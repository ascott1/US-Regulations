                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2012), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in eleven separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY

    The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of 
Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a 
``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used 
editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and 
not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, 
or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities 
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an 
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in 
this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.

[[Page vii]]

    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

[[Page 13]]

furtherance of a scientific fishery investigation or study that would 
meet the definition of fishing under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, but for 
the exemption applicable to scientific research activity conducted from 
a scientific research vessel. Scientific research activity includes, but 
is not limited to, sampling, collecting, observing, or surveying the 
fish or fishery resources within the EEZ, at sea, on board scientific 
research vessels, to increase scientific knowledge of the fishery 
resources or their environment, and to test a hypothesis as part of a

including the hypothesis or hypotheses to be tested.
    (2) The experimental design of the project, including a description 
of the methods to be used, the type and class of any vessel(s) to be 
used, and a description of sampling equipment.
    (3) The geographical area(s) in which the project is to be 
conducted.
    (4) The expected date of first appearance and final departure of the 
research vessel(s) to be employed, and deployment and removal of 
equipment, as appropriate.
    (5) The expected quantity and species of fish to be taken and their 
intended disposition, and, if significant amounts of a managed species 
or species otherwise restricted by size or sex are needed, an 
explanation of such need.
    (6) The name, address, and telephone/telex/fax number of the 
sponsoring organization and its director.
    (7) The name, address, and telephone/telex/fax number, and 
curriculum vitae of the person in charge of the project and, where 
different, the person in charge of the research project on board the 
vessel.
    (8) The identity of any vessel(s) to be used including, but not 
limited to, the vessel's name, official documentation number and IRCS, 
home port, and name, address, and telephone number of the owner and

controlled by, a foreign government agency, U.S. Government agency 
(including NOAA or institutions designated as federally funded research 
and development centers), U.S. state or territorial agency, university 
(or other educational institution accredited by a recognized national or 
international accreditation body), international treaty organization, or

Sec. 600.110  Intercouncil fisheries.

    If any fishery extends beyond the geographical area of authority of 
any one Council, the Secretary may--
    (a) Designate a single Council to prepare the FMP for such fishery 
and any amendments to such FMP, in consultation with the other Councils 
concerned; or
    (b) Require that the FMP and any amendments be prepared jointly by 
all the Councils concerned.
    (1) A jointly prepared FMP or amendment must be adopted by a 
majority of the voting members, present and voting, of each 
participating Council. Different conservation and management measures 
may be developed for specific geographic areas, but the FMP should 
address the entire geographic range of the stock(s).
    (2) In the case of joint FMP or amendment preparation, one Council 
will be designated as the ``administrative lead.'' The ``administrative 
lead'' Council is responsible for the preparation of the FMP or any 
amendments and other required documents for submission to the Secretary.
    (3) None of the Councils involved in joint preparation may withdraw 
without Secretarial approval. If Councils cannot agree on approach or 
management measures within a reasonable period of time, the Secretary 
may designate a single Council to prepare the FMP or may issue the FMP 
under Secretarial authority.

operates within the framework of the Secretary's uniform standards.
    (b) Amendments to current SOPPs must be consistent with the 
guidelines in this section, subpart C of this part,

[[Page 17]]

the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreement (the funding 
agreement between the Council and NOAA that establishes Council funding 
and mandates specific requirements regarding the use of those funds), 
the statutory requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and other 
applicable law. Upon approval of a Council's SOPP amendment by the 
Secretary, a notice of availability must be published in the Federal 
Register that includes an Internet address from which the amended SOPP 
may be read and downloaded and a mailing address to which the public may 
write to request copies.
    (c) Councils may deviate, where lawful, from the guidelines with 
appropriate supporting rationale, and Secretarial approval of each 
amendment to a SOPP would constitute approval of any such deviations for 
that particular Council.

Sec. 600.135  Meeting procedures.

    (a) Regular meetings. Public notice of a regular meeting, including 
the meeting agenda, of each Council, CCC, SSC, AP, FIAC, or other 
committees established under Magnuson-Stevens Act, Sec. 302(g), must be 
published in the Federal Register at least 14 calendar days prior to the 
meeting date. Appropriate notice by any means that will result in wide 
publicity in the major fishing ports of the region (and in other major 
fishing ports having a direct interest in the affected fishery) must be 
given. E-mail notification and website postings alone are not 
sufficient. The published agenda of a regular meeting may not be 
modified to include additional matters for Council action without public 
notice given at least 14 calendar days prior to the meeting date, unless 
such modification is necessary to address an emergency under section 
305(c) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, in which case public notice shall be 
given immediately. Drafts of all regular public meeting notices must be 
received by NMFS headquarters office at least 23 calendar days before 
the first day of the regular meeting. Councils must ensure that all 
public meetings are accessible to persons with disabilities, and that 
the public can make timely requests for language interpreters or other 
auxiliary aids at public meetings.
    (b) Emergency meetings. Drafts of emergency public notices must be 
transmitted to the NMFS headquarters office at least 5 working days 
prior to the first day of the emergency meeting. Although notices of and 
agendas for emergency meetings are not required to be published in the 
Federal Register, notices of emergency meetings must be promptly 
announced through any means that will result in wide publicity in the 
major fishing ports of the region. E-mail notification and website 
postings alone are not sufficient.
    (c) Closed meetings. After proper notification by any means that 
will result in wide publicity in the major fishing ports within the 
region and, having included in the notification the time and place of 
the meeting and the reason for closing any meeting or portion thereof to 
the public, a Council, CCC, SSC, AP, FIAC, or other committees:
    (1) Must close any meeting, or portion thereof, that concerns 
information bearing a national security classification.
    (2) May close any meeting, or portion thereof, that concerns matters 
or information pertaining to national security, employment matters, or 
briefings on litigation in which the Council is interested.
    (3) May close any meeting, or portion thereof, that concerns 
internal administrative matters other than employment. Examples of other 
internal administrative matters include candidates for appointment to 
AP, SSC, and other subsidiary bodies and public decorum or medical 
conditions of members of a Council or its subsidiary bodies. In deciding 
whether to close a portion of a meeting to discuss internal 
administrative matters, the Council, CCC, SSC, AP, FIAC, or other 
committees should consider not only the privacy interests of individuals 
whose conduct or qualifications may be discussed, but also the interest 
of the public in being informed of Council operations and actions.
    (d) Without the notice required by paragraph (c) of this section, a 
Council, CCC, SSC, AP, FIAC, or other committees may briefly close a 
portion of a meeting to discuss employment or other internal 
administrative matters. The closed portion of a meeting that is closed 
without notice may not exceed two hours.
    (e) Before closing a meeting or portion thereof, the Council, CCC, 
SSC, AP, FIAC, or other committees should consult with the NOAA Office 
of General Counsel to ensure that the matters to be discussed fall 
within the exceptions to the requirement to hold public meetings 
described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) Actions that affect the public, although based on discussions in 
closed meetings, must be taken in public. For example, appointments to 
an AP must

[[Page 20]]

be made in the public part of the meeting; however, a decision to take 
disciplinary action against a Council employee need not be announced to 
the public.
    (g) A majority of the voting members of any Council constitute a 
quorum for Council meetings, but one or more such members designated by 
the Council may hold hearings.
    (h) Decisions of any Council are by majority vote of the voting 
members present and voting (except for a vote to propose removal of a 
Council member, see 50 CFR 600.230). Voting by proxy is permitted only 
pursuant to 50 CFR 600.205 (b). An abstention does not affect the 
unanimity of a vote.
    (i) Voting members of the Council who disagree with the majority on 
any issue to be submitted to the Secretary, including principal state 
officials raising federalism issues, may submit a written statement of 
their reasons for dissent. If any Council member elects to file such a 
statement, it should be submitted to the Secretary at the same time the 
majority report is submitted.

<R05>
Sec. 600.215  Council nomination and appointment procedures.

    (a) General. (1) Each year, the 3-year terms for approximately one-
third of the appointed members of the Councils expire. The Secretary of 
Commerce (Secretary) will appoint or new members or will reappoint 
seated members to another term to fill the seats being vacated.
    (2) There are two categories of seats to which voting members are 
appointed: ``Obligatory'' and ``At-large.''
    (i) Obligatory seats are state specific. Each constituent state is 
entitled to one seat on the Council on which it is a member, except that 
the State of Alaska is entitled to five seats and the State of 
Washington is entitled to two seats on the North Pacific Fishery 
Management Council. When the term of a state's obligatory member is 
expiring or when that seat becomes vacant before the expiration of its 
term, the governor of that state must submit the names of at least three 
qualified individuals to fill that Council seat.
    (ii) The Magnuson-Stevens Act also provides for appointment, by the 
Secretary, of one treaty Indian tribal representative to the Pacific 
Fishery Management Council (Pacific Council). To fill that seat, the 
Secretary solicits written nominations from the heads of governments of 
those Indian Tribes with federally recognized fishing rights from the 
States of California, Oregon, Washington, or Idaho. The list of nominees 
must contain a total of at least three individuals who are knowledgeable 
and experienced regarding the fishery resources under the authority of 
the Pacific Council. The Secretary will appoint one tribal Indian 
representative from this list to the Pacific Council for a term of 3 
years and rotate the appointment among the tribes.
    (iii) At-large seats are regional. When the term of an at-large 
member is expiring or when that seat becomes vacant before the 
expiration of a term, the governors of all constituent states of that 
Council must each submit the names of at least three qualified 
individuals to fill the seat.
    (b) Responsibilities of State Governors. (1) Council members are 
selected by the Secretary from lists of nominees submitted by Governors 
of the constituent states, pursuant to section 302(b)(2)(C) of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act. For each applicable vacancy, a Governor must 
submit the names of at least three nominees who meet the qualification 
requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. A Governor must provide a 
statement explaining how each of his/her nominees meet the qualification 
requirements, and must also provide appropriate documentation to the 
Secretary that each nomination was made in consultation with commercial 
and recreational fishing interests of that state and that each nominee 
is knowledgeable and experienced by reason of his or her occupational or 
other experience, scientific expertise, or training in one or more of 
the following ways related to the fishery resources of the geographical 
area of concern to the Council:
    (i) Commercial fishing or the processing or marketing of fish, fish 
products, or fishing equipment;
    (ii) Fishing for pleasure, relaxation, or consumption, or experience 
in any business supporting fishing;
    (iii) Leadership in a state, regional, or national organization 
whose members participate in a fishery in the Council's area of 
authority;
    (iv) The management and conservation of natural resources, including 
related interactions with industry, government bodies, academic 
institutions, and public agencies. This includes experience serving as a 
member of a Council, Advisory Panel, Scientific and Statistical 
Committee, or Fishing Industry Advisory Committee;
    (v) Representing consumers of fish or fish products through 
participation in local, state, or national organizations, or performing 
other activities specifically related to the education or protection of 
consumers of marine resources; or
    (vi) Teaching, journalism, writing, consulting, practicing law, or 
researching matters related to fisheries, fishery management, and marine 
resource conservation.
    (2) To assist in identifying qualifications, each nominee must 
furnish to the appropriate governor's office a current resume, or 
equivalent, describing

[[Page 23]]

career history--with particular attention to experience related to the 
criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Nominees may provide such 
information in any format they wish.
    (3) A constituent State Governor must determine the state of 
residency of each of his/her nominees. A Governor may not nominate a 
non-resident of that state for appointment to a Council seat obligated 
to that state. A Governor may nominate residents of another constituent 
state of a Council for appointment to an at large seat on that Council.
    (4) If, at any time during a term, a member changes residency to 
another state that is not a constituent state of that Council, or a 
member appointed to an obligatory seat changes residency to any other 
state, the member may no longer vote and must resign from the Council. 
For purposes of this paragraph, a state resident is an individual who 
maintains his/her principal residence within that constituent state and 
who, if applicable, pays income taxes to that state and/or to another 
appropriate jurisdiction within that state.
    (5) When the terms of both an obligatory member and an at-large 
member expire concurrently, the Governor of the state holding the 
expiring obligatory seat may indicate that the nominees who were not 
selected for appointment to the obligatory seat may be considered for 
appointment to an at-large seat, provided that the resulting total 
number of nominees submitted by that governor for the expiring at-large 
seat is no fewer than three different nominees.
    (c) Nominees to the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council. (1) 
The Governors of States submitting nominees to the Secretary for 
appointment to the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council shall 
include:
    (i) At least one nominee each from the commercial, recreational, and 
charter fishing sectors, except that an individual who owns or operates 
a fish farm outside the United States shall not be considered to be a 
representative of the commercial or recreational sector; and
    (ii) At least one other individual who is knowledgeable regarding 
the conservation and management of fisheries resources in the 
jurisdiction of the Council.
    (2) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section, if the Secretary determines that the list of names 
submitted by the Governor does not meet the requirements of paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, the Secretary shall:
    (i) Publish a notice in the Federal Register asking the residents of 
that State to submit the names and pertinent biographical data of 
individuals who would meet the requirements of this section that were 
not met for appointment to the Council; and
    (ii) Add the name of any qualified individual submitted by the 
public who meets the requirements of this section that were not met to 
the list of names submitted by the Governor.
    (3) The requirements of this paragraph (c) shall expire at the end 
of fiscal year 2012, meaning through September 30, 2012.
    (d) Responsibilities of eligible tribal Indian governments. The 
tribal Indian representative on the Pacific Council will be selected by 
the Secretary from a list of no fewer than three individuals submitted 
by the tribal Indian governments with federally recognized fishing 
rights from California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho, pursuant to 
section 302(b)(5) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. To assist in assessing 
the qualifications of each nominee, each head of an appropriate tribal 
Indian government must furnish to the Assistant Administrator a current 
resume, or equivalent, describing the nominee's qualifications, with 
emphasis on knowledge and experience related to the fishery resources 
affected by recommendations of the Pacific Council. Prior service on the 
Pacific Council in a different capacity will not disqualify nominees 
proposed by tribal Indian governments.
    (e) Nomination deadlines. Nomination packages (governors' letters 
and completed nomination kits) must be forwarded by express mail under a 
single mailing to arrive at the address specified by the Assistant 
Administrator by March 15. For appointments outside the normal cycle, 
the Secretary will

[[Page 24]]

provide a deadline for receipt of nominations to the affected Council 
and state governors.
    (1) Obligatory seats. (i) The Governor of the state for which the 
term of an obligatory seat is expiring should submit the names of at 
least three qualified individuals to fill that seat by the March 15 
deadline. The Secretary will appoint to the Pacific Fishery Management 
Council a representative of an Indian tribe from a list of no fewer than 
three individuals submitted by the tribal Indian governments.
    (ii) If the Governor or tribal Indian governments fail to provide a 
nomination letter and at least three complete nomination kits by March 
15, the obligatory seat will remain vacant until all required 
information has been received and processed and the Secretary has made 
the appointment.
    (2) At-large seats. (i) If a Governor chooses to submit nominations 
for an at-large seat, he/she must submit lists that contain at least 
three qualified nominees for each vacant seat. A nomination letter and a 
nomination kit for each qualified nominee must be forwarded by express 
mail under a single mailing to arrive at the address specified by the 
Assistant Administrator by March 15.
    (ii) Nomination packages that are not substantially complete by 
March 15 may be returned to the nominating Governor. At-large members 
will be appointed from among the nominations submitted by the governors 
who complied with the nomination requirements.
    (f) Responsibilities of the Secretary. (1) The Secretary must, to 
the extent practicable, ensure a fair and balanced apportionment, on a 
rotating or other basis, of the active participants (or their 
representatives) in the commercial and recreational fisheries in the 
Council's area of authority. Further, the Secretary must take action to 
ensure, to the extent practicable, that those persons dependent for 
their livelihood upon the fisheries in the Council's area of authority 
are fairly represented as voting members on the Councils.
    (2) The Secretary will review each list submitted by a governor or 
the tribal Indian governments to ascertain whether the individuals on 
the list are qualified for the vacancy. If the Secretary determines that 
a nominee is not qualified, the Secretary will notify the appropriate 
Governor or tribal Indian government of that determination. The Governor 
or tribal Indian government shall then submit a revised list of nominees 
or resubmit the original list with an additional explanation of the 
qualifications of the nominee in question. The Secretary reserves the 
right to determine whether nominees are qualified.
    (3) The Secretary will select the appointees from lists of qualified 
nominees provided by the Governors of the constituent Council states or 
of the tribal Indian governments that are eligible to nominate 
candidates for that vacancy.
    (i) For Governor-nominated seats, the Secretary will select an 
appointee for an obligatory seat from the list of qualified nominees 
submitted by the governor of the state. In filling expiring at-large 
seats, the Secretary will select an appointee(s) for an at-large seat(s) 
from the list of all qualified candidates submitted. The Secretary will 
consider only complete slates of nominees submitted by the governors of 
the Council's constituent states. When an appointed member vacates his/
her seat prior to the expiration of his/her term, the Secretary will 
fill the vacancy for the remainder of the term by selecting from 
complete nomination letters and kits that are timely and contain the 
required number of candidates.
    (ii) For the tribal Indian seat, the Secretary will solicit 
nominations of individuals for the list referred to in paragraph (c) of 
this section only from those Indian tribes with federally recognized 
fishing rights from California, Oregon, Washington, or Idaho. The 
Secretary will consult with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department of 
the Interior, to determine which Indian tribes may submit nominations. 
Any vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of any term shall be 
filled in the same manner as described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of 
this section, except that the Secretary may use the list referred to in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section from

[[Page 25]]

which the vacating member was chosen. The Secretary shall rotate the 
appointment among the tribes, taking into consideration:
    (A) The qualifications of the individuals on the list referred to in 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (B) The various rights of the Indian tribes involved, and judicial 
cases that set out the manner in which these rights are to be exercised.
    (C) The geographic area in which the tribe of the representative is 
located.
    (D) The limitation that no tribal Indian representative shall serve 
more than three consecutive terms in the Indian tribal seat.

by the Magnuson-Stevens Act on account of any political activity or lack 
of such activity in support of or in opposition to any candidate or any

    (4) No Council member or employee may pay, offer, promise, solicit,

requirements of 31 U.S.C. 1352 and Department of Commerce implementing 
regulations published at 15 CFR part 28, ``New Restrictions on 
Lobbying.'' These provisions generally prohibit the use of Federal funds 
for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the Federal 
Government in connection with the award. Because the Councils receive in 
excess of $100,000 in Federal funding, the regulations mandate that the 
Councils must complete Form SF-LLL, ``Disclosure of Lobbying 
Activities,'' regarding the use of non Federal funds for lobbying. The 
Form SF-LLL shall be submitted within 30 days following the end of the 
calendar quarter in which there occurs any event that requires 
disclosure or that materially affects the accuracy of the information 
contained in any disclosure form previously filed. The recipient must 
submit the Forms SF-LLL, including those received from subrecipients, 
contractors, and subcontractors, to the Grants Officer.

Federal Cost Principles Applicable to Regional Fishery Management 
Council Grants and Cooperative Agreements summarized as follows:
    (1) Title 2 CFR part 230 - Cost Principles for Nonprofit 
Organizations (OMB CircularA-122) is applicable to the Federal 
assistance awards issued to the Councils.
    (2) The purpose of the cost principles at 2 CFR part 230 is to 
define what costs can be paid on Federal awards issued to non-profit 
organizations. The regulation establishes both general principles and 
detailed items of costs.
    (3) Under 2 CFR part 230, costs for certain lobbying activities are 
unallowable as charges to Federal awards. These activities would include 
any attempts to influence:
    (i) The introduction of Federal or state legislation;
    (ii) The enactment or modification of any pending legislation by 
preparing, distributing, or using publicity or propaganda, or by urging 
members of the general public to contribute to or to participate in any 
demonstration, march, rally, fundraising drive, lobbying campaign, or 
letter writing or telephone campaign.
    (4) Generally, costs associated with providing a technical and 
factual presentation directly related to the performance of a grant, 
through hearing testimony, statements, or letters to

[[Page 27]]

Congress or a state legislature are allowable if made in response to a 
documented request.
    (5) Costs associated with lobbying to influence state legislation in 
order to reduce the cost or to avoid material impairment of the 
organization's authority to perform the grant are also allowable.

officer, director, trustee, partner, or employee; and must update his or 
her form annually and file that update with the Executive Director of 
the appropriate Council by February 1 of each year, regardless of 
whether any information has changed on that form.
    (3) The Executive Director must, in a timely manner, provide copies 
of and updates to the Financial Interest Forms of appointed Council 
members to the NMFS Regional Administrator, the Regional Attorney who 
advises the Council, the Department of Commerce Assistant General 
Counsel for Administration, and the NMFS Office of Sustainable 
Fisheries. These completed Financial Interest Forms shall be kept on 
file in the office of the NMFS Regional Administrator and at the Council 
offices, and shall be made available for public inspection at such 
offices during normal office hours. In addition, the forms shall be made 
available at each Council meeting or hearing and shall be posted for 
download from the Internet on the Council's website.
    (4) Councils must retain the Financial Interest Form for a Council 
member for at least 5 years after the expiration of that individual's 
last term.
    (5) An individual being considered for appointment to an SSC must 
file the Financial Interest Form with the Regional Administrator for the 
geographic area concerned within 45 days prior to appointment. A member 
of the SSC must file an update of his or her statement with the Regional 
Administrator for the geographic area concerned within 30 days of the 
time any such financial interest is acquired or substantially changed by 
the SSC member or the SSC member's spouse, minor child, partner, or any 
organization (other than the Council) in which that individual is 
serving as an officer, director, trustee, partner, or employee; and must 
update his or her form annually and file that update with the Regional 
Administrator by February 1 of each year.
    (6) An individual who serves as an SSC member to more than one 
Council shall file Financial Interest Forms with each Regional 
Administrator for the geographic areas concerned.

[[Page 29]]

    (7) The Regional Administrator shall maintain on file the Financial 
Interest Forms of all SSC members for at least five years after the 
expiration of that individual's term on the SSC. Such Forms are not 
subject to sections 302(j)(5)(B) and (C) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (c) Restrictions on voting. (1) No affected individual may vote on 
any Council decision that would have a significant and predictable 
effect on a financial interest disclosed in his/her report filed under 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) As used in this section, a Council decision will be considered 
to have a ``significant and predictable effect on a financial interest'' 
if there is a close causal link between the decision and an expected and 
substantially disproportionate benefit to the financial interest in 
harvesting, processing, lobbying, advocacy, or marketing of any affected 
individual or the affected individual's spouse, minor child, partner, or 
any organization (other than the Council) in which that individual is 
serving as an officer, director, trustee, partner, or employee, relative 
to the financial interests of other participants in the same gear type 
or sector of the fishery. The relative financial interests of the 
affected individual and other participants will be determined with 
reference to the most recent fishing year for which information is 
available. However, for fisheries in which IFQs are assigned, the 
percentage of IFQs assigned to the affected individual will be the 
determining factor.
    (3) ``Expected and substantially disproportionate benefit'' means a 
quantifiable positive or negative impact with regard to a matter likely 
to affect a fishery or sector of the fishery in which the affected 
individual has a significant interest, as indicated by:
    (i) A greater than 10-percent interest in the total harvest of the 
fishery or sector of the fishery in question;
    (ii) A greater than 10-percent interest in the marketing or 
processing of the total harvest of the fishery or sector of the fishery 
in question; or
    (iii) Full or partial ownership of more than 10 percent of the 
vessels using the same gear type within the fishery or sector of the 
fishery in question.
    (4) A member of an SSC is not subject to the restrictions on voting 
under this section.
    (d) Voluntary recusal. An affected individual who believes that a 
Council decision would have a significant and predictable effect on that 
individual's financial interest disclosed under paragraph (b) of this 
section may, at any time before a vote is taken, announce to the Council 
an intent not to vote on the decision and identify the financial 
interest that would be affected.
    (e) Participation in deliberations. Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of 
this section, an affected individual who is recused from voting under 
this section may participate in Council and committee deliberations 
relating to the decision, after notifying the Council of the voting 
recusal and identifying the financial interest that would be affected.
    (f) Requests for determination. (1) At the request of an affected 
individual, the designated official shall determine for the record 
whether a Council decision would have a significant and predictable 
effect on that individual's financial interest. The determination will 
be based upon a review of the information contained in the individual's 
financial disclosure form and any other reliable and probative 
information provided in writing. All information considered will be made 
part of the public record for the decision. The affected individual may 
request a determination by notifying the designated official--
    (i) Within a reasonable time before the Council meeting at which the 
Council decision will be made; or
    (ii) During a Council meeting before a Council vote on the decision.
    (2) The designated official may initiate a determination on the 
basis of--
    (i) His or her knowledge of the fishery and the financial interests 
disclosed by an affected individual; or
    (ii) Written and signed information received within a reasonable 
time before a Council meeting or, if the issue could not have been 
anticipated before the meeting, during a Council meeting before a 
Council vote on the decision.
    (3) At the beginning of each Council meeting, or during a Council 
meeting

[[Page 30]]

at any time reliable and probative information is received, the 
designated official shall announce the receipt of information relevant 
to a determination concerning recusal, the nature of that information, 
and the identity of the submitter of such information.
    (4) If the designated official determines that the affected 
individual may not vote, the individual may state for the record how he 
or she would have voted. A Council Chair may not allow such an 
individual to cast a vote.
    (5) A reversal of a determination under paragraph (g) of this 
section may not be treated as cause for invalidation or reconsideration 
by the Secretary of a Council's decision.
    (g) Review of determinations. (1) Any Council member may file a 
written request to the NOAA General Counsel for review of the designated 
official's determination. A request for review must be received within 
10 days of the determination.
    (2) A request must include a full statement in support of the 
review, including a concise statement as to why the Council's decision 
did or did not have a significantly disproportionate benefit to the 
financial interest of the affected individual relative to the financial 
interests of other participants in the same gear type or sector of the 
fishery, and why the designated official's determination should be 
reversed.
    (3) If the request for review is from a Council member other than 
the affected individual whose vote is at issue, the requester must 
provide a copy of the request to the affected individual at the same 
time it is submitted to the NOAA General Counsel. The affected 
individual may submit a response to the NOAA General Counsel within 10 
days from the date of his/her receipt of the request for review.
    (4) The NOAA General Counsel must complete the review and issue a 
decision within 30 days from the date of receipt of the request for 
review. The NOAA General Counsel will limit the review to the record 
before the designated official at the time of the determination, the 
request, and any response.
    (h) The provisions of 18 U.S.C. 208 regarding conflicts of interest 
do not apply to an affected individual who is a voting member of a 
Council appointed by the Secretary, as described under section 
302(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and who is in compliance 
with the requirements of this section for filing a financial disclosure 
report. The provisions of 18 U.S.C. 208 do not apply to a member of an 
SSC, unless that individual is an officer or employee of the United 
States or is otherwise covered by the requirements of 18 U.S.C. 208.
    (i) It is unlawful for an affected individual to knowingly and 
willfully fail to disclose, or to falsely disclose, any financial 
interest as required by this section, or to knowingly vote on a Council 
decision in violation of this section. In addition to the penalties 
applicable under Sec. 600.735, a violation of this provision may result 
in removal of the affected individual from Council or SSC membership.

Sec. 600.240  Security assurances.

    (a) DOC Office of Security will issue security assurances to Council 
members following completion of favorable background investigations. A 
Council member's appointment is conditional until such time as the 
background investigation has been favorably adjudicated. The Secretary 
will revoke the member's appointment if that member receives an 
unfavorable background investigation. In instances in which Council 
members may need to discuss, at closed meetings, materials classified 
for national security purposes, the agency or individual (e.g., 
Department of State, U.S. Coast Guard) providing such classified 
information will be responsible for ensuring that Council members and 
other attendees have the appropriate security clearances.
    (b) Each nominee to a Council is required to complete a 
Certification of Status form (``form''). All nominees must certify, 
pursuant to the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, whether they 
serve as an agent of a foreign principal. Each nominee must certify, 
date, sign, and return the form with his or her completed nomination 
kit. Nominees will not be considered for appointment to a Council if 
they have

[[Page 31]]

not filed this form. Any nominee who currently is an agent of a foreign 
principal will not be eligible for appointment to a Council, and 
therefore should not be nominated by a Governor for appointment.

Sec. 600.245  Council member compensation.

    (a) All voting Council members whose eligibility for compensation 
has been established in accordance with NOAA guidelines will be paid 
through the cooperative agreement as a direct line item on a contractual 
basis without deductions being made for Social Security or Federal and 
state income taxes. A report of compensation will be furnished each year 
by the member's Council to the proper Regional Program Officer, as 
required by the Internal Revenue Service. Such compensation may be paid 
on a full day's basis, whether in excess of 8 hours a day or less than 8 
hours a day. The time is compensable where the individual member is 
required to expend a significant private effort that substantially 
disrupts the daily routine to the extent that a work day is lost to the 
member. ``Homework'' time in preparation for formal Council meetings is 
not compensable.
    (b) Non-government Council members receive compensation for:
    (1) Days spent in actual attendance at a meeting of the Council or 
jointly with another Council.
    (2) Travel on the day preceding or following a scheduled meeting 
that precluded the member from conducting his normal business on the day 
in question.
    (3) Meetings of standing committees of the Council if approved in 
advance by the Chair.
    (4) Individual member meeting with scientific and technical 
advisors, when approved in advance by the Chair and a substantial 
portion of any day is spent at the meeting.
    (5) Conducting or attending hearings, when authorized in advance by 
the Chair.
    (6) Other meetings involving Council business when approved in 
advance by the Chair.
    (c) The Executive Director of each Council must submit to the 
appropriate Regional Office annually a report, approved by the Council 
Chair, of Council member compensation authorized. This report shall 
identify, for each member, amount paid, dates, and location and purpose 
of meetings attended.

Sec. 600.250  Council member training.

    (a) The Secretary shall provide a training course covering a variety 
of topics relevant to matters before the Councils and shall make the 
training course available to all Council members and staff and staff 
from NMFS regional offices and science centers. To the extent resources 
allow, the Secretary will make the training available to Council 
committee and advisory panel members.
    (b) Council members appointed after January 12, 2007, shall, within 
one year of appointment, complete the training course developed by the 
Secretary. Any Council member who completed such a training course 
within 24 months of January 12, 2007, is considered to have met the 
training requirement of this section.

                      Subpart D_National Standards


<R05>
Sec. 600.305  General.

    (a) Purpose. (1) This subpart establishes guidelines, based on the 
national standards, to assist in the development and review of FMPs, 
amendments, and regulations prepared by the Councils and the Secretary.
    (2) In developing FMPs, the Councils have the initial authority to 
ascertain factual circumstances, to establish management objectives, and 
to propose management measures that will achieve the objectives. The 
Secretary will determine whether the proposed management objectives and 
measures are consistent with the national standards, other provisions of 
the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and other applicable law. The Secretary has an 
obligation under section 301(b) of the Magnuson-Stevens

[[Page 32]]

Act to inform the Councils of the Secretary's interpretation of the 
national standards so that they will have an understanding of the basis 
on which FMPs will be reviewed.
    (3) The national standards are statutory principles that must be 
followed in any FMP. The guidelines summarize Secretarial 
interpretations that have been, and will be, applied under these 
principles. The guidelines are intended as aids to decisionmaking; FMPs 
formulated according to the guidelines will have a better chance for 
expeditious Secretarial review, approval, and implementation. FMPs that 
are in substantial compliance with the guidelines, the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act, and other applicable law must be approved.
    (b) Fishery management objectives. (1) Each FMP, whether prepared by 
a Council or by the Secretary, should identify what the FMP is designed 
to accomplish (i.e., the management objectives to be attained in 
regulating the fishery under consideration). In establishing objectives, 
Councils balance biological constraints with human needs, reconcile 
present and future costs and benefits, and integrate the diversity of 
public and private interests. If objectives are in conflict, priorities 
should be established among them.
    (2) How objectives are defined is important to the management 
process. Objectives should address the problems of a particular fishery. 
The objectives should be clearly stated, practicably attainable, framed 
in terms of definable events and measurable benefits, and based upon a 
comprehensive rather than a fragmentary approach to the problems 
addressed. An FMP should make a clear distinction between objectives and 
the management measures chosen to achieve them. The objectives of each 
FMP provide the context within which the Secretary will judge the 
consistency of an FMP's conservation and management measures with the 
national standards.
    (c) Word usage. The word usage refers to all regulations in this 
subpart.
    (1) Must is used, instead of ``shall'', to denote an obligation to 
act; it is used primarily when referring to requirements of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act, the logical extension thereof, or of other 
applicable law.
    (2) Shall is used only when quoting statutory language directly, to 
avoid confusion with the future tense.
    (3) Should is used to indicate that an action or consideration is 
strongly recommended to fulfill the Secretary's interpretation of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act, and is a factor reviewers will look for in 
evaluating a SOPP or FMP.
    (4) May is used in a permissive sense.
    (5) May not is proscriptive; it has the same force as ``must not.''
    (6) Will is used descriptively, as distinguished from denoting an 
obligation to act or the future tense.
    (7) Could is used when giving examples, in a hypothetical, 
permissive sense.
    (8) Can is used to mean ``is able to,'' as distinguished from 
``may.''
    (9) Examples are given by way of illustration and further 
explanation. They are not inclusive lists; they do not limit options.
    (10) Analysis, as a paragraph heading, signals more detailed 
guidance as to the type of discussion and examination an FMP should 
contain to demonstrate compliance with the standard in question.
    (11) Council includes the Secretary, as applicable, when preparing 
FMPs or amendments under section 304(c) and (g) of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act.
    (12) Stock or stock complex is used as a synonym for ``fishery'' in 
the sense of the Magnuson-Stevens Act's first definition of the term; 
that is, as ``one or more stocks of fish that can be treated as a unit 
for purposes of conservation and management and that are identified on 
the basis of geographic, scientific, technical, recreational, or 
economic characteristics,'' as distinguished from the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act's second definition of fishery as ``any fishing for such stocks.''

<R05>
Sec. 600.310  National Standard 1--Optimum Yield.

    (a) Standard 1. Conservation and management measures shall prevent 
overfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield 
(OY)

[[Page 33]]

from each fishery for the U.S. fishing industry.
    (b) General. (1) The guidelines set forth in this section describe 
fishery management approaches to meet the objectives of National 
Standard 1 (NS1), and include guidance on:
    (i) Specifying maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and OY;
    (ii) Specifying status determination criteria (SDC) so that 
overfishing and overfished determinations can be made for stocks and 
stock complexes that are part of a fishery;
    (iii) Preventing overfishing and achieving OY, incorporation of 
scientific and management uncertainty in control rules, and adaptive 
management using annual catch limits (ACL) and measures to ensure 
accountability (AM); and
    (iv) Rebuilding stocks and stock complexes.
    (2) Overview of Magnuson-Stevens Act concepts and provisions related 
to NS1--(i) MSY. The Magnuson-Stevens Act establishes MSY as the basis 
for fishery management and requires that: The fishing mortality rate 
does not jeopardize the capacity of a stock or stock complex to produce 
MSY; the abundance of an overfished stock or stock complex be rebuilt to 
a level that is capable of producing MSY; and OY not exceed MSY.
    (ii) OY. The determination of OY is a decisional mechanism for 
resolving the Magnuson-Stevens Act's conservation and management 
objectives, achieving a fishery management plan's (FMP) objectives, and 
balancing the various interests that comprise the greatest overall 
benefits to the Nation. OY is based on MSY as reduced under paragraphs 
(e)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this section. The most important limitation on 
the specification of OY is that the choice of OY and the conservation 
and management measures proposed to achieve it must prevent overfishing.
    (iii) ACLs and AMs. Any FMP which is prepared by any Council shall 
establish a mechanism for specifying ACLs in the FMP (including a 
multiyear plan), implementing regulations, or annual specifications, at 
a level such that overfishing does not occur in the fishery, including 
measures to ensure accountability (Magnuson-Stevens Act section 
303(a)(15)). Subject to certain exceptions and circumstances described 
in paragraph (h) of this section, this requirement takes effect in 
fishing year 2010, for fisheries determined subject to overfishing, and 
in fishing year 2011, for all other fisheries (Magnuson-Stevens Act 
section 303 note). ``Council'' includes the Regional Fishery Management 
Councils and the Secretary of Commerce, as appropriate (see Sec. 
600.305(c)(11)).
    (iv) Reference points. SDC, MSY, acceptable biological catch (ABC), 
and ACL, which are described further in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this 
section, are collectively referred to as ``reference points.''
    (v) Scientific advice. The Magnuson-Stevens Act has requirements 
regarding scientific and statistical committees (SSC) of the Regional 
Fishery Management Councils, including but not limited to, the following 
provisions:
    (A) Each Regional Fishery Management Council shall establish an SSC 
as described in section 302(g)(1)(A) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (B) Each SSC shall provide its Regional Fishery Management Council 
recommendations for ABC as well as other scientific advice, as described 
in Magnuson-Stevens Act section 302(g)(1)(B).
    (C) The Secretary and each Regional Fishery Management Council may 
establish a peer review process for that Council for scientific 
information used to advise the Council about the conservation and 
management of a fishery (see Magnuson-Stevens Act section 302(g)(1)(E)). 
If a peer review process is established, it should investigate the 
technical merits of stock assessments and other scientific information 
used by the SSC or agency or international scientists, as appropriate. 
For Regional Fishery Management Councils, the peer review process is not 
a substitute for the SSC and should work in conjunction with the SSC. 
For the Secretary, which does not have an SSC, the peer review process 
should provide the scientific information necessary.
    (D) Each Council shall develop ACLs for each of its managed 
fisheries that

[[Page 34]]

may not exceed the ``fishing level recommendations'' of its SSC or peer 
review process (Magnuson-Stevens Act section 302(h)(6)). The SSC 
recommendation that is the most relevant to ACLs is ABC, as both ACL and 
ABC are levels of annual catch.
    (3) Approach for setting limits and accountability measures, 
including targets, for consistency with NS1. In general, when specifying 
limits and accountability measures intended to avoid overfishing and 
achieve sustainable fisheries, Councils must take an approach that 
considers uncertainty in scientific information and management control 
of the fishery. These guidelines describe how to address uncertainty 
such that there is a low risk that limits are exceeded as described in 
paragraphs (f)(4) and (f)(6) of this section.
    (c) Summary of items to include in FMPs related to NS1. This section 
provides a summary of items that Councils must include in their FMPs and 
FMP amendments in order to address ACL, AM, and other aspects of the NS1 
guidelines. As described in further detail in paragraph (d) of this 
section, Councils may review their FMPs to decide if all stocks are ``in 
the fishery'' or whether some fit the category of ``ecosystem component 
species.'' Councils must also describe fisheries data for the stocks, 
stock complexes, and ecosystem component species in their FMPs, or 
associated public documents such as Stock Assessment and Fishery 
Evaluation (SAFE) Reports. For all stocks and stock complexes that are 
``in the fishery'' (see paragraph (d)(2) of this section), the Councils 
must evaluate and describe the following items in their FMPs and amend 
the FMPs, if necessary, to align their management objectives to end or 
prevent overfishing:
    (1) MSY and SDC (see paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section).
    (2) OY at the stock, stock complex, or fishery level and provide the 
OY specification analysis (see paragraph (e)(3) of this section).
    (3) ABC control rule (see paragraph (f)(4) of this section).
    (4) Mechanisms for specifying ACLs and possible sector-specific ACLs 
in relationship to the ABC (see paragraphs (f)(5) and (h) of this 
section).
    (5) AMs (see paragraphs (g) and (h)(1) of this section).
    (6) Stocks and stock complexes that have statutory exceptions from 
ACLs (see paragraph (h)(2) of this section) or which fall under limited 
circumstances which require different approaches to meet the ACL 
requirements (see paragraph (h)(3) of this section).
    (d) Classifying stocks in an FMP--(1) Introduction. Magnuson-Stevens 
Act section 303(a)(2) requires that an FMP contain, among other things, 
a description of the species of fish involved in the fishery. The 
relevant Council determines which specific target stocks and/or non-
target stocks to include in a fishery. This section provides that a 
Council may, but is not required to, use an ``ecosystem component (EC)'' 
species classification. As a default, all stocks in an FMP are 
considered to be ``in the fishery,'' unless they are identified as EC 
species (see Sec. 600.310(d)(5)) through an FMP amendment process.
    (2) Stocks in a fishery. Stocks in a fishery may be grouped into 
stock complexes, as appropriate. Requirements for reference points and 
management measures for these stocks are described throughout these 
guidelines.
    (3) ``Target stocks'' are stocks that fishers seek to catch for sale 
or personal use, including ``economic discards'' as defined under 
Magnuson-Stevens Act section 3(9).
    (4) ``Non-target species'' and ``non-target stocks'' are fish caught 
incidentally during the pursuit of target stocks in a fishery, including 
``regulatory discards'' as defined under Magnuson-Stevens Act section 
3(38). They may or may not be retained for sale or personal use. Non-
target species may be included in a fishery and, if so, they should be 
identified at the stock level. Some non-target species may be identified 
in an FMP as ecosystem component (EC) species or stocks.
    (5) Ecosystem component (EC) species. (i) To be considered for 
possible classification as an EC species, the species should:
    (A) Be a non-target species or non-target stock;

[[Page 35]]

    (B) Not be determined to be subject to overfishing, approaching 
overfished, or overfished;
    (C) Not be likely to become subject to overfishing or overfished, 
according to the best available information, in the absence of 
conservation and management measures; and
    (D) Not generally be retained for sale or personal use.
    (ii) Occasional retention of the species would not, in and of 
itself, preclude consideration of the species under the EC 
classification. In addition to the general factors noted in paragraphs 
(d)(5)(i)(A)-(D) of this section, it is important to consider whether 
use of the EC species classification in a given instance is consistent 
with MSA conservation and management requirements.
    (iii) EC species may be identified at the species or stock level, 
and may be grouped into complexes. EC species may, but are not required 
to, be included in an FMP or FMP amendment for any of the following 
reasons: For data collection purposes; for ecosystem considerations 
related to specification of OY for the associated fishery; as 
considerations in the development of conservation and management 
measures for the associated fishery; and/or to address other ecosystem 
issues. While EC species are not considered to be ``in the fishery,'' a 
Council should consider measures for the fishery to minimize bycatch and 
bycatch mortality of EC species consistent with National Standard 9, and 
to protect their associated role in the ecosystem. EC species do not 
require specification of reference points but should be monitored to the 
extent that any new pertinent scientific information becomes available 
(e.g., catch trends, vulnerability, etc.) to determine changes in their 
status or their vulnerability to the fishery. If necessary, they should 
be reclassified as ``in the fishery.''
    (6) Reclassification. A Council should monitor the catch resulting 
from a fishery on a regular basis to determine if the stocks and species 
are appropriately classified in the FMP. If the criteria previously used 
to classify a stock or species is no longer valid, the Council should 
reclassify it through an FMP amendment, which documents rationale for 
the decision.
    (7) Stocks or species identified in more than one FMP. If a stock is 
identified in more than one fishery, Councils should choose which FMP 
will be the primary FMP in which management objectives, SDC, the stock's 
overall ACL and other reference points for the stock are established. 
Conservation and management measures in other FMPs in which the stock is 
identified as part of a fishery should be consistent with the primary 
FMP's management objectives for the stock.
    (8) Stock complex. ``Stock complex'' means a group of stocks that 
are sufficiently similar in geographic distribution, life history, and 
vulnerabilities to the fishery such that the impact of management 
actions on the stocks is similar. At the time a stock complex is 
established, the FMP should provide a full and explicit description of 
the proportional composition of each stock in the stock complex, to the 
extent possible. Stocks may be grouped into complexes for various 
reasons, including where stocks in a multispecies fishery cannot be 
targeted independent of one another and MSY can not be defined on a 
stock-by-stock basis (see paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section); where 
there is insufficient data to measure their status relative to SDC; or 
when it is not feasible for fishermen to distinguish individual stocks 
among their catch. The vulnerability of stocks to the fishery should be 
evaluated when determining if a particular stock complex should be 
established or reorganized, or if a particular stock should be included 
in a complex. Stock complexes may be comprised of: one or more indicator 
stocks, each of which has SDC and ACLs, and several other stocks; 
several stocks without an indicator stock, with SDC and an ACL for the 
complex as a whole; or one of more indicator stocks, each of which has 
SDC and management objectives, with an ACL for the complex as a whole 
(this situation might be applicable to some salmon species).
    (9) Indicator stocks. An indicator stock is a stock with measurable 
SDC that can be used to help manage and evaluate more poorly known 
stocks

[[Page 36]]

that are in a stock complex. If an indicator stock is used to evaluate 
the status of a complex, it should be representative of the typical 
status of each stock within the complex, due to similarity in 
vulnerability. If the stocks within a stock complex have a wide range of 
vulnerability, they should be reorganized into different stock complexes 
that have similar vulnerabilities; otherwise the indicator stock should 
be chosen to represent the more vulnerable stocks within the complex. In 
instances where an indicator stock is less vulnerable than other members 
of the complex, management measures need to be more conservative so that 
the more vulnerable members of the complex are not at risk from the 
fishery. More than one indicator stock can be selected to provide more 
information about the status of the complex. When indicator stock(s) are 
used, periodic re-evaluation of available quantitative or qualitative 
information (e.g., catch trends, changes in vulnerability, fish health 
indices, etc.) is needed to determine whether a stock is subject to 
overfishing, or is approaching (or in) an overfished condition.
    (10) Vulnerability. A stock's vulnerability is a combination of its 
productivity, which depends upon its life history characteristics, and 
its susceptibility to the fishery. Productivity refers to the capacity 
of the stock to produce MSY and to recover if the population is 
depleted, and susceptibility is the potential for the stock to be 
impacted by the fishery, which includes direct captures, as well as 
indirect impacts to the fishery (e.g., loss of habitat quality). 
Councils in consultation with their SSC, should analyze the 
vulnerability of stocks in stock complexes where possible.
    (e) Features of MSY, SDC, and OY--(1) MSY. Each FMP must include an 
estimate of MSY for the stocks and stock complexes in the fishery, as 
described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section).
    (i) Definitions. (A) MSY is the largest long-term average catch or 
yield that can be taken from a stock or stock complex under prevailing 
ecological, environmental conditions and fishery technological 
characteristics (e.g., gear selectivity), and the distribution of catch 
among fleets.
    (B) MSY fishing mortality rate (Fmsy) is the fishing mortality rate 
that, if applied over the long term, would result in MSY.
    (C) MSY stock size (Bmsy) means the long-term average size of the 
stock or stock complex, measured in terms of spawning biomass or other 
appropriate measure of the stock's reproductive potential that would be 
achieved by fishing at F<INF>msy</INF>.
    (ii) MSY for stocks. MSY should be estimated for each stock based on 
the best scientific information available (see Sec. 600.315).
    (iii) MSY for stock complexes. MSY should be estimated on a stock-
by-stock basis whenever possible. However, where MSY cannot be estimated 
for each stock in a stock complex, then MSY may be estimated for one or 
more indicator stocks for the complex or for the complex as a whole. 
When indicator stocks are used, the stock complex's MSY could be listed 
as ``unknown,'' while noting that the complex is managed on the basis of 
one or more indicator stocks that do have known stock-specific MSYs, or 
suitable proxies, as described in paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section. 
When indicator stocks are not used, MSY, or a suitable proxy, should be 
calculated for the stock complex as a whole.
    (iv) Specifying MSY. Because MSY is a long-term average, it need not 
be estimated annually, but it must be based on the best scientific 
information available (see Sec. 600.315), and should be re-estimated as 
required by changes in long-term environmental or ecological conditions, 
fishery technological characteristics, or new scientific information. 
When data are insufficient to estimate MSY directly, Councils should 
adopt other measures of reproductive potential, based on the best 
scientific information available, that can serve as reasonable proxies 
for MSY, F<INF>msy</INF>, and B<INF>msy</INF>, to the extent possible. 
The MSY for a stock is influenced by its interactions with other stocks 
in its ecosystem and these interactions may shift as multiple stocks in 
an ecosystem are fished. These ecological conditions should be taken 
into account, to the extent possible, when

[[Page 37]]

specifying MSY. Ecological conditions not directly accounted for in the 
specification of MSY can be among the ecological factors considered when 
setting OY below MSY. As MSY values are estimates or are based on 
proxies, they will have some level of uncertainty associated with them. 
The degree of uncertainty in the estimates should be identified, when 
possible, through the stock assessment process and peer review (see 
Sec. 600.335), and should be taken into account when specifying the ABC 
Control rule. Where this uncertainty cannot be directly calculated, such 
as when proxies are used, then a proxy for the uncertainty itself should 
be established based on the best scientific information, including 
comparison to other stocks.
    (2) Status determination criteria--(i) Definitions. (A) Status 
determination criteria (SDC) mean the quantifiable factors, MFMT, OFL, 
and MSST, or their proxies, that are used to determine if overfishing 
has occurred, or if the stock or stock complex is overfished. Magnuson-
Stevens Act (section 3(34)) defines both ``overfishing'' and 
``overfished'' to mean a rate or level of fishing mortality that 
jeopardizes the capacity of a fishery to produce the MSY on a continuing 
basis. To avoid confusion, this section clarifies that ``overfished'' 
relates to biomass of a stock or stock complex, and ``overfishing'' 
pertains to a rate or level of removal of fish from a stock or stock 
complex.
    (B) Overfishing (to overfish) occurs whenever a stock or stock 
complex is subjected to a level of fishing mortality or annual total 
catch that jeopardizes the capacity of a stock or stock complex to 
produce MSY on a continuing basis.
    (C) Maximum fishing mortality threshold (MFMT) means the level of 
fishing mortality (F), on an annual basis, above which overfishing is 
occurring. The MFMT or reasonable proxy may be expressed either as a 
single number (a fishing mortality rate or F value), or as a function of 
spawning biomass or other measure of reproductive potential.
    (D) Overfishing limit (OFL) means the annual amount of catch that 
corresponds to the estimate of MFMT applied to a stock or stock 
complex's abundance and is expressed in terms of numbers or weight of 
fish. The OFL is an estimate of the catch level above which overfishing 
is occurring.
    (E) Overfished. A stock or stock complex is considered 
``overfished'' when its biomass has declined below a level that 
jeopardizes the capacity of the stock or stock complex to produce MSY on 
a continuing basis.
    (F) Minimum stock size threshold (MSST) means the level of biomass 
below which the stock or stock complex is considered to be overfished.
    (G) Approaching an overfished condition. A stock or stock complex is 
approaching an overfished condition when it is projected that there is 
more than a 50 percent chance that the biomass of the stock or stock 
complex will decline below the MSST within two years.
    (ii) Specification of SDC and overfishing and overfished 
determinations. SDC must be expressed in a way that enables the Council 
to monitor each stock or stock complex in the FMP, and determine 
annually, if possible, whether overfishing is occurring and whether the 
stock or stock complex is overfished. In specifying SDC, a Council must 
provide an analysis of how the SDC were chosen and how they relate to 
reproductive potential. Each FMP must specify, to the extent possible, 
objective and measurable SDC as follows (see paragraphs (e)(2)(ii)(A) 
and (B) of this section):
    (A) SDC to determine overfishing status. Each FMP must describe 
which of the following two methods will be used for each stock or stock 
complex to determine an overfishing status.
    (1) Fishing mortality rate exceeds MFMT. Exceeding the MFMT for a 
period of 1 year or more constitutes overfishing. The MFMT or reasonable 
proxy may be expressed either as a single number (a fishing mortality 
rate or F value), or as a function of spawning biomass or other measure 
of reproductive potential.
    (2) Catch exceeds the OFL. Should the annual catch exceed the annual 
OFL for 1 year or more, the stock or stock complex is considered subject 
to overfishing.
    (B) SDC to determine overfished status. The MSST or reasonable proxy 
must be

[[Page 38]]

expressed in terms of spawning biomass or other measure of reproductive 
potential. To the extent possible, the MSST should equal whichever of 
the following is greater: One-half the MSY stock size, or the minimum 
stock size at which rebuilding to the MSY level would be expected to 
occur within 10 years, if the stock or stock complex were exploited at 
the MFMT specified under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A)(1) of this section. 
Should the estimated size of the stock or stock complex in a given year 
fall below this threshold, the stock or stock complex is considered 
overfished.
    (iii) Relationship of SDC to environmental change. Some short-term 
environmental changes can alter the size of a stock or stock complex 
without affecting its long-term reproductive potential. Long-term 
environmental changes affect both the short-term size of the stock or 
stock complex and the long-term reproductive potential of the stock or 
stock complex.
    (A) If environmental changes cause a stock or stock complex to fall 
below its MSST without affecting its long-term reproductive potential, 
fishing mortality must be constrained sufficiently to allow rebuilding 
within an acceptable time frame (also see paragraph (j)(3)(ii) of this 
section). SDC should not be respecified.
    (B) If environmental changes affect the long-term reproductive 
potential of the stock or stock complex, one or more components of the 
SDC must be respecified. Once SDC have been respecified, fishing 
mortality may or may not have to be reduced, depending on the status of 
the stock or stock complex with respect to the new criteria.
    (C) If manmade environmental changes are partially responsible for a 
stock or stock complex being in an overfished condition, in addition to 
controlling fishing mortality, Councils should recommend restoration of 
habitat and other ameliorative programs, to the extent possible (see 
also the guidelines issued pursuant to section 305(b) of the Magnuson-
Stevens Act for Council actions concerning essential fish habitat).
    (iv) Secretarial approval of SDC. Secretarial approval or 
disapproval of proposed SDC will be based on consideration of whether 
the proposal:
    (A) Has sufficient scientific merit;
    (B) Contains the elements described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this 
section;
    (C) Provides a basis for objective measurement of the status of the 
stock or stock complex against the criteria; and
    (D) Is operationally feasible.
    (3) Optimum yield--(i) Definitions--(A) Optimum yield (OY). 
Magnuson-Stevens Act section (3)(33) defines ``optimum,'' with respect 
to the yield from a fishery, as the amount of fish that will provide the 
greatest overall benefit to the Nation, particularly with respect to 
food production and recreational opportunities and taking into account 
the protection of marine ecosystems; that is prescribed on the basis of 
the MSY from the fishery, as reduced by any relevant economic, social, 
or ecological factor; and, in the case of an overfished fishery, that 
provides for rebuilding to a level consistent with producing the MSY in 
such fishery. OY may be established at the stock or stock complex level, 
or at the fishery level.
    (B) In NS1, use of the phrase ``achieving, on a continuing basis, 
the optimum yield from each fishery'' means producing, from each stock, 
stock complex, or fishery: a long-term series of catches such that the 
average catch is equal to the OY, overfishing is prevented, the long 
term average biomass is near or above B<INF>msy</INF>, and overfished 
stocks and stock complexes are rebuilt consistent with timing and other 
requirements of section 304(e)(4) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act and 
paragraph (j) of this section.
    (ii) General. OY is a long-term average amount of desired yield from 
a stock, stock complex, or fishery. An FMP must contain conservation and 
management measures, including ACLs and AMs, to achieve OY on a 
continuing basis, and provisions for information collection that are 
designed to determine the degree to which OY is achieved. These measures 
should allow for practical and effective implementation and enforcement 
of the management regime. The Secretary has an obligation to implement 
and enforce the FMP. If management measures prove

[[Page 39]]

unenforceable--or too restrictive, or not rigorous enough to prevent 
overfishing while achieving OY--they should be modified; an alternative 
is to reexamine the adequacy of the OY specification. Exceeding OY does 
not necessarily constitute overfishing. However, even if no overfishing 
resulted from exceeding OY, continual harvest at a level above OY would 
violate NS1, because OY was not achieved on a continuing basis. An FMP 
must contain an assessment and specification of OY, including a summary 
of information utilized in making such specification, consistent with 
requirements of section 303(a)(3) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. A Council 
must identify those economic, social, and ecological factors relevant to 
management of a particular stock, stock complex, or fishery, and then 
evaluate them to determine the OY. The choice of a particular OY must be 
carefully documented to show that the OY selected will produce the 
greatest benefit to the Nation and prevent overfishing.
    (iii) Determining the greatest benefit to the Nation. In determining 
the greatest benefit to the Nation, the values that should be weighed 
and receive serious attention when considering the economic, social, or 
ecological factors used in reducing MSY to obtain OY are:
    (A) The benefits of food production are derived from providing 
seafood to consumers; maintaining an economically viable fishery 
together with its attendant contributions to the national, regional, and 
local economies; and utilizing the capacity of the Nation's fishery 
resources to meet nutritional needs.
    (B) The benefits of recreational opportunities reflect the quality 
of both the recreational fishing experience and non-consumptive fishery 
uses such as ecotourism, fish watching, and recreational diving. 
Benefits also include the contribution of recreational fishing to the 
national, regional, and local economies and food supplies.
    (C) The benefits of protection afforded to marine ecosystems are 
those resulting from maintaining viable populations (including those of 
unexploited species), maintaining adequate forage for all components of 
the ecosystem, maintaining evolutionary and ecological processes (e.g., 
disturbance regimes, hydrological processes, nutrient cycles), 
maintaining the evolutionary potential of species and ecosystems, and 
accommodating human use.
    (iv) Factors to consider in OY specification. Because fisheries have 
limited capacities, any attempt to maximize the measures of benefits 
described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section will inevitably 
encounter practical constraints. OY cannot exceed MSY in any 
circumstance, and must take into account the need to prevent overfishing 
and rebuild overfished stocks and stock complexes. OY is prescribed on 
the basis of MSY as reduced by social, economic, and ecological factors. 
To the extent possible, the relevant social, economic, and ecological 
factors used to establish OY for a stock, stock complex, or fishery 
should be quantified and reviewed in historical, short-term, and long-
term contexts. Even where quantification of social, economic, and 
ecological factors is not possible, the FMP still must address them in 
its OY specification. The following is a non-exhaustive list of 
potential considerations for each factor. An FMP must address each 
factor but not necessarily each example.
    (A) Social factors. Examples are enjoyment gained from recreational 
fishing, avoidance of gear conflicts and resulting disputes, 
preservation of a way of life for fishermen and their families, and 
dependence of local communities on a fishery (e.g., involvement in 
fisheries and ability to adapt to change). Consideration may be given to 
fishery-related indicators (e.g., number of fishery permits, number of 
commercial fishing vessels, number of party and charter trips, landings, 
ex-vessel revenues etc.) and non-fishery related indicators (e.g., 
unemployment rates, percent of population below the poverty level, 
population density, etc.). Other factors that may be considered include 
the effects that past harvest levels have had on fishing communities, 
the cultural place of subsistence fishing, obligations under Indian 
treaties, proportions of affected minority and low-income groups, and 
worldwide nutritional needs.

[[Page 40]]

    (B) Economic factors. Examples are prudent consideration of the risk 
of overharvesting when a stock's size or reproductive potential is 
uncertain (see Sec. 600.335(c)(2)(i)), satisfaction of consumer and 
recreational needs, and encouragement of domestic and export markets for 
U.S. harvested fish. Other factors that may be considered include: The 
value of fisheries, the level of capitalization, the decrease in cost 
per unit of catch afforded by an increase in stock size, the attendant 
increase in catch per unit of effort, alternate employment 
opportunities, and economic contribution to fishing communities, coastal 
areas, affected states, and the nation.
    (C) Ecological factors. Examples include impacts on ecosystem 
component species, forage fish stocks, other fisheries, predator-prey or 
competitive interactions, marine mammals, threatened or endangered 
species, and birds. Species interactions that have not been explicitly 
taken into account when calculating MSY should be considered as relevant 
factors for setting OY below MSY. In addition, consideration should be 
given to managing forage stocks for higher biomass than B<INF>msy</INF> 
to enhance and protect the marine ecosystem. Also important are 
ecological or environmental conditions that stress marine organisms, 
such as natural and manmade changes in wetlands or nursery grounds, and 
effects of pollutants on habitat and stocks.
    (v) Specification of OY. The specification of OY must be consistent 
with paragraphs (e)(3)(i)-(iv) of this section. If the estimates of MFMT 
and current biomass are known with a high level of certainty and 
management controls can accurately limit catch then OY could be set very 
close to MSY, assuming no other reductions are necessary for social, 
economic, or ecological factors. To the degree that such MSY estimates 
and management controls are lacking or unavailable, OY should be set 
farther from MSY. If management measures cannot adequately control 
fishing mortality so that the specified OY can be achieved without 
overfishing, the Council should reevaluate the management measures and 
specification of OY so that the dual requirements of NS1 (preventing 
overfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, OY) are met.
    (A) The amount of fish that constitutes the OY should be expressed 
in terms of numbers or weight of fish.
    (B) Either a range or a single value may be specified for OY.
    (C) All catch must be counted against OY, including that resulting 
from bycatch, scientific research, and all fishing activities.
    (D) The OY specification should be translatable into an annual 
numerical estimate for the purposes of establishing any total allowable 
level of foreign fishing (TALFF) and analyzing impacts of the management 
regime.
    (E) The determination of OY is based on MSY, directly or through 
proxy. However, even where sufficient scientific data as to the 
biological characteristics of the stock do not exist, or where the 
period of exploitation or investigation has not been long enough for 
adequate understanding of stock dynamics, or where frequent large-scale 
fluctuations in stock size diminish the meaningfulness of the MSY 
concept, OY must still be established based on the best scientific 
information available.
    (F) An OY established at a fishery level may not exceed the sum of 
the MSY values for each of the stocks or stock complexes within the 
fishery.
    (G) There should be a mechanism in the FMP for periodic reassessment 
of the OY specification, so that it is responsive to changing 
circumstances in the fishery.
    (H) Part of the OY may be held as a reserve to allow for factors 
such as uncertainties in estimates of stock size and domestic annual 
harvest (DAH). If an OY reserve is established, an adequate mechanism 
should be included in the FMP to permit timely release of the reserve to 
domestic or foreign fishermen, if necessary.
    (vi) OY and foreign fishing. Section 201(d) of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act provides that fishing by foreign nations is limited to that portion 
of the OY that will not be harvested by vessels of the United States. 
The FMP must include an assessment to address the following, as required 
by section 303(a)(4) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act:

[[Page 41]]

    (A) DAH. Councils and/or the Secretary must consider the capacity 
of, and the extent to which, U.S. vessels will harvest the OY on an 
annual basis. Estimating the amount that U.S. fishing vessels will 
actually harvest is required to determine the surplus.
    (B) Domestic annual processing (DAP). Each FMP must assess the 
capacity of U.S. processors. It must also assess the amount of DAP, 
which is the sum of two estimates: The estimated amount of U.S. harvest 
that domestic processors will process, which may be based on historical 
performance or on surveys of the expressed intention of manufacturers to 
process, supported by evidence of contracts, plant expansion, or other 
relevant information; and the estimated amount of fish that will be 
harvested by domestic vessels, but not processed (e.g., marketed as 
fresh whole fish, used for private consumption, or used for bait).
    (C) Joint venture processing (JVP). When DAH exceeds DAP, the 
surplus is available for JVP.
    (f) Acceptable biological catch, annual catch limits, and annual 
catch targets. The following features (see paragraphs (f)(1) through 
(f)(5) of this section) of acceptable biological catch and annual catch 
limits apply to stocks and stock complexes in the fishery (see paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section).
    (1) Introduction. A control rule is a policy for establishing a 
limit or target fishing level that is based on the best available 
scientific information and is established by fishery managers in 
consultation with fisheries scientists. Control rules should be designed 
so that management actions become more conservative as biomass 
estimates, or other proxies, for a stock or stock complex decline and as 
science and management uncertainty increases. Examples of scientific 
uncertainty include uncertainty in the estimates of MFMT and biomass. 
Management uncertainty may include late catch reporting, misreporting, 
and underreporting of catches and is affected by a fishery's ability to 
control actual catch. For example, a fishery that has inseason catch 
data available and inseason closure authority has better management 
control and precision than a fishery that does not have these features.
    (2) Definitions. (i) Catch is the total quantity of fish, measured 
in weight or numbers of fish, taken in commercial, recreational, 
subsistence, tribal, and other fisheries. Catch includes fish that are 
retained for any purpose, as well as mortality of fish that are 
discarded.
    (ii) Acceptable biological catch (ABC) is a level of a stock or 
stock complex's annual catch that accounts for the scientific 
uncertainty in the estimate of OFL and any other scientific uncertainty 
(see paragraph (f)(3) of this section), and should be specified based on 
the ABC control rule.
    (iii) ABC control rule means a specified approach to setting the ABC 
for a stock or stock complex as a function of the scientific uncertainty 
in the estimate of OFL and any other scientific uncertainty (see 
paragraph (f)(4) of this section).
    (iv) Annual catch limit (ACL) is the level of annual catch of a 
stock or stock complex that serves as the basis for invoking AMs. ACL 
cannot exceed the ABC, but may be divided into sector-ACLs (see 
paragraph (f)(5) of this section).
    (v) Annual catch target (ACT) is an amount of annual catch of a 
stock or stock complex that is the management target of the fishery, and 
accounts for management uncertainty in controlling the actual catch at 
or below the ACL. ACTs are recommended in the system of accountability 
measures so that ACL is not exceeded.
    (vi) ACT control rule means a specified approach to setting the ACT 
for a stock or stock complex such that the risk of exceeding the ACL due 
to management uncertainty is at an acceptably low level.
    (3) Specification of ABC. ABC may not exceed OFL (see paragraph 
(e)(2)(i)(D) of this section). Councils should develop a process for 
receiving scientific information and advice used to establish ABC. This 
process should: Identify the body that will apply the ABC control rule 
(i.e. , calculates the ABC), and identify the review process that will 
evaluate the resulting ABC. The SSC must recommend the ABC to the 
Council. An SSC may recommend an ABC that differs from the result of the 
ABC

[[Page 42]]

control rule calculation, based on factors such as data uncertainty, 
recruitment variability, declining trends in population variables, and 
other factors, but must explain why. For Secretarial FMPs or FMP 
amendments, agency scientists or a peer review process would provide the 
scientific advice to establish ABC. For internationally-assessed stocks, 
an ABC as defined in these guidelines is not required if they meet the 
international exception (see paragraph (h)(2)(ii)). While the ABC is 
allowed to equal OFL, NMFS expects that in most cases ABC will be 
reduced from OFL to reduce the probability that overfishing might occur 
in a year. Also, see paragraph (f)(5) of this section for cases where a 
Council recommends that ACL is equal to ABC, and ABC is equal to OFL.
    (i) Expression of ABC. ABC should be expressed in terms of catch, 
but may be expressed in terms of landings as long as estimates of 
bycatch and any other fishing mortality not accounted for in the 
landings are incorporated into the determination of ABC.
    (ii) ABC for overfished stocks. For overfished stocks and stock 
complexes, a rebuilding ABC must be set to reflect the annual catch that 
is consistent with the schedule of fishing mortality rates in the 
rebuilding plan.
    (4) ABC control rule. For stocks and stock complexes required to 
have an ABC, each Council must establish an ABC control rule based on 
scientific advice from its SSC. The determination of ABC should be 
based, when possible, on the probability that an actual catch equal to 
the stock's ABC would result in overfishing. This probability that 
overfishing will occur cannot exceed 50 percent and should be a lower 
value. The ABC control rule should consider reducing fishing mortality 
as stock size declines and may establish a stock abundance level below 
which fishing would not be allowed. The process of establishing an ABC 
control rule could also involve science advisors or the peer review 
process established under Magnuson-Stevens Act section 302(g)(1)(E). The 
ABC control rule must articulate how ABC will be set compared to the OFL 
based on the scientific knowledge about the stock or stock complex and 
the scientific uncertainty in the estimate of OFL and any other 
scientific uncertainty. The ABC control rule should consider uncertainty 
in factors such as stock assessment results, time lags in updating 
assessments, the degree of retrospective revision of assessment results, 
and projections. The control rule may be used in a tiered approach to 
address different levels of scientific uncertainty.
    (5) Setting the annual catch limit--(i) General. ACL cannot exceed 
the ABC and may be set annually or on a multiyear plan basis. ACLs in 
coordination with AMs must prevent overfishing (see MSA section 
303(a)(15)). If a Council recommends an ACL which equals ABC, and the 
ABC is equal to OFL, the Secretary may presume that the proposal would 
not prevent overfishing, in the absence of sufficient analysis and 
justification for the approach. A ``multiyear plan'' as referenced in 
section 303(a)(15) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act is a plan that 
establishes harvest specifications or harvest guidelines for each year 
of a time period greater than 1 year. A multiyear plan must include a 
mechanism for specifying ACLs for each year with appropriate AMs to 
prevent overfishing and maintain an appropriate rate of rebuilding if 
the stock or stock complex is in a rebuilding plan. A multiyear plan 
must provide that, if an ACL is exceeded for a year, then AMs are 
triggered for the next year consistent with paragraph (g)(3) of this 
section.
    (ii) Sector-ACLs. A Council may, but is not required to, divide an 
ACL into sector-ACLs. ``Sector,'' for purposes of this section, means a 
distinct user group to which separate management strategies and separate 
catch quotas apply. Examples of sectors include the commercial sector, 
recreational sector, or various gear groups within a fishery. If the 
management measures for different sectors differ in the degree of 
management uncertainty, then sector ACLs may be necessary so that 
appropriate AMs can be developed for each sector. If a Council chooses 
to use sector ACLs, the sum of sector ACLs must not exceed the stock or 
stock complex level ACL. The system of ACLs and AMs designed must be 
effective in protecting the stock or stock complex as a whole. Even if 
sector-ACLs and AMs

[[Page 43]]

are established, additional AMs at the stock or stock complex level may 
be necessary.
    (iii) ACLs for State-Federal Fisheries. For stocks or stock 
complexes that have harvest in state or territorial waters, FMPs and FMP 
amendments should include an ACL for the overall stock that may be 
further divided. For example, the overall ACL could be divided into a 
Federal-ACL and state-ACL. However, NMFS recognizes that Federal 
management is limited to the portion of the fishery under Federal 
authority (see paragraph (g)(5) of this section). When stocks are co-
managed by Federal, state, tribal, and/or territorial fishery managers, 
the goal should be to develop collaborative conservation and management 
strategies, and scientific capacity to support such strategies 
(including AMs for state or territorial and Federal waters), to prevent 
overfishing of shared stocks and ensure their sustainability.
    (6) ACT control rule. If ACT is specified as part of the AMs for a 
fishery, an ACT control rule is utilized for setting the ACT. The ACT 
control rule should clearly articulate how management uncertainty in the 
amount of catch in the fishery is accounted for in setting ACT. The 
objective for establishing the ACT and related AMs is that the ACL not 
be exceeded.
    (i) Determining management uncertainty. Two sources of management 
uncertainty should be accounted for in establishing the AMs for a 
fishery, including the ACT control rule if utilized: Uncertainty in the 
ability of managers to constrain catch so the ACL is not exceeded, and 
uncertainty in quantifying the true catch amounts (i.e., estimation 
errors). To determine the level of management uncertainty in controlling 
catch, analyses need to consider past management performance in the 
fishery and factors such as time lags in reported catch. Such analyses 
must be based on the best available scientific information from an SSC, 
agency scientists, or peer review process as appropriate.
    (ii) Establishing tiers and corresponding ACT control rules. Tiers 
can be established based on levels of management uncertainty associated 
with the fishery, frequency and accuracy of catch monitoring data 
available, and risks of exceeding the limit. An ACT control rule could 
be established for each tier and have, as appropriate, different 
formulas and standards used to establish the ACT.
    (7) A Council may choose to use a single control rule that combines 
both scientific and management uncertainty and supports the ABC 
recommendation and establishment of ACL and if used ACT.
    (g) Accountability measures. The following features (see paragraphs 
(g)(1) through (5) of this section) of accountability measures apply to 
those stocks and stock complexes in the fishery.
    (1) Introduction. AMs are management controls to prevent ACLs, 
including sector-ACLs, from being exceeded, and to correct or mitigate 
overages of the ACL if they occur. AMs should address and minimize both 
the frequency and magnitude of overages and correct the problems that 
caused the overage in as short a time as possible. NMFS identifies two 
categories of AMs, inseason AMs and AMs for when the ACL is exceeded.
    (2) Inseason AMs. Whenever possible, FMPs should include inseason 
monitoring and management measures to prevent catch from exceeding ACLs. 
Inseason AMs could include, but are not limited to: ACT; closure of a 
fishery; closure of specific areas; changes in gear; changes in trip 
size or bag limits; reductions in effort; or other appropriate 
management controls for the fishery. If final data or data components of 
catch are delayed, Councils should make appropriate use of preliminary 
data, such as landed catch, in implementing inseason AMs. FMPs should 
contain inseason closure authority giving NMFS the ability to close 
fisheries if it determines, based on data that it deems sufficiently 
reliable, that an ACL has been exceeded or is projected to be reached, 
and that closure of the fishery is necessary to prevent overfishing. For 
fisheries without inseason management control to prevent the ACL from 
being exceeded, AMs should utilize ACTs that are set below ACLs so that 
catches do not exceed the ACL.
    (3) AMs for when the ACL is exceeded. On an annual basis, the 
Council must

[[Page 44]]

determine as soon as possible after the fishing year if an ACL was 
exceeded. If an ACL was exceeded, AMs must be triggered and implemented 
as soon as possible to correct the operational issue that caused the ACL 
overage, as well as any biological consequences to the stock or stock 
complex resulting from the overage when it is known. These AMs could 
include, among other things, modifications of inseason AMs or overage 
adjustments. For stocks and stock complexes in rebuilding plans, the AMs 
should include overage adjustments that reduce the ACLs in the next 
fishing year by the full amount of the overages, unless the best 
scientific information available shows that a reduced overage 
adjustment, or no adjustment, is needed to mitigate the effects of the 
overages. If catch exceeds the ACL for a given stock or stock complex 
more than once in the last four years, the system of ACLs and AMs should 
be re-evaluated, and modified if necessary, to improve its performance 
and effectiveness. A Council could choose a higher performance standard 
(e.g., a stock's catch should not exceed its ACL more often than once 
every five or six years) for a stock that is particularly vulnerable to 
the effects of overfishing, if the vulnerability of the stock has not 
already been accounted for in the ABC control rule.
    (4) AMs based on multi-year average data. Some fisheries have highly 
variable annual catches and lack reliable inseason or annual data on 
which to base AMs. If there are insufficient data upon which to compare 
catch to ACL, either inseason or on an annual basis, AMs could be based 
on comparisons of average catch to average ACL over a three-year moving 
average period or, if supported by analysis, some other appropriate 
multi-year period. Councils should explain why basing AMs on a multi-
year period is appropriate. Evaluation of the moving average catch to 
the average ACL must be conducted annually and AMs should be implemented 
if the average catch exceeds the average ACL. As a performance standard, 
if the average catch exceeds the average ACL for a stock or stock 
complex more than once in the last four years, then the system of ACLs 
and AMs should be re-evaluated and modified if necessary to improve its 
performance and effectiveness. The initial ACL and management measures 
may incorporate information from previous years so that AMs based on 
average ACLs can be applied from the first year. Alternatively, a 
Council could use a stepped approach where in year-1, catch is compared 
to the ACL for year-1; in year-2 the average catch for the past 2 years 
is compared to the average ACL; then in year 3 and beyond, the most 
recent 3 years of catch are compared to the corresponding ACLs for those 
years.
    (5) AMs for State-Federal Fisheries. For stocks or stock complexes 
that have harvest in state or territorial waters, FMPs and FMP 
amendments must, at a minimum, have AMs for the portion of the fishery 
under Federal authority. Such AMs could include closing the EEZ when the 
Federal portion of the ACL is reached, or the overall stock's ACL is 
reached, or other measures.
    (h) Establishing ACL mechanisms and AMs in FMPs. FMPs or FMP 
amendments must establish ACL mechanisms and AMs for all stocks and 
stock complexes in the fishery, unless paragraph (h)(2) of this section 
is applicable. These mechanisms should describe the annual or multiyear 
process by which specific ACLs, AMs, and other reference points such as 
OFL, and ABC will be established. If a complex has multiple indicator 
stocks, each indicator stock must have its own ACL; an additional ACL 
for the stock complex as a whole is optional. In cases where fisheries 
(e.g., Pacific salmon) harvest multiple indicator stocks of a single 
species that cannot be distinguished at the time of capture, separate 
ACLs for the indicator stocks are not required and the ACL can be 
established for the complex as a whole.
    (1) In establishing ACL mechanisms and AMs, FMPs should describe:
    (i) Timeframes for setting ACLs (e.g., annually or multi-year 
periods);
    (ii) Sector-ACLs, if any (including set-asides for research or 
bycatch);
    (iii) AMs and how AMs are triggered and what sources of data will be 
used (e.g., inseason data, annual catch compared to the ACL, or multi-
year averaging approach); and

[[Page 45]]

    (iv) Sector-AMs, if there are sector-ACLs.
    (2) Exceptions from ACL and AM requirements--(i) Life cycle. Section 
303(a)(15) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act ``shall not apply to a fishery 
for species that has a life cycle of approximately 1 year unless the 
Secretary has determined the fishery is subject to overfishing of that 
species'' (as described in Magnuson-Stevens Act section 303 note). This 
exception applies to a stock for which the average length of time it 
takes for an individual to produce a reproductively active offspring is 
approximately 1 year and that the individual has only one breeding 
season in its lifetime. While exempt from the ACL and AM requirements, 
FMPs or FMP amendments for these stocks must have SDC, MSY, OY, ABC, and 
an ABC control rule.
    (ii) International fishery agreements. Section 303(a)(15) of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act applies ``unless otherwise provided for under an 
international agreement in which the United States participates'' 
(Magnuson-Stevens Act section 303 note). This exception applies to 
stocks or stock complexes subject to management under an international 
agreement, which is defined as ``any bilateral or multilateral treaty, 
convention, or agreement which relates to fishing and to which the 
United States is a party'' (see Magnuson-Stevens Act section 3(24)). 
These stocks would still need to have SDC and MSY.
    (3) Flexibility in application of NS1 guidelines. There are limited 
circumstances that may not fit the standard approaches to specification 
of reference points and management measures set forth in these 
guidelines. These include, among other things, conservation and 
management of Endangered Species Act listed species, harvests from 
aquaculture operations, and stocks with unusual life history 
characteristics (e.g., Pacific salmon, where the spawning potential for 
a stock is spread over a multi-year period). In these circumstances, 
Councils may propose alternative approaches for satisfying the NS1 
requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Act than those set forth in these 
guidelines. Councils must document their rationale for any alternative 
approaches for these limited circumstances in an FMP or FMP amendment, 
which will be reviewed for consistency with the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (i) Fisheries data. In their FMPs, or associated public documents 
such as SAFE reports as appropriate, Councils must describe general data 
collection methods, as well as any specific data collection methods used 
for all stocks in the fishery, and EC species, including:
    (1) Sources of fishing mortality (both landed and discarded), 
including commercial and recreational catch and bycatch in other 
fisheries;
    (2) Description of the data collection and estimation methods used 
to quantify total catch mortality in each fishery, including information 
on the management tools used (i.e., logbooks, vessel monitoring systems, 
observer programs, landings reports, fish tickets, processor reports, 
dealer reports, recreational angler surveys, or other methods); the 
frequency with which data are collected and updated; and the scope of 
sampling coverage for each fishery; and
    (3) Description of the methods used to compile catch data from 
various catch data collection methods and how those data are used to 
determine the relationship between total catch at a given point in time 
and the ACL for stocks and stock complexes that are part of a fishery.
    (j) Council actions to address overfishing and rebuilding for stocks 
and stock complexes in the fishery--(1) Notification. The Secretary will 
immediately notify in writing a Regional Fishery Management Council 
whenever it is determined that:
    (i) Overfishing is occurring;
    (ii) A stock or stock complex is overfished;
    (iii) A stock or stock complex is approaching an overfished 
condition; or
    (iv) Existing remedial action taken for the purpose of ending 
previously identified overfishing or rebuilding a previously identified 
overfished stock or stock complex has not resulted in adequate progress.
    (2) Timing of actions--(i) If a stock or stock complex is undergoing 
overfishing. FMPs or FMP amendments must establish ACL and AM mechanisms 
in 2010,

[[Page 46]]

for stocks and stock complexes determined to be subject to overfishing, 
and in 2011, for all other stocks and stock complexes (see paragraph 
(b)(2)(iii) of this section). To address practical implementation 
aspects of the FMP and FMP amendment process, paragraphs (j)(2)(i)(A) 
through (C) of this section clarifies the expected timing of actions.
    (A) In addition to establishing ACL and AM mechanisms, the ACLs and 
AMs themselves must be specified in FMPs, FMP amendments, implementing 
regulations, or annual specifications beginning in 2010 or 2011, as 
appropriate.
    (B) For stocks and stock complexes still determined to be subject to 
overfishing at the end of 2008, ACL and AM mechanisms and the ACLs and 
AMs themselves must be effective in fishing year 2010.
    (C) For stocks and stock complexes determined to be subject to 
overfishing during 2009, ACL and AM mechanisms and ACLs and AMs 
themselves should be effective in fishing year 2010, if possible, or in 
fishing year 2011, at the latest.
    (ii) If a stock or stock complex is overfished or approaching an 
overfished condition. (A) For notifications that a stock or stock 
complex is overfished or approaching an overfished condition made before 
July 12, 2009, a Council must prepare an FMP, FMP amendment, or proposed 
regulations within one year of notification. If the stock or stock 
complex is overfished, the purpose of the action is to specify a time 
period for ending overfishing and rebuilding the stock or stock complex 
that will be as short as possible as described under section 304(e)(4) 
of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. If the stock or stock complex is 
approaching an overfished condition, the purpose of the action is to 
prevent the biomass from declining below the MSST.
    (B) For notifications that a stock or stock complex is overfished or 
approaching an overfished condition made after July 12, 2009, a Council 
must prepare and implement an FMP, FMP amendment, or proposed 
regulations within two years of notification, consistent with the 
requirements of section 304(e)(3) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Council 
actions should be submitted to NMFS within 15 months of notification to 
ensure sufficient time for the Secretary to implement the measures, if 
approved. If the stock or stock complex is overfished and overfishing is 
occurring, the rebuilding plan must end overfishing immediately and be 
consistent with ACL and AM requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (3) Overfished fishery. (i) Where a stock or stock complex is 
overfished, a Council must specify a time period for rebuilding the 
stock or stock complex based on factors specified in Magnuson-Stevens 
Act section 304(e)(4). This target time for rebuilding 
(T<INF>target</INF>) shall be as short as possible, taking into account: 
The status and biology of any overfished stock, the needs of fishing 
communities, recommendations by international organizations in which the 
U.S. participates, and interaction of the stock within the marine 
ecosystem. In addition, the time period shall not exceed 10 years, 
except where biology of the stock, other environmental conditions, or 
management measures under an international agreement to which the U.S. 
participates, dictate otherwise. SSCs (or agency scientists or peer 
review processes in the case of Secretarial actions) shall provide 
recommendations for achieving rebuilding targets (see Magnuson-Stevens 
Act section 302(g)(1)(B)). The above factors enter into the 
specification of T<INF>target</INF> as follows:
    (A) The ``minimum time for rebuilding a stock'' (T<INF>min</INF>) 
means the amount of time the stock or stock complex is expected to take 
to rebuild to its MSY biomass level in the absence of any fishing 
mortality. In this context, the term ``expected'' means to have at least 
a 50 percent probability of attaining the B<INF>msy</INF>.
    (B) For scenarios under paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the 
starting year for the T<INF>min</INF> calculation is the first year that 
a rebuilding plan is implemented. For scenarios under paragraph 
(j)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the starting year for the T<INF>min</INF> 
calculation is 2 years after notification that a stock or stock complex 
is overfished or the first year that a rebuilding plan is implemented, 
whichever is sooner.

[[Page 47]]

    (C) If T<INF>min</INF> for the stock or stock complex is 10 years or 
less, then the maximum time allowable for rebuilding (T<INF>max</INF>) 
that stock to its B<INF>msy</INF> is 10 years.
    (D) If T<INF>min</INF> for the stock or stock complex exceeds 10 
years, then the maximum time allowable for rebuilding a stock or stock 
complex to its B<INF>msy</INF> is T<INF>min</INF> plus the length of 
time associated with one generation time for that stock or stock 
complex. ``Generation time'' is the average length of time between when 
an individual is born and the birth of its offspring.
    (E) T<INF>target</INF> shall not exceed T<INF>max</INF>, and should 
be calculated based on the factors described in this paragraph (j)(3).
    (ii) If a stock or stock complex reached the end of its rebuilding 
plan period and has not yet been determined to be rebuilt, then the 
rebuilding F should not be increased until the stock or stock complex 
has been demonstrated to be rebuilt. If the rebuilding plan was based on 
a T<INF>target</INF> that was less than T<INF>max</INF>, and the stock 
or stock complex is not rebuilt by T<INF>target</INF>, rebuilding 
measures should be revised, if necessary, such that the stock or stock 
complex will be rebuilt by T<INF>max</INF>. If the stock or stock 
complex has not rebuilt by T<INF>max</INF>, then the fishing mortality 
rate should be maintained at F<INF>rebuild</INF> or 75 percent of the 
MFMT, whichever is less.
    (iii) Council action addressing an overfished fishery must allocate 
both overfishing restrictions and recovery benefits fairly and equitably 
among sectors of the fishery.
    (iv) For fisheries managed under an international agreement, Council 
action addressing an overfished fishery must reflect traditional 
participation in the fishery, relative to other nations, by fishermen of 
the United States.
    (4) Emergency actions and interim measures. The Secretary, on his/
her own initiative or in response to a Council request, may implement 
interim measures to reduce overfishing or promulgate regulations to 
address an emergency (Magnuson-Stevens Act section 304(e)(6) or 305(c)). 
In considering a Council request for action, the Secretary would 
consider, among other things, the need for and urgency of the action and 
public interest considerations, such as benefits to the stock or stock 
complex and impacts on participants in the fishery.
    (i) These measures may remain in effect for not more than 180 days, 
but may be extended for an additional 186 days if the public has had an 
opportunity to comment on the measures and, in the case of Council-
recommended measures, the Council is actively preparing an FMP, FMP 
amendment, or proposed regulations to address the emergency or 
overfishing on a permanent basis.
    (ii) Often, these measures need to be implemented without prior 
notice and an opportunity for public comment, as it would be 
impracticable to provide for such processes given the need to act 
quickly and also contrary to the public interest to delay action. 
However, emergency regulations and interim measures that do not qualify 
for waivers or exceptions under the Administrative Procedure Act would 
need to follow proposed notice and comment rulemaking procedures.
    (k) International overfishing. If the Secretary determines that a 
fishery is overfished or approaching a condition of being overfished due 
to excessive international fishing pressure, and for which there are no 
management measures (or no effective measures) to end overfishing under 
an international agreement to which the United States is a party, then 
the Secretary and/or the appropriate Council shall take certain actions 
as provided under Magnuson-Stevens Act section 304(i). The Secretary, in 
cooperation with the Secretary of State, must immediately take 
appropriate action at the international level to end the overfishing. In 
addition, within one year after the determination, the Secretary and/or 
appropriate Council shall:
    (1) Develop recommendations for domestic regulations to address the 
relative impact of the U.S. fishing vessels on the stock. Council 
recommendations should be submitted to the Secretary.
    (2) Develop and submit recommendations to the Secretary of State, 
and to the Congress, for international actions that will end overfishing 
in the fishery and rebuild the affected stocks, taking into account the 
relative impact of vessels of other nations and vessels of

[[Page 48]]

the United States on the relevant stock. Councils should, in 
consultation with the Secretary, develop recommendations that take into 
consideration relevant provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act and NS1 
guidelines, including section 304(e) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act and 
paragraph (j)(3)(iv) of this section, and other applicable laws. For 
highly migratory species in the Pacific, recommendations from the 
Western Pacific, North Pacific, or Pacific Councils must be developed 
and submitted consistent with Magnuson-Stevens Reauthorization Act 
section 503(f), as appropriate.
    (3) Considerations for assessing ``relative impact.'' ``Relative 
impact'' under paragraphs (k)(1) and (2) of this section may include 
consideration of factors that include, but are not limited to: Domestic 
and international management measures already in place, management 
history of a given nation, estimates of a nation's landings or catch 
(including bycatch) in a given fishery, and estimates of a nation's 
mortality contributions in a given fishery. Information used to 
determine relative impact must be based upon the best available 
scientific information.
    (l) Relationship of National Standard 1 to other national 
standards--General. National Standards 2 through 10 provide further 
requirements for conservation and management measures in FMPs, but do 
not alter the requirement of NS1 to prevent overfishing and rebuild 
overfished stocks.
    (1) National Standard 2 (see Sec. 600.315). Management measures and 
reference points to implement NS1 must be based on the best scientific 
information available. When data are insufficient to estimate reference 
points directly, Councils should develop reasonable proxies to the 
extent possible (also see paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section). In 
cases where scientific data are severely limited, effort should also be 
directed to identifying and gathering the needed data. SSCs should 
advise their Councils regarding the best scientific information 
available for fishery management decisions.
    (2) National Standard 3 (see Sec. 600.320). Reference points should 
generally be specified in terms of the level of stock aggregation for 
which the best scientific information is available (also see paragraph 
(e)(1)(iii) of this section). Also, scientific assessments must be based 
on the best information about the total range of the stock and potential 
biological structuring of the stock into biological sub-units, which may 
differ from the geographic units on which management is feasible.
    (3) National Standard 6 (see Sec. 600.335). Councils must build 
into the reference points and control rules appropriate consideration of 
risk, taking into account uncertainties in estimating harvest, stock 
conditions, life history parameters, or the effects of environmental 
factors.
    (4) National Standard 8 (see Sec. 600.345). National Standard 8 
directs the Councils to apply economic and social factors towards 
sustained participation of fishing communities and to the extent 
practicable, minimize adverse economic impacts on such communities 
within the context of preventing overfishing and rebuilding overfished 
stocks as required under National Standard 1. Therefore, calculation of 
OY as reduced from MSY should include economic and social factors, but 
the combination of management measures chosen to achieve the OY must 
principally be designed to prevent overfishing and rebuild overfished 
stocks.
    (5) National Standard 9 (see Sec. 600.350). Evaluation of stock 
status with respect to reference points must take into account mortality 
caused by bycatch. In addition, the estimation of catch should include 
the mortality of fish that are discarded.
    (m) Exceptions to requirements to prevent overfishing. Exceptions to 
the requirement to prevent overfishing could apply under certain limited 
circumstances. Harvesting one stock at its optimum level may result in 
overfishing of another stock when the two stocks tend to be caught 
together (This can occur when the two stocks are part of the same 
fishery or if one is bycatch in the other's fishery). Before a Council 
may decide to allow this type of overfishing, an analysis must be 
performed and the analysis must contain a justification in terms of 
overall benefits, including a comparison of benefits

[[Page 49]]

under alternative management measures, and an analysis of the risk of 
any stock or stock complex falling below its MSST. The Council may 
decide to allow this type of overfishing if the fishery is not 
overfished and the analysis demonstrates that all of the following 
conditions are satisfied:
    (1) Such action will result in long-term net benefits to the Nation;
    (2) Mitigating measures have been considered and it has been 
demonstrated that a similar level of long-term net benefits cannot be 
achieved by modifying fleet behavior, gear selection/configuration, or 
other technical characteristic in a manner such that no overfishing 
would occur; and
    (3) The resulting rate of fishing mortality will not cause any stock 
or stock complex to fall below its MSST more than 50 percent of the time 
in the long term, although it is recognized that persistent overfishing 
is expected to cause the affected stock to fall below its 
B<INF>msy</INF> more than 50 percent of the time in the long term.

<R05>
Sec. 600.315  National Standard 2--Scientific Information.

    (a) Standard 2. Conservation and management measures shall be based 
upon the best scientific information available.
    (b) FMP development. The fact that scientific information concerning 
a fishery is incomplete does not prevent the preparation and 
implementation of an FMP (see related Sec. Sec. 600.320(d)(2) and 
600.340(b).
    (1) Scientific information includes, but is not limited to, 
information of a biological, ecological, economic, or social nature. 
Successful fishery management depends, in part, on the timely 
availability, quality, and quantity of scientific information, as well 
as on the thorough analysis of this information, and the extent to which 
the information is applied. If there are conflicting facts or opinions 
relevant to a particular point, a Council may choose among them, but 
should justify the choice.
    (2) FMPs must take into account the best scientific information 
available at the time of preparation. Between the initial drafting of an 
FMP and its submission for final review, new information often becomes 
available. This new information should be incorporated into the final 
FMP where practicable; but it is unnecessary to start the FMP process 
over again, unless the information indicates that drastic changes have 
occurred in the fishery that might require revision of the management 
objectives or measures.
    (c) FMP implementation. (1) An FMP must specify whatever information 
fishermen and processors will be required or requested to submit to the 
Secretary. Information about harvest within state boundaries, as well as 
in the EEZ, may be collected if it is needed for proper implementation 
of the FMP and cannot be obtained otherwise. The FMP should explain the 
practical utility of the information specified in monitoring the 
fishery, in facilitating inseason management decisions, and in judging 
the performance of the management regime; it should also consider the 
effort, cost, or social impact of obtaining it.
    (2) An FMP should identify scientific information needed from other 
sources to improve understanding and management of the resource, marine 
ecosystem, and the fishery (including fishing communities).
    (3) The information submitted by various data suppliers should be 
comparable and compatible, to the maximum extent possible.
    (d) FMP amendment. FMPs should be amended on a timely basis, as new 
information indicates the necessity for change in objectives or 
management measures.
    (e) SAFE Report. (1) The SAFE report is a document or set of 
documents that provides Councils with a summary of information 
concerning the most recent biological condition of stocks and the marine 
ecosystems in the FMU and the social and economic condition of the 
recreational and commercial fishing interests, fishing communities, and 
the fish processing industries. It summarizes, on a periodic basis, the 
best available scientific information concerning the past, present, and 
possible future condition of the stocks, marine ecosystems, and 
fisheries being managed under Federal regulation.

[[Page 50]]

    (i) The Secretary has the responsibility to assure that a SAFE 
report or similar document is prepared, reviewed annually, and changed 
as necessary for each FMP. The Secretary or Councils may utilize any 
combination of talent from Council, state, Federal, university, or other 
sources to acquire and analyze data and produce the SAFE report.
    (ii) The SAFE report provides information to the Councils for 
determining annual harvest levels from each stock, documenting 
significant trends or changes in the resource, marine ecosystems, and 
fishery over time, and assessing the relative success of existing state 
and Federal fishery management programs. Information on bycatch and 
safety for each fishery should also be summarized. In addition, the SAFE 
report may be used to update or expand previous environmental and 
regulatory impact documents, and ecosystem and habitat descriptions.
    (iii) Each SAFE report must be scientifically based, and cite data 
sources and interpretations.
    (2) Each SAFE report should contain information on which to base 
harvest specifications.
    (3) Each SAFE report should contain a description of the maximum 
fishing mortality threshold and the minimum stock size threshold for 
each stock or stock complex, along with information by which the Council 
may determine:
    (i) Whether overfishing is occurring with respect to any stock or 
stock complex, whether any stock or stock complex is overfished, whether 
the rate or level of fishing mortality applied to any stock or stock 
complex is approaching the maximum fishing mortality threshold, and 
whether the size of any stock or stock complex is approaching the 
minimum stock size threshold.
    (ii) Any management measures necessary to provide for rebuilding an 
overfished stock or stock complex (if any) to a level consistent with 
producing the MSY in such fishery.
    (4) Each SAFE report may contain additional economic, social, 
community, essential fish habitat, and ecological information pertinent 
to the success of management or the achievement of objectives of each 
FMP.
    (5) Each SAFE report may contain additional economic, social, and 
ecological information pertinent to the success of management or the 
achievement of objectives of each FMP.

<R05>
Sec. 600.320  National Standard 3--Management Units.

    (a) Standard 3. To the extent practicable, an individual stock of 
fish shall be managed as a unit throughout its range, and interrelated 
stocks of fish shall be managed as a unit or in close coordination.
    (b) General. The purpose of this standard is to induce a 
comprehensive approach to fishery management. The geographic scope of 
the fishery, for planning purposes, should cover the entire range of the 
stocks(s) of fish, and not be overly constrained by political 
boundaries. Wherever practicable, an FMP should seek to manage 
interrelated stocks of fish.
    (c) Unity of management. Cooperation and understanding among 
entities concerned with the fishery (e.g., Councils, states, Federal 
Government, international commissions, foreign nations) are vital to 
effective management. Where management of a fishery involves multiple 
jurisdictions, coordination among the several entities should be sought 
in the development of an FMP. Where a range overlaps Council areas, one 
FMP to cover the entire range is preferred. The Secretary designates 
which Council(s) will prepare the FMP, under section 304(f) of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (d) Management unit. The term ``management unit'' means a fishery or 
that portion of a fishery identified in an FMP as relevant to the FMP's 
management objectives.
    (1) Basis. The choice of a management unit depends on the focus of 
the FMP's objectives, and may be organized around biological, 
geographic, economic, technical, social, or ecological perspectives. For 
example:
    (i) Biological--could be based on a stock(s) throughout its range.
    (ii) Geographic--could be an area.
    (iii) Economic--could be based on a fishery supplying specific 
product forms.

[[Page 51]]

    (iv) Technical--could be based on a fishery utilizing a specific 
gear type or similar fishing practices.
    (v) Social--could be based on fishermen as the unifying element, 
such as when the fishermen pursue different species in a regular pattern 
throughout the year.
    (vi) Ecological--could be based on species that are associated in 
the ecosystem or are dependent on a particular habitat.
    (2) Conservation and management measures. FMPs should include 
conservation and management measures for that part of the management 
unit within U.S. waters, although the Secretary can ordinarily implement 
them only within the EEZ. The measures need not be identical for each 
geographic area within the management unit, if the FMP justifies the 
differences. A management unit may contain, in addition to regulated 
species, stocks of fish for which there is not enough information 
available to specify MSY and OY or to establish management measures, so 
that data on these species may be collected under the FMP.
    (e) Analysis. To document that an FMP is as comprehensive as 
practicable, it should include discussions of the following:
    (1) The range and distribution of the stocks, as well as the 
patterns of fishing effort and harvest.
    (2) Alternative management units and reasons for selecting a 
particular one. A less-than-comprehensive management unit may be 
justified if, for example, complementary management exits or is planned 
for a separate geographic area or for a distinct use of the stocks, or 
if the unmanaged portion of the resource is immaterial to proper 
management.
    (3) Management activities and habitat programs of adjacent states 
and their effects on the FMP's objectives and management measures. Where 
state action is necessary to implement measures within state waters to 
achieve FMP objectives, the FMP should identify what state action is 
necessary, discuss the consequences of state inaction or contrary 
action, and make appropriate recommendations. The FMP should also 
discuss the impact that Federal regulations will have on state 
management activities.
    (4) Management activities of other countries having an impact on the 
fishery, and how the FMP's management measures are designed to take into 
account these impacts. International boundaries may be dealt with in 
several ways. For example:
    (i) By limiting the management unit's scope to that portion of the 
stock found in U.S. waters;
    (ii) By estimating MSY for the entire stock and then basing the 
determination of OY for the U.S. fishery on the portion of the stock 
within U.S. waters; or
    (iii) By referring to treaties or cooperative agreements.

Sec. 600.325  National Standard 4--Allocations.

    (a) Standard 4. Conservation and management measures shall not 
discriminate between residents of different states. If it becomes 
necessary to allocate or assign fishing privileges among various U.S. 
fishermen, such allocation shall be:
    (1) Fair and equitable to all such fishermen.
    (2) Reasonably calculated to promote conservation.
    (3) Carried out in such manner that no particular individual, 
corporation, or other entity acquires an excessive share of such 
privileges.
    (b) Discrimination among residents of different states. An FMP may 
not differentiate among U.S. citizens, nationals, resident aliens, or 
corporations on the basis of their state of residence. An FMP may not 
incorporate or rely on a state statute or regulation that discriminates 
against residents of another state. Conservation and management measures 
that have different effects on persons in various geographic locations 
are permissible if they satisfy the other guidelines under Standard 4. 
Examples of these precepts are:
    (1) An FMP that restricted fishing in the EEZ to those holding a 
permit from state X would violate Standard 4 if state X issued permits 
only to its own citizens.

[[Page 52]]

    (2) An FMP that closed a spawning ground might disadvantage 
fishermen living in the state closest to it, because they would have to 
travel farther to an open area, but the closure could be justified under 
Standard 4 as a conservation measure with no discriminatory intent.
    (c) Allocation of fishing privileges. An FMP may contain management 
measures that allocate fishing privileges if such measures are necessary 
or helpful in furthering legitimate objectives or in achieving the OY, 
and if the measures conform with paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through 
(c)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (1) Definition. An ``allocation'' or ``assignment'' of fishing 
privileges is a direct and deliberate distribution of the opportunity to 
participate in a fishery among identifiable, discrete user groups or 
individuals. Any management measure (or lack of management) has 
incidental allocative effects, but only those measures that result in 
direct distributions of fishing privileges will be judged against the 
allocation requirements of Standard 4. Adoption of an FMP that merely 
perpetuates existing fishing practices may result in an allocation, if 
those practices directly distribute the opportunity to participate in 
the fishery. Allocations of fishing privileges include, for example, 
per-vessel catch limits, quotas by vessel class and gear type, different 
quotas or fishing seasons for recreational and commercial fishermen, 
assignment of ocean areas to different gear users, and limitation of 
permits to a certain number of vessels or fishermen.
    (2) Analysis of allocations. Each FMP should contain a description 
and analysis of the allocations existing in the fishery and of those 
made in the FMP. The effects of eliminating an existing allocation 
system should be examined. Allocation schemes considered, but rejected 
by the Council, should be included in the discussion. The analysis 
should relate the recommended allocations to the FMP's objectives and OY 
specification, and discuss the factors listed in paragraph (c)(3) of 
this section.
    (3) Factors in making allocations. An allocation of fishing 
privileges must be fair and equitable, must be reasonably calculated to 
promote conservation, and must avoid excessive shares. These tests are 
explained in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (c)(3)(iii) of this section:
    (i) Fairness and equity. (A) An allocation of fishing privileges 
should be rationally connected to the achievement of OY or with the 
furtherance of a legitimate FMP objective. Inherent in an allocation is 
the advantaging of one group to the detriment of another. The motive for 
making a particular allocation should be justified in terms of the 
objectives of the FMP; otherwise, the disadvantaged user groups or 
individuals would suffer without cause. For instance, an FMP objective 
to preserve the economic status quo cannot be achieved by excluding a 
group of long-time participants in the fishery. On the other hand, there 
is a rational connection between an objective of harvesting shrimp at 
their maximum size and closing a nursery area to trawling.
    (B) An allocation of fishing privileges may impose a hardship on one 
group if it is outweighed by the total benefits received by another 
group or groups. An allocation need not preserve the status quo in the 
fishery to qualify as ``fair and equitable,'' if a restructuring of 
fishing privileges would maximize overall benefits. The Council should 
make an initial estimate of the relative benefits and hardships imposed 
by the allocation, and compare its consequences with those of 
alternative allocation schemes, including the status quo. Where 
relevant, judicial guidance and government policy concerning the rights 
of treaty Indians and aboriginal Americans must be considered in 
determining whether an allocation is fair and equitable.
    (ii) Promotion of conservation. Numerous methods of allocating 
fishing privileges are considered ``conservation and management'' 
measures under section 303 of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. An allocation 
scheme may promote conservation by encouraging a rational, more easily 
managed use of the resource. Or, it may promote conservation (in the 
sense of wise use) by optimizing the yield in terms of size, value,

[[Page 53]]

market mix, price, or economic or social benefit of the product. To the 
extent that rebuilding plans or other conservation and management 
measures that reduce the overall harvest in a fishery are necessary, any 
harvest restrictions or recovery benefits must be allocated fairly and 
equitably among the commercial, recreational, and charter fishing 
sectors of the fishery.
    (iii) Avoidance of excessive shares. An allocation scheme must be 
designed to deter any person or other entity from acquiring an excessive 
share of fishing privileges, and to avoid creating conditions fostering 
inordinate control, by buyers or sellers, that would not otherwise 
exist.
    (iv) Other factors. In designing an allocation scheme, a Council 
should consider other factors relevant to the FMP's objectives. Examples 
are economic and social consequences of the scheme, food production, 
consumer interest, dependence on the fishery by present participants and 
coastal communities, efficiency of various types of gear used in the 
fishery, transferability of effort to and impact on other fisheries, 
opportunity for new participants to enter the fishery, and enhancement 
of opportunities for recreational fishing.

<R05>
Sec. 600.330  National Standard 5--Efficiency.

    (a) Standard 5. Conservation and management measures shall, where 
practicable, consider efficiency in the utilization of fishery 
resources; except that no such measure shall have economic allocation as 
its sole purpose.
    (b) Efficiency in the utilization of resources--(1) General. The 
term ``utilization'' encompasses harvesting, processing, marketing, and 
non-consumptive uses of the resource, since management decisions affect 
all sectors of the industry. In considering efficient utilization of 
fishery resources, this standard highlights one way that a fishery can 
contribute to the Nation's benefit with the least cost to society: Given 
a set of objectives for the fishery, an FMP should contain management 
measures that result in as efficient a fishery as is practicable or 
desirable.
    (2) Efficiency. In theory, an efficient fishery would harvest the OY 
with the minimum use of economic inputs such as labor, capital, 
interest, and fuel. Efficiency in terms of aggregate costs then becomes 
a conservation objective, where ``conservation'' constitutes wise use of 
all resources involved in the fishery, not just fish stocks.
    (i) In an FMP, management measures may be proposed that allocate 
fish among different groups of individuals or establish a system of 
property rights. Alternative measures examined in searching for an 
efficient outcome will result in different distributions of gains and 
burdens among identifiable user groups. An FMP should demonstrate that 
management measures aimed at efficiency do not simply redistribute gains 
and burdens without an increase in efficiency.
    (ii) Management regimes that allow a fishery to operate at the 
lowest possible cost (e.g., fishing effort, administration, and 
enforcement) for a particular level of catch and initial stock size are 
considered efficient. Restrictive measures that unnecessarily raise any 
of those costs move the regime toward inefficiency. Unless the use of 
inefficient techniques or the creation of redundant fishing capacity 
contributes to the attainment of other social or biological objectives, 
an FMP may not contain management measures that impede the use of cost-
effective techniques of harvesting, processing, or marketing, and should 
avoid creating strong incentives for excessive investment in private 
sector fishing capital and labor.
    (c) Limited access. A ``system for limiting access,'' which is an 
optional measure under section 303(b) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, is a 
type of allocation of fishing privileges that may be considered to 
contribute to economic efficiency or conservation. For example, limited 
access may be used to combat overfishing, overcrowding, or 
overcapitalization in a fishery to achieve OY. In an unutilized or 
underutilized fishery, it may be used to reduce the chance that these 
conditions will adversely affect the fishery in the future, or to 
provide adequate economic return to pioneers in a new fishery. In some 
cases, limited entry is a

[[Page 54]]

useful ingredient of a conservation scheme, because it facilitates 
application and enforcement of other management measures.
    (1) Definition. Limited access (or limited entry) is a management 
technique that attempts to limit units of effort in a fishery, usually 
for the purpose of reducing economic waste, improving net economic 
return to the fishermen, or capturing economic rent for the benefit of 
the taxpayer or the consumer. Common forms of limited access are 
licensing of vessels, gear, or fishermen to reduce the number of units 
of effort, and dividing the total allowable catch into fishermen's 
quotas (a stock-certificate system). Two forms (i.e., Federal fees for 
licenses or permits in excess of administrative costs, and taxation) are 
not permitted under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, except for fees allowed 
under section 304(d)(2).
    (2) Factors to consider. The Magnuson-Stevens Act ties the use of 
limited access to the achievement of OY. An FMP that proposes a limited 
access system must consider the factors listed in section 303(b)(6) of 
the Magnuson-Stevens Act and in Sec. 600.325(c)(3). In addition, it 
should consider the criteria for qualifying for a permit, the nature of 
the interest created, whether to make the permit transferable, and the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act's limitations on returning economic rent to the 
public under section 304(d). The FMP should also discuss the costs of 
achieving an appropriate distribution of fishing privileges.
    (d) Analysis. An FMP should discuss the extent to which 
overcapitalization, congestion, economic waste, and inefficient 
techniques in the fishery reduce the net benefits derived from the 
management unit and prevent the attainment and appropriate allocation of 
OY. It should also explain, in terms of the FMP's objectives, any 
restriction placed on the use of efficient techniques of harvesting, 
processing, or marketing. If, during FMP development, the Council 
considered imposing a limited-entry system, the FMP should analyze the 
Council's decision to recommend or reject limited access as a technique 
to achieve efficient utilization of the resources of the fishing 
industry.
    (e) Economic allocation. This standard prohibits only those measures 
that distribute fishery resources among fishermen on the basis of 
economic factors alone, and that have economic allocation as their only 
purpose. Where conservation and management measures are recommended that 
would change the economic structure of the industry or the economic 
conditions under which the industry operates, the need for such measures 
must be justified in light of the biological, ecological, and social 
objectives of the FMP, as well as the economic objectives.

<R05>
Sec. 600.335  National Standard 6--Variations and Contingencies.

    (a) Standard 6. Conservation and management measures shall take into 
account and allow for variations among, and contingencies in, fisheries, 
fishery resources, and catches.
    (b) Conservation and management. Each fishery exhibits unique 
uncertainties. The phrase ``conservation and management'' implies the 
wise use of fishery resources through a management regime that includes 
some protection against these uncertainties. The particular regime 
chosen must be flexible enough to allow timely response to resource, 
industry, and other national and regional needs. Continual data 
acquisition and analysis will help the development of management 
measures to compensate for variations and to reduce the need for 
substantial buffers. Flexibility in the management regime and the 
regulatory process will aid in responding to contingencies.
    (c) Variations. (1) In fishery management terms, variations arise 
from biological, social, and economic occurrences, as well as from 
fishing practices. Biological uncertainties and lack of knowledge can 
hamper attempts to estimate stock size and strength, stock location in 
time and space, environmental/habitat changes, and ecological 
interactions. Economic uncertainty may involve changes in foreign or 
domestic market conditions, changes in operating costs, drifts toward 
overcapitalization, and economic perturbations caused by changed fishing 
patterns.

[[Page 55]]

Changes in fishing practices, such as the introduction of new gear, 
rapid increases or decreases in harvest effort, new fishing strategies, 
and the effects of new management techniques, may also create 
uncertainties. Social changes could involve increases or decreases in 
recreational fishing, or the movement of people into or out of fishing 
activities due to such factors as age or educational opportunities.
    (2) Every effort should be made to develop FMPs that discuss and 
take into account these vicissitudes. To the extent practicable, FMPs 
should provide a suitable buffer in favor of conservation. Allowances 
for uncertainties should be factored into the various elements of an 
FMP. Examples are:
    (i) Reduce OY. Lack of scientific knowledge about the condition of a 
stock(s) could be reason to reduce OY.
    (ii) Establish a reserve. Creation of a reserve may compensate for 
uncertainties in estimating domestic harvest, stock conditions, or 
environmental factors.
    (iii) Adjust management techniques. In the absence of adequate data 
to predict the effect of a new regime, and to avoid creating unwanted 
variations, a Council could guard against producing drastic changes in 
fishing patterns, allocations, or practices.
    (iv) Highlight habitat conditions. FMPs may address the impact of 
pollution and the effects of wetland and estuarine degradation on the 
stocks of fish; identify causes of pollution and habitat degradation and 
the authorities having jurisdiction to regulate or influence such 
activities; propose recommendations that the Secretary will convey to 
those authorities to alleviate such problems; and state the views of the 
Council on unresolved or anticipated issues.
    (d) Contingencies. Unpredictable events--such as unexpected resource 
surges or failures, fishing effort greater than anticipated, disruptive 
gear conflicts, climatic conditions, or environmental catastrophes--are 
best handled by establishing a flexible management regime that contains 
a range of management options through which it is possible to act 
quickly without amending the FMP or even its regulations.
    (1) The FMP should describe the management options and their 
consequences in the necessary detail to guide the Secretary in 
responding to changed circumstances, so that the Council preserves its 
role as policy-setter for the fishery. The description should enable the 
public to understand what may happen under the flexible regime, and to 
comment on the options.
    (2) FMPs should include criteria for the selection of management 
measures, directions for their application, and mechanisms for timely 
adjustment of management measures comprising the regime. For example, an 
FMP could include criteria that allow the Secretary to open and close 
seasons, close fishing grounds, or make other adjustments in management 
measures.
    (3) Amendment of a flexible FMP would be necessary when 
circumstances in the fishery change substantially, or when a Council 
adopts a different management philosophy and objectives.


<R05>
Sec. 600.340  National Standard 7--Costs and Benefits.

    (a) Standard 7. Conservation and management measures shall, where 
practicable, minimize costs and avoid unnecessary duplication.
    (b) Necessity of Federal management--(1) General. The principle that 
not every fishery needs regulation is implicit in this standard. The 
Magnuson-Stevens Act requires Councils to prepare FMPs only for 
overfished fisheries and for other fisheries where regulation would 
serve some useful purpose and where the present or future benefits of 
regulation would justify the costs. For example, the need to collect 
data about a fishery is not, by itself, adequate justification for 
preparation of an FMP, since there are less costly ways to gather the 
data (see Sec. 600.320(d)(2). In some cases, the FMP preparation 
process itself, even if it does not culminate in a document approved by 
the Secretary, can be useful in supplying a basis for management by one 
or more coastal states.
    (2) Criteria. In deciding whether a fishery needs management through 
regulations implementing an FMP, the following general factors should be 
considered, among others:

[[Page 56]]

    (i) The importance of the fishery to the Nation and to the regional 
economy.
    (ii) The condition of the stock or stocks of fish and whether an FMP 
can improve or maintain that condition.
    (iii) The extent to which the fishery could be or is already 
adequately managed by states, by state/Federal programs, by Federal 
regulations pursuant to FMPs or international commissions, or by 
industry self-regulation, consistent with the policies and standards of 
the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (iv) The need to resolve competing interests and conflicts among 
user groups and whether an FMP can further that resolution.
    (v) The economic condition of a fishery and whether an FMP can 
produce more efficient utilization.
    (vi) The needs of a developing fishery, and whether an FMP can 
foster orderly growth.
    (vii) The costs associated with an FMP, balanced against the 
benefits (see paragraph (d) of this section as a guide).
    (c) Alternative management measures. Management measures should not 
impose unnecessary burdens on the economy, on individuals, on private or 
public organizations, or on Federal, state, or local governments. 
Factors such as fuel costs, enforcement costs, or the burdens of 
collecting data may well suggest a preferred alternative.
    (d) Analysis. The supporting analyses for FMPs should demonstrate 
that the benefits of fishery regulation are real and substantial 
relative to the added research, administrative, and enforcement costs, 
as well as costs to the industry of compliance. In determining the 
benefits and costs of management measures, each management strategy 
considered and its impacts on different user groups in the fishery 
should be evaluated. This requirement need not produce an elaborate, 
formalistic cost/benefit analysis. Rather, an evaluation of effects and 
costs, especially of differences among workable alternatives, including 
the status quo, is adequate. If quantitative estimates are not possible, 
qualitative estimates will suffice.
    (1) Burdens. Management measures should be designed to give 
fishermen the greatest possible freedom of action in conducting business 
and pursuing recreational opportunities that are consistent with 
ensuring wise use of the resources and reducing conflict in the fishery. 
The type and level of burden placed on user groups by the regulations 
need to be identified. Such an examination should include, for example: 
Capital outlays; operating and maintenance costs; reporting costs; 
administrative, enforcement, and information costs; and prices to 
consumers. Management measures may shift costs from one level of 
government to another, from one part of the private sector to another, 
or from the government to the private sector. Redistribution of costs 
through regulations is likely to generate controversy. A discussion of 
these and any other burdens placed on the public through FMP regulations 
should be a part of the FMP's supporting analyses.
    (2) Gains. The relative distribution of gains may change as a result 
of instituting different sets of alternatives, as may the specific type 
of gain. The analysis of benefits should focus on the specific gains 
produced by each alternative set of management measures, including the 
status quo. The benefits to society that result from the alternative 
management measures should be identified, and the level of gain 
assessed.

<R05>
Sec. 600.345  National Standard 8--Communities.

    (a) Standard 8. Conservation and management measures shall, 
consistent with the conservation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act (including the prevention of overfishing and rebuilding of 
overfished stocks), take into account the importance of fishery 
resources to fishing communities by utilizing economic and social data 
that are based upon the best scientific information available in order 
to:
    (1) Provide for the sustained participation of such communities; and
    (2) To the extent practicable, minimize adverse economic impacts on 
such communities.

[[Page 57]]

    (b) General. (1) This standard requires that an FMP take into 
account the importance of fishery resources to fishing communities. This 
consideration, however, is within the context of the conservation 
requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Deliberations regarding the 
importance of fishery resources to affected fishing communities, 
therefore, must not compromise the achievement of conservation 
requirements and goals of the FMP. Where the preferred alternative 
negatively affects the sustained participation of fishing communities, 
the FMP should discuss the rationale for selecting this alternative over 
another with a lesser impact on fishing communities. All other things 
being equal, where two alternatives achieve similar conservation goals, 
the alternative that provides the greater potential for sustained 
participation of such communities and minimizes the adverse economic 
impacts on such communities would be the preferred alternative.
    (2) This standard does not constitute a basis for allocating 
resources to a specific fishing community nor for providing preferential 
treatment based on residence in a fishing community.
    (3) The term ``fishing community'' means a community that is 
substantially dependent on or substantially engaged in the harvest or 
processing of fishery resources to meet social and economic needs, and 
includes fishing vessel owners, operators, and crew, and fish processors 
that are based in such communities. A fishing community is a social or 
economic group whose members reside in a specific location and share a 
common dependency on commercial, recreational, or subsistence fishing or 
on directly related fisheries-dependent services and industries (for 
example, boatyards, ice suppliers, tackle shops).
    (4) The term ``sustained participation'' means continued access to 
the fishery within the constraints of the condition of the resource.
    (c) Analysis. (1) FMPs must examine the social and economic 
importance of fisheries to communities potentially affected by 
management measures. For example, severe reductions of harvests for 
conservation purposes may decrease employment opportunities for 
fishermen and processing plant workers, thereby adversely affecting 
their families and communities. Similarly, a management measure that 
results in the allocation of fishery resources among competing sectors 
of a fishery may benefit some communities at the expense of others.
    (2) An appropriate vehicle for the analyses under this standard is 
the fishery impact statement required by section 303(a)(9) of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act. Qualitative and quantitative data may be used, 
including information provided by fishermen, dealers, processors, and 
fisheries organizations and associations. In cases where data are 
severely limited, effort should be directed to identifying and gathering 
needed data.
    (3) To address the sustained participation of fishing communities 
that will be affected by management measures, the analysis should first 
identify affected fishing communities and then assess their differing 
levels of dependence on and engagement in the fishery being regulated. 
The analysis should also specify how that assessment was made. The best 
available data on the history, extent, and type of participation of 
these fishing communities in the fishery should be incorporated into the 
social and economic information presented in the FMP. The analysis does 
not have to contain an exhaustive listing of all communities that might 
fit the definition; a judgment can be made as to which are primarily 
affected. The analysis should discuss each alternative's likely effect 
on the sustained participation of these fishing communities in the 
fishery.
    (4) The analysis should assess the likely positive and negative 
social and economic impacts of the alternative management measures, over 
both the short and the long term, on fishing communities. Any particular 
management measure may economically benefit some communities while 
adversely affecting others. Economic impacts should be considered both 
for individual communities and for the group of all affected communities 
identified in the FMP. Impacts of both consumptive and non-consumptive 
uses of fishery resources should be considered.

[[Page 58]]

    (5) A discussion of social and economic impacts should identify 
those alternatives that would minimize adverse impacts on these fishing 
communities within the constraints of conservation and management goals 
of the FMP, other national standards, and other applicable law.

<R05>
Sec. 600.350  National Standard 9--Bycatch.

    (a) Standard 9. Conservation and management measures shall, to the 
extent practicable:
    (1) Minimize bycatch; and
    (2) To the extent bycatch cannot be avoided, minimize the mortality 
of such bycatch.
    (b) General. This national standard requires Councils to consider 
the bycatch effects of existing and planned conservation and management 
measures. Bycatch can, in two ways, impede efforts to protect marine 
ecosystems and achieve sustainable fisheries and the full benefits they 
can provide to the Nation. First, bycatch can increase substantially the 
uncertainty concerning total fishing-related mortality, which makes it 
more difficult to assess the status of stocks, to set the appropriate OY 
and define overfishing levels, and to ensure that OYs are attained and 
overfishing levels are not exceeded. Second, bycatch may also preclude 
other more productive uses of fishery resources.
    (c) Definition--Bycatch. The term ``bycatch'' means fish that are 
harvested in a fishery, but that are not sold or kept for personal use.
    (1) Inclusions. Bycatch includes the discard of whole fish at sea or 
elsewhere, including economic discards and regulatory discards, and 
fishing mortality due to an encounter with fishing gear that does not 
result in capture of fish (i.e., unobserved fishing mortality).
    (2) Exclusions. Bycatch excludes the following:
    (i) Fish that legally are retained in a fishery and kept for 
personal, tribal, or cultural use, or that enter commerce through sale, 
barter, or trade.
    (ii) Fish released alive under a recreational catch-and-release 
fishery management program. A catch-and-release fishery management 
program is one in which the retention of a particular species is 
prohibited. In such a program, those fish released alive would not be 
considered bycatch.
    (iii) Fish harvested in a commercial fishery managed by the 
Secretary under Magnuson-Stevens Act sec. 304(g) or the Atlantic Tunas 
Convention Act of 1975 (16 U.S.C. 971d) or highly migratory species 
harvested in a commercial fishery managed by a Council under the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act or the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries 
Convention Implementation Act, that are not regulatory discards and that 
are tagged and released alive under a scientific tagging and release 
program established by the Secretary.
    (d) Minimizing bycatch and bycatch mortality. The priority under 
this standard is first to avoid catching bycatch species where 
practicable. Fish that are bycatch and cannot be avoided must, to the 
extent practicable, be returned to the sea alive. Any proposed 
conservation and management measure that does not give priority to 
avoiding the capture of bycatch species must be supported by appropriate 
analyses. In their evaluation, the Councils must consider the net 
benefits to the Nation, which include, but are not limited to: Negative 
impacts on affected stocks; incomes accruing to participants in directed 
fisheries in both the short and long term; incomes accruing to 
participants in fisheries that target the bycatch species; environmental 
consequences; non-market values of bycatch species, which include non-
consumptive uses of bycatch species and existence values, as well as 
recreational values; and impacts on other marine organisms. To evaluate 
conservation and management measures relative to this and other national 
standards, as well as to evaluate total fishing mortality, Councils 
must--
    (1) Promote development of a database on bycatch and bycatch 
mortality in the fishery to the extent practicable. A review and, where 
necessary, improvement of data collection methods, data sources, and 
applications of data must be initiated for each fishery to determine the 
amount, type, disposition, and other characteristics of bycatch and 
bycatch

[[Page 59]]

mortality in each fishery for purposes of this standard and of section 
303(a)(11) and (12) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Bycatch should be 
categorized to focus on management responses necessary to minimize 
bycatch and bycatch mortality to the extent practicable. When 
appropriate, management measures, such as at-sea monitoring programs, 
should be developed to meet these information needs.
    (2) For each management measure, assess the effects on the amount 
and type of bycatch and bycatch mortality in the fishery. Most 
conservation and management measures can affect the amounts of bycatch 
or bycatch mortality in a fishery, as well as the extent to which 
further reductions in bycatch are practicable. In analyzing measures, 
including the status quo, Councils should assess the impacts of 
minimizing bycatch and bycatch mortality, as well as consistency of the 
selected measure with other national standards and applicable laws. The 
benefits of minimizing bycatch to the extent practicable should be 
identified and an assessment of the impact of the selected measure on 
bycatch and bycatch mortality provided. Due to limitations on the 
information available, fishery managers may not be able to generate 
precise estimates of bycatch and bycatch mortality or other effects for 
each alternative. In the absence of quantitative estimates of the 
impacts of each alternative, Councils may use qualitative measures. 
Information on the amount and type of bycatch should be summarized in 
the SAFE reports.
    (3) Select measures that, to the extent practicable, will minimize 
bycatch and bycatch mortality. (i) A determination of whether a 
conservation and management measure minimizes bycatch or bycatch 
mortality to the extent practicable, consistent with other national 
standards and maximization of net benefits to the Nation, should 
consider the following factors:
    (A) Population effects for the bycatch species.
    (B) Ecological effects due to changes in the bycatch of that species 
(effects on other species in the ecosystem).
    (C) Changes in the bycatch of- other species of fish and the 
resulting population and ecosystem effects.
    (D) Effects on marine mammals and birds.
    (E) Changes in fishing, processing, disposal, and marketing costs.
    (F) Changes in fishing practices and behavior of fishermen.
    (G) Changes in research, administration, and enforcement costs and 
management effectiveness.
    (H) Changes in the economic, social, or cultural value of fishing 
activities and nonconsumptive uses of fishery resources.
    (I) Changes in the distribution of benefits and costs.
    (J) Social effects.
    (ii) The Councils should adhere to the precautionary approach found 
in the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) 
Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (Article 6.5), which is 
available from the Director, Publications Division, FAO, Viale delle 
Terme di Caracalla, 00100 Rome, Italy, when faced with uncertainty 
concerning any of the factors listed in this paragraph (d)(3).
    (4) Monitor selected management measures. Effects of implemented 
measures should be evaluated routinely. Monitoring systems should be 
established prior to fishing under the selected management measures. 
Where applicable, plans should be developed and coordinated with 
industry and other concerned organizations to identify opportunities for 
cooperative data collection, coordination of data management for cost 
efficiency, and avoidance of duplicative effort.
    (e) Other considerations. Other applicable laws, such as the MMPA, 
the ESA, and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, require that Councils 
consider the impact of conservation and management measures on living 
marine resources other than fish; i.e., marine mammals and birds.

<R05>
Sec. 600.355  National Standard 10--Safety of Life at Sea.

    (a) Standard 10. Conservation and management measures shall, to the 
extent practicable, promote the safety of human life at sea.
    (b) General. (1) Fishing is an inherently dangerous occupation where 
not

[[Page 60]]

all hazardous situations can be foreseen or avoided. The standard 
directs Councils to reduce that risk in crafting their management 
measures, so long as they can meet the other national standards and the 
legal and practical requirements of conservation and management. This 
standard is not meant to give preference to one method of managing a 
fishery over another.
    (2) The qualifying phrase ``to the extent practicable'' recognizes 
that regulation necessarily puts constraints on fishing that would not 
otherwise exist. These constraints may create pressures on fishermen to 
fish under conditions that they would otherwise avoid. This standard 
instructs the Councils to identify and avoid those situations, if they 
can do so consistent with the legal and practical requirements of 
conservation and management of the resource.
    (3) For the purposes of this national standard, the safety of the 
fishing vessel and the protection from injury of persons aboard the 
vessel are considered the same as ``safety of human life at sea. The 
safety of a vessel and the people aboard is ultimately the 
responsibility of the master of that vessel. Each master makes many 
decisions about vessel maintenance and loading and about the 
capabilities of the vessel and crew to operate safely in a variety of 
weather and sea conditions. This national standard does not replace the 
judgment or relieve the responsibility of the vessel master related to 
vessel safety. The Councils, the USCG, and NMFS, through the 
consultation process of paragraph (d) of this section, will review all 
FMPs, amendments, and regulations during their development to ensure 
they recognize any impact on the safety of human life at sea and 
minimize or mitigate that impact where practicable.
    (c) Safety considerations. The following is a non-inclusive list of 
safety considerations that should be considered in evaluating management 
measures under national standard 10.
    (1) Operating environment. Where and when a fishing vessel operates 
is partly a function of the general climate and weather patterns of an 
area. Typically, larger vessels can fish farther offshore and in more 
adverse weather conditions than smaller vessels. An FMP should try to 
avoid creating situations that result in vessels going out farther, 
fishing longer, or fishing in weather worse than they generally would 
have in the absence of management measures. Where these conditions are 
unavoidable, management measures should mitigate these effects, 
consistent with the overall management goals of the fishery.
    (2) Gear and vessel loading requirements. A fishing vessel operates 
in a very dynamic environment that can be an extremely dangerous place 
to work. Moving heavy gear in a seaway creates a dangerous situation on 
a vessel. Carrying extra gear can also significantly reduce the 
stability of a fishing vessel, making it prone to capsizing. An FMP 
should consider the safety and stability of fishing vessels when 
requiring specific gear or requiring the removal of gear from the water. 
Management measures should reflect a sensitivity to these issues and 
provide methods of mitigation of these situations wherever possible.
    (3) Limited season and area fisheries. Fisheries where time 
constraints for harvesting are a significant factor and with no 
flexibility for weather, often called ``derby'' fisheries, can create 
serious safety problems. To participate fully in such a fishery, 
fishermen may fish in bad weather and overload their vessel with catch 
and/or gear. Where these conditions exist, FMPs should attempt to 
mitigate these effects and avoid them in new management regimes, as 
discussed in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (d) Consultation. During preparation of any FMP, FMP amendment, or 
regulation that might affect safety of human life at sea, the Council 
should consult with the USCG and the fishing industry as to the nature 
and extent of any adverse impacts. This consultation may be done through 
a Council advisory panel, committee, or other review of the FMP, FMP 
amendment, or regulations. Mitigation, to the extent practicable, and 
other safety considerations identified in paragraph (c) of this section 
should be included in the FMP.
    (e) Mitigation measures. There are many ways in which an FMP may 
avoid or provide alternative measures

[[Page 61]]

to reduce potential impacts on safety of human life at sea. The 
following is a list of some factors that could be considered when 
management measures are developed:
    (1) Setting seasons to avoid hazardous weather.
    (2) Providing for seasonal or trip flexibility to account for bad 
weather (weather days).
    (3) Allowing for pre- and post-season ``soak time'' to deploy and 
pick up fixed gear, so as to avoid overloading vessels with fixed gear.
    (4) Tailoring gear requirements to provide for smaller or lighter 
gear for smaller vessels.
    (5) Avoiding management measures that require hazardous at-sea 
inspections or enforcement if other comparable enforcement could be 
accomplished as effectively.
    (6) Limiting the number of participants in the fishery.
    (7) Spreading effort over time and area to avoid potential gear and/
or vessel conflicts.
    (8) Implementing management measures that reduce the race for fish 
and the resulting incentives for fishermen to take additional risks with 
respect to vessel safety.

                        Subpart F_Foreign Fishing


<R05>
Sec. 600.501  Vessel permits.

    (a) General. (1) Each FFV fishing under the Magnuson-Stevens Act 
must have on board a permit issued under this section, unless it is 
engaged only in recreational fishing.
    (2) Permits issued under this section do not authorize FFV's or 
persons to harass, capture, or kill marine mammals. No marine mammals 
may be taken in the course of fishing unless that vessel has on board a 
currently valid Authorization Certificate under the MMPA. Regulations 
governing the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing 
operations are contained in 50 CFR part 229 of this title.
    (b) Responsibility of owners and operators. The owners and operators 
of each FFV are jointly and severally responsible for compliance with 
the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the applicable GIFA, this subpart, and any 
permit issued under the Magnuson-Stevens Act and this subpart. The 
owners and operators of each FFV bear civil responsibility for the acts 
of their employees and agents constituting violations, regardless of 
whether the specific acts were authorized or even forbidden by the 
employer or principal, and regardless of knowledge concerning the 
occurrence.
    (c) Activity codes. Permits to fish under this subpart may be issued 
by the Assistant Administrator for the activities described in this 
paragraph, but the permits may be modified by regulations of this 
subpart and by the conditions and restrictions attached to the permit 
(see paragraphs (e)(1)(v) and (l) of this section). The Assistant 
Administrator may issue a permit, as appropriate, for one or more of the 
activity codes listed. Only vessels of nations having a GIFA with the 
United States may be issued permits for activity codes 1 through 9. A 
GIFA is not required for a vessel to be issued a permit for activity 
code 10. The activity codes are described as follows:
    (1) Activity Code 1. Catching, scouting, processing, transshipping, 
and supporting foreign vessels. Activity is limited to fish harvested or 
to be harvested by foreign vessels in the EEZ.
    (2) Activity Code 2. Processing, scouting, transshipping, and 
supporting foreign vessels. Activity is limited to fish harvested or to 
be harvested by foreign vessels in the EEZ.
    (3) Activity Code 3. Transshipping, scouting, and supporting foreign 
vessels. Activity is limited to fish harvested or to be harvested by 
foreign vessels in the EEZ.
    (4) Activity Code 4. Processing, scouting, transshipping, and 
supporting U.S. vessels delivering fish to foreign vessels. Activity is 
limited to the receipt of unprocessed fish harvested or to be harvested 
by U.S. vessels.
    (5) Activity Code 5. Transshipping, scouting, and supporting foreign 
vessels. Transshipment limited to fish received or to be received from 
foreign vessels processing fish from U.S. harvesting vessels.
    (6) Activity Code 6. Transshipping, scouting, and supporting U.S. 
vessels. Transshipment limited to U.S.-harvested fish processed on board 
U.S. vessels.
    (7) Activity Code 7. Processing, transshipping, and supporting 
foreign vessels. Activity limited to fish harvested or to be harvested 
by foreign vessels seaward of the EEZ.
    (8) Activity Code 8. Transshipping and supporting foreign vessels. 
Activity is limited to fish harvested or to be harvested seaward of the 
EEZ by foreign vessels or fish duly authorized for processing in the 
internal waters of one of the states.
    (9) Activity Code 9. Supporting U.S. fishing vessels and U.S. fish 
processing vessels and any foreign fishing vessels authorized under any 
activity code under paragraph (c) of this subpart.
    (10) Activity Code 10. Transshipping at sea for the purpose of 
transporting fish or fish products from a point within the EEZ or, with 
the concurrence of a state, within the boundaries of that state, to a 
point outside the United States.
    (d) Application. (1) Applications for FFV permits authorizing 
activity codes 1 through 9 must be submitted by an official 
representative of a foreign nation to the DOS. Applications for permits 
authorizing activity codes 1 through 9 are available from, and should be 
submitted to, DOS, OES/

[[Page 64]]

OMC, Washington, DC 20520. Applications for FFV permits authorizing 
activity code 10 may be submitted by any person to the Assistant 
Administrator. Applications for permits authorizing activity code 10 are 
available from NMFS, Attn: Office of International Affairs, 1315 East 
West Highway, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910. All applicants should allow 
90 days for review and comment by the public, involved governmental 
agencies, and appropriate Councils and for processing before the 
anticipated date to begin fishing. The permit application fee must be 
paid at the time of application according to Sec. 600.518.
    (2) Applicants must provide complete and accurate information 
requested on the permit application form.
    (3) Applicants for FFV's that will support U.S. vessels in joint 
ventures (Activity Code 4) must provide the additional information 
specified by the permit application form.
    (4) Each applicant may request to substitute one FFV for another of 
the same flag by submitting a new application form and a short 
explanation of the reason for the substitution to the appropriate 
address listed at paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Each substitution is 
considered a new application, and a new application fee must be paid. 
NMFS will promptly process an application for a vessel replacing a 
permitted FFV that is disabled or decommissioned, once the appropriate 
Council(s) and governmental agencies have been notified of the 
substituted application.
    (e) Issuance. (1) Permits may be issued to an FFV by the Assistant 
Administrator after--
    (i) The Assistant Administrator determines that the fishing 
described in the application will meet the requirements of the Magnuson-
Stevens Act and approves the permit application.
    (ii) The applicant has paid the fees and provided any assurances 
required by the Secretary in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 
600.518.
    (iii) The applicant has appointed an agent.
    (iv) The applicant has identified a designated representative.
    (v) The applicant has accepted the general ``conditions and 
restrictions'' of receiving permits, as required by section 204(b)(7) of 
the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and any ``additional restrictions'' attached 
to the permit for the conservation and management of fishery resources 
or for the prevention of significant impairment of the national defense 
or security interests.
    (2) The DOS will provide permits for activity codes 1 through 9 to 
the official representative of the applicant foreign nation. The 
Assistant Administrator will provide permits for activity code 10 
directly to the applicant.
    (3) An approved permit will contain--
    (i) The name and IRCS of the FFV and its permit number.
    (ii) The permitted fisheries and/or activity codes.
    (iii) The date of issuance and expiration date, if other than 
December 31.
    (iv) All conditions and restrictions, and any additional 
restrictions and technical modifications appended to the permit.
    (4) Permits are not issued for boats that are launched from larger 
vessels. Any enforcement action that results from the activities of a 
launched boat will be taken against the permitted vessel.
    (f) Duration. A permit is valid from its date of issuance to its 
date of expiration, unless it is revoked or suspended or the nation 
issuing the FFV's documents does not accept amendments to the permit 
made by the Assistant Administrator in accordance with the procedures of 
paragraph (l) of this section. The permit will be valid for no longer 
than the calendar year in which it was issued.
    (g) Transfer. Permits are not transferable or assignable. A permit 
is valid only for the FFV to which it is issued.
    (h) Display. Each FFV operator must have a properly completed permit 
form available on board the FFV when engaged in fishing activities and 
must produce it at the request of an authorized officer or observer.
    (i) Suspension and revocation. NMFS may apply sanctions to an FFV's 
permit by revoking, suspending, or imposing additional permit 
restrictions on the permit under 15 CFR part 904, if the vessel is 
involved in the commission of any violation of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, 
the GIFA, or this subpart; if an

[[Page 65]]

agent and a designated representative are not maintained in the United 
States; if a civil penalty or criminal fine imposed under the Magnuson-
Stevens Act has become overdue; or as otherwise specified in the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (j) Fees. Permit application fees are described in Sec. 600.518.
    (k) Change in application information. The applicant must report, in 
writing, any change in the information supplied under paragraph (d) of 
this section to the Assistant Administrator within 15 calendar days 
after the date of the change. Failure to report a change in the 
ownership from that described in the current application within the 
specified time frame voids the permit, and all penalties involved will 
accrue to the previous owner.
    (l) Permit amendments. (1) The Assistant Administrator may amend a 
permit by adding ``additional restrictions'' for the conservation and 
management of fishery resources covered by the permit, or for the 
national defense or security if the Assistant Administrator determines 
that such interests would be significantly impaired without such 
restrictions. Compliance with the added additional restrictions is a 
condition of the permit. Violations of added additional restrictions 
will be treated as violations of this subpart.
    (2) The Assistant Administrator may make proposed additional 
restrictions effective immediately, if necessary, to prevent substantial 
harm to a fishery resource of the United States, to allow for the 
continuation of ongoing fishing operations, or to allow for fishing to 
begin at the normal time for opening of the fishery.
    (3) The Assistant Administrator will send proposed additional 
restrictions to each Nation whose vessels are affected (via the 
Secretary of State), to the appropriate Councils, and to the Commandant 
of the Coast Guard. NMFS will, at the same time, publish a document of 
any significant proposed additional restrictions in the Federal 
Register. The document will include a summary of the reasons underlying 
the proposal, and the reasons that any proposed additional restrictions 
are made effective immediately.
    (4) The Nation whose vessels are involved, the owners of the 
affected vessels, their representatives, the agencies specified in 
paragraph (l)(3) of this section, and the public may submit written 
comments on the proposed additional restrictions within 30 days after 
publication in the Federal Register.
    (5) The Assistant Administrator will make a final decision regarding 
the proposed additional restrictions as soon as practicable after the 
end of the comment period. The Assistant Administrator will provide the 
final additional restrictions to the Nation whose vessels are affected 
(via the Secretary of State) according to the procedures of paragraph 
(e) of this section. The Assistant Administrator will include with the 
final additional restrictions to the Nation, a response to comments 
submitted.
    (6) Additional restrictions may be modified by following the 
procedures of paragraphs (l)(2) through (l)(5) of this section.

Sec. 600.502  Vessel reports.

    (a) The operator of each FFV must report the FFV's activities to the 
USCG and NMFS as specified in this section.
    (b) All reports required by this section must be in English and in 
the formats specified in the permit additions and restrictions. Reports 
must be delivered via private or commercial communications facilities, 
facsimile, or other electronic means acceptable to NMFS and the USCG, 
directly to the appropriate NMFS Region or Center and USCG commander. 
Weekly reports must also be delivered directly to the appropriate NMFS 
Region or Center (see tables 1 and 2 of this section). (The required 
reports may be delivered to the closest USCG communication station as 
indicated in table 3 of this section or other USCG communication station 
only if adequate private or commercial communications facilities have 
not been successfully contacted.) Radio reports must be made via 
radiotelegraphy, Telex, or facsimile where

[[Page 66]]

available. For the purposes of this section, a message is considered 
``transmitted'' when its receipt is acknowledged by a communications 
facility and considered ``delivered'' upon its receipt by the offices of 
the appropriate USCG commander, NMFS Regional Office, or NMFS Center 
identified in table 2 of this section. Reports required by this section 
may be submitted by the vessel's designated representative; however, the 
operator of the FFV is responsible for the correct and timely filing of 
all required reports.
    (c) Activity reports. The operator of each FFV must report the FFV's 
movements and activities before or upon the event, as specified in this 
paragraph (c). Appropriate forms, instructions, codes, and examples are 
contained in the conditions and restrictions of the FFV's permit. Each 
FFV report must contain the following information: The message 
identifier ``VESREP'' to indicate it is a vessel activity report, FFV 
name, international radio call sign IRCS, date (month and day based on 
GMT), time (hour and minute GMT), position (latitude and longitude to 
the nearest degree and minute) where required, area (by fishing area 
code) where required, the appropriate action code, confirmation codes 
where required, and the other information specified in paragraphs (c)(1) 
through (c)(11) of this section.
    (1) ``BEGIN''. Each operator must specify the date, time, position, 
and area the FFV will actually ``BEGIN'' fishing in the EEZ and the 
species (by species code), product (by product code), and quantity of 
all fish and fish products (by product weight to the nearest hundredth 
of a metric ton) on board when entering the EEZ (action code ``BEGIN''). 
The message must be delivered at least 24 hours before the vessel begins 
to fish.
    (2) ``DEPART''. Each operator must specify the date, time, position, 
and area the FFV will ``DEPART'' the EEZ to embark or debark an 
observer, to visit a U.S. port, to conduct a joint venture in internal 
waters, or to otherwise temporarily leave an authorized fishing area, 
but not depart the seaward limit of the EEZ (action code ``DEPART''). 
The message must be transmitted before the FFV departs the present 
fishing area and delivered within 24 hours of its transmittal.
    (3) ``RETURN''. Each operator must specify the date, time, position, 
and area the FFV will ``RETURN'' to the EEZ following a temporary 
departure, and the species (by species code), product (by product code), 
and quantity of all fish and fish products (by product weight to the 
nearest hundredth of a metric ton) on board that were received in a 
joint venture in internal waters (action code ``RETURN''). The message 
must be transmitted before returning to the EEZ and delivered within 24 
hours of its transmittal.
    (4) ``SHIFT''. Each operator must report each SHIFT in fishing area 
(as described for each fishery) by specifying the date, time, and 
position the FFV will start fishing, and the new area (action code 
``SHIFT''). The message must be transmitted before leaving the original 
area and delivered within 24 hours of its transmittal. If a foreign 
vessel operates within 20 nautical miles (37.04 km) of a fishing area 
boundary, its operator may submit in one message the shift reports for 
all fishing area shifts occurring during 1 fishing day (0001-2400 GMT). 
This message must be transmitted prior to the last shift expected to be 
made in the day and delivered within 24 hours of its transmittal.
    (5) ``JV OPS''. Each operator must specify the date, time, position, 
and area at which the FFV will ``START'' joint venture operations 
(action code ``START JV OPS'') or ``END'' joint venture operations 
(action code ``END JV OPS''). These reports must be made in addition to 
other activity reports made under this section. Each message must be 
transmitted before the event and delivered within 24 hours of its 
transmittal.
    (6) ``TRANSFER''. The operator of each FFV that anticipates a 
transshipping operation in which the FFV will receive fish or fisheries 
products must specify the date, time, position and area the FFV will 
conduct the ``TRANSFER'' and the name and IRCS of the other FFV or U.S. 
vessel involved (action code ``TRANSFER''). The report must include the 
permit activity code under which the transfer will be made. The message 
must be transmitted prior to the transfer and

[[Page 67]]

delivered within 24 hours of its transmittal. The movement of raw fish 
from a permitted foreign catching vessel or, under an Activity Code 4, 
from a U.S. fishing vessel to the reporting processing vessel and the 
return of nets or codends is not considered a transfer.
    (7) ``OFFLOADED''. Each operator must specify the date, time, 
position, and area the FFV ``OFFLOADED'' fish or fisheries products TO 
another FFV or a U.S. vessel in a transfer, the other FFV's or U.S. 
vessel's name, IRCS, Permit Activity Code under which the transfer was 
made, species (by species code) and quantity of fish and fisheries 
products (by product code and by product weight, to the nearest 
hundredth of a metric ton) offloaded (action code ``OFFLOADED TO''). The 
message must be transmitted within 12 hours after the transfer is 
completed and delivered within 24 hours of its transmittal and before 
the FFV ceases fishing in the EEZ.
    (8) ``RECEIVED''. Each operator must specify the date, time, 
position and area the vessel ``RECEIVED'' fish or fisheries products 
FROM another FFV in a transfer, the other FFV's or U.S. vessel's name, 
IRCS, Permit Activity Code under which the receipt was made, species (by 
species code) and quantity of fish and fisheries products (by product 
code and by product weight, to the nearest hundredth of a metric ton) 
received (action code ``RECEIVED FROM''). The message must be 
transmitted within 12 hours after the transfer is completed and 
delivered within 24 hours of its transmittal and before the vessel 
ceases fishing in the EEZ.
    (9) ``CEASE''. Each operator must specify the date, time, position, 
and area the FFV will ``CEASE'' fishing in order to leave the EEZ 
(action code ``CEASE''). The message must be delivered at least 24 hours 
before the FFV's departure.
    (10) ``CHANGE''. Each operator must report any ``CHANGE'' TO the 
FFV's operations if the position or time of an event specified in an 
activity report will vary more than 5 nautical miles (9.26 km) or 4 
hours from that previously reported, by sending a revised message 
inserting the word ``CHANGE'' in front of the previous report, repeating 
the name, IRCS, date, and time of the previous report, adding the word 
``TO'' and the complete revised text of the new report (action code 
``CHANGE TO''). Changes to reports specifying an early beginning of 
fishing by an FFV or other changes to reports contained in paragraphs 
(c)(1) through (c)(9) of this section must be transmitted and delivered 
as if the ``CHANGE'' report were the original message.
    (11) ``CANCEL''. Each operator wanting to ``CANCEL'' a previous 
report may do so by sending a revised message, and inserting the word 
``CANCEL'' in front of the previous report's vessel name, IRCS, date, 
time and action code canceled (action code ``CANCEL''). The message must 
be transmitted and delivered prior to the date and time of the event in 
the original message.
    (d) The operator of an FFV will be in violation of paragraphs (c)(1) 
through (c)(9) of this section if the FFV does not pass within 5 
nautical miles (9.26 km) of the position given in the report within 4 
hours of the time given in the report.
    (e) The notices required by this section may be provided for 
individual or groups of FFV's (on a vessel-by-vessel basis) by 
authorized persons. An FFV operator may retransmit reports on the behalf 
of another FFV, if authorized by that FFV's operator. This does not 
relieve the individual vessel operator of the responsibility of filing 
required reports. In these cases, the message format should be modified 
so that each line of text under ``VESREP'' is a separate vessel report.
    (f) Weekly reports. (1) The operator of each FFV in the EEZ must 
submit appropriate weekly reports through the Nation's designated 
representative. The report must arrive at the address and time specified 
in paragraph (g) of this section. The reports may be sent by facsimile 
or Telex, but a completed copy of the report form must be mailed or hand 
delivered to confirm the Telex. Appropriate forms, instructions, codes, 
and examples are contained in the conditions and restrictions of the 
FFV's permit. Designated representatives may include more than one 
vessel report in a facsimile or Telex message, if

[[Page 68]]

the information is submitted on a vessel-by-vessel basis. Requests for 
corrections to previous reports must be submitted through the Nation's 
designated representative and mailed or hand-delivered, together with a 
written explanation of the reasons for the errors. The appropriate 
Regional Administrator or Science and Research Director may accept or 
reject any correction and initiate any appropriate civil penalty 
actions.
    (2) Weekly catch report (CATREP). The operator of each FFV must 
submit a weekly catch report stating any catch (Activity Code 1) in 
round weight of each species or species group allocated to that Nation 
by area and days fished in each area for the weekly period Sunday 
through Saturday, GMT, as modified by the fishery in which the FFV is 
engaged. Foreign vessels delivering unsorted, unprocessed fish to a 
processing vessel are not required to submit CATREP's, if that 
processing vessel (Activity Code 2) submits consolidated CATREP's for 
all fish received during each weekly period. No report is required for 
FFV's that do not catch or receive foreign-caught fish during the 
reporting period.
    (3) Weekly receipts report (RECREP). The operator of each FFV must 
submit a weekly report stating any receipts of U.S.-harvested fish in a 
joint venture (Activity Code 4) for the weekly period Sunday through 
Saturday, GMT, as modified by the fishery in which the FFV is engaged, 
for each fishing area, by authorized or prohibited species or species 
group; days fish received; round weight retained or returned to the U.S. 
fishing vessel; number of codends received; and number of vessels 
transferring codends. The report must also include the names of U.S. 
fishing vessels transferring codends during the week. No report is 
required for FFV's that do not receive any U.S.-harvested fish during 
the reporting period.
    (4) Marine mammal report (MAMREP). The operator of each FFV must 
submit a weekly report stating any incidental catch or receipt of marine 
mammals (Activity Codes 1 or 2 and/or 4), the geographical position 
caught, the condition of the animal, number caught (if more than one of 
the same species and condition), and nationality of the catching vessel 
for the period Sunday through Saturday, GMT, as modified by the fishery 
in which the vessel is engaged. Foreign catching vessels delivering 
unsorted, unprocessed fish to processing vessel are not required to 
submit MAMREP's, provided that the processing or factory vessel 
(Activity Code 2) submits consolidated MAMREP's for all fish received 
during each weekly period. FFV's receiving U.S.-harvested fish in a 
joint venture (Activity Code 4) must submit consolidated reports for 
U.S. vessels operating in the joint venture. No report is required for 
FFV's that do not catch or receive marine mammals during the reporting 
period.
    (g) Submission instructions for weekly reports. The designated 
representative for each FFV must submit weekly reports in the prescribed 
format to the appropriate Regional Administrator or Science and Research 
Director of NMFS by 1900 GMT on the Wednesday following the end of the 
reporting period. However, by agreement with the appropriate Regional 
Administrator or Science and Research Director, the designated 
representative may submit weekly reports to some other facility of NMFS.
    (h) Alternative reporting procedures. As an alternative to the use 
of the specific procedures provided, an applicant may submit proposed 
reporting procedures for a general type of fishery operation (i.e., 
transshipments under Activity Code 10) to the appropriate Regional 
Administrator and the USCG commander (see tables 1 and 2 to Sec. 
600.502 of this chapter). With the agreement of the USCG commander, the 
Regional Administrator may authorize the use of alternative reporting 
procedures.

Sec. 600.503  Vessel and gear identification.

    (a) Vessel identification. (1) The operator of each FFV assigned an 
IRCS must display that call sign amidships on both the port and 
starboard sides of the deckhouse or hull, so that it is visible from an 
enforcement vessel, and on an appropriate weather deck so it is visible 
from the air.
    (2) The operator of each FFV not assigned an IRCS, such as a small 
trawler associated with a mothership or one of a pair of trawlers, must 
display the IRCS of the associated vessel, followed by a numerical 
suffix. (For example, JCZM-1, JCZM-2, etc., would be displayed on small 
trawlers not assigned an IRCS operating with a mothership whose IRCS is 
JCZM; JANP-1 would be displayed by a pair trawler not assigned an IRCS 
operating with a trawler whose IRCS is JANP.)
    (3) The vessel identification must be in a color in contrast to the 
background and must be permanently affixed to the FFV in block Roman 
alphabet letters and Arabic numerals at least 1 m in height for FFV's 
over 20 m in length, and at least 0.5 m in height for all other FFV's.
    (b) Navigational lights and shapes. Each FFV must display the lights 
and shapes prescribed by the International Regulations for Preventing 
Collisions at Sea, 1972 (TIAS 8587, and 1981 amendment TIAS 10672), for 
the activity in which the FFV is engaged (as described at 33 CFR part 
81).
    (c) Gear identification. (1) The operator of each FFV must ensure 
that all deployed fishing gear that is not physically and continuously 
attached to an FFV:
    (i) Is clearly marked at the surface with a buoy displaying the 
vessel identification of the FFV (see paragraph (a) of this section) to 
which the gear belongs.
    (ii) Has attached a light visible for 2 nautical miles (3.70 km) at 
night in good visibility.
    (iii) Has a radio buoy.
    Trawl codends passed from one vessel to another are considered 
continuously attached gear and are not required to be marked.
    (2) The operator of each FFV must ensure that deployed longlines, 
strings of traps or pots, and gillnets are marked at the surface at each 
terminal end with: (see paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iii) of this 
section).
    (3) Additional requirements may be specified for the fishery in 
which the vessel is engaged.
    (4) Unmarked or incorrectly identified fishing gear may be 
considered abandoned and may be disposed of in accordance with 
applicable Federal regulations by any authorized officer.
    (d) Maintenance. The operator of each FFV must--
    (1) Keep the vessel and gear identification clearly legible and in 
good repair.
    (2) Ensure that nothing on the FFV obstructs the view of the 
markings from an enforcement vessel or aircraft.

[[Page 71]]

    (3) Ensure that the proper navigational lights and shapes are 
displayed for the FFV's activity and are properly functioning.

Sec. 600.504  Facilitation of enforcement.

    (a) General. (1) The owner, operator, or any person aboard any FFV 
subject to this subpart must immediately comply with instructions and 
signals issued by an authorized officer to stop the FFV; to move the FFV 
to a specified location; and to facilitate safe boarding and inspection 
of the vessel, its gear, equipment, records, and fish and fish products 
on board for purposes of enforcing the Magnuson-Stevens Act and this 
subpart.
    (2) The operator of each FFV must provide vessel position or other 
information when requested by an authorized officer within the time 
specified in the request.
    (b) Communications equipment. (1) Each FFV must be equipped with a 
VHF-FM radiotelephone station located so that it may be operated from 
the wheelhouse. Each operator must maintain a continuous listening watch 
on channel 16 (156.8 mHz).
    (2) Each FFV must be equipped with a radiotelephone station capable 
of communicating via 2182 kHz (SSB) radiotelephony and at least one set 
of working frequencies identified in table 3 to Sec. 600.502 
appropriate to the fishery in which the FFV is operating. Each operator 
must monitor and be ready to communicate via 2182 kHz (SSB) 
radiotelephone each day from 0800 GMT to 0830 GMT and 2000 to 2030 GMT, 
and in preparation for boarding.
    (3) FFV's that are not equipped with processing facilities and that 
deliver all catches to a foreign processing vessel are exempt from the 
requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (4) FFV's with no IRCS that do not catch fish and are used as 
auxiliary vessels to handle codends, nets, equipment, or passengers for 
a processing vessel are exempt from the requirements of paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.
    (5) The appropriate Regional Administrator, with the agreement of 
the appropriate USCG commander, may, upon request by a foreign nation, 
accept alternatives to the radio requirements of this section to certain 
FFV's or types of FFV's operating in a fishery, provided they are 
adequate for the communications needs of the fishery.
    (c) Communications procedures. (1) Upon being approached by a USCG 
vessel or aircraft, or other vessel or aircraft with an authorized 
officer aboard, the operator of any FFV subject to this subpart must be 
alert for communications conveying enforcement instructions. The 
enforcement unit may communicate by channel 16 VHF-FM radiotelephone, 
2182 kHz (SSB) radiotelephone, message block from an aircraft, flashing 
light or flag signals from the International Code of Signals, hand 
signal, placard, loudhailer, or other appropriate means. The following 
signals, extracted from the International Code of Signals, are among 
those that may be used.
    (i) ``AA, AA, AA, etc.'', which is the call for an unknown station. 
The signaled vessel should respond by identifying itself or by 
illuminating the vessel identification required by Sec. 600.505.
    (ii) ``RY-CY'', meaning ``You should proceed at slow speed, a boat 
is coming to you''.
    (iii) ``SQ3'', meaning ``You should stop or heave to; I am going to 
board you''.
    (iv) ``L'', meaning ``You should stop your vessel instantly.''
    (2) Failure of an FFV's operator to stop the vessel when directed to 
do so by an authorized officer using VHF-FM radiotelephone (channel 16), 
2182 kHz (SSB) radiotelephone (where required), message block from an 
aircraft, flashing light signal, flaghoist, or loudhailer constitutes a 
violation of this subpart.
    (3) The operator of or any person aboard an FFV who does not 
understand a signal from an enforcement unit and who is unable to obtain 
clarification by radiotelephone or other means must consider the signal 
to be a command to stop the FFV instantly.
    (d) Boarding. The operator of an FFV signaled for boarding must--
    (1) Monitor 2182 kHz (SSB) radiotelephone and channel 16 (156.8 mHz) 
VHF-FM radiotelephone.
    (2) Stop immediately and lay to or maneuver in such a way as to 
maintain the safety of the FFV and facilitate

[[Page 72]]

boarding by the authorized officer and the boarding party or an 
observer.
    (3) Provide the authorized officer, boarding party, or observer a 
safe pilot ladder. The operator must ensure the pilot ladder is securely 
attached to the FFV and meets the construction requirements of 
Regulation 17, Chapter V of the International Convention for the Safety 
of Life at Sea (SOLAS), 1974 (TIAS 9700 and 1978 Protocol, TIAS 10009), 
or a substantially equivalent national standard approved by letter from 
the Assistant Administrator, with agreement with the USCG. Safe pilot 
ladder standards are summarized below:
    (i) The ladder must be of a single length of not more than 9 m (30 
ft), capable of reaching the water from the point of access to the FFV, 
accounting for all conditions of loading and trim of the FFV and for an 
adverse list of 15[deg]. Whenever the distance from sea level to the 
point of access to the ship is more than 9 m (30 ft), access must be by 
means of an accommodation ladder or other safe and convenient means.
    (ii) The steps of the pilot ladder must be--
    (A) Of hardwood, or other material of equivalent properties, made in 
one piece free of knots, having an efficient non-slip surface; the four 
lowest steps may be made of rubber of sufficient strength and stiffness 
or of other suitable material of equivalent characteristics.
    (B) Not less than 480 mm (19 inches) long, 115 mm (4.5 inches) wide, 
and 25 mm (1 inch) in depth, excluding any non-slip device.
    (C) Equally spaced not less than 300 millimeters (12 inches) nor 
more than 380 mm (15 inches) apart and secured in such a manner that 
they will remain horizontal.
    (iii) No pilot ladder may have more than two replacement steps that 
are secured in position by a method different from that used in the 
original construction of the ladder.
    (iv) The side ropes of the ladder must consist of two uncovered 
manila ropes not less than 60 mm (2.25 inches) in circumference on each 
side (or synthetic ropes of equivalent size and equivalent or greater 
strength). Each rope must be continuous, with no joints below the top 
step.
    (v) Battens made of hardwood, or other material of equivalent 
properties, in one piece and not less than 1.80 m (5 ft 10 inches) long 
must be provided at such intervals as will prevent the pilot ladder from 
twisting. The lowest batten must be on the fifth step from the bottom of 
the ladder and the interval between any batten and the next must not 
exceed nine steps.
    (vi) Where passage onto or off the ship is by means of a bulwark 
ladder, two handhold stanchions must be fitted at the point of boarding 
or leaving the FFV not less than 0.70 m (2 ft 3 inches) nor more than 
0.80 m (2 ft 7 inches) apart, not less than 40 mm (2.5 inches) in 
diameter, and must extend not less than 1.20 m (3 ft 11 inches) above 
the top of the bulwark.
    (4) When necessary to facilitate the boarding or when requested by 
an authorized officer or observer, provide a manrope, safety line, and 
illumination for the ladder; and
    (5) Take such other actions as necessary to ensure the safety of the 
authorized officer and the boarding party and to facilitate the boarding 
and inspection.
    (e) Access and records. (1) The owner and operator of each FFV must 
provide authorized officers access to all spaces where work is conducted 
or business papers and records are prepared or stored, including but not 
limited to, personal quarters and areas within personal quarters.
    (2) The owner and operator of each FFV must provide to authorized 
officers all records and documents pertaining to the fishing activities 
of the vessel, including but not limited to, production records, fishing 
logs, navigation logs, transfer records, product receipts, cargo stowage 
plans or records, draft or displacement calculations, customs documents 
or records, and an accurate hold plan reflecting the current structure 
of the vessel's storage and factory spaces.
    (f) Product storage. The operator of each permitted FFV storing fish 
or fish products in a storage space must ensure that all non-fish 
product items are neither stowed beneath nor covered by

[[Page 73]]

fish products, unless required to maintain the stability and safety of 
the vessel. These items include, but are not limited to, portable 
conveyors, exhaust fans, ladders, nets, fuel bladders, extra bin boards, 
or other movable non-product items. These items may be in the space when 
necessary for safety of the vessel or crew or for storage of the 
product. Lumber, bin boards, or other dunnage may be used for shoring or 
bracing of product to ensure safety of crew and to prevent shifting of 
cargo within the space.

service and preparation areas and work spaces aboard the vessel.
    (e) Observer transfers. (1) The operator of the FFV must ensure that 
transfers of observers at sea via small boat or raft are carried out 
during daylight hours as weather and sea conditions allow, and with the 
agreement of the observer involved. The FFV operator must provide the 
observer 3 hours advance notice of at-sea transfers, so that the 
observer may collect personal belongings, equipment, and scientific 
samples.
    (2) The FFV's involved must provide a safe pilot ladder and conduct 
the transfer according to the procedures of Sec. 600.504(d) to ensure 
the safety of the during the transfer.
    (3) An experienced crew member must assist the observer in the small 
boat or raft in which the transfer is made.
    (f) Supplementary observers. In the event funds are not available 
from Congressional appropriations of fees collected to assign an 
observer to a foreign fishing vessel, the appropriate Regional 
Administrator or Science and Research Director will assign a 
supplementary observer to that vessel. The costs of supplementary 
observers will be paid for by the owners and operators of foreign 
fishing vessels as provided for in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (g) Supplementary observer authority and duties. (1) A supplementary 
observer aboard a foreign fishing vessel has the same authority and must 
be treated in all respects as an observer who is employed by NMFS, 
either directly or under contract.
    (2) The duties of supplementary observers and their deployment and 
work schedules will be specified by the appropriate Regional 
Administrator or Science and Research Director.
    (3) All data collected by supplementary observers will be under the 
exclusive control of the Assistant Administrator.
    (h) Supplementary observer payment--(1) Method of payment. The 
owners and operators of foreign fishing vessels must pay directly to the 
contractor the costs of supplementary observer coverage. Payment must be 
made to the contractor supplying supplementary observer coverage either 
by letter of credit or certified check drawn on a federally chartered 
bank in U.S. dollars, or other financial institution acceptable to the 
contractor. The letter of credit used to pay supplementary observer fees 
to contractors must be separate and distinct from the letter of credit 
required by Sec. 600.518(b)(2). Billing schedules will be specified by 
the terms of the contract between NOAA and the contractors. Billings for 
supplementary observer coverage will be approved by the appropriate 
Regional Administrator or Science and Research Director and then 
transmitted to the owners and operators of foreign fishing vessels by 
the appropriate designated representative. Each country will have only 
one designated representative to receive observer bills for all vessels 
of that country, except as provided for by the Assistant Administrator. 
All bills must be paid within 10 working days of the billing date. 
Failure to pay an observer bill will constitute grounds to revoke 
fishing permits. All fees collected under this section will be 
considered interim in nature and subject to reconciliation at the end of 
the fiscal year in accordance with paragraph (h)(4) of this section and 
Sec. 600.518(d).
    (2) Contractor costs. The costs charged for supplementary observer 
coverage to the owners and operators of foreign fishing vessels may not 
exceed the costs charged to NMFS for the same or similar services, 
except that contractors may charge to the owners and operators of 
foreign fishing vessels an additional fee to cover the administrative 
costs of the program not ordinarily part of contract costs charged to 
NMFS. The costs charged foreign fishermen for supplementary observers 
may include, but are not limited to the following:
    (i) Salary and benefits, including overtime, for supplementary 
observers.
    (ii) The costs of post-certification training required by paragraph 
(j)(2) of this section.
    (iii) The costs of travel, transportation, and per diem associated 
with deploying supplementary observers to foreign fishing vessels 
including the

[[Page 77]]

cost of travel, transportation, and per diem from the supplementary 
observer's post of duty to the point of embarkation to the foreign 
fishing vessel, and then from the point of disembarkation to the post of 
duty from where the trip began. For the purposes of these regulations, 
the appropriate Regional Administrator or Science and Research Director 
will designate posts of duty for supplementary observers.
    (iv) The costs of travel, transportation, and per diem associated 
with the debriefing following deployment of a supplementary observer by 
NMFS officials.
    (v) The administrative and overhead costs incurred by the contractor 
and, if appropriate, a reasonable profit.
    (3) NMFS costs. The owners and operators of foreign fishing vessels 
must also pay to NMFS as part of the surcharge required by section 
201(i)(4) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the following costs:
    (i) The costs of certifying applicants for the position of 
supplementary observer.
    (ii) The costs of any equipment, including safety equipment, 
sampling equipment, operations manuals, or other texts necessary to 
perform the duties of a supplementary observer. The equipment will be 
specified by the appropriate Regional Administrator or Science and 
Research Director according to the requirements of the fishery to which 
the supplementary observer will be deployed.
    (iii) The costs associated with communications with supplementary 
observers for transmission of data and routine messages.
    (iv) For the purposes of monitoring the supplementary observer 
program, the costs for the management and analysis of data.
    (v) The costs for data editing and entry.
    (vi) Any costs incurred by NMFS to train, deploy or debrief a 
supplementary observer.
    (vii) The cost for U.S. Customs inspection for supplementary 
observers disembarking after deployment.
    (4) Reconciliation. Fees collected by the contractor in excess of 
the actual costs of supplementary observer coverage will be refunded to 
the owners and operators of foreign fishing vessels, or kept on deposit 
to defray the costs of future supplementary observer coverage. Refunds 
will be made within 60 days after final costs are determined and 
approved by NMFS.
    (i) Supplementary observer contractors--(1) Contractor eligibility. 
Supplementary observers will be obtained by NMFS from persons or firms 
having established contracts to provide NMFS with observers. In the 
event no such contract is in place, NMFS will use established, 
competitive contracting procedures to select persons or firms to provide 
supplementary observers. The services supplied by the supplementary 
observer contractors will be as described within the contract and as 
specified below.
    (2) Supplementary observer contractors must submit for the approval 
of the Assistant Administrator the following:
    (i) A copy of any contract, including all attachments, amendments, 
and enclosures thereto, between the contractor and the owners and 
operators of foreign fishing vessels for whom the contractor will 
provide supplementary observer services.
    (ii) All application information for persons whom the contractor 
desires to employ as certified supplementary observers.
    (iii) Billing schedules and billings to the owners and operators of 
foreign fishing vessels for further transmission to the designated 
representative of the appropriate foreign nation.
    (iv) All data on costs.
    (j) Supplementary observers--certification, training--(1)

education or experience required of persons used as observers by NMFS as 
either Federal personnel or contract employees. The education and 
experience required for certification may vary according to the 
requirements of managing the foreign fishery in which the supplementary 
observer is to be deployed.

[[Page 78]]

Documentation of U.S. citizenship or nationality, and education or 
experience will be provided from personal qualification statements on 
file with NMFS contractors who provide supplementary observer services, 
and will not require the submission of additional information to NMFS.
    (2) Training. Prior to deployment to foreign fishing vessels, 
certified supplementary observers must also meet the following 
conditions:
    (i) Each certified supplementary observer must satisfactorily 
complete a course of training approved by the appropriate Regional 
Administrator or Science and Research Director as equivalent to that 
received by persons used as observers by NMFS as either Federal 
personnel or contract employees. The course of training may vary 
according to the foreign fishery in which the supplementary observer is 
to be deployed.
    (ii) Each certified supplementary observer must agree in writing to 
abide by standards of conduct as set forth in Department of Commerce 
Administrative Order 202-735 (as provided by the contractor).
    (k) Supplementary observer certification suspension or revocation. 
(1) Certification of a supplementary observer may be suspended or 
revoked by the Assistant Administrator under the following conditions:
    (i) A supplementary observer fails to perform the duties specified 
in paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
    (ii) A supplementary observer fails to abide by the standards of 
conduct described by Department of Commerce Administrative Order 202-
735.
    (2) The suspension or revocation of the certification of a 
supplementary observer by the Assistant Administrator may be based on 
the following:
    (i) Boarding inspection reports by authorized officers of the USCG 
or NMFS, or other credible information, that indicate a supplementary 
observer has failed to abide by the established standards of conduct; or
    (ii) An analysis by NMFS of the data collected by a supplementary 
observer indicating improper or incorrect data collection or recording. 
The failure to properly collect or record data is sufficient to justify 
decertification of supplementary observers; no intent to defraud need be 
demonstrated.
    (3) The Assistant Administrator will notify the supplementary 
observer, in writing, of the Assistant Administrator's intent to suspend 
or revoke certification, and the reasons therefor, and provide the 
supplementary observer a reasonable opportunity to respond. If the 
Assistant Administrator determines that there are disputed questions of 
material fact, then the Assistant Administrator may in this respect 
appoint an examiner to make an informal fact-finding inquiry and prepare 
a report and recommendations.

(disposition ``C'' or ``M'') must be based on the most accurate method 
available to the vessel, either scale round weights or factory weights 
converted to round weights. Entries for daily and cumulative weights of 
discarded or returned fish (disposition ``D'' or ``R'') must be based on 
the most accurate method available to the vessel, either actual count, 
scale round weight, or estimated deck weights. Entries for product 
weights must be based on the number of production units (pans, boxes, 
blocks, trays, cans, or bags) and the average weight of the production 
unit, with reasonable allowances for water added. Allowances for water 
added cannot exceed 5 percent of the unit weight. Product weights cannot 
be based on the commercial or arbitrary wholesale weight of the product, 
but must be based on the total actual weight of the product as 
determined by representative samples.
    (3) The owner or operator must make all entries in indelible ink, 
with corrections to be accomplished by lining out and rewriting, rather 
than erasure.
    (i) Alternative log formats. As an alternative to the use of the 
specific formats provided, a Nation may submit a proposed log format for 
FFV's of that Nation for a general type of fishery operation in a 
fishery (i.e., joint venture operations) to the appropriate Regional 
Administrator and the USCG commander (see tables 1 and 2 to Sec. 
600.502). With the agreement of the USCG commander, the Regional 
Administrator may authorize the use of that log format for vessels of 
the requesting Nation.

Sec. 600.508  Fishing operations.

    (a) Catching. Each FFV authorized for activity code 1 may catch 
fish. An FFV may retain its catch of any species or species group for 
which there is an unfilled national allocation. All fish caught will be 
counted against the national allocation, even if the fish are discarded, 
unless exempted by the regulations of the fishery in which the

[[Page 82]]

FFV is engaged. Catching operations may be conducted as specified by the 
regulations of the fishery in which the FFV is engaged and as modified 
by the FFV's permit.
    (b) Scouting. Each FFV authorized for Activity Codes 1 through 6 may 
scout for fish. Scouting may be conducted only in the fisheries area 
authorized by the scouting vessel's permit and under such other 
circumstances as may be designated in this subpart or the permit.
    (c) Processing. Each FFV with Activity Code 1 or 2 may process fish. 
Processing may only be conducted whenever and wherever catching 
operations for FFV's of that Nation are permitted, whenever and wherever 
joint venture operations are authorized by an FFV's permit under 
Activity Code 4, and under such other circumstances as may be designated 
in this subpart or the permit.
    (d) Support. Each FFV with Activity Codes 1, 2, 3, 5, or 8 may 
support other permitted FFV's. Each FFV with Activity Codes 4 or 6 may 
support U.S. vessels. Support operations may be conducted only in the 
fisheries areas authorized by the supporting vessel's permit, and under 
such other circumstances as may be designated in this subpart or the 
permit.
    (e) Joint ventures. Each FFV with Activity Code 4 in addition to 
Activity Codes 1 or 2 may also conduct operations with U.S. fishing 
vessels. These joint venture operations with U.S. fishing vessels may be 
conducted throughout the EEZ, and under such other circumstances as may 
be designated in these regulations or the permit. FFV's with activity 
code 4 may continue operations assisting U.S. fishing vessels, despite 
closures under Sec. 600.511(a).
    (f) Internal waters. For FFV's authorized under section 306(c) of 
the Magnuson-Stevens Act:
    (1) Each FFV may engage in fish processing and support of U.S. 
fishing vessels within the internal waters of that state in compliance 
with terms and conditions set by the authorizing Governor.
    (2) The owner or operator of each FFV must submit weekly reports on 
the amount of fish received from vessels of the United States and the 
location(s) where such fish were harvested.
    (i) Reports must include:
    (A) Vessel identification information for the FFV.
    (B) Date of each receipt of fish.
    (C) Amount of fish received, by species.
    (D) Location(s) from which the fish received were harvested and the 
name and official number of the vessel of the United States that 
harvested the fish.
    (ii) Owners or operators of FFV's processing fish in internal waters 
under the provisions of this paragraph (f) must request, from the 
Regional Administrator, the requirements regarding timing and submission 
of the reports, at least 15 days prior to the first receipt of fish from 
a vessel of the United States. The Regional Administrator shall 
stipulate the timing and submission requirements in writing.
    (g) Transshipping. Each FFV with Activity Code 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 
8, or 10 may transship in accordance with this subpart and the vessel's 
permit.

[61 FR 32540, June 24, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 27183, May 19, 1997; 62 
FR 34397, June 26, 1997; 64 FR 39020, July 21, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 600.509  Prohibited species.

    (a) The owner or operator of each FFV must minimize its catch or 
receipt of prohibited species.
    (b) After allowing for sampling by an observer (if any), the owner 
or operator of each FFV must sort its catch of fish received as soon as 
possible and return all prohibited species and species parts to the sea 
immediately with a minimum of injury, regardless of condition, unless a 
different procedure is specified by the regulations for the fishery in 
which the FFV is engaged. All prohibited species must be recorded in the 
daily fishing log and other fishing logs as specified by the regulations 
for the fishery in which the FFV is engaged.
    (c) All species of fish that an FFV has not been specifically 
allocated or authorized under this subpart to retain, including fish 
caught or received in excess of any allocation or authorization, are 
prohibited species.
    (d) It is a rebuttable presumption that any prohibited species or 
species part found on board an FFV was caught

[[Page 83]]

and retained in violation of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 600.510  Gear avoidance and disposal.

    (a) Vessel and gear avoidance. (1) FFV's arriving on fishing grounds 
where fishing vessels are already fishing or have set their gear for 
that purpose must ascertain the position and extent of gear already 
placed in the sea and must not place themselves or their fishing gear so 
as to interfere with or obstruct fishing operations already in progress. 
Vessels using mobile gear must avoid fixed fishing gear.
    (2) The operator of each FFV must maintain on its bridge a current 
plot of broadcast fixed-gear locations for the area in which it is 
fishing, as required by the regulations for the fishery in which the FFV 
is engaged.
    (b) Gear conflicts. The operator of each FFV that is involved in a 
conflict or that retrieves the gear of another vessel must immediately 
notify the appropriate USCG commander identified in tables 1 and 2 to 
Sec. 600.502 and request disposal instructions. Each report must 
include:
    (1) The name of the reporting vessel.
    (2) A description of the incident and articles retrieved, including 
the amount, type of gear, condition, and identification markings.
    (3) The location of the incident.
    (4) The date and time of the incident.
    (c) Disposal of fishing gear and other articles. (1) The operator of 
an FFV in the EEZ may not dump overboard, jettison or otherwise discard 
any article or substance that may interfere with other fishing vessels 
or gear, or that may catch fish or cause damage to any marine resource, 
including marine mammals and birds, except in cases of emergency 
involving the safety of the ship or crew, or as specifically authorized 
by communication from the appropriate USCG commander or other authorized 
officer. These articles and substances include, but are not limited to, 
fishing gear, net scraps, bale straps, plastic bags, oil drums, 
petroleum containers, oil, toxic chemicals or any manmade items 
retrieved in an FFV's gear.
    (2) The operator of an FFV may not abandon fishing gear in the EEZ.
    (3) If these articles or substances are encountered, or in the event 
of accidental or emergency placement into the EEZ, the vessel operator 
must immediately report the incident to the appropriate USCG Commander 
indicated in tables 1 and 2 to Sec. 600.502, and give the information 
required in paragraph (b) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 600.511  Fishery closure procedures.

    (a) Activity Codes 1 and 2 for a fishery are automatically canceled 
in the following cases, unless otherwise specified by regulations 
specific to a fishery, when--
    (1) The OY for any allocated species or species group has been 
reached in that fishery;
    (2) The TALFF or catch allowance for any allocated species or 
species group has been reached in that fishery;
    (3) The foreign nation's allocation for any allocated species or 
species group has been reached; or
    (4) The letter of credit required in Sec. 600.518(b)(2) is not 
established and maintained.
    (b) Activity Code 4 is automatically canceled when--
    (1) The OY for a species with a JVP amount is reached;
    (2) The JVP amount for a species or species group is reached; or
    (3) The letter of credit required in Sec. 600.518(b)(2) is not 
established and maintained.
    (c) Notification. (1) The Regional Administrator is authorized to 
close a fishery on behalf of NMFS. The Regional Administrator will 
notify each FFV's designated representative of closures.
    (2) If possible, notice will be given 48 hours before the closure. 
However, each Nation and the owners and operators of all FFV's of that 
Nation are responsible for ending fishing operations when an allocation 
is reached.
    (d) Catch reconciliation. Vessel activity reports, U.S. surveillance 
observations, observer reports, and foreign catch and effort reports 
will be used to make the determination listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section. If NMFS estimates of catch or other values made during 
the season differ from

[[Page 84]]

those reported by the foreign fleets, efforts may be initiated by the 
designated representative of each Nation to resolve such differences 
with NMFS. If, however, differences still persist after such efforts 
have been made, NMFS estimates will be the basis for decisions and will 
prevail.
    (e) Duration. Any closure under this section will remain in effect 
until an applicable new or increased allocation or JVP becomes available 
or the letter of credit required by Sec. 600.518(b)(2) is 
reestablished.

<R05>
Sec. 600.512  Scientific research.

    (a) Scientific research activity. Persons planning to conduct 
scientific research activities on board a scientific research vessel in 
the EEZ that may be confused with fishing are encouraged to submit to 
the appropriate Regional Administrator or Director, 60 days or as soon 
as practicable prior to its start, a scientific research plan for each 
scientific activity. The Regional Administrator or Director will 
acknowledge notification of scientific research activity by issuing to 
the operator or master of that vessel, or to the sponsoring institution, 
a Letter of Acknowledgment. This Letter of Acknowledgment is separate 
and distinct from any permit or consultation required under the MMPA, 
the ESA, or any other applicable law. The Regional Administrator or 
Director will include text in the Letter of Acknowledgment informing the 
applicant that such permits may be required and should be obtained from 
the agency prior to embarking on the activity. If the Regional 
Administrator or Director, after review of a research plan, determines 
that it does not constitute scientific research activity but rather 
fishing, the Regional Administrator or Director will inform the 
applicant as soon as practicable and in writing. In making this 
determination, the Regional Administrator, Director, or designee shall 
consider: the merits of the individual proposal and the institution(s) 
involved; whether the proposed activity meets the definition of 
scientific research activity; and whether the vessel meets all the 
requirements for a scientific research vessel. Foreign vessels that 
qualify as scientific research vessels and which are engaged in a 
scientific research activity may only engage in compensation fishing 
during the scientific research cruise and in accordance with the 
applicable scientific research plan. The Regional Administrator or 
Director may also make recommendations to revise the research plan to 
ensure the activity will be considered to be a scientific research 
activity. The Regional Administrator or Director may designate a Science 
and Research Director, or the Assistant Regional Administrator for 
Sustainable Fisheries, to receive scientific research plans and issue 
Letters of Acknowledgment. In order to facilitate identification of the 
activity as scientific research, persons conducting scientific research 
activities are advised to carry a copy of the scientific research plan 
and the Letter of Acknowledgment on board the scientific research vessel 
and to make it available for inspection upon the request of any 
authorized officer. It is recommended that for any scientific research 
activity, any fish, or parts thereof, retained pursuant to such activity 
be accompanied, during any ex-vessel activities, by a copy of the Letter 
of Acknowledgment. Activities conducted in accordance with a scientific 
research plan acknowledged by such a Letter of Acknowledgment are 
presumed to be scientific research activities. An authorized officer may 
overcome this presumption by showing that an activity does not fit the 
definition of scientific research activity or is outside the scope of 
the scientific research plan.
    (b) Reports. Persons conducting scientific research are requested to 
submit a copy of any cruise report or other publication created as a 
result of the cruise, including the amount, composition, and disposition 
of their catch, to the appropriate Science and Research Director.

Sec. 600.513  Recreational fishing.

    (a) Foreign vessels conducting recreational fishing must comply only 
with this section, and Sec. Sec. 600.10,

[[Page 85]]

600.504(a)(1), and 600.505 (as applicable). Such vessels may conduct 
recreational fishing within the EEZ and within the boundaries of a 
state. Any fish caught may not be sold, bartered, or traded.
    (b) The owners or operator and any other person aboard any foreign 
vessel conducting recreational fishing must comply with any Federal laws 
or regulations applicable to the domestic fishery while in the EEZ, and 
any state laws or regulations applicable while in state waters.


<R05>
Sec. 600.514  Relation to other laws.

    (a) Persons affected by these regulations should be aware that other 
Federal and state statutes may apply to their activities.
    (b) Fishing vessel operators must exercise due care in the conduct 
of fishing activities near submarine cables. Damage to submarine cables 
resulting from intentional acts or from the failure to exercise due care 
in the conduct of fishing operations subjects the fishing vessel 
operator to enforcement action under the International Convention for 
the Protection of Submarine Cables, and to the criminal penalties 
prescribed by the Submarine Cable Act (47 U.S.C. 21) and other laws that 
implement that Convention. Fishing vessel operators also should be aware 
that the Submarine Cable Act prohibits fishing operations at a distance 
of less than 1 nautical mile (1.85 km) from a vessel engaged in laying 
or repairing a submarine cable; or at a distance of less than 0.25 
nautical mile (0.46 km) from a buoy or buoys intended to mark the 
position of a cable when being laid, or when out of order, or broken.


<R05>
Sec. 600.515  Interpretation of 16 U.S.C. 1857(4).

    Section 307(4) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act prohibits any fishing 
vessel other than a vessel of the United States (foreign fishing vessel) 
from operating in the EEZ if all of the fishing gear on board the vessel 
is not stowed in compliance with that section ``unless such vessel is 
authorized to engage in fishing in the area in which the vessel is 
operating.'' If such a vessel has a permit authorization that is limited 
to fishing activities other than catching, taking or harvesting (such as 
support, scouting or processing activities), it must have all of its 
fishing gear stowed at all times while it is in the EEZ. If such a 
vessel has a permit authorization to engage in catching, taking or 
harvesting activities, but such authorization is limited to a specific 
area within the EEZ, and/or to a specific period of time, the vessel 
must have all of its fishing gear stowed while it is in the EEZ, except 
when it is in the specific area authorized, and/or during the specific 
period of time authorized.

<R05>
Sec. 600.516  Total allowable level of foreign fishing (TALFF).

    (a) The TALFF, if any, with respect to any fishery subject to the 
exclusive fishery management authority of the United States, is that 
portion of the OY of such fishery, which cannot or will not be harvested 
by vessels of the United States. Allocations of TALFF are discretionary, 
except that the total allowable level shall be zero for fisheries 
determined by the Secretary to have adequate or excess domestic harvest 
capacity.
    (b) Each specification of OY and each assessment of the anticipated 
U.S. harvest will be reviewed during each fishing season. Adjustments to 
TALFF's will be made based on updated information relating to status of 
stocks, estimated and actual performance of domestic and foreign fleets, 
and other relevant factors.
    (c) Specifications of OY and the initial estimates of U.S. harvests 
and TALFF's at the beginning of the relevant fishing year will be 
published in the Federal Register. Adjustments to those numbers will be 
published in the Federal Register upon occasion or as directed by 
regulations implementing FMPs. For current apportionments, contact the 
appropriate Regional Administrator or the Director.

[61 FR 32540, June 24, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 7075, Feb. 12, 1998; 73 
FR 67811, Nov. 17, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 600.517  Allocations.

    The Secretary of State, in cooperation with the Secretary, 
determines the allocation among foreign nations of fish species and 
species groups. The

[[Page 86]]

Secretary of State officially notifies each foreign nation of its 
allocation. The burden of ascertaining and accurately transmitting 
current allocations and status of harvest of an applicable allocation to 
fishing vessels is upon the foreign nation and the owner or operator of 
the FFV.


<R05>
Sec. 600.518  Fee schedule for foreign fishing.

    (a) Permit application fees. Each vessel permit application 
submitted under Sec. 600.501 must be accompanied by a fee. The amount 
of the fee will be determined in accordance with the procedures for 
determining administrative costs of each special product or service 
contained in the NOAA Finance Handbook, which is available upon request 
from the Office of International Affairs (see address at Sec. 
600.501(d)(1)). The fee is specified with the application form. At the 
time the application is submitted, a check for the fees, drawn on a U.S. 
bank, payable to the order of ``Department of Commerce, NOAA,'' must be 
sent to the Assistant Administrator. The permit fee payment must be 
accompanied by a list of the vessels for which the payment is made. In 
the case of applications for permits authorizing activity code 10, the 
permit application fee will be waived if the applicant provides 
satisfactory documentary proof to the Assistant Administrator that the 
foreign nation under which the vessel is registered does not collect a 
fee from a vessel of the United States engaged in similar activities in 
the waters of such foreign nation. The documentation presented (e.g., 
copy of foreign fishing regulations applicable to vessels of the United 
States) must clearly exempt vessels of the United States from such a 
fee.
    (b) Poundage fees--(1) Rates. If a Nation chooses to accept an 
allocation, poundage fees must be paid at the rate specified in the 
following table.

                    Table--Species and Poundage Fees
                        [Dollars per metric ton]

                           Species                                fees
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Northwest Atlantic Ocean fisheries:
  1. Butterfish..............................................     277.96
  2. Herring, Atlantic.......................................      25.75
  3. Herring, River..........................................      49.59
  4. Mackerel, Atlantic......................................      64.76
  5. Other finfish...........................................      45.48
  6. Squid, Illex............................................      97.56
  7. Squid, Loligo...........................................     321.68
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Method of payment of poundage fees and observer fees. (i) If a 
Nation chooses to accept an allocation, a revolving letter of credit (L/
C) must be established and maintained to cover the poundage fees for at 
least 25 percent of the previous year's total allocation at the rate in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or as determined by the Assistant 
Administrator, plus the observer fees required by paragraph (c) of this 
section. The L/C must--
    (A) Be irrevocable.
    (B) Be with a bank subscribing to ICC Pub. 290.
    (C) Designate ``Department of Commerce, NOAA'' as beneficiary;
    (D) Allow partial withdrawals.
    (E) Be confirmed by a U.S. bank.
    (ii) The customer must pay all commissions, transmission, and 
service charges. No fishing will be allowed until the L/C is 
established, and authorized written notice of its issuance is provided 
to the Assistant Administrator.
    (3) Assessment of poundage fees. Poundage fees will be assessed 
quarterly for the actual catch during January through March, April 
through June, July through September, and October through December. The 
appropriate Regional Administrator will reconcile catch figures with 
each country following the procedures of Sec. 600.511(d). When the 
catch figures are agreed upon, NOAA will present a bill for collection 
as the documentary demand for payment to the confirming bank. If, after 
45 days from the end of the quarter, catches have not been reconciled, 
the estimate of the Regional Administrator will stand and a bill will be 
issued for that amount. If necessary, the catch figures may be refined 
by the Regional Administrator during the next 60 days, and any 
modifications will be reflected in the next quarter's bill.

[[Page 87]]

    (c) Observer fees. The Assistant Administrator will notify the 
owners or operators of FFV's of the estimated annual costs of placing 
observers aboard their vessels. The owners or operators of any such 
vessel must provide for repayment of those costs by including one-fourth 
of the estimated annual observer fee as determined by the Assistant 
Administrator in a L/C as prescribed in Sec. 600.518(b)(2). During the 
fiscal year, payment will be withdrawn from the L/C as required to cover 
anticipated observer coverage for the upcoming fishery. The Assistant 
Administrator will reconcile any differences between the estimated cost 
and actual costs of observer coverage within 90 days after the end of 
the fiscal year.
    (d) Financial assurances. (1) A foreign nation, or the owners and 
operators of certain vessels of that foreign nation, may be required by 
the Assistant Administrator to provide financial assurances. Such 
assurances may be required if--
    (i) Civil and criminal penalties assessed against fishing vessels of 
the Nation have not effectively deterred violations;
    (ii) Vessels of that Nation have engaged in fishing in the EEZ 
without proper authorization to conduct such activities;
    (iii) The Nation's vessel owners have refused to answer 
administrative charges or summons to appear in court; or
    (iv) Enforcement of Magnuson-Stevens Act civil or criminal judgments 
in the courts of a foreign nation is unattainable.
    (2) The level of financial assurances will be guided by the level of 
penalties assessed and costs to the U.S. Government.

<R05>
Sec. 600.520  Northwest Atlantic Ocean fishery.

    (a) Purpose. Sections 600.520 and 600.525 regulate all foreign 
fishing conducted under a GIFA within the EEZ in the Atlantic Ocean 
north of 35[deg]00[min] N. lat.
    (b) Authorized fishery--(1) Allocations. Foreign vessels may engage 
in fishing only in accordance with applicable national allocations.
    (2) Time and area restrictions. (i) Fishing, including processing, 
scouting, and support of foreign or U.S. vessels, is prohibited south of 
35[deg]00[min] N. lat., and north and east of a line beginning at the 
shore at 44[deg]22[min] N. lat., 67[deg]52[min] W. long. and 
intersecting the boundary of the EEZ at 44[deg]11[min]12[sec] N. lat., 
67[deg]16[min]46[sec] W. long.
    (ii) The Regional Administrator will consult with the Council prior 
to giving notice of any area or time restriction. NMFS will also consult 
with the USCG if the restriction is proposed to reduce gear conflicts. 
If NMFS determines after such consultation that the restriction appears 
to be appropriate, NMFS will publish the proposed restriction in the 
Federal Register, together with a summary of the information on which 
the restriction is based. Following a 30-day comment period, NMFS will 
publish a final action.
    (iii) The Regional Administrator may rescind any restriction if he/
she determines that the basis for the restriction no longer exists.
    (iv) Any notice of restriction shall operate as a condition imposed 
on the permit issued to the foreign vessels involved in the fishery.
    (3) TALFF. The TALFFs for the fisheries of the Northwest Atlantic 
Ocean are published in the Federal Register. Current TALFFs are also 
available from the Regional Administrator.
    (4) Species definitions. The category ``other finfish'' used in 
TALFFs and in allocations includes all species except:
    (i) The other allocated species, namely: Short-finned squid, long-
finned squid, Atlantic herring, Atlantic mackerel, river herring 
(includes alewife, blueback herring, and hickory shad), and butterfish.
    (ii) The prohibited species, namely: American plaice, American shad, 
Atlantic cod, Atlantic menhaden, Atlantic redfish, Atlantic salmon, all 
marlin, all spearfish, sailfish, swordfish, black sea bass, bluefish, 
croaker, haddock, ocean pout, pollock, red hake, scup, sea turtles, 
sharks (except dogfish), silver hake, spot, striped bass, summer 
flounder, tilefish, yellowtail

[[Page 88]]

flounder, weakfish, white hake, windowpane flounder, winter flounder, 
witch flounder, Continental Shelf fishery resources, and other 
invertebrates (except nonallocated squids).
    (5) Closures. The taking of any species for which a Nation has an 
allocation is permitted, provided that:
    (i) The vessels of the foreign nation have not caught the allocation 
of that Nation for any species or species group (e.g., ``other 
finfish''). When vessels of a foreign nation have caught an applicable 
allocation of any species, all further fishing other than scouting, 
processing, or support by vessels of that Nation must cease, even if 
other allocations have not been reached. Therefore, it is essential that 
foreign nations plan their fishing strategy to ensure that the reaching 
of an allocation for one species does not result in the premature 
closing of a Nation's fishery for other allocated species.
    (ii) The fishery has not been closed for other reasons under Sec. 
600.511.
    (6) Allocation utilization. Foreign fishing vessels may elect to 
retain or discard allocated species; however, the computation of 
allocation utilization and fee refunds will be based on the total 
quantity of that species that was caught. Prohibited species must always 
be returned to the sea as required under Sec. 600.509.
    (c) Fishing areas. For the purposes of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean 
fishery, fishing areas are that portion of the EEZ shown inside the 
boundaries of the ``three digit statistical areas'' described in Figure 
1 to this section.

    (a) Purpose and scope. This section regulates fishing by Canadian 
vessels under the 1981 Treaty Between the Government of the United 
States of America and the Government of Canada on Pacific Coast Albacore 
Tuna Vessels and Port Privileges as amended in 2002. Notwithstanding any 
other provision of this subpart F, fishing vessels of Canada may be 
authorized to fish in waters under the fisheries jurisdiction of the 
United States more than 12 nautical miles from the baseline from which 
the territorial sea is measured in accordance with the Treaty and this 
section, pursuant to Public Law 108-219 (118 Stat. 616; 16 U.S.C. 1821 
note).
    (b) Definitions. In addition to the definitions in the Magnuson-
Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act and Sec. 600.10, the 
terms used in this subpart have the following meanings:
    Fishing under the Treaty as amended in 2002 means to engage in 
fishing for albacore tuna in waters under the fisheries jurisdiction of

Canadian vessel operators.
    Treaty means the 1981 Treaty Between the Government of the United 
States of America and the Government of Canada on Pacific Coast Albacore 
Tuna Vessels and Port Privileges as amended in 2002.
    (c) Vessel list. A Canadian vessel is not eligible to fish for 
albacore in U.S. waters under the Treaty as amended in 2002 unless the 
vessel is on the list provided to NMFS by the Government of Canada of 
vessels authorized by Canada to fish under the Treaty as amended in 
2002.
    (d) Vessel identification. A Canadian vessel fishing under the 
Treaty as amended in 2002 must clearly display its Canadian vessel 
registration number followed by the letter C in the same height and size 
as the numerals, consistent with Canadian vessel marking requirements.
    (e) Hail-in reports. The operator of a Canadian Vessel eligible to 
fish for albacore in U.S. waters under the Treaty as amended in 2002 
must file a hail-in report with the Reporting Office at least 24 hours 
prior to beginning any such fishing.
    (f) Hail-out Reports. The operator of a Canadian vessel that has 
been fishing in U.S. waters under the Treaty as amended in 2002 must 
file a hail-out report with the Reporting Office at least 24 hours prior 
to exiting from U.S. waters.
    (g) Prohibitions. It is prohibited for the operator of a Canadian 
vessel to engage in fishing in U.S. waters if the vessel:
    (1) Is not on the vessel list in paragraph (c) of this section;
    (2) Has not filed a hail-in report to advise of an intent to fish 
under the Treaty as amended in 2002 prior to engaging in such fishing; 
or
    (3) Is not clearly marked in accordance with paragraph (d) of this 
section.

      Subpart G_Preemption of State Authority Under Section 306(b)


<R05>
Sec. 600.605  General policy.

    It is the policy of the Secretary that preemption proceedings will 
be conducted expeditiously. The administrative law judge and counsel or 
other representative for each party are encouraged to make every effort 
at each stage of the proceedings to avoid delay.


<R05>
Sec. 600.610  Factual findings for Federal preemption.

    (a) The two factual findings for Federal preemption of state 
management authority over a fishery are:
    (1) The fishing in a fishery that is covered by an FMP implemented 
under the Magnuson-Stevens Act is engaged in predominately within the 
EEZ and beyond such zone.

[[Page 91]]

    (2) A state has taken any action, or omitted to take any action, the 
results of which will substantially and adversely affect the carrying 
out of such FMP.
    (b) Whether fishing is engaged in ``predominately'' within or beyond 
the EEZ will be determined after consideration of relevant factors, 
including but not limited to, the catch (based on numbers, value, or 
weight of fish caught, or other relevant factors) or fishing effort 
during the appropriate period, and in light of historical patterns of 
the distribution of catch or fishing effort for such stock or stocks of 
fish.
    (c) Whether relevant effects are substantial will be determined 
after consideration of the magnitude of such actual or potential 
effects. Relevant to this determination are various factors, including 
but not limited to, the proportion of the fishery (stock or stocks of 
fish and fishing for such stocks) that is subject to the effects of a 
particular state's action or omission, the characteristics and status 
(including migratory patterns and biological condition) of the stock or 
stocks of fish in the fishery, and the similarity or dissimilarity 
between the goals, objectives, or policies of the state's action or 
omission and the management goals or objectives specified in the FMP for 
the fishery or between the state and Federal conservation and management 
measures of the fishery.

<R05>
Sec. 600.615  Commencement of proceedings.

    (a) Notice of proposed preemption. (1) If a proceeding under this 
part is deemed necessary, the Administrator must issue a notice of 
proposed preemption to the Attorney General of the State or States 
concerned. The notice will contain:
    (i) A recital of the legal authority and jurisdiction for 
instituting the proceeding.
    (ii) A concise statement of the Sec. 600.610 factual findings for 
Federal preemption upon which the notice is based.
    (iii) The time, place, and date of the hearing.
    (2) The notice of proposed preemption will also be published in the 
Federal Register. This notification may be combined with any notice of 
proposed rulemaking published under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (b) Response. The state will have the opportunity to respond in 
writing to the notice of proposed preemption.
    (c) Amendment. The Administrator may, at any time prior to the 
Secretary's decision, withdraw the notice of proposed preemption. Upon 
motion of either party before the record is closed, the administrative 
law judge may amend the notice of proposed preemption.
    (d) Proposed regulations--(1) In general. If additional regulations 
are required to govern fishing within the boundaries of a state, the 
Administrator may publish proposed regulations in the Federal Register 
concurrently with issuing the notification indicated in paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (2) Emergency actions. Nothing in this section will prevent the 
Secretary from taking emergency action under section 305(c) of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act.

<R05>
Sec. 600.620  Rules pertaining to the hearing.

    (a) The civil procedure rules of the NOAA currently set forth in 15 
CFR part 904, subpart C (or as subsequently amended), apply to the 
proceeding after its commencement by service of notice (pursuant to 
Sec. 600.615) and prior to the Secretary's decision (Sec. 600.625), 
except that the following sections will not apply:
    (1) 15 CFR 904.201 (Definitions);

<R05>
Sec. 600.625  Secretary's decision.

    (a) The Secretary will, on the basis of the hearing, record the 
administrative law judge's recommended decision:
    (1) Accept or reject any of the findings or conclusions of the 
administrative law judge and decide whether the factual findings exist 
for Federal preemption of a state's authority within its boundaries 
(other than in its internal waters) with respect to the fishery in 
question;
    (2) Reserve decision on the merits or withdraw the notice of 
proposed preemption; or
    (3) Remand the case to the administrative law judge for further 
proceedings as may be appropriate, along with a statement of reasons for 
the remand.
    (b) Notification. (1) If the factual findings for Federal preemption 
are determined to exist, the Secretary will notify in writing the 
Attorney General of that state and the appropriate Council(s) of the 
preemption of that state's authority. The Secretary will also direct the 
Administrator to promulgate appropriate regulations proposed under Sec. 
600.615(d) and otherwise to begin regulating the fishery within the 
state's boundaries (other than in its internal waters).
    (2) If the factual findings for Federal preemption are determined 
not to exist, the Secretary will notify, in writing, the Attorney 
General of the state and the appropriate Council(s) of that 
determination. The Secretary will also direct the Administrator to issue 
a notice withdrawing any regulations proposed under Sec. 600.615(d).


<R05>
Sec. 600.630  Application for reinstatement of state authority.

    (a) Application or notice. (1) At any time after the promulgation of 
regulations under Sec. 600.625(b)(1) to regulate a fishery within a 
state's boundaries, the affected state may apply to the Secretary for 
reinstatement of state authority. The Secretary may also serve upon such 
state a notice of intent to terminate such Federal regulation. A state's 
application must include a clear and concise statement of:
    (i) The action taken by the State to correct the action or omission 
found to have substantially and adversely affected the carrying out of 
the FMP; or
    (ii) Any changed circumstances that affect the relationship of the 
state's action or omission to take action to the carrying out of the FMP 
(including any amendment to such plan); and
    (iii) Any laws, regulations, or other materials that the state 
believes support the application.
    (2) Any such application received by the Secretary or notice issued 
to the State will be published in the Federal Register.
    (b) Informal response. The Secretary has sole discretion to accept 
or reject the application or response. If the Secretary accepts the 
application or rejects any responses and finds that the reasons for 
regulation of the fishery within the boundaries of the state no longer 
prevail, the Secretary will promptly terminate such regulation and 
publish in the Federal Register any regulatory amendments necessary to 
accomplish that end.
    (c) Hearing. The Secretary has sole discretion to direct the 
Administrator to schedule hearings for the receipt of evidence by an 
administrative law judge. Hearings before the administrative law judge 
to receive such evidence will be conducted in accordance with Sec. 
600.620. Upon conclusion of such hearings, the administrative law judge 
will certify the record and a recommended decision to the Secretary. If 
the Secretary, upon consideration of the state's application or any 
response to the notice published under Sec. 600.630(a)(2), the hearing 
record, the recommended decision, and any other relevant materials finds 
that the reasons for regulation of the fishery within the boundaries of 
the state no longer prevail, the Secretary will promptly terminate such 
regulation and publish in the Federal Register any regulatory amendments 
necessary to accomplish that end.


<R04>
           Subpart H_General Provisions for Domestic Fisheries


<R05>
Sec. 600.705  Relation to other laws.

    (a) General. Persons affected by these regulations should be aware 
that other Federal and state statutes and regulations may apply to their 
activities.

[[Page 93]]

Vessel operators may wish to refer to USCG regulations found in the Code 
of Federal Regulations title 33--Navigation and Navigable Waters and 
46--Shipping; 15 CFR part 904, subpart D--Permit Sanctions and Denials; 
and title 43--Public Lands (in regard to marine sanctuaries).
    (b) State responsibilities. Certain responsibilities relating to 
data collection and enforcement may be performed by authorized state 
personnel under a state/Federal agreement for data collection and a 
tripartite agreement among the state, the USCG, and the Secretary for 
enforcement.
    (c) Submarine cables. Fishing vessel operators must exercise due 
care in the conduct of fishing activities near submarine cables. Damage 
to the submarine cables resulting from intentional acts or from the 
failure to exercise due care in the conduct of fishing operations 
subjects the fishing vessel operator to the criminal penalties 
prescribed by the Submarine Cable Act (47 U.S.C. 21) which implements 
the International Convention for the Protection of Submarine Cables. 
Fishing vessel operators also should be aware that the Submarine Cable 
Act prohibits fishing operations at a distance of less than 1 nautical 
mile (1.85 km) from a vessel engaged in laying or repairing a submarine 
cable; or at a distance of less than 0.25 nautical mile (0.46 km) from a 
buoy or buoys intended to mark the position of a cable when being laid 
or when out of order or broken.
    (d) Marine mammals. Regulations governing exemption permits and the 
recordkeeping and reporting of the incidental take of marine mammals are 
set forth in part 229 of this title.
    (e) Halibut fishing. Fishing for halibut is governed by regulations 
of the International Pacific Halibut Commission set forth at part 300 of

the gear or participate in the fishery (e.g., through emergency or 
interim regulations). The list of authorized fisheries and gear is as

<R05>
Sec. 600.730  Facilitation of enforcement.

    (a) General. The operator of, or any other person aboard, any 
fishing vessel subject to parts 622 through 699 of this chapter must 
immediately comply with instructions and signals issued by an authorized 
officer to stop the vessel and with instructions to facilitate safe 
boarding and inspection of the vessel, its gear, equipment, fishing 
record (where applicable), and catch for purposes of enforcing the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act or any other statute administered by NOAA and this 
chapter.
    (1) For the purposes of this section ``freeboard'' means the working 
distance between the top rail of the gunwale of a vessel and the water's 
surface. Where cut-outs are provided in the bulwarks for the purpose of 
boarding personnel, freeboard means the distance between the threshold 
of the bulwark cut-out and the water's surface.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, ``pilot ladder'' means a 
flexible ladder constructed and approved to meet the U.S. Coast Guard 
standards for pilot ladders at 46 CFR subpart 163.003 entitled Pilot 
Ladder.
    (b) Communications. (1) Upon being approached by a USCG vessel or 
aircraft, or other vessel or aircraft with an authorized officer aboard, 
the operator of a fishing vessel must be alert for communications 
conveying enforcement instructions.
    (2) VHF-FM radiotelephone is the preferred method for communicating 
between vessels. If the size of the vessel

[[Page 104]]

and the wind, sea, and visibility conditions allow, a loudhailer may be 
used instead of the radio. Hand signals, placards, high frequency 
radiotelephone, or voice may be employed by an authorized officer, and 
message blocks may be dropped from an aircraft.
    (3) If other communications are not practicable, visual signals may 
be transmitted by flashing light directed at the vessel signaled. USCG 
units will normally use the flashing light signal ``L'' as the signal to 
stop. In the International Code of Signals, ``L'' (.-..) means ``you 
should stop your vessel instantly.'' (Period (.) means a short flash of 
light; dash (-) means a long flash of light.)
    (4) Failure of a vessel's operator promptly to stop the vessel when 
directed to do so by an authorized officer using loudhailer, 
radiotelephone, flashing light signal, or other means constitutes prima 
facie evidence of the offense of refusal to permit an authorized officer 
to board.
    (5) The operator of a vessel who does not understand a signal from 
an enforcement unit and who is unable to obtain clarification by 
loudhailer or radiotelephone must consider the signal to be a command to 
stop the vessel instantly.
    (c) Boarding. The operator of a vessel directed to stop must:
    (1) Guard Channel 16, VHF-FM, if so equipped.
    (2) Stop immediately and lay to or maneuver in such a way as to 
allow the authorized officer and his/her party to come aboard.
    (3) Except for fishing vessels with a freeboard of 4 feet (1.25 m) 
or less, provide, when requested by an authorized officer or observer 
personnel, a pilot ladder capable of being used for the purpose of 
enabling personnel to embark and disembark the vessel safely. The pilot 
ladder must be maintained in good condition and kept clean.
    (4) When necessary to facilitate the boarding or when requested by 
an authorized officer or observer, provide a manrope or safety line, and 
illumination for the pilot ladder.
    (5) Take such other actions as necessary to facilitate boarding and 
to ensure the safety of the authorized officer and the boarding party.
    (d) Signals. The following signals, extracted from the International 
Code of Signals, may be sent by flashing light by an enforcement unit 
when conditions do not allow communications by loudhailer or 
radiotelephone. Knowledge of these signals by vessel operators is not 
required. However, knowledge of these signals and appropriate action by 
a vessel operator may preclude the necessity of sending the signal ``L'' 
and the necessity for the vessel to stop instantly. (Period (.) means a 
short flash of light; dash (-) means a long flash of light.)
    (1) ``AA'' repeated (.-.-) is the call to an unknown station. The 
operator of the signaled vessel should respond by identifying the vessel 
by radiotelephone or by illuminating the vessel's identification.
    (2) ``RY-CY'' (.-. -.-- -.-. -.--) means ``you should proceed at 
slow speed, a boat is coming to you.'' This signal is normally employed 
when conditions allow an enforcement boarding without the necessity of 
the vessel being boarded coming to a complete stop, or, in some cases, 
without retrieval of fishing gear which may be in the water.
    (3) ``SQ3'' (... --.- ...--) means ``you should stop or heave to; I 
am going to board you.''

Sec. 600.735  Penalties.

    Any person committing, or fishing vessel used in the commission of a 
violation of the Magnuson-Stevens Act or any other statute administered 
by NOAA and/or any regulation issued under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, is 
subject to the civil and criminal penalty provisions and civil 
forfeiture provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, to this section, to 
15 CFR part 904 (Civil Procedures), and to other applicable law.

[61 FR 32540, June 24, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 7075, Feb. 12, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 600.740  Enforcement policy.

    (a) The Magnuson-Stevens Act provides four basic enforcement 
remedies for violations, in ascending order of severity, as follows:

[[Page 105]]

    (1) Issuance of a citation (a type of warning), usually at the scene 
of the offense (see 15 CFR part 904, subpart E).
    (2) Assessment by the Administrator of a civil money penalty.
    (3) For certain violations, judicial forfeiture action against the 
vessel and its catch.
    (4) Criminal prosecution of the owner or operator for some offenses. 
It shall be the policy of NMFS to enforce vigorously and equitably the 
provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act by utilizing that form or 
combination of authorized remedies best suited in a particular case to 
this end.
    (b) Processing a case under one remedial form usually means that 
other remedies are inappropriate in that case. However, further 
investigation or later review may indicate the case to be either more or 
less serious than initially considered, or may otherwise reveal that the 
penalty first pursued is inadequate to serve the purposes of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act. Under such circumstances, the Agency may pursue 
other remedies either in lieu of or in addition to the action originally 
taken. Forfeiture of the illegal catch does not fall within this general 
rule and is considered in most cases as only the initial step in 
remedying a violation by removing the ill-gotten gains of the offense.
    (c) If a fishing vessel for which a permit has been issued under the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act is used in the commission of an offense prohibited 
by section 307 of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, NOAA may impose permit 
sanctions, whether or not civil or criminal action has been undertaken 
against the vessel or its owner or operator. In some cases, the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act requires permit sanctions following the assessment 
of a civil penalty or the imposition of a criminal fine. In sum, the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act treats sanctions against the fishing vessel permit 
to be the carrying out of a purpose separate from that accomplished by 
civil and criminal penalties against the vessel or its owner or 
operator.

<R05>
Sec. 600.745  Scientific research activity, exempted fishing, and 
exempted educational activity.

    (a) Scientific research activity. Nothing in this part is intended 
to inhibit or prevent any scientific research activity conducted by a 
scientific research vessel. Persons planning to conduct scientific 
research activities on board a scientific research vessel in the EEZ are 
encouraged to submit to the appropriate Regional Administrator or 
Director, 60 days or as soon as practicable prior to its start, a 
scientific research plan for each scientific activity. The Regional 
Administrator or Director will acknowledge notification of scientific 
research activity by issuing to the operator or master of that vessel, 
or to the sponsoring institution, a Letter of Acknowledgment. This 
Letter of Acknowledgment is separate and distinct from any permit or 
consultation required by the MMPA, the ESA, or any other applicable law. 
The Regional Administrator or Director will include text in the Letter 
of Acknowledgment informing the applicant that such a permit may be 
required and should be obtained from the agency prior to embarking on 
the activity. If the Regional Administrator or Director, after review of 
a research plan, determines that it does not constitute scientific 
research but rather fishing, the Regional Administrator or Director will 
inform the applicant as soon as practicable and in writing. In making 
this determination, the Regional Administrator, Director, or designee 
shall consider: the merits of the individual proposal and the 
institution(s) involved; whether the proposed activity meets the 
definition of scientific research activity; and whether the vessel meets 
all the requirements for a scientific research vessel. The Regional 
Administrator or Director may also make recommendations to revise the 
research plan to ensure the activity will be considered to be scientific 
research activity or recommend the applicant request an EFP. The 
Regional Administrator or Director may designate a Science and Research 
Director, or the Assistant Regional Administrator for Sustainable 
Fisheries, to receive scientific research

[[Page 106]]

plans and issue Letters of Acknowledgment. In order to facilitate 
identification of the activity as scientific research, persons 
conducting scientific research activities are advised to carry a copy of 
the scientific research plan and the Letter of Acknowledgment on board 
the scientific research vessel and to make it available for inspection 
upon the request of any authorized officer. It is recommended that for 
any scientific research activity, any fish, or parts thereof, retained 
pursuant to such activity be accompanied, during any ex-vessel 
activities, by a copy of the Letter of Acknowledgment. Activity 
conducted in accordance with a scientific research plan acknowledged by 
such a Letter of Acknowledgment is presumed to be scientific research 
activity. An authorized officer may overcome this presumption by showing 
that an activity does not fit the definition of scientific research 
activity or is outside the scope of the scientific research plan.
    (b) Exempted fishing--(1) General. A NMFS Regional Administrator or 
Director may authorize, for limited testing, public display, data 
collection, exploratory fishing, compensation fishing, conservation 
engineering, health and safety surveys, environmental cleanup, and/or 
hazard removal purposes, the target or incidental harvest of species 
managed under an FMP or fishery regulations that would otherwise be 
prohibited. Exempted fishing may not be conducted unless authorized by 
an EFP issued by a Regional Administrator or Director in accordance with 
the criteria and procedures specified in this section. Compensation 
fishing must be conducted under an EFP if the activity would otherwise 
be prohibited by applicable regulations unless the activity is 
specifically authorized under an FMP or a scientific research permit. 
Conservation engineering that does not meet the definition of scientific 
research activity, but does meet the definition of fishing must be 
conducted under an EFP if the activity would otherwise be prohibited by 
applicable regulations. Data collection designed to capture and land 
quantities of fish for product development, market research, and/or 
public display must be permitted under exempted fishing procedures. An 
EFP exempts a vessel only from those regulations specified in the EFP. 
All other applicable regulations remain in effect. The Regional 
Administrator or Director may charge a fee to recover the administrative 
expenses of issuing an EFP. The amount of the fee will be calculated, at 
least annually, in accordance with procedures of the NOAA Handbook for 
determining administrative costs of each special product or service; the 
fee may not exceed such costs. Persons may contact the appropriate 
Regional Administrator or Director to determine the applicable fee.
    (2) Application. An applicant for an EFP shall submit a completed 
application package to the appropriate Regional Administrator or 
Director, as soon as practicable and at least 60 days before the desired 
effective date of the EFP. Submission of an EFP application less than 60 
days before the desired effective date of the EFP may result in a 
delayed effective date because of review requirements. The application 
package must include payment of any required fee as specified by 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and a written application that 
includes, but is not limited to, the following information:
    (i) The date of the application.
    (ii) The applicant's name, mailing address, and telephone number.
    (iii) A statement of the purposes and goals of the exempted fishery 
for which an EFP is needed, including justification for issuance of the 
EFP.
    (iv) For each vessel to be covered by the EFP, as soon as the 
information is available and before operations begin under the EFP:
    (A) A copy of the USCG documentation, state license, or registration 
of each vessel, or the information contained on the appropriate 
document.
    (B) The current name, address, and telephone number of the owner and 
master, if not included on the document provided for the vessel.
    (v) The species (target and incidental) expected to be harvested 
under the EFP, the amount(s) of such harvest necessary to conduct the 
exempted fishing, the arrangements for disposition of all regulated 
species harvested under the EFP, and any anticipated

[[Page 107]]

impacts on the environment, including impacts on fisheries, marine 
mammals, threatened or endangered species, and EFH.
    (vi) For each vessel covered by the EFP, the approximate time(s) and 
place(s) fishing will take place, and the type, size, and amount of gear 
to be used.
    (vii) The signature of the applicant.
    (viii) The Regional Administrator or Director, as appropriate, may 
request from an applicant additional information necessary to make the 
determinations required under this section. An incomplete application or 
an application for which the appropriate fee has not been paid will not 
be considered until corrected in writing and the fee paid. An applicant 
for an EFP need not be the owner or operator of the vessel(s) for which 
the EFP is requested.
    (3) Issuance. (i) The Regional Administrator or Director, as 
appropriate, will review each application and will make a preliminary 
determination whether the application contains all of the required 
information and constitutes an activity appropriate for further 
consideration. If the Regional Administrator or Director finds that any 
application does not warrant further consideration, both the applicant 
and the affected Council(s) will be notified in writing of the reasons 
for the decision. If the Regional Administrator or Director determines 
that any application warrants further consideration, notification of 
receipt of the application will be published in the Federal Register 
with a brief description of the proposal. Interested persons will be 
given a 15- to 45-day opportunity to comment on the notice of receipt of 
the EFP application. In addition, comments may be requested during 
public testimony at a Council meeting. If the Council intends to take 
comments on EFP applications at a Council meeting, it must include a 
statement to this effect in the Council meeting notice and meeting 
agenda. Multiple applications for EFPs may be published in the same 
Federal Register document and may be discussed under a single Council 
agenda item. The notification may establish a cut-off date for receipt 
of additional applications to participate in the same, or a similar, 
exempted fishing activity. The Regional Administrator or Director will 
also forward copies of the application to the Council(s), the U.S. Coast 
Guard, and the appropriate fishery management agencies of affected 
states, accompanied by the following information:
    (A) The effect of the proposed EFP on the target and incidental 
species, including the effect on any TAC.
    (B) A citation of the regulation or regulations that, without the 
EFP, would prohibit the proposed activity.
    (C) Biological information relevant to the proposal, including 
appropriate statements of environmental impacts, including impacts on 
fisheries, marine mammals, threatened or endangered species, and EFH.
    (ii) If the application is complete and warrants additional 
consultation, the Regional Administrator or Director may consult with 
the appropriate Council(s) concerning the permit application during the 
period in which comments have been requested. The Council(s) or the 
Regional Administrator or Director shall notify the applicant in advance 
of any public meeting at which the application will be considered, and 
offer the applicant the opportunity to appear in support of the 
application.
    (iii) As soon as practicable after receiving a complete application, 
including all required analyses and consultations (e.g., NEPA, EFH, ESA 
and MMPA), and having received responses from the public, the agencies 
identified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, and/or after the 
consultation, if any, described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, 
the Regional Administrator or Director shall issue the EFP or notify the 
applicant in writing of the decision to deny the EFP and the reasons for 
the denial. Grounds for denial of an EFP include, but are not limited 
to, the following:
    (A) The applicant has failed to disclose material information 
required, or has made false statements as to any material fact, in 
connection with his or her application; or
    (B) According to the best scientific information available, the 
harvest to be conducted under the permit would detrimentally affect the 
well-being of the stock of any regulated species of

[[Page 108]]

fish, marine mammal, threatened or endangered species, or EFH; or
    (C) Issuance of the EFP would have economic allocation as its sole 
purpose (other than compensation fishing); or
    (D) Activities to be conducted under the EFP would be inconsistent 
with the intent of this section, the management objectives of the FMP, 
or other applicable law; or
    (E) The applicant has failed to demonstrate a valid justification 
for the permit; or
    (F) The activity proposed under the EFP could create a significant 
enforcement problem.
    (iv) The decision of a Regional Administrator or Director to grant 
or deny an EFP is the final action of NMFS. If the permit, as granted, 
is significantly different from the original application, or is denied, 
NMFS may publish notification in the Federal Register describing the 
exempted fishing to be conducted under the EFP or the reasons for 
denial.
    (v) The Regional Administrator or Director should attach, as 
applicable, terms and conditions to the EFP, consistent with the purpose 
of the exempted fishing and as otherwise necessary for the conservation 
and management of the fishery resources and the marine environment, 
including, but not limited to:
    (A) The maximum amount of each regulated species that can be 
harvested and landed during the term of the EFP, including trip 
limitations, where appropriate.
    (B) The number, size(s), name(s), and identification number(s) of 
the vessel(s) authorized to conduct fishing activities under the EFP.
    (C) A citation of the regulations from which the vessel is exempted.
    (D) The time(s) and place(s) where exempted fishing may be 
conducted.
    (E) The type, size, and amount of gear that may be used by each 
vessel operated under the EFP.
    (F) Whether observers, a vessel monitoring system, or other 
electronic equipment must be carried on board vessels operating under 
the EFP, and any necessary conditions, such as predeployment 
notification requirements.
    (G) Data reporting requirements necessary to document the 
activities, including catches and incidental catches, and to determine 
compliance with the terms and conditions of the EFP and established time 
frames and formats for submission of the data to NMFS.
    (H) Other conditions as may be necessary to assure compliance with 
the purposes of the EFP, consistent with the objectives of the FMP and 
other applicable law.
    (I) Provisions for public release of data obtained under the EFP 
that are consistent with NOAA confidentiality of statistics procedures 
at set out in subpart E. An applicant may be required to waive the right 
to confidentiality of information gathered while conducting exempted 
fishing as a condition of an EFP.
    (4) Acknowledging permit conditions. Upon receipt of an EFP, the 
permit holder must date and sign the permit, and retain the permit on 
board the vessel(s). The permit is not valid until signed by the permit 
holder. In signing the permit, the permit holder:
    (i) Agrees to abide by all terms and conditions set forth in the 
permit, and all restrictions and relevant regulations; and
    (ii) Acknowledges that the authority to conduct certain activities 
specified in the permit is conditional and subject to authorization and 
revocation by the Regional Administrator or Director.
    (5) Duration. Unless otherwise specified in the EFP or a superseding 
notice or regulation, an EFP is valid for no longer than 1 year. EFPs 
may be renewed following the application procedures in this section.
    (6) Alteration. Any permit that has been altered, erased, or 
mutilated is invalid.
    (7) Inspection. Any EFP issued under this section must be carried on 
board the vessel(s) for which it was issued. The EFP must be presented 
for inspection upon request of any authorized officer. Any fish, or 
parts thereof, retained pursuant to an EFP issued under this paragraph 
must be accompanied, during any ex-vessel activities, by a copy of the 
EFP.
    (8) Inspection. Any EFP issued under this section must be carried on 
board the vessel(s) for which it was issued.

[[Page 109]]

The EFP must be presented for inspection upon request of any authorized 
officer.
    (9) Sanctions. Failure of a permittee to comply with the terms and 
conditions of an EFP may be grounds for revocation, suspension, or 
modification of the EFP with respect to all persons and vessels 
conducting activities under the EFP. Any action taken to revoke, 
suspend, or modify an EFP for enforcement purposes will be governed by 
15 CFR part 904, subpart D.
    (c) Reports. (1) NMFS requests that persons conducting scientific 
research activities from scientific research vessels submit a copy of 
any report or other publication created as a result of the activity, 
including the amount, composition, and disposition of their catch, to 
the appropriate Science and Research Director and Regional Administrator 
or Director.
    (2) Upon completion of the activities of the EFP, or periodically as 
required by the terms and conditions of the EFP, persons fishing under 
an EFP must submit a report of their catches and any other information 
required, to the appropriate Regional Administrator or Director, in the 
manner and within the time frame specified in the EFP, but no later than 
6 months after concluding the exempted fishing activity. Persons 
conducting EFP activities are also requested to submit a copy of any 
publication prepared as a result of the EFP activity.
    (d) Exempted educational activities--(1) General. A NMFS Regional 
Administrator or Director may authorize, for educational purposes, the 
target or incidental harvest of species managed under an FMP or fishery 
regulations that would otherwise be prohibited. The trade, barter or 
sale of fish taken under this authorization is prohibited. The decision 
of a Regional Administrator or Director to grant or deny an exempted 
educational activity authorization is the final action of NMFS. Exempted 
educational activities may not be conducted unless authorized in writing 
by a Regional Administrator or Director in accordance with the criteria 
and procedures specified in this section. Such authorization will be 
issued without charge.
    (2) Application. An applicant for an exempted educational activity 
authorization shall submit to the appropriate Regional Administrator or 
Director, at least 15 days before the desired effective date of the 
authorization, a written application that includes, but is not limited 
to, the following information:
    (i) The date of the application.
    (ii) The applicant's name, mailing address, and telephone number.
    (iii) A brief statement of the purposes and goals of the exempted 
educational activity for which authorization is requested, including a 
general description of the arrangements for disposition of all species 
collected.
    (iv) Evidence that the sponsoring institution is a valid educational 
institution, such as accreditation by a recognized national or 
international accreditation body.
    (v) The scope and duration of the activity.
    (vi) For each vessel to be covered by the authorization:
    (A) A copy of the U.S. Coast Guard documentation, state license, or 
registration of the vessel, or the information contained on the 
appropriate document.
    (B) The current name, address, and telephone number of the owner and 
master, if not included on the document provided for the vessel.
    (vii) The species and amounts expected to be caught during the 
exempted educational activity, and any anticipated impacts on the 
environment, including impacts on fisheries, marine mammals, threatened 
or endangered species, and EFH.
    (viii) For each vessel covered by the authorization, the approximate 
time(s) and place(s) fishing will take place, and the type, size, and 
amount of gear to be used.
    (ix) The signature of the applicant.
    (x) The Regional Administrator or Director may request from an 
applicant additional information necessary to make the determinations 
required under this section. An incomplete application will not be 
considered until corrected in writing.
    (3) Issuance. (i) The Regional Administrator or Director, as 
appropriate, will review each application and will

[[Page 110]]

make a determination whether the application contains all of the 
required information, is consistent with the goals, objectives, and 
requirements of the FMP or regulations and other applicable law, and 
constitutes a valid exempted educational activity. The applicant will be 
notified in writing of the decision within 5 working days of receipt of 
the application.
    (ii) The Regional Administrator or Director should attach, as 
applicable, terms and conditions to the authorization, consistent with 
the purpose of the exempted educational activity and as otherwise 
necessary for the conservation and management of the fishery resources 
and the marine environment, including, but not limited to:
    (A) The maximum amount of each regulated species that may be 
harvested.
    (B) A citation of the regulations from which the vessel is being 
exempted.
    (C) The time(s) and place(s) where the exempted educational activity 
may be conducted.
    (D) The type, size, and amount of gear that may be used by each 
vessel operated under the authorization.
    (E) Data reporting requirements necessary to document the activities 
and to determine compliance with the terms and conditions of the 
exempted educational activity.
    (F) Such other conditions as may be necessary to assure compliance 
with the purposes of the authorization, consistent with the objectives 
of the FMP or regulations.
    (G) Provisions for public release of data obtained under the 
authorization, consistent with NOAA confidentiality of statistics 
procedures in subpart E. An applicant may be required to waive the right 
to confidentiality of information gathered while conducting exempted 
educational activities as a condition of the authorization.
    (iii) The authorization will specify the scope of the authorized 
activity and will include, at a minimum, the duration, vessel(s), 
persons, species, and gear involved in the activity, as well as any 
additional terms and conditions specified under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of 
this section.
    (4) Duration. Unless otherwise specified, authorization for an 
exempted educational activity is effective for no longer than 1 year, 
unless revoked, suspended, or modified. Authorizations may be renewed 
following the application procedures in this section.
    (5) Alteration. Any authorization that has been altered, erased, or 
mutilated is invalid.
    (6) Transfer. Authorizations issued under this paragraph (d) are not 
transferable or assignable.
    (7) Inspection. Any authorization issued under this paragraph (d) 
must be carried on board the vessel(s) for which it was issued, or be in 
the possession of at least one of the persons identified in the 
authorization, who must be present while the exempted educational 
activity is being conducted. The authorization must be presented for 
inspection upon request of any authorized officer. Activities that meet 
the definition of ``fishing,'' despite an educational purpose, are 
fishing. An authorization may allow covered fishing activities; however, 
fishing activities conducted outside the scope of an authorization for 
exempted educational activities are illegal. Any fish, or parts thereof, 
retained pursuant to an authorization issued under this paragraph must 
be accompanied, during any ex-vessel activities, by a copy of the 
authorization.
    (e) Observers. NMFS-sanctioned observers or biological technicians 
conducting activities within NMFS-approved sea sampling and/or observer 
protocols are exempt from the requirement to obtain an EFP. For purposes 
of this section, NMFS-sanctioned observers or biological technicians 
include NMFS employees, NMFS observers, observers who are employees of 
NMFS-contracted observer providers, and observers who are employees of 
NMFS-permitted observer providers.

FR 42794, Aug. 25, 2009]


<R05>
Sec. 600.746  Observers.

    (a) Applicability. This section applies to any fishing vessel 
required to carry an observer as part of a mandatory observer program or 
carrying an observer as part of a voluntary observer program under the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act, MMPA (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.), the ATCA (16 U.S.C. 
971 et seq.), the South Pacific

[[Page 111]]

Tuna Act of 1988 (16 U.S.C. 973 et seq.), or any other U.S. law.
    (b) Observer safety. An observer will not be deployed on, or stay 
aboard, a vessel that is inadequate for observer deployment as described 
in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Vessel inadequate for observer deployment. A vessel is 
inadequate for observer deployment if it:
    (1) Does not comply with the applicable regulations regarding 
observer accommodations (see 50 CFR parts 229, 285, 300, 600, 622, 635, 
648, 660, and 679), or
    (2) Has not passed a USCG Commercial Fishing Vessel Safety 
Examination, or for vessels less than 26 ft (8 m) in length, has not 
passed an alternate safety equipment examination, as described in 
paragraph (g) of this section.
    (d) Display or show proof. A vessel that has passed a USCG 
Commercial Fishing Vessel Safety Examination must display or show proof 
of a valid USCG Commercial Fishing Vessel Safety Examination decal that 
certifies compliance with regulations found in 33 CFR Chapter 1 and 46 
CFR Chapter 1, and which was issued within the last 2 years or at a time 
interval consistent with current USCG regulations or policy.
    (1) In situations of mitigating circumstances, which may prevent a 
vessel from displaying a valid safety decal (broken window, etc.), NMFS, 
the observer, or NMFS' designated observer provider may accept the 
following associated documentation as proof of the missing safety decal 
described in paragraph (d) of this section:
    (i) A certificate of compliance issued pursuant to 46 CFR 28.710;
    (ii) A certificate of inspection pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 3311; or
    (iii) For vessels not required to obtain the documents identified in 
(d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii) of this section, a dockside examination report 
form indicating the decal number and date and place of issue.
    (e) Visual inspection. Upon request by an observer, a NMFS employee, 
or a designated observer provider, a vessel owner or operator must 
provide correct information concerning any item relating to any safety 
or accommodation requirement prescribed by law or regulation, in a 
manner and according to a timeframe as directed by NMFS. A vessel owner 
or operator must also allow an observer, a NMFS employee, or a 
designated observer provider to visually examine any such item.
    (f) Vessel safety check. Prior to the initial deployment, the vessel 
owner or operator or the owner or operator's designee must accompany the 
observer in a walk through the vessel's major spaces to ensure that no 
obviously hazardous conditions exist. This action may be a part of the 
vessel safety orientation to be provided by the vessel to the observer 
as required by 46 CFR 28.270. The vessel owner or operator or the owner 
or operator's designee must also accompany the observer in checking the 
following major items as required by applicable USCG regulations:
    (1) Personal flotation devices/ immersion suits;
    (2) Ring buoys;
    (3) Distress signals;
    (4) Fire extinguishing equipment;
    (5) Emergency position indicating radio beacon (EPIRB), when 
required, shall be registered to the vessel at its documented homeport;
    (6) Survival craft, when required, with sufficient capacity to 
accommodate the total number of persons, including the observer(s), that 
will embark on the voyage; and
    (7) Other fishery-area and vessel specific items required by the 
USCG.
    (g) Alternate safety equipment examination. If a vessel is under 26 
ft (8 m) in length, and in a remote location, and NMFS has determined 
that the USCG cannot provide a USCG Commercial Fishing Vessel Safety 
Examination due to unavailability of inspectors or to unavailability of 
transportation to or from an inspection station, the vessel will be 
adequate for observer deployment if it passes an alternate safety 
equipment examination conducted by a NMFS certified observer, observer 
provider, or a NMFS observer program employee, using a checklist of USCG 
safety requirements for commercial fishing vessels under 26 ft (8 m) in 
length. Passage of the alternative examination will only be effective 
for the single trip selected for observer coverage.
    (h) Duration. The vessel owner or operator is required to comply 
with the

[[Page 112]]

requirements of this section when the vessel owner or operator is 
notified orally or in writing by an observer, a NMFS employee, or a 
designated observer provider, that his or her vessel has been selected 
to carry an observer. The requirements of this section continue to apply 
through the time of the observer's boarding, at all times the observer 
is aboard, and at the time the observer disembarks from the vessel at 
the end of the observed trip.
    (i) Effect of inadequate status. A vessel that would otherwise be 
required to carry an observer, but is inadequate for the purposes of 
carrying an observer, as described in paragraph (c) of this section, and 
for allowing operation of normal observer functions, is prohibited from 
fishing without observer coverage.

Sec. 600.747  Guidelines and procedures for determining new fisheries 
and gear.

    (a) General. Section 305(a) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act requires the 
Secretary to prepare a list of all fisheries under the authority of each 
Council, or the Director in the case of Atlantic highly migratory 
species, and all gear used in such fisheries. This section contains 
guidelines in paragraph (b) for determining when fishing gear or a 
fishery is sufficiently different from those listed in Sec. 600.725(v) 
as to require notification of a Council or the Director in order to use 
the gear or participate in the unlisted fishery. This section also 
contains procedures in paragraph (c) for notification of a Council or 
the Director of potentially new fisheries or gear, and for amending the 
list of fisheries and gear.
    (b) Guidelines. The following guidance establishes the basis for 
determining when fishing gear or a fishery is sufficiently different 
from those listed to require notification of the appropriate Council or 
the Director.
    (1) The initial step in the determination of whether a fishing gear 
or fishery is sufficiently different to require notification is to 
compare the gear or fishery in question to the list of authorized 
fisheries and gear in Sec. 600.725(v) and to the existing gear 
definitions in Sec. 600.10.
    (2) If the gear in question falls within the bounds of a definition 
in Sec. 600.10 for an allowable gear type within that fishery, as 
listed under Sec. 600.725(v), then the gear is not considered 
different, is considered allowable gear, and does not require 
notification of the Council or Secretary 90 days before it can be used 
in that fishery.
    (3) If, for any reason, the gear is not consistent with a gear 
definition for a listed fishery as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, the gear is considered different and requires Council or 
Secretarial notification as described in paragraph (c) of this section 
90 days before it can be used in that fishery.
    (4) If a fishery falls within the bounds of the list of authorized 
fisheries and gear in Sec. 600.725(v) under the Council's or 
Secretary's authority, then the fishery is not considered different, is 
considered an allowable fishery and does not require notification of the 
Council or Director before that fishery can occur.
    (5) If a fishery is not already listed in the list of authorized 
fisheries and gear in Sec. 600.725(v), then the fishery is considered 
different and requires notification as described in paragraph (c) of 
this section 90 days before it can occur.
    (c) Procedures. If a gear or fishery does not appear on the list in 
Sec. 600.725(v), or if the gear is different from that defined in Sec. 
600.10, the process for notification, and consideration by a Council or 
the Director, is as follows:
    (1) Notification. After July 26, 1999, no person or vessel may 
employ fishing gear or engage in a fishery not included on the list of 
approved gear types in Sec. 600.725(v) without notifying the 
appropriate Council or the Director at least 90 days before the intended 
use of that gear.
    (2) Notification procedures. (i) A signed return receipt for the 
notice serves as adequate evidence of the date that the notification was 
received by the appropriate Council or the Director, in the case of 
Atlantic highly migratory species, and establishes the beginning of the 
90-day notification period, unless required information in the 
notification is incomplete.

[[Page 113]]

    (ii) The notification must include:
    (A) Name, address, and telephone number of the person submitting the 
notification.
    (B) Description of the gear.
    (C) The fishery or fisheries in which the gear is or will be used.
    (D) A diagram and/or photograph of the gear, as well as any 
specifications and dimensions necessary to define the gear.
    (E) The season(s) in which the gear will be fished.
    (F) The area(s) in which the gear will be fished.
    (G) The anticipated bycatch species associated with the gear, 
including protected species, such as marine mammals, sea turtles, sea 
birds, or species listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA.
    (H) How the gear will be deployed and fished, including the portions 
of the marine environment where the gear will be deployed (surface, 
midwater, and bottom).
    (iii) Failure to submit complete and accurate information will 
result in a delay in beginning the 90-day notification period. The 90-
day notification period will not begin until the information received is 
determined to be accurate and complete.
    (3) Action upon receipt of notification--(i) Species other than 
Atlantic Highly Migratory Species. (A) Upon signing a return receipt of 
the notification by certified mail regarding an unlisted fishery or 
gear, a Council must immediately begin consideration of the notification 
and send a copy of the notification to the appropriate Regional 
Administrator.
    (B) If the Council finds that the use of an unlisted gear or 
participation in a new fishery would not compromise the effectiveness of 
conservation and management efforts, it shall:
    (1) Recommend to the RA that the list be amended;
    (2) Provide rationale and supporting analysis, as necessary, for 
proper consideration of the proposed amendment; and
    (3) Provide a draft proposed rule for notifying the public of the 
proposed addition, with a request for comment.
    (C) If the Council finds that the proposed gear or fishery will be 
detrimental to conservation and management efforts, it will recommend to 
the RA that the authorized list of fisheries and gear not be amended, 
that a proposed rule not be published, give reasons for its 
recommendation of a disapproval, and may request NMFS to publish 
emergency or interim regulations, and begin preparation of an FMP or 
amendment to an FMP, if appropriate.
    (D) After considering information in the notification and Council's 
recommendation, NMFS will decide whether to publish a proposed rule. If 
information on the new gear or fishery being considered indicates it is 
likely that it will compromise conservation and management efforts under 
the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and no additional new information is likely to 
be gained from a public comment period, then a proposed rule will not be 
published and NMFS will notify the appropriate Council. In such an 
instance, NMFS will publish emergency or interim regulations to prohibit 
or restrict use of the gear or participation in the fishery. If NMFS 
determines that the proposed amendment is not likely to compromise 
conservation and management efforts under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, NMFS 
will publish a proposed rule in the Federal Register with a request for 
public comment.
    (ii) Atlantic Highly Migratory Species. (A) Upon signing a return 
receipt of the notification by certified mail regarding an unlisted 
fishery or gear for Atlantic highly migratory species (HMS), NMFS will 
immediately begin consideration of the notification.
    (B) Based on information in the notification and submitted by the 
Council, NMFS will make a determination whether the use of an unlisted 
gear or participation in an unlisted HMS fishery will compromise the 
effectiveness of conservation and management efforts under the Magnuson-
Stevens Act. If it is determined that the proposed amendment will not 
compromise conservation and management efforts, NMFS will publish a 
proposed rule.
    (C) If NMFS finds that the proposed gear or fishery will be 
detrimental to conservation and management efforts in this initial stage 
of review, it will not publish a proposed rule and notify

[[Page 114]]

the applicant of the negative determination with the reasons therefor.
    (4) Final determination and publication of a final rule. Following 
public comment, NMFS will approve or disapprove the amendment to the 
list of gear and fisheries.
    (i) If approved, NMFS will publish a final rule in the Federal 
Register and notify the applicant and the Council, if appropriate, of 
the final approval.
    (ii) If disapproved, NMFS will withdraw the proposed rule, notify 
the applicant and the Council, if appropriate, of the disapproval; 
publish emergency or interim regulations, if necessary, to prohibit or 
restrict the use of gear or the participation in a fishery; and either 
notify the Council of the need to amend an FMP or prepare an amendment 
to an FMP in the case of Atlantic highly migratory species.

[62 FR 23669, May 1, 1997, as amended at 63 FR 7075, Feb. 12, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 600.751  Determination of need for a fishery negotiation panel.

    A Council or NMFS may establish an FNP to assist in the development 
of specific fishery conservation and management measures. In determining 
whether to establish an FNP, NMFS or the Council, as appropriate, shall 
consider whether:
    (a) There is a need for specific fishery conservation and management 
measures.
    (b) There are a limited number of identifiable interests that will 
be significantly affected by the conservation and management measure.
    (c) There is a reasonable likelihood that an FNP can be convened 
with a balanced representation of persons who:
    (1) Can adequately represent the interests identified under 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Are willing to negotiate in good faith to reach a consensus on a 
report regarding the issues presented.
    (d) There is a reasonable likelihood that an FNP will reach
    a consensus on a report regarding the issues presented within 1 year 
from date of establishment of the FNP.
    (e) The use of an FNP will not unreasonably delay Council or NMFS 
fishery management plan development or rulemaking procedures.
    (f) The costs of establishment and operation of an FNP are 
reasonable when compared to fishery management plan development or 
rulemaking procedures that do not use FNP procedures.
    (g) The Council or NMFS has adequate resources and is willing to 
commit such resources, including technical assistance, to an FNP.
    (h) The use of an FNP is in the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 600.752  Use of conveners and facilitators.

    (a) Purposes of conveners. A Council or NMFS may use the services of 
a trained convener to assist the Council or NMFS in: (1) Conducting 
discussions to identify the issues of concern, and to ascertain whether 
the establishment of an FNP regarding such matter is feasible and 
appropriate.

[[Page 115]]

    (2) Identifying persons who will be significantly affected by the 
issues presented in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (b) Duties of conveners. The convener shall report findings under 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section and shall make recommendations to the 
Council or NMFS. Upon request of the Council or NMFS, the convener shall 
ascertain the names of persons who are willing and qualified to 
represent interests that will be significantly affected by the potential 
conservation and management measures relevant to the issues to be 
negotiated. The report and any recommendations of the convener shall be 
made available to the public upon request.
    (c) Selection of facilitator. Notwithstanding section 10(e) of the 
Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), a Council or NMFS may nominate a 
person trained in facilitation either from the Federal Government or 
from outside the Federal Government to serve as an impartial, neutral 
facilitator for the negotiations of the FNP, subject to the approval of 
the FNP, by consensus. The facilitator may be the same person as the 
convener used under paragraph (a) of this section. If the FNP does not 
approve the nominee of the Council or NMFS for facilitator, the FNP 
shall submit a substitute nomination. If an FNP does not approve any 
nominee of the Council or NMFS for facilitator, the FNP shall select, by 
consensus, a person to serve as facilitator. A person designated to 
represent the Council or NMFS in substantive issues may not serve as 
facilitator or otherwise chair the FNP.
    (d) Roles and duties of facilitator. A facilitator shall:
    (1) Chair the meetings of the FNP in an impartial manner.
    (2) Impartially assist the members of the FNP in conducting 
discussions and negotiations.
    (3) Manage the keeping of minutes and records as required under 
section 10(b) and (c) of FACA.

the person or persons proposed to represent the Council or NMFS.
    (5) A proposed agenda and schedule for completing the work of the 
FNP.
    (6) A description of administrative support for the FNP to be 
provided by the Council or NMFS, including technical assistance.
    (7) A solicitation for comments on the proposal to establish the 
FNP, and the proposed membership of the FNP.
    (8) An explanation of how a person may apply or nominate another 
person for membership on the FNP, as provided under paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (b) Nomination of members and public comment. Persons who may be 
significantly affected by the development of conservation and management 
measure and who believe that their interests will not be adequately 
represented by any person specified in a document under paragraph (a)(4) 
of this section may apply for, or nominate another person for, 
membership on the FNP to represent such interests. Each application or 
nomination shall include:
    (1) The name of the applicant or nominee and a description of the 
interests such person shall represent.
    (2) Evidence that the applicant or nominee is authorized to 
represent parties related to the interests the person proposes to 
represent.
    (3) A written commitment that the applicant or nominee shall 
actively

[[Page 116]]

participate in good faith in the development of the conservation and 
management measure under consideration.
    (4) The reasons that the persons specified in the document under 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section do not adequately represent the 
interests of the person submitting the application or nomination.
    (c) Public comment. The Council or NMFS shall provide at least 30 
calendar days for the submission of comments and applications under this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 600.754  Decision to establish a fishery negotiation panel.

    (a) Determination to establish an FNP. If, after considering 
comments and applications submitted under Sec. 600.753, the Council or 
NMFS determines that an FNP can adequately represent the interests that 
will be significantly affected and that it is feasible and appropriate 
in the particular case, the Council or NMFS may establish an FNP.
    (b) Determination not to establish FNP. If, after considering such 
comments and applications, the Council or NMFS decides not to establish 
an FNP, the Council or NMFS shall promptly publish notification of such 
decision and the reasons therefor in the Federal Register and, as 
appropriate, in trade or other specialized publications, a copy of which 
shall be sent to any person who applied for, or nominated another person 
for membership on the FNP to represent such interests with respect to 
the issues of concern.


<R05>
Sec. 600.755  Establishment of a fishery negotiation panel.

    (a) General authority. (1) A Council may establish an FNP to assist 
in the development of specific conservation and management measures for 
a fishery under its authority.
    (2) NMFS may establish an FNP to assist in the development of 
specific conservation and management measures required for:
    (i) A fishery for which the Secretary has authority under section 
304(e)(5) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, regarding rebuilding of 
overfished fisheries;
    (ii) A fishery for which the Secretary has authority under 16 U.S.C. 
section 304(g), regarding highly migratory species; or
    (iii) Any fishery with the approval of the appropriate Council.
    (b) Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) In establishing and 
administering such an FNP, the Council or NMFS shall comply with the 
FACA with respect to such FNP.
    (c) Balance. Each potentially affected organization or individual 
does not necessarily have to have its own representative, but each 
interest must be adequately represented. The intent is to have a group 
that as a whole reflects a proper balance and mix of interests. 
Representatives must agree, in writing, to negotiate in good faith.
    (d) Membership. The Council or NMFS shall limit membership on an FNP 
to no more than 25 members, unless the Council or NMFS determines that a 
greater number of members is necessary for the functioning of the FNP or 
to achieve balanced membership. Each FNP shall include at least one 
person representing the Council in addition to at least one person 
representing NMFS.


<R05>
Sec. 600.756  Conduct and operation of a fishery negotiation panel.

    (a) Roles and duties of an FNP. Each FNP shall consider the issue 
proposed by the Council or NMFS for consideration and shall attempt to 
reach a consensus concerning a report to assist in the development of a 
conservation and management measure with respect to such matter and any 
other matter the FNP determines is relevant to the development of a 
conservation and management measure. An FNP may adopt procedures for the 
operation of the FNP.
    (b) Roles and duties of representative of the council or NMFS. The 
person or persons representing the Council or NMFS on an FNP shall 
participate in the deliberations and activities of the FNP with the same 
rights and responsibilities as other members of the FNP, and shall be 
authorized to fully represent the Council or NMFS in the discussions and 
negotiations of the FNP.


<R05>
Sec. 600.757  Operational protocols.

    (a) Services of conveners and facilitators. A Council or NMFS may

[[Page 117]]

employ or enter into contracts for the services of an individual or 
organization to serve as a convener or facilitator for an FNP 
established under Sec. 600.755, or may use the services of a government 
employee to act as a convener or a facilitator for such an FNP.
    (b) Councils. For an FNP proposed and established by one or more 
Councils approved expenses shall be paid out of the Council's operating 
budget.
    (c) Expenses of FNP members. Members of an FNP shall be responsible 
for their own expenses of participation in such an FNP, except that NMFS 
or the Council may, in accordance with section 7(d) of FACA, pay for a 
member's reasonable travel and per diem expenses, and a reasonable rate 
of compensation, if:
    (1) Such member certifies a lack of adequate financial resources to 
participate in the FNP.
    (2) The Council or NMFS determines that such member's participation 
in the FNP is necessary to assure an adequate representation of the 
member's interest.
    (d) Administrative support. The Council or NMFS shall provide 
appropriate administrative support to an FNP including technical 
assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 600.758  Preparation of report.

    (a) At the conclusion of the negotiations, an FNP may submit a 
report. Such report shall specify:
    (1) All the areas where consensus was reached by the FNP, including, 
if appropriate, proposed conservation and management measures.
    (2) Any other information submitted by members of the FNP.
    (b) Upon receipt of the report, the Council or NMFS shall publish 
such report in the Federal Register for public comment.


<R05>
Sec. 600.759  Use of report.

    A Council or NMFS may, at its discretion, use all or a part of a 
report prepared in accordance with Sec. 600.758 in the development of 
conservation and management measures. Neither a Council nor NMFS, 
whichever is appropriate, is required to use such report.


<R05>
Sec. 600.760  Fishery Negotiation Panel lifetime.

    (a) An FNP shall terminate upon either:
    (1) Submission of a report prepared in accordance with Sec. 
600.758; or
    (2) Submission of a written statement from the FNP to the Council or 
NMFS that no consensus can be reached.
    (b) In no event shall an FNP exist for longer than 1 year from the 
date of establishment unless granted an extension. Upon written request 
by the FNP to the Council or NMFS, and written authorization from the 
Council or NMFS (whichever is appropriate), the Secretary may authorize 
an extension for a period not to exceed 6 months. No more than one 
extension may be granted per FNP.

                 Subpart J_Essential Fish Habitat (EFH)

    Source: 67 FR 2376, Jan. 17, 2002, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 600.805  Purpose and scope.

    (a) Purpose. This subpart provides guidelines for Councils and the 
Secretary to use in adding the required EFH provisions to an FMP, i.e., 
description and identification of EFH, adverse effects on EFH (including 
minimizing, to the extent practicable, adverse effects from fishing), 
and actions to conserve and enhance EFH.
    (b) Scope--(1) Species covered. An EFH provision in an FMP must 
include all fish species in the fishery management unit (FMU). An FMP 
may describe, identify, and protect the habitat of species not in an 
FMU; however, such habitat may not be considered EFH for the purposes of 
sections 303(a)(7) and 305(b) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (2) Geographic. EFH may be described and identified in waters of the 
United States, as defined in 33 CFR 328.3, and in the exclusive economic 
zone, as defined in Sec. 600.10. Councils may describe, identify, and 
protect habitats of managed species beyond the exclusive economic zone; 
however, such habitat may not be considered EFH for the purposes of 
sections 303(a)(7) and 305(b) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Activities 
that

[[Page 118]]

may adversely affect such habitat can be addressed through any process 
conducted in accordance with international agreements between the United 
States and the foreign nation(s) undertaking or authorizing the action.


<R05>
Sec. 600.810  Definitions and word usage.

    (a) Definitions. In addition to the definitions in the Magnuson-
Stevens Act and Sec. 600.10, the terms in this subpart have the 
following meanings:
    Adverse effect means any impact that reduces quality and/or quantity 
of EFH. Adverse effects may include direct or indirect physical, 
chemical, or biological alterations of the waters or substrate and loss 
of, or injury to, benthic organisms, prey species and their habitat, and 
other ecosystem components, if such modifications reduce the quality 
and/or quantity of EFH. Adverse effects to EFH may result from actions 
occurring within EFH or outside of EFH and may include site-specific or 
habitat-wide impacts, including individual, cumulative, or synergistic 
consequences of actions.
    Council includes the Secretary, as applicable, when preparing FMPs 
or amendments under sections 304(c) and (g) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    Ecosystem means communities of organisms interacting with one 
another and with the chemical and physical factors making up their 
environment.
    Habitat areas of particular concern means those areas of EFH 
identified pursuant to Sec. 600.815(a)(8).
    Healthy ecosystem means an ecosystem where ecological productive 
capacity is maintained, diversity of the flora and fauna is preserved, 
and the ecosystem retains the ability to regulate itself. Such an 
ecosystem should be similar to comparable, undisturbed ecosystems with 
regard to standing crop, productivity, nutrient dynamics, trophic 
structure, species richness, stability, resilience, contamination 
levels, and the frequency of diseased organisms.
    Overfished means any stock or stock complex, the status of which is 
reported as overfished by the Secretary pursuant to section 304(e)(1) of 
the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (b) Word usage. The terms ``must'', ``shall'', ``should'', ``may'', 
``may not'', ``will'', ``could'', and ``can'' are used in the same 
manner as in Sec. 600.305(c).


<R05>
Sec. 600.815  Contents of Fishery Management Plans.

    (a) Mandatory contents--(1) Description and identification of EFH--
(i) Overview. FMPs must describe and identify EFH in text that clearly 
states the habitats or habitat types determined to be EFH for each life 
stage of the managed species. FMPs should explain the physical, 
biological, and chemical characteristics of EFH and, if known, how these 
characteristics influence the use of EFH by the species/life stage. FMPs 
must identify the specific geographic location or extent of habitats 
described as EFH. FMPs must include maps of the geographic locations of 
EFH or the geographic boundaries within which EFH for each species and 
life stage is found.
    (ii) Habitat information by life stage. (A) Councils need basic 
information to understand the usage of various habitats by each managed 
species. Pertinent information includes the geographic range and habitat 
requirements by life stage, the distribution and characteristics of 
those habitats, and current and historic stock size as it affects 
occurrence in available habitats. FMPs should summarize the life history 
information necessary to understand each species' relationship to, or 
dependence on, its various habitats, using text, tables, and figures, as 
appropriate. FMPs should document patterns of temporal and spatial 
variation in the distribution of each major life stage (defined by 
developmental and functional shifts) to aid in understanding habitat 
needs. FMPs should summarize (e.g., in tables) all available information 
on environmental and habitat variables that control or limit 
distribution, abundance, reproduction, growth, survival, and 
productivity of the managed species. The information should be supported

    (B) Councils should obtain information to describe and identify EFH 
from the best available sources, including peer-reviewed literature, 
unpublished

[[Page 119]]

scientific reports, data files of government resource agencies, 
fisheries landing reports, and other sources of information. Councils 
should consider different types of information according to its 
scientific rigor. FMPs should identify species-specific habitat data 
gaps and deficits in data quality (including considerations of scale and 
resolution; relevance; and potential biases in collection and 
interpretation). FMPs must demonstrate that the best scientific 
information available was used in the description and identification of 
EFH, consistent with national standard 2.
    (iii) Analysis of habitat information. (A) The following approach 
should be used to organize the information necessary to describe and 
identify EFH.
    (1) Level 1: Distribution data are available for some or all 
portions of the geographic range of the species. At this level, only 
distribution data are available to describe the geographic range of a 
species (or life stage). Distribution data may be derived from 
systematic presence/absence sampling and/or may include information on 
species and life stages collected opportunistically. In the event that 
distribution data are available only for portions of the geographic area 
occupied by a particular life stage of a species, habitat use can be 
inferred on the basis of distributions among habitats where the species 
has been found and on information about its habitat requirements and 
behavior. Habitat use may also be inferred, if appropriate, based on 
information on a similar species or another life stage.
    (2) Level 2: Habitat-related densities of the species are available. 
At this level, quantitative data (i.e., density or relative abundance) 
are available for the habitats occupied by a species or life stage. 
Because the efficiency of sampling methods is often affected by habitat 
characteristics, strict quality assurance criteria should be used to 
ensure that density estimates are comparable among methods and habitats. 
Density data should reflect habitat utilization, and the degree that a 
habitat is utilized is assumed to be indicative of habitat value. When 
assessing habitat value on the basis of fish densities in this manner, 
temporal changes in habitat availability and utilization should be 
considered.
    (3) Level 3: Growth, reproduction, or survival rates within habitats 
are available. At this level, data are available on habitat-related 
growth, reproduction, and/or survival by life stage. The habitats 
contributing the most to productivity should be those that support the 
highest growth, reproduction, and survival of the species (or life 
stage).
    (4) Level 4: Production rates by habitat are available. At this 
level, data are available that directly relate the production rates of a 
species or life stage to habitat type, quantity, quality, and location. 
Essential habitats are those necessary to maintain fish production 
consistent with a sustainable fishery and the managed species' 
contribution to a healthy ecosystem.
    (B) Councils should strive to describe habitat based on the highest 
level of detail (i.e., Level 4). If there is no information on a given 
species or life stage, and habitat usage cannot be inferred from other 
means, such as information on a similar species or another life stage, 
EFH should not be designated.
    (iv) EFH determination. (A) Councils should analyze available 
ecological, environmental, and fisheries information and data relevant 
to the managed species, the habitat requirements by life stage, and the 
species' distribution and habitat usage to describe and identify EFH. 
The information described in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this 
section will allow Councils to assess the relative value of habitats. 
Councils should interpret this information in a risk-averse fashion to 
ensure adequate areas are identified as EFH for managed species. Level 1 
information, if available, should be used to identify the geographic 
range of the species at each life stage. If only Level 1 information is 
available, distribution data should be evaluated (e.g., using a 
frequency of occurrence or other appropriate analysis) to identify EFH 
as those habitat areas most commonly used by the species. Level 2 
through 4 information, if available, should be used to identify EFH as 
the habitats supporting the highest relative abundance; growth, 
reproduction, or survival rates; and/or production rates

[[Page 120]]

within the geographic range of a species. FMPs should explain the 
analyses conducted to distinguish EFH from all habitats potentially used 
by a species.
    (B) FMPs must describe EFH in text, including reference to the 
geographic location or extent of EFH using boundaries such as longitude 
and latitude, isotherms, isobaths, political boundaries, and major 
landmarks. If there are differences between the descriptions of EFH in 
text, maps, and tables, the textual description is ultimately 
determinative of the limits of EFH. Text and tables should explain 
pertinent physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of EFH for 
the managed species and explain any variability in habitat usage 
patterns, but the boundaries of EFH should be static.
    (C) If a species is overfished and habitat loss or degradation may 
be contributing to the species being identified as overfished, all 
habitats currently used by the species may be considered essential in 
addition to certain historic habitats that are necessary to support 
rebuilding the fishery and for which restoration is technologically and 
economically feasible. Once the fishery is no longer considered 
overfished, the EFH identification should be reviewed and amended, if 
appropriate.
    (D) Areas described as EFH will normally be greater than or equal to 
aquatic areas that have been identified as ``critical habitat'' for any 
managed species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered 
Species Act.
    (E) Ecological relationships among species and between the species 
and their habitat require, where possible, that an ecosystem approach be 
used in determining the EFH of a managed species. EFH must be designated 
for each managed species, but, where appropriate, may be designated for 
assemblages of species or life stages that have similar habitat needs 
and requirements. If grouping species or using species assemblages for 
the purpose of designating EFH, FMPs must include a justification and 
scientific rationale. The extent of the EFH should be based on the 
judgment of the Secretary and the appropriate Council(s) regarding the 
quantity and quality of habitat that are necessary to maintain a 
sustainable fishery and the managed species' contribution to a healthy 
ecosystem.
    (F) If degraded or inaccessible aquatic habitat has contributed to 
reduced yields of a species or assemblage and if, in the judgment of the 
Secretary and the appropriate Council(s), the degraded conditions can be 
reversed through such actions as improved fish passage techniques (for 
stream or river blockages), improved water quality measures (removal of 
contaminants or increasing flows), and similar measures that are 
technologically and economically feasible, EFH should include those 
habitats that would be necessary to the species to obtain increased 
yields.
    (v) EFH mapping requirements. (A) FMPs must include maps that 
display, within the constraints of available information, the geographic 
locations of EFH or the geographic boundaries within which EFH for each 
species and life stage is found. Maps should identify the different 
types of habitat designated as EFH to the extent possible. Maps should 
explicitly distinguish EFH from non-EFH areas. Councils should confer 
with NMFS regarding mapping standards to ensure that maps from different 
Councils can be combined and shared efficiently and effectively. 
Ultimately, data used for mapping should be incorporated into a 
geographic information system (GIS) to facilitate analysis and 
presentation.
    (B) Where the present distribution or stock size of a species or 
life stage is different from the historical distribution or stock size, 
then maps of historical habitat boundaries should be included in the 
FMP, if known.
    (C) FMPs should include maps of any habitat areas of particular 
concern identified under paragraph (a)(8) of this section.
    (2) Fishing activities that may adversely affect EFH--(i) 
Evaluation. Each FMP must contain an evaluation of the potential adverse 
effects of fishing on EFH designated under the FMP, including effects of 
each fishing activity

[[Page 121]]

regulated under the FMP or other Federal FMPs. This evaluation should 
consider the effects of each fishing activity on each type of habitat 
found within EFH. FMPs must describe each fishing activity, review and 
discuss all available relevant information (such as information 
regarding the intensity, extent, and frequency of any adverse effect on 
EFH; the type of habitat within EFH that may be affected adversely; and 
the habitat functions that may be disturbed), and provide conclusions 
regarding whether and how each fishing activity adversely affects EFH. 
The evaluation should also consider the cumulative effects of multiple 
fishing activities on EFH. The evaluation should list any past 
management actions that minimize potential adverse effects on EFH and 
describe the benefits of those actions to EFH. The evaluation should 
give special attention to adverse effects on habitat areas of particular 
concern and should identify for possible designation as habitat areas of 
particular concern any EFH that is particularly vulnerable to fishing 
activities. Additionally, the evaluation should consider the 
establishment of research closure areas or other measures to evaluate 
the impacts of fishing activities on EFH. In completing this evaluation, 
Councils should use the best scientific information available, as well 
as other appropriate information sources. Councils should consider 
different types of information according to its scientific rigor.
    (ii) Minimizing adverse effects. Each FMP must minimize to the 
extent practicable adverse effects from fishing on EFH, including EFH 
designated under other Federal FMPs. Councils must act to prevent, 
mitigate, or minimize any adverse effects from fishing, to the extent 
practicable, if there is evidence that a fishing activity adversely 
affects EFH in a manner that is more than minimal and not temporary in 
nature, based on the evaluation conducted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section and/or the cumulative impacts analysis 
conducted pursuant to paragraph (a)(5) of this section. In such cases, 
FMPs should identify a range of potential new actions that could be 
taken to address adverse effects on EFH, include an analysis of the 
practicability of potential new actions, and adopt any new measures that 
are necessary and practicable. Amendments to the FMP or to its 
implementing regulations must ensure that the FMP continues to minimize 
to the extent practicable adverse effects on EFH caused by fishing. FMPs 
must explain the reasons for the Council's conclusions regarding the 
past and/or new actions that minimize to the extent practicable the 
adverse effects of fishing on EFH.
    (iii) Practicability. In determining whether it is practicable to 
minimize an adverse effect from fishing, Councils should consider the 
nature and extent of the adverse effect on EFH and the long and short-
term costs and benefits of potential management measures to EFH, 
associated fisheries, and the nation, consistent with national standard 
7. In determining whether management measures are practicable, Councils 
are not required to perform a formal cost/benefit analysis.
    (iv) Options for managing adverse effects from fishing. Fishery 
management options may include, but are not limited to:
    (A) Fishing equipment restrictions. These options may include, but 
are not limited to: seasonal and areal restrictions on the use of 
specified equipment, equipment modifications to allow escapement of 
particular species or particular life stages (e.g., juveniles), 
prohibitions on the use of explosives and chemicals, prohibitions on 
anchoring or setting equipment in sensitive areas, and prohibitions on 
fishing activities that cause significant damage to EFH.
    (B) Time/area closures. These actions may include, but are not 
limited to: closing areas to all fishing or specific equipment types 
during spawning, migration, foraging, and nursery activities and 
designating zones for use as marine protected areas to limit adverse 
effects of fishing practices on certain vulnerable or rare areas/
species/life stages, such as those areas designated as habitat areas of 
particular concern.
    (C) Harvest limits. These actions may include, but are not limited 
to, limits on the take of species that provide

[[Page 122]]

structural habitat for other species assemblages or communities and 
limits on the take of prey species.
    (3) Non-Magnuson-Stevens Act fishing activities that may adversely 
affect EFH. FMPs must identify any fishing activities that are not 
managed under the Magnuson-Stevens Act that may adversely affect EFH. 
Such activities may include fishing managed by state agencies or other 
authorities.
    (4) Non-fishing related activities that may adversely affect EFH. 
FMPs must identify activities other than fishing that may adversely 
affect EFH. Broad categories of such activities include, but are not 
limited to: dredging, filling, excavation, mining, impoundment, 
discharge, water diversions, thermal additions, actions that contribute 
to non-point source pollution and sedimentation, introduction of 
potentially hazardous materials, introduction of exotic species, and the 
conversion of aquatic habitat that may eliminate, diminish, or disrupt 
the functions of EFH. For each activity, the FMP should describe known 
and potential adverse effects to EFH.
    (5) Cumulative impacts analysis. Cumulative impacts are impacts on 
the environment that result from the incremental impact of an action 
when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future 
actions, regardless of who undertakes such actions. Cumulative impacts 
can result from individually minor, but collectively significant actions 
taking place over a period of time. To the extent feasible and 
practicable, FMPs should analyze how the cumulative impacts of fishing 
and non-fishing activities influence the function of EFH on an ecosystem 
or watershed scale. An assessment of the cumulative and synergistic 
effects of multiple threats, including the effects of natural stresses 
(such as storm damage or climate-based environmental shifts) and an 
assessment of the ecological risks resulting from the impact of those 
threats on EFH, also should be included.
    (6) Conservation and enhancement. FMPs must identify actions to 
encourage the conservation and enhancement of EFH, including recommended 
options to avoid, minimize, or compensate for the adverse effects 
identified pursuant to paragraphs (a)(3) through (5) of this section, 
especially in habitat areas of particular concern.
    (7) Prey species. Loss of prey may be an adverse effect on EFH and 
managed species because the presence of prey makes waters and substrate 
function as feeding habitat, and the definition of EFH includes waters 
and substrate necessary to fish for feeding. Therefore, actions that 
reduce the availability of a major prey species, either through direct 
harm or capture, or through adverse impacts to the prey species' habitat 
that are known to cause a reduction in the population of the prey 
species, may be considered adverse effects on EFH if such actions reduce 
the quality of EFH. FMPs should list the major prey species for the 
species in the fishery management unit and discuss the location of prey 
species' habitat. Adverse effects on prey species and their habitats may 
result from fishing and non-fishing activities.
    (8) Identification of habitat areas of particular concern. FMPs 
should identify specific types or areas of habitat within EFH as habitat 
areas of particular concern based on one or more of the following 
considerations:
    (i) The importance of the ecological function provided by the 
habitat.
    (ii) The extent to which the habitat is sensitive to human-induced 
environmental degradation.
    (iii) Whether, and to what extent, development activities are, or 
will be, stressing the habitat type.
    (iv) The rarity of the habitat type.
    (9) Research and information needs. Each FMP should contain 
recommendations, preferably in priority order, for research efforts that 
the Councils and NMFS view as necessary to improve upon the description 
and identification of EFH, the identification of threats to EFH from 
fishing and other activities, and the development of conservation and 
enhancement measures for EFH.
    (10) Review and revision of EFH components of FMPs. Councils and 
NMFS should periodically review the EFH provisions of FMPs and revise or 
amend EFH provisions as warranted based on available information. FMPs 
should outline the procedures the

[[Page 123]]

Council will follow to review and update EFH information. The review of 
information should include, but not be limited to, evaluating published 
scientific literature and unpublished scientific reports; soliciting 
information from interested parties; and searching for previously 
unavailable or inaccessible data. Councils should report on their review 
of EFH information as part of the annual Stock Assessment and Fishery 
Evaluation (SAFE) report prepared pursuant to Sec. 600.315(e). A 
complete review of all EFH information should be conducted as 
recommended by the Secretary, but at least once every 5 years.
    (b) Development of EFH recommendations for Councils. After reviewing 
the best available scientific information, as well as other appropriate 
information, and in consultation with the Councils, participants in the 
fishery, interstate commissions, Federal agencies, state agencies, and 
other interested parties, NMFS will develop written recommendations to 
assist each Council in the identification of EFH, adverse impacts to 
EFH, and actions that should be considered to ensure the conservation 
and enhancement of EFH for each FMP. NMFS will provide such 
recommendations for the initial incorporation of EFH information into an 
FMP and for any subsequent modification of the EFH components of an FMP. 
The NMFS EFH recommendations may be provided either before the Council's 
development of a draft EFH document or later as a review of a draft EFH 
document developed by a Council, as appropriate.
    (c) Relationship to other fishery management authorities. Councils 
are encouraged to coordinate with state and interstate fishery 
management agencies where Federal fisheries affect state and interstate 
managed fisheries or where state or interstate fishery regulations 
affect the management of Federal fisheries. Where a state or interstate 
fishing activity adversely affects EFH, NMFS will consider that action 
to be an adverse effect on EFH pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section and will provide EFH Conservation Recommendations to the 
appropriate state or interstate fishery management agency on that 
activity.

<R05>
Sec. 600.905  Purpose, scope, and NMFS/Council cooperation.

    (a) Purpose. These procedures address the coordination, 
consultation, and recommendation requirements of sections 305(b)(1)(D) 
and 305(b)(2-4) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. The purpose of these 
procedures is to promote the protection of EFH in the review of Federal 
and state actions that may adversely affect EFH.
    (b) Scope. Section 305(b)(1)(D) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act requires 
the Secretary to coordinate with, and provide information to, other 
Federal agencies regarding the conservation and enhancement of EFH. 
Section 305(b)(2) requires all Federal agencies to consult with the 
Secretary on all actions or proposed actions authorized, funded, or 
undertaken by the agency that may adversely affect EFH. Sections 
305(b)(3) and (4) direct the Secretary and the Councils to provide 
comments and EFH Conservation Recommendations to Federal or state 
agencies on actions that affect EFH. Such recommendations may include 
measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, or otherwise offset adverse 
effects on EFH resulting from actions or proposed actions authorized, 
funded, or undertaken by that agency. Section 305(b)(4)(B) requires 
Federal agencies to respond in writing to such comments. The following 
procedures for coordination, consultation, and recommendations allow all 
parties involved to understand and implement the requirements of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (c) Cooperation between Councils and NMFS. The Councils and NMFS 
should cooperate closely to identify actions that may adversely affect 
EFH, to develop comments and EFH Conservation Recommendations to Federal 
and state agencies, and to provide EFH information to Federal and state 
agencies. NMFS will work with each Council to share information and to 
coordinate

[[Page 124]]

Council and NMFS comments and recommendations on actions that may 
adversely affect EFH. However, NMFS and the Councils also have the 
authority to act independently.


<R05>
Sec. 600.910  Definitions and word usage.

    (a) Definitions. In addition to the definitions in the Magnuson-
Stevens Act and Sec. 600.10, the terms in this subpart have the 
following meanings:
    Adverse effect means any impact that reduces quality and/or quantity 
of EFH. Adverse effects may include direct or indirect physical, 
chemical, or biological alterations of the waters or substrate and loss 
of, or injury to, benthic organisms, prey species and their habitat, and 
other ecosystem components, if such modifications reduce the quality 
and/or quantity of EFH. Adverse effects to EFH may result from actions 
occurring within EFH or outside of EFH and may include site-specific or 
habitat-wide impacts, including individual, cumulative, or synergistic 
consequences of actions.
    Anadromous fishery resource under Council authority means an 
anadromous species managed under an FMP.
    Federal action means any action authorized, funded, or undertaken, 
or proposed to be authorized, funded, or undertaken by a Federal agency.
    Habitat areas of particular concern means those areas of EFH 
identified pursuant to Sec. 600.815(a)(8).
    State action means any action authorized, funded, or undertaken, or 
proposed to be authorized, funded, or undertaken by a state agency.
    (b) Word usage. The terms ``must'', ``shall'', ``should'', ``may'', 
``may not'', ``will'', ``could'', and ``can'' are used in the same 
manner as in Sec. 600.305(c).


<R05>
Sec. 600.915  Coordination for the conservation and enhancement of EFH.

    To further the conservation and enhancement of EFH in accordance 
with section 305(b)(1)(D) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, NMFS will compile 
and make available to other Federal and state agencies, and the general 
public, information on the locations of EFH, including maps and/or 
narrative descriptions. NMFS will also provide information on ways to 
improve ongoing Federal operations to promote the conservation and 
enhancement of EFH. Federal and state agencies empowered to authorize, 
fund, or undertake actions that may adversely affect EFH are encouraged 
to contact NMFS and the Councils to become familiar with areas 
designated as EFH, potential threats to EFH, and opportunities to 
promote the conservation and enhancement of EFH.


<R05>
Sec. 600.920  Federal agency consultation with the Secretary.

    (a) Consultation generally--(1) Actions requiring consultation. 
Pursuant to section 305(b)(2) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, Federal 
agencies must consult with NMFS regarding any of their actions 
authorized, funded, or undertaken, or proposed to be authorized, funded, 
or undertaken that may adversely affect EFH. EFH consultation is not 
required for actions that were completed prior to the approval of EFH 
designations by the Secretary, e.g., issued permits. Consultation is 
required for renewals, reviews, or substantial revisions of actions if 
the renewal, review, or revision may adversely affect EFH. Consultation 
on Federal programs delegated to non-Federal entities is required at the 
time of delegation, review, and renewal of the delegation. EFH 
consultation is required for any Federal funding of actions that may 
adversely affect EFH. NMFS and Federal agencies responsible for funding 
actions that may adversely affect EFH should consult on a programmatic 
level under paragraph (j) of this section, if appropriate, with respect 
to these actions. Consultation is required for emergency Federal actions 
that may adversely affect EFH, such as hazardous material clean-up, 
response to natural disasters, or actions to protect public safety. 
Federal agencies should contact NMFS early in emergency response 
planning, but may consult after-the-fact if consultation on an expedited 
basis is not practicable before taking the action.
    (2) Approaches for conducting consultation. Federal agencies may use 
one of the five approaches described in paragraphs (f) through (j) of 
this section to

[[Page 125]]

fulfill the EFH consultation requirements. The selection of a particular 
approach for handling EFH consultation depends on the nature and scope 
of the actions that may adversely affect EFH. Federal agencies should 
use the most efficient approach for EFH consultation that is appropriate 
for a given action or actions. The five approaches are: use of existing 
environmental review procedures, General Concurrence, abbreviated 
consultation, expanded consultation, and programmatic consultation.
    (3) Early notification and coordination. The Federal agency should 
notify NMFS in writing as early as practicable regarding actions that 
may adversely affect EFH. Notification will facilitate discussion of 
measures to conserve EFH. Such early coordination should occur during 
pre-application planning for projects subject to a Federal permit or 
license and during preliminary planning for projects to be funded or 
undertaken directly by a Federal agency.
    (b) Designation of lead agency. If more than one Federal agency is 
responsible for a Federal action, the consultation requirements of 
sections 305(b)(2) through (4) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act may be 
fulfilled through a lead agency. The lead agency should notify NMFS in 
writing that it is representing one or more additional agencies. 
Alternatively, if one Federal agency has completed an EFH consultation 
for an action and another Federal agency acts separately to authorize, 
fund, or undertake the same activity (such as issuing a permit for an 
activity that was funded via a separate Federal action), the completed 
EFH consultation may suffice for both Federal actions if it adequately 
addresses the adverse effects of the actions on EFH. Federal agencies 
may need to consult with NMFS separately if, for example, only one of 
the agencies has the authority to implement measures necessary to 
minimize adverse effects on EFH and that agency does not act as the lead 
agency.
    (c) Designation of non-Federal representative. A Federal agency may 
designate a non-Federal representative to conduct an EFH consultation by 
giving written notice of such designation to NMFS. If a non-Federal 
representative is used, the Federal action agency remains ultimately 
responsible for compliance with sections 305(b)(2) and 305(b)(4)(B) of 
the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (d) Best available information. The Federal agency and NMFS must use 
the best scientific information available regarding the effects of the 
action on EFH and the measures that can be taken to avoid, minimize, or 
offset such effects. Other appropriate sources of information may also 
be considered.
    (e) EFH Assessments--(1) Preparation requirement. For any Federal 
action that may adversely affect EFH, Federal agencies must provide NMFS 
with a written assessment of the effects of that action on EFH. For 
actions covered by a General Concurrence under paragraph (g) of this 
section, an EFH Assessment should be completed during the development of 
the General Concurrence and is not required for the individual actions. 
For actions addressed by a programmatic consultation under paragraph (j) 
of this section, an EFH Assessment should be completed during the 
programmatic consultation and is not required for individual actions 
implemented under the program, except in those instances identified by 
NMFS in the programmatic consultation as requiring separate EFH 
consultation. Federal agencies are not required to provide NMFS with 
assessments regarding actions that they have determined would not 
adversely affect EFH. Federal agencies may incorporate an EFH Assessment 
into documents prepared for other purposes such as Endangered Species 
Act (ESA) Biological Assessments pursuant to 50 CFR part 402 or National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documents and public notices pursuant to 
40 CFR part 1500. If an EFH Assessment is contained in another document, 
it must include all of the information required in paragraph (e)(3) of 
this section and be clearly identified as an EFH Assessment. The 
procedure for combining an EFH consultation with other environmental 
reviews is set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (2) Level of detail. The level of detail in an EFH Assessment should 
be commensurate with the complexity and

[[Page 126]]

magnitude of the potential adverse effects of the action. For example, 
for relatively simple actions involving minor adverse effects on EFH, 
the assessment may be very brief. Actions that may pose a more serious 
threat to EFH warrant a correspondingly more detailed EFH Assessment.
    (3) Mandatory contents. The assessment must contain:
    (i) A description of the action.
    (ii) An analysis of the potential adverse effects of the action on 
EFH and the managed species.
    (iii) The Federal agency's conclusions regarding the effects of the 
action on EFH.
    (iv) Proposed mitigation, if applicable.
    (4) Additional information. If appropriate, the assessment should 
also include:
    (i) The results of an on-site inspection to evaluate the habitat and 
the site-specific effects of the project.
    (ii) The views of recognized experts on the habitat or species that 
may be affected.
    (iii) A review of pertinent literature and related information.
    (iv) An analysis of alternatives to the action. Such analysis should 
include alternatives that could avoid or minimize adverse effects on 
EFH.
    (v) Other relevant information.
    (5) Incorporation by reference. The assessment may incorporate by 
reference a completed EFH Assessment prepared for a similar action, 
supplemented with any relevant new project specific information, 
provided the proposed action involves similar impacts to EFH in the same 
geographic area or a similar ecological setting. It may also incorporate 
by reference other relevant environmental assessment documents. These 
documents must be provided to NMFS with the EFH Assessment.
    (f) Use of existing environmental review procedures--(1) Purpose and 
criteria. Consultation and commenting under sections 305(b)(2) and 
305(b)(4) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act should be consolidated, where 
appropriate, with interagency consultation, coordination, and 
environmental review procedures required by other statutes, such as 
NEPA, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, Clean Water Act, ESA, and 
Federal Power Act. The requirements of sections 305(b)(2) and 305(b)(4) 
of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, including consultations that would be 
considered to be abbreviated or expanded consultations under paragraphs 
(h) and (i) of this section, can be combined with existing procedures 
required by other statutes if such processes meet, or are modified to 
meet, the following criteria:
    (i) The existing process must provide NMFS with timely notification 
of actions that may adversely affect EFH. The Federal agency should 
notify NMFS according to the same timeframes for notification (or for 
public comment) as in the existing process. Whenever possible, NMFS 
should have at least 60 days notice prior to a final decision on an 
action, or at least 90 days if the action would result in substantial 
adverse impacts. NMFS and the action agency may agree to use shorter 
timeframes provided that they allow sufficient time for NMFS to develop 
EFH Conservation Recommendations.
    (ii) Notification must include an assessment of the impacts of the 
action on EFH that meets the requirements for EFH Assessments contained 
in paragraph (e) of this section. If the EFH Assessment is contained in 
another document, the Federal agency must identify that section of the 
document as the EFH Assessment.
    (iii) NMFS must have made a finding pursuant to paragraph (f)(3) of 
this section that the existing process can be used to satisfy the 
requirements of sections 305(b)(2) and 305(b)(4) of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act.
    (2) NMFS response to Federal agency. If an existing environmental 
review process is used to fulfill the EFH consultation requirements, the 
comment deadline for that process should apply to the submittal of NMFS 
EFH Conservation Recommendations under section 305(b)(4)(A) of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act, unless NMFS and the Federal agency agree to a 
different deadline. If NMFS EFH Conservation Recommendations are 
combined with other NMFS or NOAA comments on a Federal action, such as 
NOAA comments on a draft Environmental Impact Statement, the EFH 
Conservation

[[Page 127]]

Recommendations will be clearly identified as such (e.g., a section in 
the comment letter entitled ``EFH Conservation Recommendations'') and a 
Federal agency response pursuant to section 305(b)(4)(B) of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act is required for only the identified portion of the 
comments.
    (3) NMFS finding. A Federal agency with an existing environmental 
review process should contact NMFS at the appropriate level (regional 
offices for regional processes, headquarters office for national 
processes) to discuss how to combine the EFH consultation requirements 
with the existing process, with or without modifications. If, at the 
conclusion of these discussions, NMFS determines that the existing or 
modified process meets the criteria of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, 
NMFS will make a finding that the process can be used to satisfy the EFH 
consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. If NMFS does not 
make such a finding, or if there are no existing consultation processes 
relevant to the Federal agency's actions, the agency and NMFS should 
follow one of the approaches for consultation discussed in the following 
sections.
    (g) General Concurrence--(1) Purpose. A General Concurrence 
identifies specific types of Federal actions that may adversely affect 
EFH, but for which no further consultation is generally required because 
NMFS has determined, through an analysis of that type of action, that it 
will likely result in no more than minimal adverse effects individually 
and cumulatively. General Concurrences may be national or regional in 
scope.
    (2) Criteria. (i) For Federal actions to qualify for General 
Concurrence, NMFS must determine that the actions meet all of the 
following criteria:
    (A) The actions must be similar in nature and similar in their 
impact on EFH.
    (B) The actions must not cause greater than minimal adverse effects 
on EFH when implemented individually.
    (C) The actions must not cause greater than minimal cumulative 
adverse effects on EFH.
    (ii) Actions qualifying for General Concurrence must be tracked to 
ensure that their cumulative effects are no more than minimal. In most 
cases, tracking actions covered by a General Concurrence will be the 
responsibility of the Federal agency. However, NMFS may agree to track 
such actions. Tracking should include numbers of actions and the amount 
and type of habitat adversely affected, and should specify the baseline 
against which the actions will be tracked. The agency responsible for 
tracking such actions should make the information available to NMFS, the 
applicable Council(s), and to the public on an annual basis.
    (iii) Categories of Federal actions may also qualify for General 
Concurrence if they are modified by appropriate conditions that ensure 
the actions will meet the criteria in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this 
section. For example, NMFS may provide General Concurrence for 
additional actions contingent upon project size limitations, seasonal 
restrictions, or other conditions.
    (iv) If a General Concurrence is proposed for actions that may 
adversely affect habitat areas of particular concern, the General 
Concurrence should be subject to a higher level of scrutiny than a 
General Concurrence not involving a habitat area of particular concern.
    (3) General Concurrence development. A Federal agency may request a 
General Concurrence for a category of its actions by providing NMFS with 
an EFH Assessment containing a description of the nature and approximate 
number of the actions, an analysis of the effects of the actions on EFH, 
including cumulative effects, and the Federal agency's conclusions 
regarding the magnitude of such effects. If NMFS agrees that the actions 
fit the criteria in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, NMFS will 
provide the Federal agency with a written statement of General 
Concurrence that further consultation is not required. If NMFS does not 
agree that the actions fit the criteria in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this 
section, NMFS will notify the Federal agency that a General Concurrence 
will not be issued and that another type of consultation will be 
required. If NMFS identifies specific types of Federal actions that may 
meet

[[Page 128]]

the requirements for a General Concurrence, NMFS may initiate and 
complete a General Concurrence.
    (4) Further consultation. NMFS may request notification for actions 
covered under a General Concurrence if NMFS concludes there are 
circumstances under which such actions could result in more than a 
minimal impact on EFH, or if it determines that there is no process in 
place to adequately assess the cumulative impacts of actions covered 
under the General Concurrence. NMFS may request further consultation for 
these actions on a case-by-case basis. Each General Concurrence should 
establish specific procedures for further consultation, if appropriate.
    (5) Notification. After completing a General Concurrence, NMFS will 
provide a copy to the appropriate Council(s) and will make the General 
Concurrence available to the public by posting the document on the 
internet or through other appropriate means.
    (6) Revisions. NMFS will periodically review and revise its General 
Concurrences, as appropriate.
    (h) Abbreviated consultation procedures--(1) Purpose and criteria. 
Abbreviated consultation allows NMFS to determine quickly whether, and 
to what degree, a Federal action may adversely affect EFH. Federal 
actions that may adversely affect EFH should be addressed through the 
abbreviated consultation procedures when those actions do not qualify 
for a General Concurrence, but do not have the potential to cause 
substantial adverse effects on EFH. For example, the abbreviated 
consultation procedures should be used when the adverse effect(s) of an 
action could be alleviated through minor modifications.
    (2) Notification by agency and submittal of EFH Assessment. 
Abbreviated consultation begins when NMFS receives from the Federal 
agency an EFH Assessment in accordance with paragraph (e) of this 
section and a written request for consultation.
    (3) NMFS response to Federal agency. If NMFS determines, contrary to 
the Federal agency's assessment, that an action would not adversely 
affect EFH, or if NMFS determines that no EFH Conservation 
Recommendations are needed, NMFS will notify the Federal agency either 
informally or in writing of its determination. If NMFS believes that the 
action may result in substantial adverse effects on EFH, or that 
additional analysis is needed to assess the effects of the action, NMFS 
will request in writing that the Federal agency initiate expanded 
consultation. Such request will explain why NMFS believes expanded 
consultation is needed and will specify any new information needed. If 
expanded consultation is not necessary, NMFS will provide EFH 
Conservation Recommendations, if appropriate, pursuant to section 
305(b)(4)(A) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (4) Timing. The Federal agency must submit its EFH Assessment to 
NMFS as soon as practicable, but at least 60 days prior to a final 
decision on the action. NMFS must respond in writing within 30 days. 
NMFS and the Federal agency may agree to use a compressed schedule in 
cases where regulatory approvals or emergency situations cannot 
accommodate 30 days for consultation, or to conduct consultation earlier 
in the planning cycle for actions with lengthy approval processes.
    (i) Expanded consultation procedures--(1) Purpose and criteria. 
Expanded consultation allows maximum opportunity for NMFS and the 
Federal agency to work together to review the action's impacts on EFH 
and to develop EFH Conservation Recommendations. Expanded consultation 
procedures must be used for Federal actions that would result in 
substantial adverse effects to EFH. Federal agencies are encouraged to 
contact NMFS at the earliest opportunity to discuss whether the adverse 
effects of an action make expanded consultation appropriate.
    (2) Notification by agency and submittal of EFH Assessment. Expanded 
consultation begins when NMFS receives from the Federal agency an EFH 
Assessment in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section and a 
written request for expanded consultation. Federal agencies are 
encouraged to provide in the EFH Assessment the additional information 
identified under paragraph (e)(4) of this section to facilitate review 
of the effects of the action on EFH.

[[Page 129]]

    (3) NMFS response to Federal agency. NMFS will:
    (i) Review the EFH Assessment, any additional information furnished 
by the Federal agency, and other relevant information.
    (ii) Conduct a site visit, if appropriate, to assess the quality of 
the habitat and to clarify the impacts of the Federal agency action. 
Such a site visit should be coordinated with the Federal agency and 
appropriate Council(s), if feasible.
    (iii) Coordinate its review of the action with the appropriate 
Council(s).
    (iv) Discuss EFH Conservation Recommendations with the Federal 
agency and provide such recommendations to the Federal agency, pursuant 
to section 305(b)(4)(A) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (4) Timing. The Federal agency must submit its EFH Assessment to 
NMFS as soon as practicable, but at least 90 days prior to a final 
decision on the action. NMFS must respond within 60 days of submittal of 
a complete EFH Assessment unless consultation is extended by agreement 
between NMFS and the Federal agency. NMFS and Federal agencies may agree 
to use a compressed schedule in cases where regulatory approvals or 
emergency situations cannot accommodate 60 days for consultation, or to 
conduct consultation earlier in the planning cycle for actions with 
lengthy approval processes.
    (5) Extension of consultation. If NMFS determines that additional 
data or analysis would provide better information for development of EFH 
Conservation Recommendations, NMFS may request additional time for 
expanded consultation. If NMFS and the Federal agency agree to an 
extension, the Federal agency should provide the additional information 
to NMFS, to the extent practicable. If NMFS and the Federal agency do 
not agree to extend consultation, NMFS must provide EFH Conservation 
Recommendations to the Federal agency using the best scientific 
information available to NMFS.
    (j) Programmatic consultation--(1) Purpose. Programmatic 
consultation provides a means for NMFS and a Federal agency to consult 
regarding a potentially large number of individual actions that may 
adversely affect EFH. Programmatic consultation will generally be the 
most appropriate option to address funding programs, large-scale 
planning efforts, and other instances where sufficient information is 
available to address all reasonably foreseeable adverse effects on EFH 
of an entire program, parts of a program, or a number of similar 
individual actions occurring within a given geographic area.
    (2) Process. A Federal agency may request programmatic consultation 
by providing NMFS with an EFH Assessment in accordance with paragraph 
(e) of this section. The description of the proposed action in the EFH 
Assessment should describe the program and the nature and approximate 
number (annually or by some other appropriate time frame) of the 
actions. NMFS may also initiate programmatic consultation by requesting 
pertinent information from a Federal agency.
    (3) NMFS response to Federal agency. NMFS will respond to the 
Federal agency with programmatic EFH Conservation Recommendations and, 
if applicable, will identify any potential adverse effects that could 
not be addressed programmatically and require project-specific 
consultation. NMFS may also determine that programmatic consultation is 
not appropriate, in which case all EFH Conservation Recommendations will 
be deferred to project-specific consultations. If appropriate, NMFS' 
response may include a General Concurrence for activities that qualify 
under paragraph (g) of this section.
    (k) Responsibilities of Federal agency following receipt of EFH 
Conservation Recommendations--(1) Federal agency response. As required 
by section 305(b)(4)(B) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the Federal agency 
must provide a detailed response in writing to NMFS and to any Council 
commenting on the action under section 305(b)(3) of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act within 30 days after receiving an EFH Conservation Recommendation 
from NMFS. Such a response must be provided at least 10 days prior to 
final approval of the action if the response is inconsistent with any of 
NMFS' EFH Conservation Recommendations, unless NMFS and

[[Page 130]]

the Federal agency have agreed to use alternative time frames for the 
Federal agency response. The response must include a description of 
measures proposed by the agency for avoiding, mitigating, or offsetting 
the impact of the activity on EFH. In the case of a response that is 
inconsistent with NMFS Conservation Recommendations, the Federal agency 
must explain its reasons for not following the recommendations, 
including the scientific justification for any disagreements with NMFS 
over the anticipated effects of the action and the measures needed to 
avoid, minimize, mitigate, or offset such effects.
    (2) Further review of decisions inconsistent with NMFS or Council 
recommendations. If a Federal agency decision is inconsistent with a 
NMFS EFH Conservation Recommendation, the Assistant Administrator for 
Fisheries may request a meeting with the head of the Federal agency, as 
well as with any other agencies involved, to discuss the action and 
opportunities for resolving any disagreements. If a Federal agency 
decision is also inconsistent with a Council recommendation made 
pursuant to section 305(b)(3) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the Council 
may request that the Assistant Administrator initiate further review of 
the Federal agency's decision and involve the Council in any interagency 
discussion to resolve disagreements with the Federal agency. The 
Assistant Administrator will make every effort to accommodate such a 
request. NMFS may develop written procedures to further define such 
review processes.
    (l) Supplemental consultation. A Federal agency must reinitiate 
consultation with NMFS if the agency substantially revises its plans for 
an action in a manner that may adversely affect EFH or if new 
information becomes available that affects the basis for NMFS EFH 
Conservation Recommendations.


<R05>
Sec. 600.925  NMFS EFH Conservation Recommendations to Federal and state
agencies.

    (a) General. Under section 305(b)(4)(A) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, 
NMFS is required to provide EFH Conservation Recommendations to Federal 
and state agencies for actions that would adversely affect EFH. NMFS 
will not recommend that state or Federal agencies take actions beyond 
their statutory authority.
    (b) Recommendations to Federal agencies. For Federal actions, EFH 
Conservation Recommendations will be provided to Federal agencies as 
part of EFH consultations conducted pursuant to Sec. 600.920. If NMFS 
becomes aware of a Federal action that would adversely affect EFH, but 
for which a Federal agency has not initiated an EFH consultation, NMFS 
may request that the Federal agency initiate EFH consultation, or NMFS 
will provide EFH Conservation Recommendations based on the information 
available.
    (c) Recommendations to state agencies--(1) Establishment of 
procedures. The Magnuson-Stevens Act does not require state agencies to 
consult with the Secretary regarding EFH. NMFS will use existing 
coordination procedures or establish new procedures to identify state 
actions that may adversely affect EFH, and to determine the most 
appropriate method for providing EFH Conservation Recommendations to 
state agencies.
    (2) Coordination with states on recommendations to Federal agencies. 
When an action that would adversely affect EFH is authorized, funded, or 
undertaken by both Federal and state agencies, NMFS will provide the 
appropriate state agencies with copies of EFH Conservation 
Recommendations developed as part of the Federal consultation procedures 
in Sec. 600.920. NMFS will also seek agreements on sharing information 
and copies of recommendations with Federal or state agencies conducting 
similar consultation and recommendation processes to ensure coordination 
of such efforts.
    (d) Coordination with Councils. NMFS will coordinate with each 
Council to identify the types of actions on which Councils intend to 
comment pursuant to section 305(b)(3) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. For 
such actions NMFS will share pertinent information with the Council, 
including copies of NMFS' EFH Conservation Recommendations.

[[Page 131]]


<R05>
Sec. 600.930  Council comments and recommendations to Federal and state
agencies.

    Under section 305(b)(3) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, Councils may 
comment on and make recommendations to the Secretary and any Federal or 
state agency concerning any activity or proposed activity authorized, 
funded, or undertaken by the agency that, in the view of the Council, 
may affect the habitat, including EFH, of a fishery resource under its 
authority. Councils must provide such comments and recommendations 
concerning any activity that, in the view of the Council, is likely to 
substantially affect the habitat, including EFH, of an anadromous 
fishery resource under Council authority.
    (a) Establishment of procedures. Each Council should establish 
procedures for reviewing Federal or state actions that may adversely 
affect the habitat, including EFH, of a species under its authority. 
Each Council may receive information on actions of concern by methods 
such as directing Council staff to track proposed actions, recommending 
that the Council's habitat committee identify actions of concern, or 
entering into an agreement with NMFS to have the appropriate Regional 
Administrator notify the Council of actions of concern that would 
adversely affect EFH. Federal and state actions often follow specific 
timetables which may not coincide with Council meetings. Therefore, 
Councils should consider establishing abbreviated procedures for the 
development of Council recommendations.
    (b) Early involvement. Councils should provide comments and 
recommendations on proposed state and Federal actions of concern as 
early as practicable in project planning to ensure thorough 
consideration of Council concerns by the action agency. Each Council 
should provide NMFS with copies of its comments and recommendations to 
state and Federal agencies.

600.10 of this title, the terms used in this subpart have the following 
meanings:
    Address of Record means the business address of a person, 
partnership, or corporation. Addresses listed on permits or other NMFS 
records are presumed to be business addresses, unless clearly indicated 
otherwise.
    Bid means the price a vessel owner or reduction fishery permit 
holder requests for reduction of his/her fishing capacity. It is an 
irrevocable offer in response to the invitation to bid in Sec. 
600.1009.
    Borrower means, individually and collectively, each post-reduction 
fishing permit holder and/or fishing vessel owner fishing in the 
reduction fishery.
    Business plan means the document containing the information 
specified in Sec. 600.1003(n) and required to be submitted with a 
request for a financed program.
    Business week means a 7-day period, Saturday through Friday.
    Controlling fishery management plan or program (CFMP) means either 
any fishery management plan or any state fishery management plan or 
program, including amendments to the plan or program, pursuant to which 
a fishery is managed.
    Delivery value means:
    (1) For unprocessed fish, all compensation that a fish buyer pays to 
a fish seller in exchange for fee fish; and
    (2) For processed fish, all compensation that a fish buyer would 
have paid to a fish seller in exchange for fee fish if the fee fish had 
been unprocessed fish instead of processed fish.
    Delivery value encompasses fair market value, as defined herein, and 
includes the value of all in-kind compensation or all other goods or 
services exchanged in lieu of cash. It is synonymous with the statutory 
term ``ex-vessel value'' as used in section 312 of the Magnuson Act.
    Deposit principal means all collected fee revenue that a fish buyer 
deposits in a segregated account maintained at a federally insured 
financial institution for the sole purpose of aggregating

[[Page 132]]

collected fee revenue before sending the fee revenue to NMFS for 
repaying a reduction loan.
    Fair market value means the amount that a buyer pays a seller in an 
arm's length transaction or, alternatively, would pay a seller if the 
transaction were at arm's length.
    Fee means the amount that fish buyers deduct from the delivery value 
under a financed reduction program. The fee is the delivery value times 
the reduction fishery's applicable fee rate under section 600.1013.
    Fee fish means all fish harvested from a reduction fishery involving 
a financed program during the period in which any amount of the 
reduction loan remains unpaid. The term fee fish excludes fish harvested 
incidentally while fishing for fish not included in the reduction 
fishery.
    Final development plan means the document NMFS prepares, under Sec. 
600.1006(b) and based on the preliminary development plan the requester 
submits, for a subsidized program.
    Financed means funded, in any part, by a reduction loan.
    Fish buyer means the first ex-vessel party who:
    (1) In an arm's--length transaction, purchases fee fish from a fish 
seller;
    (2) Takes fish on consignment from a fish seller; or
    (3) Otherwise receives fish from a fish seller in a non arm's-length 
transaction.
    Fish delivery means the point at which a fish buyer first purchases 
fee fish or takes possession of fee fish from a fish seller.
    Fishing capacity reduction specifications means the minimum amount 
of fishing capacity reduction and the maximum amount of reduction loan 
principal specified in a business plan.
    Fish seller means the party who harvests and first sells or 
otherwise delivers fee fish to a fish buyer.
    Fishery Management Plan (FMP) means any Federal fishery management 
plan, including amendments to the plan, that the Secretary of Commerce 
approves or adopts pursuant to section 303 of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    Fund means the Fishing Capacity Reduction Fund, and each subaccount 
for each program, established in the U.S. Treasury for the deposit into, 
and disbursement from, all funds, including all reduction loan capital 
and all fee revenue, involving each program.
    Implementation plan means the plan in Sec. 600.1008 for carrying 
out each program.
    Implementation regulations mean the regulations in Sec. 600.1008 
for carrying out each program.
    Net delivery value means the delivery value minus the fee.
    Post-bidding referendum means a referendum that follows bidding 
under Sec. 600.1009.
    Post-reduction means after a program reduces fishing capacity in a 
reduction fishery.
    Pre-bidding referendum means a referendum that occurs at any time 
after a request for a financed program but before a proposal under Sec. 
600.1008 of an implementation plan and implementation regulations.
    Preliminary development plan means the document specified in Sec. 
600.1005(g) and required to be submitted with a request for a subsidized 
program.
    Processed fish means fish in any form different from the form in 
which the fish existed at the time the fish was first harvested, unless 
any such difference in form represents, in the reduction fishery 
involved, the standard ex-vessel form upon which fish sellers and fish 
buyers characteristically base the delivery value of unprocessed fish.
    Program means each instance of reduction under this subpart, in each 
reduction fishery--starting with a request and ending, for a financed 
program, with full reduction loan repayment.
    Reduction means the act of reducing fishing capacity under any 
program.
    Reduction amendment means any amendment, or, where appropriate, 
framework adjustment, to a CFMP that may be necessary for a program to 
meet the requirements of this subpart.
    Reduction amendment specifications mean the reduction amendment to a 
CFMP specified in a business plan.
    Reduction contract means the invitation to bid under Sec. 600.1009, 
together with each bidder's irrevocable offer and NMFS' conditional or 
non-conditional

[[Page 133]]

acceptance of each such bid under Sec. 600.1009.
    Reduction cost means the total dollar amount of all reduction 
payments to fishing permit owners, fishing vessel owners, or both, in a 
reduction fishery.
    Reduction fishery means the fishery or portion of a fishery to which 
a program applies. The reduction fishery must specify each included 
species, as well as any limitations by gear type, fishing vessel size, 
geographic area, and any other relevant factor(s).
    Reduction loan means a loan, under section 1111 and section 1112 of 
Title XI of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 U.S.C. 1279f 
and g App.), for financing any portion, or all, of a financed program's 
reduction cost and repayable by a fee under, and in accordance with, 
Sec. 600.1012, Sec. 600.1013, and Sec. 600.1014.
    Reduction payment means the Federal Government's fishing capacity 
reduction payment to a fishing permit owner, fishing vessel owner, or 
both, under a reduction contract. Additionally, it is payment for 
reduction to each bidder whose bid NMFS accepts under Sec. 600.1009. In 
a financed program each reduction payment constitutes a disbursement of 
a reduction loan's proceeds and is for either revoking a fishing permit 
or both revoking a fishing permit and withdrawing a vessel from fishing 
either by scrapping or title restriction.
    Reduction permit means any fishing permit revoked in a program in 
exchange for a reduction payment under a reduction contract.
    Reduction vessel means any fishing vessel withdrawn from fishing 
either by scrapping or title restriction in exchange for a reduction 
payment under a reduction contract.
    Referendum means the voting process under Sec. 600.1010 for 
approving the fee system for repaying a reduction loan.
    Request means a request, under Sec. 600.1001, for a program.
    Requester means a Council for a fishery identified in Sec. 
600.1001(c) or a state governor for a fishery identified in Sec. 
600.1001(d), or a majority of permit holders in the fishery.
    Scrap means to completely and permanently reduce a fishing vessel's 
hull, superstructures, and other fixed structural components to 
fragments having value, if any, only as raw materials for reprocessing 
or for other non-fisheries use.
    Subsidized means wholly funded by anything other than a reduction 
loan.
    Treasury percentage means the annual percentage rate at which NMFS 
must pay interest to the U.S. Treasury on any principal amount that NMFS 
borrows from the U.S. Treasury in order to generate the funds with which 
to later disburse a reduction loan's principal amount.
    Unprocessed fish means fish in the same form as the fish existed at 
the time the fish was harvested, unless any difference in form 
represents, in the reduction fishery involved, the standard ex-vessel 
form upon which fish sellers and fish buyers characteristically base the 
delivery value of unprocessed fish.
    Vote means a vote in a referendum.

<R05>
Sec. 600.1001  Requests.

    (a) A Council, the Governor of a State under whose authority a 
proposed reduction fishery is subject, or a majority of permit holders 
in the fishery may request that NMFS conduct a program in that fishery. 
Each request shall be in writing. Each request shall satisfy the 
requirements of Sec. 600.1003 or Sec. 600.1005, as applicable, and 
enable NMFS to make the determinations required by Sec. 600.1004 or 
Sec. 600.1006, as applicable.
    (b) NMFS cannot conduct a program in any fishery subject to the 
jurisdiction of a Council or a state unless NMFS first receives a 
request from the Council or the governor to whose jurisdiction the 
fishery is subject.
    (c) For a fishery subject to the jurisdiction of a Council, only 
that Council can or must make the request. If the fishery is subject to 
the jurisdiction of two or more Councils, those Councils must make a 
joint request. No Council may make a request, or join in making a 
request, until after the Council conducts a public hearing about the 
request.
    (d) For a fishery subject to the jurisdiction of a State, only the 
Governor of that State can make the request. If the fishery is subject 
to the jurisdiction of

[[Page 134]]

two or more states, the Governors of those States shall make a joint 
request. No Governor of a State may make a request, or join in making a 
request, until the State conducts a public hearing about the request.
    (e) For a fishery under the direct management authority of the 
Secretary, NMFS may conduct a program on NMFS' own motion by fulfilling 
the requirements of this subpart that reasonably apply to a program not 
initiated by a request.
    (f) Where necessary to accommodate special circumstances in a 
particular fishery, NMFS may waive, as NMFS deems necessary and 
appropriate, compliance with any specific requirements under this 
subpart not required by statute.

[65 FR 31443, May 18, 2000, as amended at 75 FR 62328, Oct. 8, 2010]


<R05>
Sec. 600.1002  General requirements.

    (a) Each program must be:
    (1) Necessary to prevent or end overfishing, rebuild stocks of fish, 
or achieve measurable and significant improvements in the conservation 
and management of the reduction fishery;
    (2) Accompanied by the appropriate environmental, economic and/or 
socioeconomic analyses, in accordance with applicable statutes, 
regulations, or other authorities; and
    (3) Consistent with the CFMP, including any reduction amendment, for 
the reduction fishery.
    (b) Each CFMP for a reduction fishery must:
    (1) Prevent the replacement of fishing capacity removed by the 
program through a moratorium on new entrants, restrictions on vessel 
upgrades, and other effort control measures, taking into account the 
full potential fishing capacity of the fleet;
    (2) Establish a specified or target total allowable catch or other 
measures that trigger closure of the fishery or adjustments to reduce 
catch; and
    (3) Include, for a financed program in a reduction fishery involving 
only a portion of a fishery, appropriate provisions for the post-
reduction allocation of fish between the reduction fishery and the rest 
of the fishery that both protect the borrower's reduction investment in 
the program and support the borrower's ability to repay the reduction 
loan.
    (c) The Secretary may not make a fishing capacity reduction program 
payment with respect to a reduction vessel that will not be scrapped 
unless the Secretary certifies that the vessel will not be used for 
fishing in the waters of the U.S., a foreign nation, or on the high 
seas.

fishing

[[Page 135]]

vessel owners who are currently authorized to harvest fish from the 
reduction fishery, excluding those whose authority is limited to 
incidentally harvesting fish from the reduction fishery during directed 
fishing for fish not in the reduction fishery. The list shall be based 
on the best information available to the requester. The list shall take 
into account any limitation by type of fishing gear operated, size of

which both the pre-bidding referendum and the bidding under Sec. 
600.1009 will be based. The reduction loan's maximum principal amount 
cannot, at the interest rate projected to prevail at the time of 
reduction, exceed the principal amount that can be amortized in 20 years 
by 5 percent of the projected delivery value;

[[Page 136]]

    (4) States the reduction loan's repayment term and the fee rate, or 
range of fee rates, prospectively necessary to amortize the reduction 
loan over its repayment term;
    (5) Analyzes and demonstrates the ability to repay the reduction 
loan at the minimum reduction level and at various reduction-level 
increments reasonably greater than the minimum one, based on the:
    (i) Best and most representative historical fishing revenue and 
expense data and any other relevant productivity measures available in 
the reduction fishery, and
    (ii) Projected effect of the program on the post-reduction operating 
economics of typical harvesters in the reduction fishery, with 
particular emphasis on the extent to which the reduction increases the

the general economic impact on such other fisheries, and recommendations 
that could mitigate, or enable such other fisheries to mitigate, any 
undesirable impacts;
    (10) Specifies the names and addresses of record of all fish buyers 
who can, after reduction, reasonably be expected to receive deliveries 
of fee fish. This shall be based on the best information available, 
including any information that NMFS may be able to supply to the 
business planners;
    (11) Specifies, after full consultation with fish buyers, any 
special circumstances in the reduction fishery that may require the 
implementing regulations to contain provisions in addition to, or 
different from, those contained in Sec. 600.1013 and/or Sec. 600.1014 
in order to accommodate the circumstances of, and practices in, the 
reduction fishery while still fulfilling the intent and purpose of Sec. 
600.1013 and/or Sec. 600.1014--including, but not limited to:
    (i) In the case of reduction fisheries in which state data 
confidentiality laws or other impediments may negatively affect the 
efficient and effective conduct of the same, specification of who needs 
to take what action to resolve any such impediments, and
    (ii) In the case of reduction fisheries in which some fish sellers 
sell unprocessed, and other fish sellers sell processed fish to fish 
buyers, specification of an accurate and efficient method of 
establishing the delivery value of processed fish; and
    (12) Demonstrates by a survey of potential voters, or by any other 
convincing means, a substantial degree of potential voter support for 
the business plan and confidence in its feasibility.
    (o) Include the requester's statement of belief that the business

request aspects constitute a complete, realistic, and practical prospect 
for successfully completing a program in accordance with this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 600.1004  Accepting a request for, and determinations about 
initiating, a financed program.

    (a) Accepting a request. Once it receives a request, NMFS will 
review any request for a financed program to determine whether the 
request conforms with the requirements of Sec. 600.1003. If the request 
does not conform, NMFS will return the request with guidance on how to 
make the request conform. If the request conforms, NMFS shall accept it 
and publish a notice in the Federal Register requesting public comments 
on the request. Such notice shall state the name and address of record 
of each eligible voter, as well as the basis for having determined the 
eligibility of those voters. This shall constitute notice and 
opportunity to respond about

    (1) The program meets, or will meet after an appropriate reduction 
amendment, the requirements in Sec. 600.1002(a);
    (2) The CFMP meets, or will meet after an appropriate reduction 
amendment, the requirements in Sec. 600.1002(b);
    (3) The program, if successfully implemented, is cost effective;
    (4) The reduction requested constitutes a realistic and practical 
prospect for successfully completing a program in accordance with this 
subpart and the borrower is capable of repaying the reduction loan. This 
includes enabling NMFS to readily design, propose, and adopt a timely 
and reliable implementation plan as well as propose and issue timely and 
reliable implementation regulations and otherwise complete the program 
in accordance with this subpart; and
    (5) The program accords with all other applicable law.

    (a) Specify the reduction fishery.
    (b) Project the amount of the reduction and specify what a reduction 
of that amount achieves in the reduction fishery.
    (c) Project the reduction cost, the amount of reduction cost to be 
funded by Federal appropriations, and the amount, if any, to be funded 
by other sources.
    (d) Project the availability of Federal appropriations or other 
funding, if any, that completion of the program requires, including the 
time at which funding from each source will be available and how that 
relates to the time at which elements of the reduction process are 
projected to occur.
    (e) List the names and addresses of record of all fishing permit or 
fishing vessel owners who are currently authorized to harvest fish from 
the reduction fishery, excluding those whose authority is limited to 
incidentally harvesting fish from the reduction fishery during directed 
fishing for fish not in the reduction fishery. The list shall be based 
on the best information available to the requester, including any 
information that NMFS may supply to the requester, and take into account 
any limitation by type of fishing gear operated, size of fishing vessel 
operated, geographic area of operation, or other factor that the 
proposed program involves.
    (f) Specify the aggregate total allowable catch in the reduction 
fishery during each of the preceding 5 years and the aggregate portion 
of such catch harvested by the parties listed under paragraph (e) of 
this section.
    (g) Include a preliminary development plan that:
    (1) Specifies a detailed reduction methodology that accomplishes the 
maximum sustained reduction in the reduction fishery's fishing capacity 
at the least cost and in a minimum period of time, and otherwise 
achieves the program result that the requester specifies under paragraph 
(b) of this section. The methodology shall:
    (i) Be sufficiently detailed to enable NMFS to prepare a final 
development plan to serve as the basis for NMFS to readily design,

600.1002(b)(1) and (2).
    (j) Specify any other information or guidance that assists NMFS in 
preparing a final development plan and a proposed implementation plan 
and proposed implementation regulations.
    (k) Include the requester's statement of belief that the program 
constitutes a reasonably realistic and practical prospect for 
successfully completing a program in accordance with this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 600.1006  Accepting a request for, and determinations about 
conducting, a subsidized program.

    (a) Accepting a request. NMFS will review any request for a 
subsidized program submitted to NMFS to determine whether the request 
conforms with the requirements of Sec. 600.1005. If the request does 
not conform, NMFS will return it with guidance on how to make the 
request conform. If the request conforms, NMFS shall accept it and 
publish a notice in the Federal Register requesting public comments 
about the request.
    (b) Final development plan. After receipt of a conforming request, 
NMFS will prepare a final development plan if NMFS determines that the 
reduction requested constitutes a realistic and practical prospect for 
successfully completing a program in accordance with this subpart. This 
includes enabling NMFS to readily design, propose, and adopt a timely 
and reliable implementation plan as well as propose and issue timely and 
reliable implementation regulations and otherwise complete the program 
in accordance with this subpart. NMFS will, as far as possible, base the 
final development plan on the requester's preliminary development plan. 
Before completing the final development plan, NMFS will consult, as NMFS 
deems necessary, with the requester, Federal agencies, state and 
regional authorities, affected fishing communities, participants in the 
reduction fishery, conservation organizations, and other interested 
parties in preparing the final development plan.
    (c) Reaffirmation of the request. After completing the final 
development plan, NMFS will submit the plan to the requester for the 
requester's reaffirmation of the request. Based on the final development 
plan, the reaffirmation shall: (1) Certify that the final development 
plan meets, or will meet after an appropriate reduction amendment, the 
requirements in Sec. 600.1002(a);
    (2) Certify that the CFMP meets, or will meet after an appropriate 
reduction amendment, the requirements in Sec. 600.1002(b)(1) and (2); 
and
    (3) Project the date on which the requester will forward any 
necessary reduction amendment and, if the requester is a Council, 
proposed regulations to implement the reduction amendment. The requester 
shall base any necessary reduction amendment on the final development 
plan.
    (d) Determinations about conducting a subsidized program. After 
NMFS' receipt of the requester's reaffirmation, any required reduction 
amendment, and any proposed regulations required to implement the 
amendment, NMFS will initiate the program if NMFS determines that:
    (1) The program meets, or will meet after an appropriate reduction 
amendment, the requirements in Sec. 600.1002(a);

[[Page 139]]

    (2) The CFMP meets, or will meet after an appropriate reduction 
amendment, the requirements in Sec. 600.1002(b)(1) and (2); and
    (3) The program is reasonably capable of being successfully 
implemented;
    (4) The program, if successfully implemented, will be cost 
effective; and
    (5) The program is in accord with all other applicable provisions of 
the Magnuson-Stevens Act and this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 600.1007  Reduction amendments.

    (a) Each reduction amendment may contain provisions that are either 
dependent upon or independent of a program. Each provision of a 
reduction amendment is a dependent provision unless the amendment 
expressly designates the provision as independent.
    (b) Independent provisions are effective without regard to any 
subsequent program actions.
    (c) Dependent provisions are initially effective for the sole 
limited purpose of enabling initiation and completion of the pre-
reduction processing stage of a program.
    (d) All dependent provisions of a reduction amendment for a financed 
program are fully in force and effect for all other purposes only when 
NMFS either:
    (1) For bidding results that conform to the fishing capacity 
reduction specifications and are not subject to any other condition, 
notifies bidders, under Sec. 600.1009(e)(3), that reduction contracts 
then exist between the bidders and the United States; or
    (2) For bidding results that do not conform to the fishing capacity 
reduction specifications or are subject to any other condition, notifies 
bidders whose bids NMFS had conditionally accepted, under Sec. 600.1010 
(d)(8)(iii), that the condition pertaining to the reduction contracts 
between them and the United States is fulfilled.
    (e) If NMFS does not, in accordance with this subpart and any 
special provisions in the implementation regulations, subsequently make 
all reduction payments that circumstances, in NMFS' judgment, reasonably 
permit NMFS to make and, thus, complete a program, no dependent 
provisions shall then have any further force or effect for any purpose 
and all final regulations involving such dependent provisions shall then 
be repealed.


<R05>
Sec. 600.1008  Implementation plan and implementation regulations.

    (a) As soon as practicable after deciding to initiate a program, 
NMFS will prepare and publish, for a 60-day public comment period, a 
proposed implementation plan and implementation regulations. During the 
public comment period, NMFS will conduct a public hearing of the 
proposed implementation plan and implementation regulations in each 
state that the program affects.
    (b) To the greatest extent practicable, NMFS will base the 
implementation plan and implementation regulations for a financed 
program on the business plan. The implementation plan for a financed 
program will describe in detail all relevant aspects of implementing the 
program, including:
    (1) The reduction fishery;
    (2) The reduction methodology;
    (3) The maximum reduction cost;
    (4) The maximum reduction loan amount, if different from the maximum 
reduction cost;
    (5) The reduction cost funding, if any, other than a reduction loan;
    (6) The minimum acceptable reduction level;
    (7) The potential amount of the fee;
    (8) The criteria for determining the types and number of fishing 
permits or fishing permits and fishing vessels eligible to participate 
in the program;
    (9) The invitation to bid and bidding procedures;
    (10) The criteria for determining bid acceptance;
    (11) The referendum procedures; and
    (12) Any relevant post-referendum reduction procedures other than 
those in the implementation regulations or this subpart.
    (c) NMFS will base each implementation plan and implementation 
regulations for a subsidized program on the final development plan. The 
implementation plan will describe in detail all relevant aspects of 
implementing the program, including:
    (1) The reduction fishery;
    (2) The reduction methodology;
    (3) The maximum reduction cost;

[[Page 140]]

    (4) The reduction-cost funding, if any, other than Federal 
appropriations;
    (5) The criteria for determining the types and number of fishing 
permits or fishing permits and fishing vessels eligible to participate 
in the program;
    (6) The invitation to bid and bidding procedures;
    (7) The criteria for determining bid acceptance; and
    (8) Any relevant post-bidding program procedures other than those in 
the implementation regulations or this subpart.
    (d) The implementation regulations will:
    (1) Specify, for invitations to bid, bids, and reduction contracts 
under Sec. 600.1009:
    (i) Bidder eligibility,
    (ii) Bid submission requirements and procedures,
    (iii) A bid opening date, before which a bidder may not bid, and a 
bid closing date, after which a bidder may not bid,
    (iv) A bid expiration date after which the irrevocable offer 
contained in each bid expires unless NMFS, before that date, accepts the 
bid by mailing a written acceptance notice to the bidder at the bidder's 
address of record,
    (v) The manner of bid submission and the information each bidder 
shall supply for NMFS to deem a bid responsive,
    (vi) The conditions under which NMFS will accept or reject a bid,
    (vii) The manner in which NMFS will accept or reject a bid, and
    (viii) The manner in which NMFS will notify each bidder of bid 
acceptance or rejection;
    (2) Specify any other special referendum procedures or criteria; and
    (3) Specify such other provisions, in addition to and consistent 
with those in this subpart, necessary to regulate the individual terms 
and conditions of each program and reduction loan. This includes, but is 
not limited to:
    (i) Provisions for the payment of costs and penalties for non-
payment, non-collection, non-deposit, and/or non-disbursement of the fee 
in accordance with Sec. 600.1013 and Sec. 600.1014,
    (ii) Prospective fee rate determinations, and
    (iii) Any other aspect of fee payment, collection, deposit, 
disbursement, accounting, record keeping, and/or reporting.
    (e) NMFS will issue final implementation regulations and adopt a 
final implementation plan within 45 days of the close of the public-
comment period.
    (f) NMFS may repeal the final implementation regulations for any 
program if:
    (1) For a financed program, the bidding results do not conform to 
the fishing capacity reduction specifications or a post-bidding 
referendum does not subsequently approve an industry fee system based on 
the bidding results;
    (2) For a subsidized program, NMFS does not accept bids; and
    (3) For either a financed program or a subsidized program, if NMFS 
is unable to make all reduction payments due to a material adverse 
change.


<R05>
Sec. 600.1009  Bids.

    (a) Each invitation to bid, bid, bid acceptance, reduction contract, 
and bidder--or any other party in any way affected by any of the 
foregoing--under this subpart is subject to the terms and conditions in 
this section:
    (1) Each invitation to bid constitutes the entire terms and 
conditions of a reduction contract under which:
    (i) Each bidder makes an irrevocable offer to the United States of 
fishing capacity for reduction, and
    (ii) NMFS accepts or rejects, on behalf of the United States, each 
bidder's offer;
    (2) NMFS may, at any time before the bid expiration date, accept or 
reject any or all bids;
    (3) For a financed program in which bidding results do not conform 
to the fishing capacity reduction specifications, NMFS' acceptance of 
any bid is subject to the condition that the industry fee system 
necessary to repay the reduction loan is subsequently approved by a 
successful post-bidding referendum conducted under Sec. 600.1010. 
Approval or disapproval of the industry fee system by post-bidding 
referendum is an event that neither the United States nor the bidders 
can control. Disapproval of the industry fee system by an unsuccessful 
post-bidding referendum fully excuses both parties

[[Page 141]]

from any performance and fully discharges all duties under any reduction 
contract;
    (4) For a financed program in one reduction fishery that is being 
conducted under appropriate implementation regulations simultaneously 
with another financed program in another reduction fishery, where the 
acceptance of bids for each financed program is conditional upon 
successful post-bidding referenda approving industry fee systems for 
both financed programs, NMFS' acceptance of all bids is, in addition to 
any condition under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, also subject to 
the additional conditions that both referenda approve the industry fee 
systems required for both financed programs--all as otherwise provided 
in paragraph (a)(3) of this section;
    (5) Upon NMFS' acceptance of the bid and tender of a reduction 
payment, the bidder consents to:
    (i) The revocation, by NMFS, of any reduction permit, and
    (ii) Where the program also involves the withdrawal of reduction 
vessels from fishing:
    (A) Title restrictions imposed by the U.S. Coast Guard on any 
reduction vessel that is Federally documented to forever prohibit and 
effectively prevent any future use of the reduction vessel for fishing:
    (1) In any area subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, or 
any state, territory, commonwealth, or possession of the United States, 
or
    (2) On the high seas, or
    (3) In the waters of a foreign nation; or
    (B) Scrapping of all reduction vessels involved in a fishing 
capacity reduction program, unless the reduction program vessel has been 
certified by the Secretary, and the requirements established under Sec. 
600.1002(c) are met. Where reduction vessel scrapping is involved and 
the reduction vessel's owner does not comply with the owner's obligation 
under the reduction contract to scrap the reduction vessel, the 
Secretary may take such measures as necessary to cause the reduction 
vessel's prompt scrapping. The scrapping will be at the reduction vessel 
owner's risk and expense. Upon completion of scrapping, NMFS will take 
such action as may be necessary to recover from the reduction vessel 
owner any cost, damages, or other expense NMFS incurred in the scrapping 
of the reduction vessel.
    (6) Money damages not being an adequate remedy for a bidder's breach 
of a reduction contract, the United States is, in all particulars, 
entitled to specific performance of each reduction contract. This 
includes, but is not limited to, the scrapping of a reduction vessel;
    (7) Any reduction payment is available, upon timely and adequately 
documented notice to NMFS, to satisfy liens, as allowed by law, against 
any reduction permit/and or reduction vessel; provided, however, that:
    (i) No reduction payment to any bidder either relieves the bidder of 
responsibility to discharge the obligation which gives rise to any lien 
or relieves any lien holder of responsibility to protect the lien 
holder's interest,
    (ii) No reduction payment in any way gives rise to any liability of 
the United States for the obligation underlying any lien,
    (iii) No lien holder has any right or standing, not otherwise 
provided by law, against the United States in connection with the 
revocation of any reduction permit or the title restriction or scrapping 
of any reduction vessel under this subpart, and
    (iv) This subpart does not provide any lien holder with any right or 
standing to seek to set aside any revocation of any reduction permit or 
the title restriction or scrapping of any reduction vessel for which the 
United States made, or has agreed to make, any reduction payment. A lien 
holder is limited to recovery against the holder of the reduction permit 
or the owner of the reduction vessel as otherwise provided by law; and
    (8) Each invitation to bid may specify such other terms and 
conditions as NMFS believes necessary to enforce specific performance of 
each reduction contract or otherwise to ensure completing each program. 
This includes, but is not limited to, each bidder's certification, 
subject to the penalties in Sec. 600.1017, of the bidder's full 
authority to submit each bid and to dispose of the property involved in 
the bid in the

[[Page 142]]

manner contemplated by each invitation to bid.
    (b) NMFS will not invite bids for any program until NMFS determines 
that:
    (1) Any necessary reduction amendment is fully and finally approved 
and all provisions except those dependent on the completion of reduction 
are implemented;
    (2) The final implementation plan is adopted and the final 
implementation regulations are issued;
    (3) All required program funding is approved and in place, including 
all Federal appropriation and apportionment authority;
    (4) Any reduction loan involved is fully approved;
    (5) Any non-Federal funding involved is fully available at the 
required time for NMFS disbursement as reduction payments; and
    (6) All other actions necessary to disburse reduction payments, 
except for matters involving bidding and post-bidding referenda, are 
completed.
    (c) After making the affirmative determinations required under 
paragraph (b) of this section, NMFS will publish a Federal Register 
notice inviting eligible bidders to offer to the United States, under 
this subpart, fishing capacity for reduction.
    (d) NMFS may extend a bid closing date and/or a bid expiration date 
for a reasonable period. NMFS may also issue serial invitations to bid 
if the result of previous bidding, in NMFS' judgment, warrant this.
    (e) After the bid expiration date, NMFS will:
    (1) Analyze responsive bids;
    (2) Determine which bids, if any, NMFS accepts; and
    (3) Notify, by U.S. mail at each bidder's address of
    record, those bidders whose bids NMFS accepts that a reduction 
contract now exists between them and the United States--subject, where 
appropriate, to the conditions provided for elsewhere in this subpart.
    (f) NMFS will keep confidential the identity of all bidders whose 
bids NMFS does not accept. In financed programs where bidding results do 
not conform to the fishing capacity reduction specifications, NMFS also 
will keep confidential the identity of all bidders whose bids NMFS does 
accept until after completing a successful post-bidding referendum under 
Sec. 600.1010.

<R05>
Sec. 600.1010  Referenda.

    (a) Referendum success. A referendum is successful if at least a 
majority of the permit holders in the fishery who participate in the 
fishery cast ballots in favor of an industry fee system.
    (b) Pre-bidding referendum--(1) Initial referendum. An initial pre-
bidding referendum shall be conducted for each financed program. The 
business plan shall, subject to this subpart, determine the 
chronological relationship of the initial pre-bidding referendum to 
other pre-bidding aspects of the reduction process sequence. The initial 
pre-bidding referendum shall be based on the fishing capacity reduction 
specifications. If the initial pre-bidding referendum precedes the 
adoption of any necessary reduction amendment, the initial pre-bidding 
referendum shall also be based on the reduction amendment 
specifications. If the initial pre-bidding referendum follows the 
adoption of any necessary reduction amendment, the initial pre-bidding 
referendum shall also be based on the adopted reduction amendment;
    (2) Successful initial pre-bidding referendum. If the initial pre-
bidding referendum is successful, the reduction process will proceed as 
follows:
    (i) If the initial pre-bidding referendum follows reduction 
amendment adoption, no second pre-bidding referendum shall be conducted,
    (ii) If the initial pre-bidding referendum precedes reduction 
amendment adoption, a second pre-bidding referendum shall be conducted 
if, in NMFS' judgment, the reduction amendment subsequently adopted 
differs, in any respect materially affecting the borrower's reduction 
investment in the program and the borrower's ability to repay the 
reduction loan, from the reduction amendment specifications upon which 
the initial pre-bidding referendum successfully occurred. The sole 
purpose of any second pre-bidding referendum shall be to determine 
whether the voters authorize

[[Page 143]]

an industry fee system despite any such difference between the reduction 
amendment specifications and a subsequently adopted reduction amendment.
    (3) Unsuccessful initial pre-bidding referendum. If the initial pre-
bidding referendum is unsuccessful, the reduction process will either 
cease or NMFS may suspend the process pending an appropriate amendment 
of the business plan and the request.
    (c) Post-bidding referendum. A post-bidding referendum shall occur 
only if, in NMFS' judgment, the result of bidding under Sec. 600.1009 
does not conform, in any material respect, to the fishing capacity 
reduction specifications and such result justifies, in NMFS' judgment, 
conducting a post-bidding referendum. Bidding that results in reducing 
fishing capacity in any amount not less than the minimum fishing 
capacity reduction amount for any reduction loan amount not more than 
the maximum reduction loan amount, and otherwise achieves all material 
requirements of the fishing capacity reduction specifications, shall 
conform to the fishing capacity reduction specifications. The sole 
purpose of any post-bidding referendum shall be to determine whether 
voters authorize an industry fee system for bidding that results in 
reducing fishing capacity in any amount materially less than the minimum 
amount in the fishing capacity reduction specifications.
    (d) NMFS will conduct referenda in accordance with the following:
    (1) Eligible voters. The parties eligible to vote in each referendum 
are the parties whose names are listed as being eligible to vote in the 
notice published in the Federal Register under Sec. 600.1004(a);
    (2) Ballot issuance. NMFS will mail, by U.S. certified mail, return 
receipt requested, a ballot to each eligible voter. Each ballot will 
bear a randomly derived, 5-digit number assigned to each eligible voter. 
Each ballot will contain a place for the voter to vote for or against 
the proposed industry fee system and a place, adjacent to the 5-digit 
number, for the signature of the fishing permit or fishing vessel owner 
to whom the ballot is addressed or, if the fishing permit or fishing 
vessel owner is an organization, the person having authority to vote and 
cast the ballot on the organization's behalf. Each ballot will contain a 
place for the person signing the ballot to print his or her name. NMFS 
will enclose with each ballot a specially-marked, postage-paid, pre-
addressed envelope that each voter shall use to return the ballot to 
NMFS;
    (3) Voter certification. Each ballot will contain a certification, 
subject to the penalties set forth in Sec. 600.1017, that the person 
signing the ballot is the fishing permit or fishing vessel owner to whom 
the ballot is addressed or, if the fishing permit or fishing vessel 
owner is an organization, the person having authority to vote and cast 
the ballot on the organization's behalf;
    (4) Information included on a ballot. Each ballot mailing will:
    (i) Summarize the referendum's nature and purpose,
    (ii) Specify the date by which NMFS must receive a ballot in order 
for the ballot to be counted as a qualified vote,
    (iii) Identify the place on the ballot for the voter to vote for or 
against the proposed industry fee system, the place on the ballot where 
the voter shall sign the ballot, and the purpose of the return envelope,
    (iv) For each pre-bidding referendum, state:
    (A) The fishing capacity reduction specifications,
    (B) The reduction loan's repayment term, and
    (C) The fee rate, or range of fee rates, prospectively necessary to 
amortize the reduction loan over the loan's term,
    (v) For each initial pre-bidding referendum that precedes reduction 
amendment adoption, state the reduction amendment specifications,
    (vi) For each initial pre-bidding referendum that follows reduction 
amendment adoption, summarize the material aspects of the reduction 
amendment adopted,
    (vii) For each second pre-bidding referendum, summarize how the 
adopted reduction amendment materially differs from the reduction 
amendment specifications upon which a successful initial pre-bidding 
referendum occurred

[[Page 144]]

and how this material difference affects the borrower's reduction 
investment in the program and the borrower's ability to repay the 
reduction loan,
    (viii) For each post-bidding referendum, specify the actual bidding 
results that do not conform to the fishing capacity reduction 
specifications, and
    (ix) State or include whatever else NMFS deems appropriate;
    (5) Enclosures to accompany a ballot. Each ballot mailing will 
include:
    (i) A specially-marked, postage-paid, and pre-addressed envelope 
that a voter must use to return the original of a ballot to NMFS by 
whatever means of delivery the voter chooses, and
    (ii) Such other materials as NMFS deems appropriate;
    (6) Vote qualification. A completed ballot qualifies to be counted 
as a vote if the ballot:
    (i) Is physically received by NMFS on or before the last day NMFS 
specifies for receipt of the ballot,
    (ii) Is cast for or against the proposed industry fee system,
    (iii) Is signed by the voter,
    (iv) Is the original ballot NMFS sent to the voter bearing the same 
5-digit number that NMFS assigned to the voter, and
    (v) Was returned to NMFS in the specially-marked envelope that NMFS 
provided for the ballot's return;
    (6) Vote tally and notification. NMFS will:
    (i) Tally all ballots qualified to be counted as referendum votes,
    (ii) Notify, by U.S. mail at the address of record, all eligible 
voters who received ballots of:
    (A) The number of potential voters,
    (B) The number of actual voters who returned a ballot,
    (C) The number of returned ballots that qualified to be counted as 
referendum votes,
    (D) The number of votes for and the number of votes against the 
industry fee system, and
    (E) Whether the referendum was successful and approved the industry 
fee system or unsuccessful and disapproved the industry fee system, and
    (iii) If a successful referendum is a post-bidding referendum, NMFS 
will, at the same time and in the same manner, also notify the bidders 
whose bids were conditionally accepted that the condition pertaining to 
the reduction contracts between them and the United States is fulfilled;
    (7) Conclusiveness of referendum determinations. NMFS' 
determinations about ballot qualifications and about all other 
referendum matters, including, but not limited to, eligible voters and 
their addresses of record, are conclusive and final as of the date NMFS 
makes such determinations. No matter respecting such determinations 
shall impair, invalidate, avoid, or otherwise render unenforceable any 
referendum, reduction contract, reduction loan, or fee payment and 
collection obligation under Sec. 600.1013 and Sec. 600.1014 necessary 
to repay any reduction loan;
    (8) Ballot confidentiality. NMFS will not voluntarily release the 
name of any party who voted. NMFS will restrict the availability of all 
voter information to the maximum extent allowed by law; and
    (9) Conclusive authorization of industry fee system. Each successful 
referendum conclusively authorizes NMFS' imposition of an industry fee 
system--including the fee payment, collection, and other provisions 
regarding fee payment and collection under Sec. 600.1013 and Sec. 
600.1014--to repay the reduction loan for each financed program that 
NMFS conducts under this subpart.

[65 FR 31443, May 18, 2000, as amended at 75 FR 62329, Oct. 8, 2010]


<R05>
Sec. 600.1011  Reduction methods and other conditions.

    (a) Reduction permits or reduction permits and reduction vessels. 
Each program may involve either the surrender and revocation of 
reduction permits or both the surrender and revocation of reduction 
permits and the withdrawal from fishing either by title restriction or 
by scrapping of reduction vessels. No financed program may, however, 
require such title restriction or scrapping of reduction vessels unless 
the business plan voluntarily includes the same.
    (b) Reduction permit revocation and surrender. Each reduction permit 
is, upon NMFS' tender of the reduction payment for the reduction permit, 
forever revoked. Each reduction permit

[[Page 145]]

holder shall, upon NMFS' tender of the reduction payment, surrender the 
original reduction permit to NMFS. The reduction permit holder, upon 
NMFS' tender of the reduction payment, forever relinquishes any claim 
associated with the reduction permit and with the fishing vessel that 
was used to harvest fishery resources under the reduction permit that 
could qualify the reduction permit holder or the fishing vessel owner 
for any present or future limited access system fishing permit in the 
reduction fishery.
    (c) Reduction vessel title restriction or scrapping. For each 
program that involves reduction vessel title restriction or scrapping:
    (1) Each reduction vessel that is subject to title restriction only 
and is thus not required to be scrapped, is, upon NMFS' tender of the 
reduction payment, forever prohibited from any future use for fishing in 
any area subject to the jurisdiction of the United States or any State, 
territory, possession, or commonwealth of the United States. NMFS will 
request that the U.S. Coast Guard permanently restrict each such 
reduction vessel's title to exclude the reduction vessel's future use 
for fishing in any such area;
    (2) Each reduction vessel owner whose reduction vessel is required 
to be scrapped shall, upon NMFS' tender of the reduction payment, 
immediately cease all further use of the reduction vessel and arrange, 
without delay and at the reduction vessel owner's expense, to scrap the 
reduction vessel to NMFS' satisfaction, including adequate provision for 
NMFS to document the physical act of scrapping; and
    (3) Each reduction vessel owner, upon NMFS' tender of the reduction 
payment, forever relinquishes any claim associated with the reduction 
vessel and with the reduction permit that could qualify the reduction 
vessel owner or the reduction permit holder for any present or future 
limited access system fishing permit in the reduction fishery.
    (d) Fishing permits in a non-reduction fishery. A financed program 
that does not involve the withdrawal from fishing or scrapping of 
reduction vessels may not require any holder of a reduction permit in a 
reduction fishery to surrender any fishing permit in any non-reduction 
fishery or restrict or revoke any fishing permit other than a reduction 
permit in the reduction fishery, except those fishing permits 
authorizing the incidental harvesting of species in any non-reduction 
fishery during, and as a consequence of, directed fishing for species in 
the reduction fishery.
    (e) Reduction vessels disposition. Where a business plan requires 
the withdrawal from fishing of reduction vessels as well as the 
revocation of reduction permits:
    (1) Each reduction vessel that is not documented under Federal law 
must in every case always be scrapped, without regard to whether a 
program is a financed program or a subsidized program;
    (2) No financed program may require any disposition of a reduction 
vessel documented under Federal law other than the title restriction in 
paragraph (b) of this section unless the business plan volunteers to do 
otherwise; and
    (3) Any subsidized program may require the scrapping of reduction 
vessels documented under Federal law.
    (f) Reduction payments. NMFS will disburse all reduction payments in 
the amount and in the manner prescribed in reduction contracts, except 
reduction payments that a bidder's reduction-contract nonperformance 
prevents NMFS from disbursing. In financed programs, the reduction 
loan's principal amount is the total amount of all reduction payments 
that NMFS disburses from the proceeds of a reduction loan. Any reduction 
payment that NMFS, because of a bidder's reduction-contract 
nonperformance, disburses but subsequently recovers, shall reduce the 
principal amount of the reduction loan accordingly.
    (g) Effect of reduction-contract nonperformance. No referendum, no 
reduction contract, no reduction loan, and no fee payment and collection 
obligation under Sec. 600.1013 and Sec. 600.1014 necessary to repay 
any reduction loan, shall be impaired, invalidated, avoided, or 
otherwise rendered unenforceable by virtue of any reduction contract's 
nonperformance. This is without regard to the cause of, or reason for, 
nonperformance. NMFS shall endeavor to enforce

[[Page 146]]

the specific performance of all reduction contracts, but NMFS' 
inability, for any reason, to enforce specific performance for any 
portion of such reduction contracts shall not relieve fish sellers of 
their obligation to pay, and fish buyers of their obligation to collect, 
the fee necessary to fully repay the full reduction loan balance that 
results from all reduction payments that NMFS actually makes and does 
not recover.
    (h) Program completion. Other than the payment and collection of the 
fee that repays a reduction loan and any other residual matters 
regarding reduction payments and the disposition of reduction permits 
and reduction vessels, a program shall be completed when NMFS tenders or 
makes all reduction payments under all reduction contracts that 
circumstances, in NMFS' judgment, reasonably permit NMFS to make.


<R05>
Sec. 600.1012  Reduction loan.

    (a) Obligation. The borrower shall be obligated to repay a reduction 
loan. The borrower's obligation to repay a reduction loan shall be 
discharged by fish sellers paying a fee in accordance with Sec. 
600.1013. Fish buyers shall be obligated to collect the fee in 
accordance with Sec. 600.1013 and to deposit and disburse the fee 
revenue in accordance with Sec. 600.1014.
    (b) Principal amount, interest rate, repayment term, and penalties 
for non-payment or non-collection. The reduction loan shall be:
    (1) In a principal amount that shall be determined by subsequent 
program events under this subpart, but which shall not exceed the 
maximum principal amount in the fishing capacity reduction 
specifications;
    (2) At an annual rate, that shall be determined by subsequent 
events, of simple interest on the reduction loan's principal balance 
that shall equal 2 percent plus the Treasury percentage;
    (3) Repayable over the repayment term specified in the business plan 
or otherwise determined by subsequent events; and
    (4) Subject to such provisions as implementation regulations shall 
specify for the payment of costs and penalties for non-payment, non-
collection, non-deposit, and/or non-disbursement in accordance with 
Sec. 600.1013 and Sec. 600.1014.
    (c) Effect of prospective interest rate. Any difference between a 
prospective interest rate projected, for the purpose of any aspect of 
reduction planning or processing under this subpart, before the U.S. 
Treasury determines the Treasury percentage and an interest rate first 
known after the U.S. Treasury determines the Treasury percentage shall 
not void, invalidate, or otherwise impair any reduction contract, any 
reduction loan repayment obligation, or any other aspect of the 
reduction process under this subpart. Should any such difference result 
in a reduction loan that cannot, at the maximum fee rate allowed by law, 
be repaid, as previously projected, within the maximum maturity, any 
amount of the reduction loan remaining unpaid at maturity shall be 
repaid after maturity by continuing fee payment and collection under 
this subpart at such maximum fee rate until the reduction loan's unpaid 
principal balance and accrued interest is fully repaid. The above 
notwithstanding, at the discretion of the Secretary, the reduction 
contract can be voided if a material adverse change affects the 
reduction contract, reduction loan obligation, or any other aspect of 
the reduction process under this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 600.1013  Fee payment and collection.

    (a) Amount. The fee amount is the delivery value times the fee rate.
    (b) Rate. NMFS will establish the fee rate. The fee rate may not 
exceed 5 percent of the delivery value. NMFS will establish the initial 
fee rate by calculating the fee revenue annually required to amortize a 
reduction loan over the reduction loan's term, projecting the annual 
delivery value, and expressing such fee revenue as a percentage of such 
delivery value. Before each anniversary of the initial fee rate 
determination, NMFS will recalculate the fee rate reasonably required to 
ensure reduction loan repayment. This will include any changed delivery 
value projections and any adjustment required to correct for previous 
delivery values higher or lower than projected.
    (c) Payment and collection. (1) The full fee is due and payable at 
the time of

[[Page 147]]

fish delivery. Each fish buyer shall collect the fee at the time of fish 
delivery by deducting the fee from the delivery value before paying, or 
promising to pay, the net delivery value. Each fish seller shall pay the 
fee at the time of fish delivery by receiving from the fish buyer the 
net delivery value, or the fish buyer's promise to pay the net delivery 
value, rather than the delivery value. Regardless of when the fish buyer 
pays the net delivery value, the fish buyer shall collect the fee at the 
time of fish delivery;
    (2) In the event of any post-delivery payment for fee fish--
including, but not limited to bonuses--whose amount depends on 
conditions that cannot be known until after fish delivery, that either 
first determines the delivery value or later increases the previous 
delivery value, the fish seller shall pay, and the fish buyer shall 
collect, at the time the amount of such post-delivery payment first 
becomes known, the fee that would otherwise have been due and payable as 
if the amount of the post-delivery payment had been known, and as if the 
post-delivery payment had consequently occurred, at the time of initial 
fish delivery;
    (3)(i) Each fish seller shall be deemed to be, for the purpose of 
the fee collection, deposit, disbursement, and accounting requirements 
of this subpart, both the fish seller and the fish buyer, and shall be 
responsible for all requirements and liable for any penalties under this 
subpart applicable to fish sellers and/or fish buyers, each time that a 
fish seller sells fee fish to:
    (A) Any party whose place of business is not located in the United 
States, who does not take delivery or possession of the fee fish in the 
United States, who is not otherwise subject to this subpart, or to whom 
or against whom NMFS cannot otherwise apply or enforce this subpart,
    (B) Any party who is a general food-service wholesaler or supplier, 
a restaurant, a retailer, a consumer, some other type of end-user, or 
some other party not engaged in the business of buying fish from fish 
sellers for the purpose of reselling the fish, either with or without 
processing the fish, or
    (C) Any other party who the fish seller has good reason to believe 
is a party not subject to this subpart or to whom or against whom NMFS 
cannot otherwise apply or enforce this subpart,
    (ii) In each such case the fish seller shall, with respect to the 
fee fish involved in each such case, discharge, in addition to the fee 
payment requirements of this subpart, all the fee collection, deposit, 
disbursement, accounting, record keeping, and reporting requirements 
that this subpart otherwise imposes on the fish buyer, and the fish 
seller shall be subject to all the penalties this subpart provides for a 
fish buyer's failure to discharge such requirements;
    (4) Fee payment begins on the date NMFS specifies under the 
notification procedures of paragraph (d) of this section and continues 
without interruption at the fee rates NMFS specifies in accordance this 
subpart until NMFS determines that the reduction loan is fully repaid. 
If a reduction loan is, for any reason, not fully repaid at the maturity 
of the reduction loan's original amortization period, fee payment and 
collection shall continue until the reduction loan is fully repaid, 
notwithstanding that the time required to fully repay the reduction loan 
exceeds the reduction loan's initially permissible maturity.
    (d) Notification. (1) At least 30 days before the effective date of 
any fee or of any fee rate change, NMFS will publish a Federal Register 
notice establishing the date from and after which the fee or fee rate 
change is effective. NMFS will then also send, by U.S. mail, an 
appropriate notification to each affected fish seller and fish buyer of 
whom NMFS has notice;
    (2) When NMFS determines that a reduction loan is fully repaid, NMFS 
will publish a Federal Register notice that the fee is no longer in 
effect and should no longer be either paid or collected. NMFS will then 
also send, by U.S. mail, notification to each affected fish seller and 
fish buyer of whom NMFS has knowledge;
    (3) If NMFS fails to notify a fish seller or a fish buyer by U.S. 
mail, or if the fish seller or fish buyer otherwise does not receive the 
notice, of the date fee payments start or of the fee rate in effect, 
each fish seller is, nevertheless, obligated to pay the fee at the fee 
rate

[[Page 148]]

in effect and each fish buyer is, nevertheless, obligated to collect the 
fee at the fee rate in effect.
    (e) Failure to pay or collect. (1) If a fish buyer refuses to 
collect the fee in the amount and manner that this subpart requires, the 
fish seller shall then advise the fish buyer of the fish seller's fee 
payment obligation and of the fish buyer's fee collection obligation. If 
the fish buyer still refuses to properly collect the fee, the fish 
seller, within the next 7 calendar days, shall forward the fee to NMFS. 
The fish seller at the same time shall also advise NMFS in writing of 
the full particulars, including:
    (i) The fish buyer's and fish seller's name, address, and telephone 
number,
    (ii) The name of the fishing vessel from which the fish seller made 
fish delivery and the date of doing so,
    (iii) The quantity and delivery value of each species of fee fish 
that the fish seller delivered, and
    (iv) The fish buyer's reason, if known, for refusing to collect the 
fee in accordance with this subpart;
    (2) If a fish seller refuses to pay the fee in the amount and manner 
that this subpart requires, the fish buyer shall then advise the fish 
seller of the fish buyer's collection obligation and of the fish 
seller's payment obligation. If the fish seller still refuses to pay the 
fee, the fish buyer shall then either deduct the fee from the delivery 
value over the fish seller's protest or refuse to buy the fee fish. The 
fish buyer shall also, within the next 7 calendar days, advise NMFS in 
writing of the full particulars, including:
    (i) The fish buyer's and fish seller's name, address, and telephone 
number,
    (ii) The name of the fishing vessel from which the fish seller made 
or attempted to make fish delivery and the date of doing so,
    (iii) The quantity and delivery value of each species of fee fish 
the fish seller delivered or attempted to deliver,
    (iv) Whether the fish buyer deducted the fee over the fish seller's 
protest or refused to buy the fee fish, and
    (v) The fish seller's reason, if known, for refusing to pay the fee 
in accordance with this subpart.
    (f) Implementation regulations at variance with this section. If any 
special circumstances in a reduction fishery require, in NMFS's 
judgment, fee payment and/or collection provisions in addition to, or 
different from, those in this section in order to accommodate the 
circumstances of, and practices in, a reduction fishery while still 
fulfilling the intent and purpose of this section, NMFS may, 
notwithstanding this section, include such provisions in the 
implementation regulations for such reduction fishery.


<R05>
Sec. 600.1014  Fee collection deposits, disbursements, records, and
reports.

    (a) Deposit accounts. Each fish buyer that this subpart requires to 
collect a fee shall maintain a segregated account at a federally insured 
financial institution for the sole purpose of depositing collected fee 
revenue and disbursing the fee revenue directly to NMFS in accordance 
with paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) Fee collection deposits. Each fish buyer, no less frequently 
than at the end of each business week, shall deposit, in the deposit 
account established under paragraph (a) of this section, all fee 
revenue, not previously deposited, that the fish buyer collects through 
a date not more than two calendar days before the date of deposit. 
Neither the deposit account nor the principal amount of deposits in the 
account may be pledged, assigned, or used for any purpose other than 
aggregating collected fee revenue for disbursement to the Fund in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The fish buyer is 
entitled, at any time, to withdraw deposit interest, if any, but never 
deposit principal, from the deposit account for the fish buyer's own use 
and purposes.
    (c) Deposit principal disbursement. On the last business day of each 
month, or more frequently if the amount in the account exceeds the 
account limit for insurance purposes, the fish buyer shall disburse to 
NMFS the full amount of deposit principal then in the deposit account. 
The fish buyer shall do this by check made payable to the Fund 
subaccount to which the deposit principal relates. The fish buyer shall 
mail each such check to the Fund subaccount lockbox that NMFS 
establishes for the receipt of the disbursements for each

[[Page 149]]

program. Each disbursement shall be accompanied by the fish buyer's 
settlement sheet completed in the manner and form that NMFS specifies. 
NMFS will specify the Fund subaccount lockbox and the manner and form of 
settlement sheet by means of the notification in Sec. 600.1013(d).
    (d) Records maintenance. Each fish buyer shall maintain, in a secure 
and orderly manner for a period of at least 3 years from the date of 
each transaction involved, at least the following information:
    (1) For all deliveries of fee fish that the fish buyer buys from 
each fish seller:
    (i) The date of delivery,
    (ii) The seller's identity,
    (iii) The weight, number, or volume of each species of fee fish 
delivered,
    (iv) The identity of the fishing vessel that delivered the fee fish,
    (v) The delivery value of each species of fee fish,
    (vi) The net delivery value,
    (vii) The identity of the party to whom the net delivery value is 
paid, if other than the fish seller,
    (viii) The date the net delivery value was paid, and
    (ix) The total fee amount collected;
    (2) For all fee collection deposits to and disbursements from the 
deposit account:
    (i) The dates and amounts of deposits,
    (ii) The dates and amounts of disbursements to the Fund's lockbox 
account, and
    (iii) The dates and amounts of disbursements to the fish buyer or 
other parties of interest earned on deposits.
    (e) Annual report. In each year, on the date to be specified in each 
implementation regulation, succeeding the year during which NMFS first 
implemented a fee, each fish buyer shall submit to NMFS a report, on or 
in the form NMFS specifies, containing the following information for the 
preceding year, or whatever longer period may be involved in the first 
annual report, for all fee fish each fish buyer purchases from fish 
sellers: (1) Total weight, number, or volume bought;
    (2) Total delivery value paid;
    (3) Total fee amounts collected;
    (4) Total fee collection amounts deposited by month;
    (5) Dates and amounts of monthly disbursements to each Fund lockbox 
account;
    (6) Total amount of interest earned on deposits; and
    (7) Depository account balance at year-end.
    (f) State records. If landing records that a state requires from 
fish sellers contain some or all of the data that this section requires 
and state confidentiality laws or regulations do not prevent NMFS' 
access to the records maintained for the state, then fish buyers can use 
such records to meet appropriate portions of this section's 
recordkeeping requirements. If, however, state confidentiality laws or 
regulations make such records unavailable to NMFS, then fish buyers 
shall maintain separate records for NMFS that meet the requirements of 
this section. If any state law or regulation prohibits fish buyers, or 
fish sellers where appropriate, from keeping, for the purpose of 
complying with any requirement of this section, separate records that 
involve some or all of the same data elements as the landing records 
that the fish buyers also keep, for state purposes and under state law 
or regulation, then a financed reduction program will not be possible.
    (g) Audits. NMFS or its agents may audit, in whatever manner NMFS 
believes reasonably necessary for the duly diligent administration of 
reduction loans, the financial records of fish buyers and fish sellers 
in each reduction fishery in order to ensure proper fee payment, 
collection, deposit, disbursement, accounting, record keeping, and 
reporting. Fish buyers and fish sellers shall make all records of all 
program transactions involving post-reduction fish harvests, fish 
deliveries, and fee payments, collections, deposits, disbursements, 
accounting, record keeping, and reporting available to NMFS or NMFS' 
agents at reasonable times and places and promptly provide all requested 
information reasonably related to these records that such fish sellers 
and fish buyers may otherwise lawfully provide. Trip tickets (or similar 
accounting records establishing the pounds of fee fish that each fish 
buyer

[[Page 150]]

buys from each fish seller each time that each fish buyer does so and 
each price that each fish buyer then pays to each fish seller for the 
fee fish) are essential audit documentation.
    (h) Confidentiality of records. NMFS and NMFS' auditing agents shall 
maintain the confidentiality of all data to which NMFS has access under 
this section and shall neither release the data nor allow the data's use 
for any purpose other than the purpose of this subpart; provided, 
however, that NMFS may aggregate such data so as to preclude their 
identification with any fish buyer or any fish seller and use them in 
the aggregate for other purposes).
    (i) Refunds. When NMFS determines that a reduction loan is fully 
repaid, NMFS will refund any excess fee receipts, on a last-in/first-out 
basis, to the fish buyers. Fish buyers shall return the refunds, on a 
last-in/first-out basis, to the fish sellers who paid the amounts 
refunded.
    (j) Implementation regulations at variance with this section. If any 
special circumstances in a reduction fishery require, in NMFS's 
judgment, fee collection deposit, disbursement, or records provisions in 
addition to, or different from, those in this section in order to 
accommodate the circumstances of, and practices in, a reduction fishery 
while still fulfilling the intent and purpose of this section, NMFS may, 
notwithstanding this section, include such provisions in the 
implementation regulations for such reduction fishery.


<R05>
Sec. 600.1015  Late charges.

    The late charge to fish buyers for fee payment, collection, deposit, 
and/or disbursement shall be one and one-half (1.5) percent per month, 
or the maximum rate permitted by state law, for the total amount of the 
fee not paid, collected, deposited, and/or disbursed when due to be 
paid, collected, deposited, and/or disbursed. The full late charge shall 
apply to the fee for each month or portion of a month that the fee 
remains unpaid, uncollected, undeposited, and/or undisbursed.


<R05>
Sec. 600.1016  Enforcement.

    In accordance with applicable law or other authority, NMFS may take 
appropriate action against each fish seller and/or fish buyer 
responsible for non-payment, non-collection, non-deposit, and/or non-
disbursement of the fee in accordance with this subpart to enforce the 
collection from such fish seller and/or fish buyer of any fee (including 
penalties and all costs of collection) due and owing the United States 
on account of the loan that such fish seller and/or fish buyer should 
have, but did not, pay, collect, deposit, and/or disburse in accordance 
with this subpart. All such loan recoveries shall be applied to reduce 
the unpaid balance of the loan.

the Magnuson-Stevens Act and 15 CFR part 904 provide--including, but not 
limited to: civil penalties, sanctions, forfeitures, and punishment for 
criminal offenses--and to the full penalties and punishments otherwise 
provided by any other applicable law of the United States.
    (c) Additionally, NMFS may take any and all appropriate actions, 
including the communication of action at law, against each party 
responsible for the non-payment, non-collection, non-deposit, and/or 
non-disbursement in accordance with Sec. 600.1013 and/or Sec. 600.1014 
to enforce the United States' receipt from such party of any fee--

United States on account of the reduction loan that such party should 
have, but did not, pay, collect, deposit, and/or disburse in accordance 
with Sec. 600.1013 and/or Sec. 600.1014. All such reduction loan 
recoveries shall be applied to reduce the unpaid balances of reduction 
loans.

Sec. 600.1100  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 600.1101  Inshore fee system for repayment of the loan to 
harvesters of Pollock from the directed fishing allowance allocated to 

the inshore component under section 206(b)(1) of the AFA.

    (a) Definition. In addition to the definitions in the Magnuson-
Stevens Act

[[Page 152]]

and in Sec. 679.2 of this title, the terms used in this subpart have 
the following meanings:
    American Fisheries Act (AFA) means Title II of Pub.L. 105-277.
    Borrower means (individually and collectively) all persons who, 
after January 1, 2000, harvest fee fish from the IC directed fishing 
allowance.
    Business week means a 7-day period, Saturday through Friday.
    Delivery value means the gross ex-vessel value of all fee fish at 
fish delivery.
    Deposit principal means all collected fee revenue that a fish buyer 
deposits in a segregated deposit account maintained in a federally 
chartered national bank for the sole purpose of aggregating collected 
fee revenue before sending the fee revenue to NMFS for repaying the 
loan.
    Fee means the six-tenths (0.6) of one cent that fish buyers deduct 
at fish delivery from the delivery value of each pound of round weight 
fee fish.
    Fee fish means all pollock harvested from the IC directed fishing 
allowance beginning on February 10, 2000 and ending at such time as the 
loan's principal and interest are fully repaid.
    Fish buyer means the first ex-vessel fish buyer who purchases fee 
fish from a fish seller.
    Fish delivery means the point at which a fish buyer first takes 
delivery or possession of fee fish from a fish seller.
    Fish seller means the harvester who catches and first sells fee fish 
to a fish buyer.
    IC directed fishing allowance means the directed fishing allowance 
allocated to the inshore component under section 206(b)(1) of the AFA.
    Loan means the loan authorized by section 207(a) of the AFA.
    Net delivery value means the delivery value minus the fee.
    Subaccount means the Inshore Component Pollock Subaccount of the 
Fishing Capacity Reduction Fund in the U.S. Treasury for the deposit of 
all funds involving the loan.
    (b) Loan--(1) Principal amount. The loan's principal amount is 
$75,000,000 (seventy five million dollars).
    (2) Interest. Interest shall, from December 30, 1998, when NMFS 
disbursed the loan, until the date the borrower fully repays the loan, 
accrue at a fixed rate of 7.09 percent. Interest shall be simple 
interest and shall accrue on the basis of a 365-day year.
    (3) Repayment. The fee shall be the exclusive source of loan 
repayment. The fee shall be paid on all fee fish.
    (4) Application of fee receipts. NMFS shall apply all fee receipts 
it receives, first, to payment of the loan's accrued interest and, 
second, to reduction of the loan's principal balance.
    (5) Obligation. The borrower shall repay the loan in accordance with 
the AFA and this subpart.
    (c) Fee payment and collection--(1) Payment and collection. (i) The 
fee is due and payable at the time of fish delivery. Each fish buyer 
shall collect the fee at the time of fish delivery by deducting the fee 
from the delivery value before paying or promising later to pay the net 
delivery value. Each fish seller shall pay the fee at the time of fish 
delivery by receiving from the fish buyer the net delivery value or the 
fish buyer's promise later to pay the net delivery value rather than the 
delivery value. Regardless of when the fish buyer pays the net delivery 
value, the fish buyer shall collect the fee at the time of fish 
delivery;
    (ii)(A) Each fish seller shall be deemed, for the purpose of the fee 
collection, deposit, disbursement, and accounting requirements of this 
subpart, to be both the fish seller and the fish buyer--and all 
requirements and penalties under this subpart applicable to both a fish 
seller and a fish buyer shall equally apply to the fish seller--each 
time that the fish seller sells fee fish to:
    (1) Any fish buyer whose place of business is not located in the 
United States, who does not take delivery or possession of the fee fish 
in the United States, who is not otherwise subject to this subpart, or 
to whom or against whom NMFS cannot otherwise apply or enforce this 
subpart,
    (2) Any fish buyer who is a general food-service wholesaler or 
supplier, a restaurant, a retailer, a consumer, some other type of end-
user, or some other fish buyer not engaged in the business of buying 
fish from fish sellers for the purpose of reselling the fish, or

[[Page 153]]

    (3) Any other fish buyer who the fish seller has good reason to 
believe is a fish buyer not subject to this subpart or to whom or 
against whom NMFS cannot otherwise apply or enforce this subpart,
    (B) In each such case the fish seller shall, with respect to the fee 
fish involved in each such case, discharge, in addition to the fee 
payment requirements of this subpart, all the fee collection, deposit, 
disbursement, accounting, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements that 
this subpart otherwise imposes on the fish buyer, and the fish seller 
shall be subject to all the penalties this subpart provides for a fish 
buyer's failure to discharge such requirements;
    (2) Notification. (i) NMFS will send an appropriate fee payment and 
collection commencement notification to each affected fish seller and 
fish buyer of whom NMFS has knowledge.
    (ii) When NMFS determines that the loan is fully repaid, NMFS will 
publish a Federal Register notification that the fee is no longer in 
effect and should no longer be either paid or collected. NMFS will then 
also send an appropriate fee termination notification to each affected 
fish seller and fish buyer of whom NMFS has knowledge;
    (3) Failure to pay or collect. (i) If a fish buyer refuses to 
collect the fee in the amount and manner that this subpart requires, the 
fish seller shall then advise the fish buyer of the fish seller's fee 
payment obligation and of the fish buyer's fee collection obligation. If 
the fish buyer still refuses to properly collect the fee, the fish 
seller, within the next 7 calendar days, shall forward the fee to NMFS. 
The fish seller at the same time shall also advise NMFS in writing of 
the full particulars, including:
    (A) The fish buyer's and fish seller's name, address, and telephone 
number,
    (B) The name of the fishing vessel from which the fish seller made 
fish delivery and the date of doing so,
    (C) The quantity and delivery value of fee fish that the fish seller 
delivered, and
    (D) The fish buyer's reason (if known) for refusing to collect the 
fee in accordance with this subpart;
    (ii) If a fish seller refuses to pay the fee in the amount and 
manner that this subpart requires, the fish buyer shall then advise the 
fish seller of the fish buyer's collection obligation and of the fish 
seller's payment obligation. If the fish seller still refuses to pay the 
fee, the fish buyer shall then either deduct the fee from the delivery 
value over the fish seller's protest or refuse to buy the fee fish. The 
fish buyer shall also, within the next 7 calendar days, advise NMFS in 
writing of the full particulars, including:
    (A) The fish buyer's and fish seller's name, address, and telephone 
number,
    (B) The name of the fishing vessel from which the fish seller made 
or attempted to make fish delivery and the date of doing so,
    (C) The quantity and delivery value of fee fish the fish seller 
delivered or attempted to deliver,
    (D) Whether the fish buyer deducted the fee over the fish seller's 
protest or refused to buy the fee fish, and
    (E) The fish seller's reason (if known) for refusing to pay the fee 
in accordance with this subpart.
    (d) Fee collection deposits, disbursements, records, and reports--
(1) Deposit accounts. Each fish buyer that this subpart requires to 
collect a fee shall maintain a segregated account at a federally insured 
financial institution for the sole purpose of depositing collected fee 
revenue and disbursing the fee revenue directly to NMFS in accordance 
with paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) Fee collection deposits. Each fish buyer, no less frequently 
than at the end of each business week, shall deposit, in the deposit 
account established under paragraph (a) of this section, all fee 
revenue, not previously deposited, that the fish buyer has collected 
through a date not more than 2 calendar days before the date of deposit. 
Neither the deposit account nor the principal amount of deposits in the 
account may be pledged, assigned, or used for any purpose other than 
aggregating collected fee revenue for disbursement to the subaccount in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The fish buyer is 
entitled, at any time, to withdraw deposit interest, if any, but never 
deposit principal, from the

[[Page 154]]

deposit account for the fish buyer's own use and purposes.
    (3) Deposit principal disbursement. On the last business day of each 
month, or more frequently if the amount in the account exceeds the 
account limit for insurance purposes, the fish buyer shall disburse to 
NMFS the full amount of deposit principal then in the deposit account. 
The fish buyer shall do this by check made payable to ``NOAA Inshore 
Component Pollock Loan Subaccount.'' The fish buyer shall mail each such 
check to the subaccount lockbox account that NMFS establishes for the 
receipt of the disbursements of deposit principal. Each disbursement 
shall be accompanied by the fish buyer's settlement sheet completed in 
the manner and form that NMFS specifies. NMFS will specify the 
subaccount's lockbox and the manner and form of settlement sheet by 
means of the notification in Sec. 600.1101(c).
    (4) Records maintenance. Each fish buyer shall maintain, in a secure 
and orderly manner for a period of at least 3 years from the date of 
each transaction involved, at least the following information:
    (i) For all deliveries of fee fish that the fish buyer buys from 
each fish seller:
    (A) The date of delivery,
    (B) The fish seller's identity,
    (C) The round weight of fee fish delivered,
    (D) The identity of the fishing vessel that delivered the fee fish,
    (E) The delivery value,
    (F) The net delivery value,
    (G) The identity of the party to whom the net delivery value is 
paid, if other than the fish seller,
    (H) The date the net delivery value was paid, and
    (I) The total fee amount collected;
    (ii) For all fee collection deposits to and disbursements from the 
deposit account:
    (A) The dates and amounts of deposits,
    (B) The dates and amounts of disbursements to the subaccount's 
lockbox account, and
    (C) The dates and amounts of disbursements to the fish buyer or 
other parties of interest earned on deposits.
    (5) Annual report. By January 15, 2001, and by each January 15 
thereafter until the loan is fully repaid, each fish buyer shall submit 
to NMFS a report, on or in the form NMFS specifies, containing the 
following information for the preceding year for all fee fish each fish 
buyer purchases from fish sellers:
    (i) Total round weight bought;
    (ii) Total delivery value paid;
    (iii) Total fee amount collected;
    (iv) Total fee collection amounts deposited by month;
    (v) Dates and amounts of monthly disbursements to the subaccount 
lockbox;
    (vi) Total amount of interest earned on deposits; and
    (vii) Depository account balance at year-end.
    (6) State records. If landing records that a state requires from 
fish sellers contain some or all of the data that this section requires 
and state confidentiality laws or regulations do not prevent NMFS' 
access to the records maintained for the state, then fish buyers can use 
such records to meet appropriate portions of this section's 
recordkeeping requirements. If, however, state confidentiality laws or 
regulations make such records unavailable to NMFS, then fish buyers 
shall maintain separate records for NMFS that meet the requirements of 
this section.
    (7) Audits. NMFS or its agents may audit, in whatever manner NMFS 
believes reasonably necessary for the duly diligent administration of 
the loan, the financial records of the fish buyers and the fish sellers 
in order to ensure proper fee payment, collection, deposit, 
disbursement, accounting, recordkeeping, and reporting. Fish buyers and 
fish sellers shall make all records of all transactions involving fee 
fish catches, fish deliveries, and fee payments, collections, deposits, 
disbursements, accounting, recordkeeping, and reporting available to 
NMFS or its agents at reasonable times and places and promptly provide 
all requested information reasonably related to these records that such 
fish sellers and fish buyers may otherwise lawfully provide. Trip 
tickets (or similar accounting records establishing the round weight 
pounds of fee fish that each fish buyer buys from each fish seller each 
time

[[Page 155]]

that each fish buyer does so) are essential audit documentation.
    (8) Confidentiality of records. NMFS and its auditing agents shall 
maintain the confidentiality of all data to which NMFS has access under 
this section and shall neither release the data nor allow the data's use 
for any purpose other than the purpose of this subpart, unless otherwise 
required by law; provided, however, that NMFS may aggregate such data so 
as to preclude their identification with any fish buyer or any fish 
seller and use them in the aggregate for other purposes.
    (9) Refunds. When NMFS determines that the loan is fully repaid, 
NMFS will refund any excess fee receipts, on a last-in/first-out basis, 
to the fish buyers. Fish buyers shall return the refunds, on a last-in/
first-out basis, to the fish sellers who paid the amounts refunded.
    (e) Late charges. The late charge to fish buyers for fee payment, 
collection, deposit, and/or disbursement shall be one and one-half (1.5) 
percent per month, or the maximum rate permitted by state law, for the 
total amount of the fee not paid, collected, deposited, and/or disbursed 
when due to be paid, collected, deposited, and/or disbursed within 5 
days of the date due. The full late charge shall apply to the fee for 
each month or portion of a month that the fee remains unpaid, 
uncollected, undeposited, and/or undisbursed.
    (f) Enforcement. In accordance with applicable law or other 
authority, NMFS may take appropriate action against each fish seller 
and/or fish buyer responsible for non-payment, non-collection, non-
deposit, and/or non-disbursement of the fee in accordance with this 
subpart to enforce the collection from such fish seller and/or fish 
buyer of any fee (including penalties and all costs of collection) due 
and owing the United States on account of the loan that such fish seller 
and/or fish buyer should have, but did not, pay, collect, deposit, and/
or disburse in accordance with this subpart. All such loan recoveries 
shall be applied to reduce the unpaid balance of the loan.
    (g) Prohibitions and penalties. (1) The following activities are 
prohibited, and it is unlawful for anyone to:
    (i) Avoid, decrease, interfere with, hinder, or delay payment or 
collection of, or otherwise fail to fully and properly pay or collect, 
any fee due and payable under this subpart or convert, or otherwise use 
for any purpose other than the purpose this subpart intends, any paid or 
collected fee;
    (ii) Fail to fully and properly deposit on time the full amount of 
all fee revenue collected under this subpart into a deposit account and 
disburse the full amount of all deposit principal to the subaccount's 
lockbox account--all as this subpart requires;
    (iii) Fail to maintain full, timely, and proper fee payment, 
collection, deposit, and/or disbursement records or make full, timely, 
and proper reports of such information to NMFS-all as this subpart 
requires;
    (iv) Fail to advise NMFS of any fish seller's refusal to pay, or of 
any fish buyer's refusal to collect, any fee due and payable under this 
subpart;
    (v) Refuse to allow NMFS or agents that NMFS designates to review 
and audit at reasonable times all books and records reasonably pertinent 
to fee payment, collection, deposit, disbursement, and accounting under 
this subpart or otherwise interfere with, hinder, or delay NMFS or it 
agents in the course of their activities under this subpart;
    (vi) Make false statements to NMFS, any of the NMFS' employees, or 
any of NMFS' agents about any of the matters in this subpart;
    (vii) Obstruct, prevent, or unreasonably delay or attempt to 
obstruct, prevent, or unreasonably delay any audit or investigation NMFS 
or its agents conduct, or attempt to conduct, in connection with any of 
the matters in this subpart; and/or
    (viii) Otherwise materially interfere with the efficient and 
effective repayment of the loan.
    (2) Anyone who violates one or more of the prohibitions of paragraph 
(a) of this section is subject to the full range of penalties the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act and 15 CFR part 904 provide (including, but not 
limited to: civil penalties, sanctions, forfeitures, and punishment

[[Page 156]]

for criminal offenses) and to the full penalties and punishments 
otherwise provided by any other applicable law of the United States.

fee-share fisheries paying the fee applicable to

[[Page 157]]

each such fishery's subamount in accordance with Sec. 600.1013 of 
subpart L, and
    (2) Fish buyers in the reduction fishery and in each of the fee-
share fisheries shall be obligated to collect the fee applicable to each 
such fishery's subamount in accordance with Sec. 600.1013 of this 
subpart.
    (i) Fee collection, deposits, disbursements, records, and reports. 
Fish buyers in the reduction fishery and in each of the fee share 
fisheries shall deposit and disburse, as well as keep records for and 
submit reports about, the fees applicable to each such fishery in 
accordance with Sec. 600.1014 of this subpart, except that:
    (1) Deposit accounts. Each fish buyer that this section requires to 
collect a fee shall maintain an account at a federally insured financial 
institution for the purpose of depositing collected fee revenue and 
disbursing the deposit principal directly to NMFS in accordance with 
paragraph (i)(3) of this section. The fish buyer may use this account 
for other operational purposes as well, but the fish buyer shall ensure 
that the account separately accounts for all deposit principal collected 
from the reduction fishery and from each of the six fee-share fisheries. 
The fish buyer shall separately account for all fee collections as 
follows:
    (i) All fee collections from the reduction fishery shall be 
accounted for in a reduction fishery subaccount,
    (ii) All fee collections from the California pink shrimp fee-share 
fishery shall be accounted for in a California shrimp fee-share fishery 
subaccount,
    (iii) All fee collections from the California coastal Dungeness crab 
fishery shall be accounted for in a California crab fee-share fishery 
subaccount,
    (iv) All fee collections from the Oregon pink shrimp fee-share 
fishery shall be accounted for in an Oregon shrimp fee-share fishery 
subaccount,
    (v) All fee collections from the Oregon coastal Dungeness crab fee-
share fishery shall be accounted for in an Oregon crab fee-share fishery 
subaccount,
    (vi) All fee collections from the Washington ocean pink shrimp fee-
share fishery shall be accounted for in a Washington ocean shrimp fee-
share fishery subaccount, and
    (vii) All fee collections from the Washington coastal Dungeness crab 
fishery shall be accounted for in a Washington crab fee-share fishery 
subaccount;
    (2) Fee collection deposits. Each fish buyer, no less frequently 
than at the end of each month, shall deposit, in the deposit account 
established under paragraph (i)(1) of this section, all collected fee 
revenue not previously deposited that the fish buyer collects through a 
date not more than two calendar days before the date of deposit. The 
deposit principal may not be pledged, assigned, or used for any purpose 
other than aggregating collected fee revenue for disbursement to the 
fund in accordance with paragraph (i)(3) of this section. The fish buyer 
is entitled, at any time, to withdraw interest (if any) on the deposit 
principal, but never the deposit fee principal itself, for the fish 
buyer's own use and purposes;
    (3) Deposit principal disbursement. Not later than the 14th calendar 
day after the last calendar day of each month, or more frequently if the 
amount in the account exceeds the account limit for insurance purposes, 
the fish buyer shall disburse to NMFS the full deposit principal then in 
the deposit account, provided that the deposit principal then totals 
$100 or more. If the deposit principal then totals less than $100, the 
fish buyer need not disburse the deposit principal until either the next 
month during which the deposit principal then totals $100 or more, or 
not later than the 14th calendar day after the last calendar day of any 
year in which the deposit principal has not since the last required 
disbursement totaled $100 or more, whichever comes first. The fish buyer 
shall disburse deposit principal by check made payable to the groundfish 
program's fund subaccount. The fish buyer shall mail each such check to 
the groundfish program's fund subaccount lockbox that NMFS establishes 
for the receipt of groundfish program disbursements. Each disbursement 
shall be accompanied by the fish buyer's fee collection report completed 
in the manner and form which NMFS specifies. NMFS will, before fee 
payment and collection begins, specify the groundfish program's fund 
subaccount lockbox and the manner and form of

[[Page 158]]

fee collection report. NMFS will do this by means of the notification in 
Sec. 600.1013(d) of subpart L. NMFS' fee collection report instructions 
will include provisions for the fish buyer to specify the amount of each 
disbursement which was disbursed from the reduction fishery subaccount 
and/or from each of the six fee-share fishery subaccounts;
    (4) Records maintenance. Each fish buyer shall maintain, in a secure 
and orderly manner for a period of at least 3 years from the date of 
each transaction involved, at least the following information:
    (i) For all deliveries of fee fish that the fish buyer buys from 
each fish seller:
    (A) The date of delivery,
    (B) The fish seller's identity,
    (C) The weight, number, or volume of each species of fee fish 
delivered,
    (D) Information sufficient to specifically identify the fishing 
vessel which delivered the fee fish,
    (E) The delivery value of each species of fee fish,
    (F) The net delivery value of each species of fee fish,
    (G) The identity of the payor to whom the net delivery value is 
paid, if different than the fish seller,
    (H) The date the net delivery value was paid,
    (I) The total fee amount collected as a result of all fee fish, and
    (J) The total fee amount collected as a result of all fee fish from 
the reduction fishery and/or all fee fish from each of the six fee-share 
fisheries; and
    (ii) For all collected fee deposits to, and disbursements of deposit 
principal from, the deposit account include:
    (A) The date of each deposit,
    (B) The total amount deposited,
    (C) The total amount deposited in the reduction fishery subaccount 
and/or in each of the six fee-share fishery subaccounts,
    (D) The date of each disbursement to the Fund's lockbox,
    (E) The total amount disbursed,
    (F) The total amount disbursed from the reduction fishery subaccount 
and/or from each of the six fee-share fishery subaccounts, and
    (G) The dates and amounts of disbursements to the fish buyer, or 
other parties, of interest earned on deposits; and
    (5) Annual report. No fish buyer needs to submit an annual report 
about fee fish collection activities unless, during the course of an 
audit under Sec. 600.1014(g), NMFS requires a fish buyer to submit such 
a report or reports.
    (j) Other provisions. The reduction loan is, in all other respects, 
subject to the provisions of Sec. 600.1012 through applicable portions 
of Sec. 600.1017, except Sec. 600.1014(e).

    (e) Who constitutes a bidder. A bidder is a person or persons who is 
the:
    (1) Holder of record and person otherwise fully and legally entitled 
to offer, in the manner this section requires, the bid's crab reduction 
permit and the bid's non-crab reduction permit;
    (2) Reduction/privilege vessel owner, title holder of record, and 
person otherwise fully and legally entitled to offer, in the manner this 
section requires, the bid's reduction fishing privilege; and
    (3) Retainer and person otherwise fully and legally entitled to 
offer, in the manner this section requires, the bid's reduction fishing 
history.
    (f) How crab licenses determine qualifying bidders and qualifying 
voters--(1) Non-interim crab licenses. Each person

[[Page 161]]

who is the record holder of a non-interim crab license endorsed for one 
or more reduction endorsement fisheries is both a qualifying bidder and 
a qualifying voter and can both bid and vote;
    (2) Interim crab licenses. Each person who is the record holder of 
an interim crab license endorsed for one or more reduction endorsement 
fisheries is a qualifying voter but not a qualifying bidder and can vote 
but not bid;
    (3) Crab licenses endorsed solely for the Norton Sound Fishery. Each 
person who is the record holder of any crab license endorsed solely for 
the Norton Sound fishery is neither a qualifying bidder nor a qualifying 
voter and can neither bid nor vote; and
    (4) Time at which qualifying bidders and voters must hold required 
crab licenses. A qualifying bidder must be the record holder of the 
required crab license at the time the qualifying bidder submits its bid. 
A qualifying voter must be the record holder of the required crab 
license at the time the qualifying voter submits its referendum ballot.
    (g) Qualifying bidders and co-bidders--(1) Qualifying bidders 
bidding alone. There is no co-bidder when a qualifying bidder owns, 
holds, or retains all the required components of the reduction fishing 
interest;
    (2) Qualifying bidders bidding together with co-bidders. When a 
qualifying bidder does not own the reduction/privilege vessel, the 
person who does may be the qualifying bidder's co-bidder; and
    (3) Minimum reduction components that qualifying bidders must hold 
or retain when bidding with co-bidders. At a minimum, a qualifying 
bidder must hold the crab reduction permit and the non-crab reduction 
permit and retain the reduction fishing history. The reduction/privilege 
vessel may, however, be owned by another person who is a co-bidder.
    (h) Reduction fishing interest--(1) General requirements. Each 
bidder must:
    (i) In its bid, offer to surrender, to have revoked, to have 
restricted, to relinquish, to have withdrawn, or to have extinguished by 
other means, in the manner that this section requires, the reduction 
fishing interest,
    (ii) At the time of bidding, hold, own, or retain the reduction 
fishing interest and be fully and legally entitled to offer, in the 
manner that this section requires, the reduction fishing interest, and
    (iii) Continuously thereafter hold, own, or retain the reduction 
fishing interest and remain fully and legally entitled to offer, in the 
manner that this section requires, the reduction fishing interest until:
    (A) The bid expires without NMFS first having accepted the bid,
    (B) NMFS notifies the bidder that NMFS rejects the bid,
    (C) NMFS notifies the bidder that a reduction contract between the 
bidder and the United States no longer exists, or
    (D) NMFS tenders reduction payment to the bidder;
    (2) Reduction/privilege vessel requirements. The reduction/privilege 
vessel in each bid must be:
    (i) The vessel designated, at the time this final rule is published 
in the Federal Register, on a crab license which becomes a bid's crab 
reduction permit, and
    (ii) Be neither lost nor destroyed at the time of bidding;
    (3) Reduction fishing privilege requirements. The reduction fishing 
privilege in each bid must be the reduction/privilege vessel's:
    (i) Fisheries trade endorsement under the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 
(46 U.S.C.A. 12108),
    (ii) Qualification for any present or future U.S. Government 
approval under section (9)(c)(2) of the Shipping Act, 1916 (46 U.S.C. 
App. 808(c)(2)) for placement under foreign registry or operation under 
the authority of a foreign country, and
    (iii) Any other privilege to ever fish anywhere in the world;
    (4) Crab reduction permit requirements. (i) Except as otherwise 
provided in paragraph (i) of this section, the crab reduction permit 
must in each bid:
    (A) Be the crab license that NMFS issued on the basis of the 
bidder's reduction fishing history,
    (B) Be non-interim at the time each bidder submits its bid, and
    (C) Include an area/species endorsement for any one or more 
reduction endorsement fisheries,

[[Page 162]]

    (ii) Although the Norton Sound fishery is not a reduction 
endorsement fishery, an area/species endorsement for the Norton Sound 
fishery occurring on a crab reduction permit must be surrendered and 
revoked (and all fishing history involving it relinquished) in the same 
manner as all other reduction endorsement fisheries occurring on the 
crab reduction permit;
    (5) Non-crab reduction permit requirements. The non-crab reduction 
permit must in each bid be every license, permit, or other harvesting 
privilege that:
    (i) NMFS issued on the basis of the fishing history of the bidder's 
reduction/history vessel, and
    (ii) For which the bidder was the license holder of record on the 
effective date of this section; and
    (6) Reduction fishing history requirements. Except as otherwise 
provided in paragraph (i) of this section, the reduction fishing history 
in each bid must that of a single reduction/history vessel.
    (i) Exceptions to the reduction fishing interest requirements--(1) 
Lost or destroyed vessel salvaged. When a bidder has salvaged a lost or 
destroyed vessel and has made from the salvaged vessel the documented 
harvest of crab Sec. 679.4(k)(5)(iii)(B)(3) of this chapter requires, 
the crab portion of the reduction fishing history is the salvaged 
vessel's documented harvest of crab; and
    (2) Lost or destroyed vessel not salvaged. When a bidder has not 
salvaged the lost or destroyed vessel but has made from a replacement 
vessel the documented harvest of crab Sec. 679.4(k)(5)(iii)(B)(3) of 
this chapter requires:
    (i) The crab portion of the reduction fishing history is the total 
of the lost or destroyed vessel's documented harvest of crab through the 
date of such vessel's loss or destruction plus the replacement vessel's 
documented harvest of crab after such date, and
    (ii) For the purposes of this program, the lost or destroyed 
vessel's documented harvest of crab merges with, and becomes a part of, 
the replacement vessel's documented harvest of crab; and
    (3) Acquired crab fishing history. When a bidder, in the manner 
Sec. 679.4(k)(5)(iv) of this chapter requires, has made a documented 
harvest of crab from one vessel and has acquired a replacement vessel's 
documented harvest of crab:
    (i) The crab portion of the reduction fishing history is the total 
of the acquired documented harvest of crab through December 31, 1994, 
plus the documented harvest of crab after December 31, 1994, of the 
vessel from which the bidder made the documented crab harvest Sec. 
679.4(k)(5)(iv) of this chapter requires, and
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (iii) For the purposes of this program, the acquired documented 
harvest of crab merges with, and becomes a part of, the non-acquired 
documented harvest of crab.
    (j) Determining value of reduction/history vessels' bid crab--(1) In 
each fishery. NMFS will determine the dollar value of each reduction/
history vessel's bid crab in each reduction endorsement fishery and in 
the Norton Sound Fishery by multiplying each reduction/history vessel's 
number of pounds of each species of bid crab by the average ex-vessel 
price per pound that the State of Alaska annually publishes for each 
crab species in the bid crab; and
    (2) In all fisheries. NMFS will determine the dollar value of each 
reduction/history vessel's bid crab in all reduction endorsement 
fisheries and in the Norton Sound fishery by adding each of the products 
of the multiplications in paragraph (j)(1) of this section; and
    (3) Crab excluded from bid crab. A reduction/history vessel's bid 
crab may not include, to the extent that NMFS has knowledge:
    (i) Triangle tanner crab, grooved tanner crab, and any other crab 
not involved in the various area/species endorsements,
    (ii) Discarded crab,
    (iii) Crab caught for personal use,
    (iv) Unspecified crab, and
    (v) Any other crab for which the dollar value, crab fishery, landing 
date, or harvesting vessel NMFS cannot, for whatever reason, determine.
    (k) Determining bid score. NMFS will determine each bid score by 
dividing each bid amount by the sum in paragraph (j)(2) of this section.
    (l) Determining reduction loan sub-amount--(1) Value of all bid crab 
in each

[[Page 163]]

fishery. NMFS will add the dollar value of bid crab of all accepted 
bidders' reduction/history vessels in each reduction endorsement 
fishery;
    (2) Value of all bid crab in all fisheries. NMFS will add the dollar 
value of bid crab of all accepted bidders' reduction/history vessels in 
all reduction endorsement fisheries plus the Norton Sound fishery;
    (3) Each fishery as a percentage of all fisheries. NMFS will divide 
each of the sums in paragraph (l)(1) of this section by the sum in 
paragraph (l)(2) of this section. The result of this calculation will be 
the dollar value of all bid crab in each reduction endorsement fishery 
as a percentage of the dollar value of all bid crab in all reduction 
endorsement fisheries plus the Norton Sound fishery;
    (4) Applying percentages to loan amount. NMFS will multiply the 
reduction loan's full original principal amount by each of the yields in 
paragraph (l)(3) of this section; and
    (5) Loan sub-amount. Each of the amounts resulting from the 
calculation in paragraph (l)(4) of this section will be the reduction 
loan subamount that a reduction endorsement fishery must repay.
    (m) Prospectively qualifying bidder and voter notification--(1) 
General. At the appropriate point before issuing an invitation to bid, 
NMFS will publish a notification in the Federal Register listing all 
persons who at the time of publishing the notification prospectively are 
qualifying bidders and qualifying voters;
    (2) Qualifying bidder list. The prospectively qualifying bidder list 
will include the names and addresses of record of each license holder of 
record for all non-interim crab licenses except only crab licenses whose 
sole area/species endorsement is for the Norton Sound fishery;
    (3) Qualifying voter list. The prospectively qualifying voter list 
will include the names and addresses of record of each license holder of 
record for all non-interim and interim crab licenses except only crab 
licenses whose sole area/species endorsement is for the Norton Sound 
fishery;
    (4) Basis of lists. NMFS will base both the lists on the RAM 
Program's license holder records for crab licenses meeting the 
requirements of Sec. 679.4(k)(5) of this chapter as well as the 
requirements of this section;
    (5) Purpose. The purpose of the notification is to provide the 
public notice of:
    (i) The prospectively qualifying bidders, and
    (ii) The prospectively qualifying voters; and
    (6) Public comment. Any person who wants to comment about the 
notification has 30 days from the notification's publication date to do 
so. Persons should send their comments to both FSD and the RAM Program 
(at addresses that the notification will specify). Comments may address:
    (i) Persons who appear on one or more lists but should not,
    (ii) Persons who do not appear on one or more lists but should, and
    (iii) Persons who believe their names and/or business mailing 
addresses appearing on one or more lists are incorrect.
    (n) Invitation to bid--(1) Notification. At the appropriate point 
after issuing the notification in paragraph (m) of this section, NMFS 
will publish the invitation to bid in the Federal Register notification 
further specified in Sec. 600.1009(c) of this subpart, along with a 
bidding form and terms of capacity reduction agreement. No person may, 
however, bid at this stage;
    (2) Notification contents. The invitation to bid notification will 
state all applicable bid submission requirements and procedures 
(including, but not limited to, those included in this section). In 
particular, the invitation to bid notification will:
    (i) State the date on which NMFS will invite bids by mailing an 
invitation to bid to each person on the prospectively qualifying bidder 
list,
    (ii) State a bid opening date, before which a bidder may not bid, 
and a bid closing date, after which a bidder may not bid,
    (iii) State a bid expiration date after which each bid expires 
unless, prior to that date, NMFS accepts the bid by mailing a written 
acceptance notice to the bidder at the bidder's address of record,

[[Page 164]]

    (iv) State the manner of bid submission and the information each 
bidder must submit for NMFS to deem a bid responsive,
    (v) State any other information required for bid submission, and
    (vi) Include a facsimile of the invitation to bid, along with a 
bidding form and terms of capacity reduction agreement comprising the 
entire terms and conditions of the reduction contract under which each 
bidder must bid and under which NMFS must accept a bid; and
    (3) Mailing. On the date specified in this notification, NMFS will 
invite bids by mailing the invitation to bid and a bidding package, 
including a bidding form terms of capacity reduction agreement, to each 
person then on the prospectively qualifying bidder list. NMFS will not 
mail the invitation to bid to any potential co-bidder because NMFS will 
not then know which bids may include a co-bidder. Each qualifying bidder 
is solely responsible to have any required co-bidder properly complete 
the bid. No person may bid before receiving the invitation to bid and 
the bidding package that NMFS mailed to that person.
    (o) Bids--(1) Content. Each invitation to bid that NMFS mails to a 
qualifying bidder will have a bid form requiring each bid to:
    (i) Identify, by name, regular mail address, telephone number, and 
(if available) electronic mail address, the qualifying bidder and each 
co-bidder,
    (ii) State the bid amount in U.S. dollars,
    (iii) Identify, by crab license number, the qualifying bidder's crab 
reduction permit and include an exact copy of this crab license (which 
the RAM Program issued),
    (iv) Identify, by vessel name and official number, the bidder's 
reduction/privilege vessel, and include an exact copy of this vessel's 
official document (which NVDC issued),
    (v) Identify, by license or permit number, each of the bidder's non-
crab reduction permits; and include an exact copy of each of these 
licenses or permits (which the RAM Program issued for licenses or 
permits involving species under the jurisdiction of NMFS' Alaska Region 
and which other NMFS offices issued for licenses or permits involving 
species under those offices' jurisdiction),
    (vi) Identify, separately for crab and for each other species:
    (A) The qualifying bidder's reduction fishing history, and
    (B) The dates that each portion of the reduction fishing history 
encompasses; the name and official number of the reduction/history 
vessel or vessels which gave rise to it; and the dates during which the 
qualifying bidder owned such vessels or, if the qualifying bidder 
acquired any reduction fishing history from another person, the name of 
the person from which the qualifying bidder acquired such reduction 
fishing history and the manner in which and the date on which the 
qualifying bidder did so,
    (vii) State, declare, and affirm that the qualifying bidder holds 
the crab reduction permit and retains the complete reduction fishing 
history, and is fully and legally entitled to offer both in the manner 
this section requires,
    (viii) State, declare, and affirm that either the qualifying bidder 
or the co-bidder owns the reduction/privilege vessel and holds the non-
crab reduction permit and is fully and legally entitled to offer both in 
the manner that this section requires, and
    (ix) Provide any other information or materials that NMFS believes 
is necessary and appropriate; and
    (2) Rejection. NMFS, regardless of bid scores, will reject any bid 
that NMFS believes is unresponsive to the invitation to bid. All bid 
rejections will constitute final agency action as of the date of 
rejection. Before rejection, NMFS may, however, contact any bidder to 
attempt to correct a bid deficiency if NMFS, in its discretion, believes 
the attempt warranted.
    (p) Acceptance--(1) Reverse auction. NMFS will determine which 
responsive bids NMFS accepts by using a reverse auction in which NMFS 
first accepts the responsive bid with the lowest bid score and 
successively accepts each additional responsive bid with the next lowest 
bid score until either there are no more responsive bids to accept or 
acceptance of the last responsive bid with the next lowest bid score 
would cause the reduction cost to exceed $100

[[Page 165]]

million. If two or more responsive bid scores are exactly the same, NMFS 
will first accept the bid that NMFS first received;
    (2) Notification. NMFS will, after the conclusion of a successful 
referendum, notify accepted bidders that NMFS had, before the 
referendum, accepted their bids; and
    (3) Post-acceptance reduction permit transfer. After NMFS has 
accepted bids, neither the RAM Program (nor any other NMFS office) will 
transfer to other persons any reduction permits that accepted bidders 
included in the bids unless and until FSD advises the RAM Program (or 
some other NMFS office) that the resulting reduction contracts are no 
longer in effect because a referendum failed to approve the fee that 
this section requires to repay this program's reduction loan.
    (q) Reduction contracts subject to successful post-bidding 
referendum condition. Although this program involves no fishing capacity 
reduction specifications under this subpart, each bid, each acceptance, 
and each reduction contract is nevertheless subject to the successful 
post-bidding referendum condition that Sec. 600.1009(a)(3) of this 
subpart specifies for bidding results that do not conform to the fishing 
capacity reduction specifications.
    (r) Post-bidding referendum--(1) Purpose. NMFS will conduct a post-
bidding referendum whose sole purpose is to determine whether, based on 
the bidding results, qualifying voters who cast referendum ballots in 
the manner that this section requires authorize the fee required to 
repay this program's reduction loan;
    (2) Manner of conducting. NMFS will mail a referendum ballot to each 
person then on the prospectively qualifying voter list for each crab 
license that the person holds and otherwise conduct the referendum as 
specified in Sec. 600.1010 of this subpart;
    (3) One vote per crab license. Each qualifying voter may cast only 
one vote for each crab license that each qualifying voter holds;
    (4) Crab license numbers on ballots. Each referendum ballot that 
NMFS mails will contain the license number of the prospectively 
qualifying voter's crab license to which the ballot relates;
    (5) Potential reduction results stated. Each referendum ballot that 
NMFS mails will state the aggregate potential reduction results of all 
the bids that NMFS accepted, including:
    (i) The amount of reduction that all accepted bids potentially 
effect, including:
    (A) The number of crab reduction permits, together with each area/
species endorsement for which each of these licenses is endorsed,
    (B) The number of reduction/privilege vessels and reduction/history 
vessels, and
    (C) The aggregate and average dollar value of bid crab (together 
with the number of pounds of bid crab upon which NMFS based the dollar 
value), in each reduction endorsement fishery and in the reduction 
fishery, for all reduction/history vessels during the period for which 
NMFS calculates the dollar value of bid crab,
    (ii) The reduction loan sub-amount that each reduction endorsement 
fishery must repay if a referendum approves the fee, and
    (iii) Any other useful information NMFS may then have about the 
potential sub-fee rate initially necessary in each reduction endorsement 
fishery to repay each reduction loan sub-amount; and
    (6) Notice that condition fulfilled. If the referendum is 
successful, NMFS will notify accepted bidders, in the manner that Sec. 
600.1010(d)(6)(iii) of this subpart specifies, that a successful 
referendum has fulfilled the reduction contracts' successful post-
bidding referendum condition specified in paragraph (q) of this section.
    (s) Reduction method. In return for each reduction payment, NMFS 
will permanently:
    (1) Revoke each crab reduction permit;
    (2) Revoke each non-crab reduction permit;
    (3) Revoke each reduction fishing privilege (which revocation will 
run with the reduction/privilege vessel's title in the manner Sec. 
600.1009(a)(5)(ii)(A) of this subpart requires and in accordance with 46 
U.S.C. 12108(d));
    (4) Effect relinquishment of each reduction fishing history for the 
purposes specified in this section by noting in

[[Page 166]]

the RAM Program records (or such other records as may be appropriate for 
reduction permits issued elsewhere) that the reduction fishing history 
has been relinquished under this section and will never again be 
available to anyone for any fisheries purpose; and
    (5) Otherwise restrict in accordance with this subpart each 
reduction/privilege vessel and fully effect the surrender, revocation, 
restriction, relinquishment, withdrawal, or extinguishment by other 
means of all components of each reduction fishing interest.
    (t) Reduction payment tender and disbursement--(1) Fishing continues 
until tender. Each accepted bidder may continue fishing as it otherwise 
would have absent the program until NMFS, after a successful referendum, 
tenders reduction payment to the accepted bidder;
    (2) Notification to the public. After a successful referendum but 
before tendering reduction payment, NMFS will publish a notification in 
the Federal Register listing all proposed reduction payments and putting 
the public on notice:
    (i) Of the crab reduction permits, the reduction/privilege vessels, 
the reduction fishing histories, and the non-crab reduction permits upon 
whose holding, owning, retaining, or other legal authority 
representations accepted bidders based their bids and NMFS based its 
acceptances, and
    (ii) That NMFS intends, in accordance with the reduction contracts, 
to tender reduction payments in return for the actions specified in 
paragraph (s) of this section;
    (3) Public response. The public has 30 days after the date on which 
NMFS publishes the reduction payment tender notification to advise NMFS 
in writing of any holding, owning, or retaining claims that conflict 
with the representations upon which the accepted bidders based their 
bids and on which NMFS based its acceptances;
    (4) Tender and disbursement parties. NMFS will tender reduction 
payments only to accepted bidders, unless otherwise provided contrary 
written instructions by accepted bidders. Creditors or other parties 
with secured or other interests in reduction/privilege vessels or 
reduction permits are responsible to make their own arrangements with 
accepted bidders;
    (5) Time of tender. At the end of the reduction payment tender 
notification period, NMFS will tender reduction payments to accepted 
bidders, unless NMFS then knows of a material dispute about an accepted 
bidder's authority to enter into the reduction contract with respect to 
any one or more components of the reduction fishing interest that 
warrants, in NMFS' discretion, an alternative course of action;
    (6) Method of tender and disbursement. NMFS will tender reduction 
payment by requesting from each accepted bidder specific, written 
instructions for paying the reduction payments. Upon receipt of these 
payment instructions, NMFS will immediately disburse reduction payments 
in accordance with the payment instructions; and
    (7) Effect of tender. Concurrently with NMFS' tender of reduction 
payment to each accepted bidder:
    (i) All fishing activity for any species anywhere in the world in 
any way associated with each accepted bidder's reduction fishing 
interest must cease,
    (ii) Each accepted bidder must retrieve all fixed fishing gear for 
whose deployment the accepted bidder's reduction/privilege vessel was 
responsible, and
    (iii) NMFS will fully exercise its reduction contract rights with 
respect to the reduction fishing interest by taking the actions 
specified in paragraph (s) of this section.
    (u) Fee payment and collection--(1) Fish sellers who pay the fee. 
Any person who harvests any crab, but whom ADF&G's fisheries reporting 
requirements do not require to record and submit an ADF&G fish ticket 
for that crab, is a fish seller for the purpose of paying any fee on 
that crab and otherwise complying with the requirements of Sec. 
600.1013 of this subpart;
    (2) Fish buyers who collect the fee. Any person whom ADF&G's 
fisheries reporting requirements require to record and submit an ADF&G 
fish ticket for any crab that another person harvested is a fish buyer 
for the purpose of collecting the fee on that crab and otherwise 
complying with the requirements of Sec. 600.1013 of this subpart; and

[[Page 167]]

    (3) Persons who are both fish sellers and fish buyers and both pay 
and collect the fee. Any person who harvests any crab, and whom ADF&G's 
fisheries reporting requirements require to record and submit an ADF&G 
fish ticket for that crab, is both a fish seller and a fish buyer for 
the purpose of paying and collecting the fee on that crab and otherwise 
complying with the requirements of Sec. 600.1013 of this subpart.
    (v) Fishing prohibition and penalties--(1) General. Fishing, for the 
purpose of this section, includes the full range of activities defined 
in the term ``fishing'' in the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801),
    (2) Prohibitions. Concurrently with NMFS' tender of each reduction 
payment, and with the sole exception in paragraph (t)(7)(i) of this 
section, no person whatsoever may, and it is unlawful for any person to:
    (i) Fish with or attempt to fish with, or allow others to fish with 
or attempt to fish with, the reduction/privilege vessel anywhere in the 
world for any species under any conditions and regardless of the 
reduction/privilege vessel's ownership or registry for so long as the 
reduction/privilege vessel exists. This prohibition includes, but is not 
limited to, fishing on the high seas or in the jurisdiction of any 
foreign country (to the extent prohibited by law) while operating under 
U.S. flag,
    (ii) Place or attempt to place, or allow others to place or attempt 
to place, the reduction/privilege vessel under foreign flag or registry,
    (iii) Operate or attempt to operate, or allow others to operate or 
attempt to operate, the reduction/privilege vessel under the authority 
of a foreign country to the extent prohibited by law,
    (iv) Otherwise avoid or attempt to avoid, or allow others to avoid 
or attempt to avoid, the revocation of the reduction fishing privilege 
with respect to any reduction/privilege vessel, and
    (v) Make any claim or attempt to make any claim, or allow others to 
claim or attempt to make any claim, for any present or future limited 
access fishing license or permit in any U.S. fishery (including, but not 
limited to, any quota allocation under any present or future individual 
quota allocation system) based in any way on any portion of a reduction 
fishing interest surrendered, revoked, restricted, relinquished, 
withdrawn, or extinguished by other means under this section; and
    (3) Penalties. The activities that this paragraph prohibits are 
subject to the full penalties provided in Sec. 600.1017 of this 
subpart, and immediate cause for NMFS to take action to, among other 
things:
    (i) At the reduction/privilege vessel owner's expense, seize and 
scrap the reduction/privilege vessel, and
    (ii) Pursue such other remedies and enforce such other penalties as 
may be applicable.
    (w) Program administration--(1) FSD responsibilities. FSD is 
responsible for implementing and administering this program. FSD will:
    (i) Issue all notifications and mailings that this section requires,
    (ii) Prepare and issue the invitation to bid,
    (iii) Receive bids,
    (iv) Reject bids,
    (v) Score bids,
    (vi) Make acceptances,
    (vii) Prepare and issue referendum ballots,
    (viii) Receive referendum ballots,
    (ix) Tally referendum ballots,
    (x) Determine referendum success or failure,
    (xi) Tender and disburse reduction payments,
    (xii) Administer reduction contracts,
    (xiii) Administer fees and reduction loan repayment, and
    (xiv) Discharge all other management and administration functions 
that this section requires;
    (2) RAM Program responsibilities. Upon FSD's advice, the RAM Program 
(for fishing licenses under the jurisdiction of NMFS's Alaska Region) 
and any other appropriate NMFS authority (for fishing licenses under the 
jurisdiction of any other NMFS office) will revoke reduction permits and 
effect the surrender of fishing histories in accordance with this 
section; and
    (3) NVDC and MARAD responsibilities. FSD will advise NVDC, MARAD, 
such other agency or agencies as may be involved, or all of them to 
revoke reduction/privilege vessels' fisheries trade

[[Page 168]]

endorsements and otherwise restrict reduction/privilege vessels in 
accordance with this section.
    (x) Reduction loan and reduction loan sub-amounts. [Reserved]

[[Page 172]]

    (6) Notice. All notices related to the effective date of the 
Reduction Agreement shall be sent by the Auditor via registered mail.
    (7) Withdrawal. A Subsector Member, unless such Subsector Member is 
a Current Offeror or Selected Offeror, may terminate the Reduction 
Agreement at any time with respect to that Subsector Member by giving 
ten (10) calendar days written notice to the Auditor preferably via e-
mail. Withdrawal of a Subsector Member shall not affect the validity of 
the Reduction Agreement with respect to any other Subsector Members. 
Once effective, the Reduction Agreement shall continue in full force and 
effect regardless of whether subsequent withdrawals reduce the number of 
Subsector Members below that level required to effectuate the Reduction 
Agreement. Attempted withdrawal by a Current Offeror or Selected Offeror 
shall be invalid, and such Offer shall remain a binding, irrevocable 
Offer, unaffected by the attempted withdrawal.
    (d) Selection of fishing capacity to be removed by Reduction Plan. 
The fishing capacity removed by the Reduction Plan will be the Reduction 
Fishing Interests voluntarily offered through the Reduction Plan by 
offering Subsector Members and as selected by the Nonoffering Subsector 
Members, up to an aggregate amount of thirty six million dollars 
($36,000,000) as set forth in this paragraph (d).
    (1) Overview. The Selection Process will begin upon the Effective 
Date of the Reduction Agreement. The Selection Process will alternate on 
a weekly basis between:
    (i) Submitting Periods, during which individual Subsector Members 
may submit Offers of fishing capacity they wish to include in the 
Reduction Plan; and
    (ii) Ranking Periods, during which Nonoffering Subsector Members 
will rank the submitted Offers.
    (2) Offers--(i) Binding agreement. An Offer from a Subsector Member 
shall be a binding, irrevocable offer from a Subsector Member to 
relinquish to NMFS the Reduction Fishing Interests for the price set 
forth on the Offer contingent on such Offer being a Selected Offer at 
the closing of the Selection Process. Once submitted, an Offer may not 
be revoked or withdrawn while that Offer is a Current Offer or Selected 
Offer. An Offer that is submitted by a Subsector Member, but is not a 
Selected Offer during the subsequent Ranking Period, shall be deemed to 
be terminated and the Subsector Member shall have no further obligation 
with respect to performance of that Offer.
    (ii) Offer content. All Offers submitted to the Auditor shall 
include the following information: LLP License number; LLP License 
number(s) of any linked crab LLP Licenses; license MLOA (MLOA--maximum 
length overall of a vessel is defined at Sec. 679.2 of this chapter); 
the license area, gear and species endorsements; a summary of the 
Pacific cod catch history for the calendar years 1995-2004; and the 
offered price. The Offer shall also state whether a vessel is currently 
designated on the LLP License and as such will be withdrawn from all 
fisheries if the Offer is selected for reduction in the Reduction Plan. 
If so, the Offer shall identify such vessel by name, official number, 
and current owner. In addition, the Offer shall provide a summary of the 
Pacific cod catch history for the calendar years 1995-2004 of the vessel 
to be retired from the fisheries. All summary catch histories included 
in Offers shall be calculated utilizing both the weekly production 
report and best blend methodology and shall separately state for each 
methodology the Pacific cod catch in metric tons and as a percentage of 
the overall catch for the longline catcher processor subsector on an 
annual basis for each of the required years. If the vessel stated to be 
withdrawn from the fisheries is not owned by the LLP License owner of 
record, the Offer shall be countersigned by the owner of record of the 
vessel. An Offer offering a Latent License shall state on the Offer Form 
that the offered LLP License is a Latent License. The Offer Form shall 
also include a comment section for any additional information that 
Offerors wish to provide to the Subsector Members concerning the Offer.
    (iii) Prequalification of offers. A Subsector Member may submit a 
Prequalification Offer to the Auditor at any time prior to the Opening 
Date.

[[Page 173]]

A Prequalification Offer shall contain all elements of an Offer, except 
that a price need not be provided. The Auditor shall notify the 
Subsector Member submitting a Prequalification Offer as to any 
deficiencies as soon as practicable. All details of a Prequalification 
Offer shall be kept confidential by the Auditor.
    (3) Submitting an offer--(i) Offer submission. Commencing on the 
first Tuesday following the Opening Date and during all Submission 
Periods until the Selection Process is closed, any Subsector Member may 
submit an Offer. All Offers are to be on the applicable form provided on 
the FLCC website, executed by an Authorized Party and submitted to the 
Auditor by facsimile. Any Subsector Member may submit an Offer during 
any Submission Period, even if that Subsector Member has not submitted 
an Offer in any previous Submission Period. If a Subsector Member holds 
more than one LLP License, such Subsector Member may, but is not 
required to, submit an Offer for each LLP License held during a 
Submission Period.
    (ii) Submission periods. The initial Submission Period shall 
commence at 9 a.m. (Pacific time) on the Tuesday following the Opening 
Date and end at 5 p.m. (Pacific time) on the Friday of that week. 
Subsequent Submission Periods shall commence at 9 a.m. (Pacific time) on 
the first Tuesday following the preceding Ranking Period and end at 5 
p.m. (Pacific time) on the Friday of that week. All times set forth in 
the Reduction Agreement and used in the Offer process shall be the time 
kept in the Pacific time zone as calculated by the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology.
    (iii) Validity of offer. The Auditor shall examine each Offer for 
consistency with the Database and information contained in the 
enrollment documents. If there is an inconsistency in the information 
contained in the Offer, any of the elements required of an Offer 
pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section are missing, or the 
Auditor does not receive the original Offer Form before the Offers are 
to be posted pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the Auditor 
shall notify the offering Subsector Member by e-mail or mail that the 
Offer is nonconforming as soon as practicable after discovering the 
basis of invalidity. The Subsector Member may submit a revised, 
conforming Offer prior to the close of that Submission Period or, in any 
subsequent Submission Period. Only one Offer may be submitted with 
respect to an LLP License during a Submission Period. In the event a 
Subsector Member submits more than one Offer with respect to an LLP 
License during a Submission Period, the first conforming Offer received 
by the Auditor shall be binding and irrevocable and any subsequent 
Offers shall be deemed invalid.
    (iv) Warranty. By submitting an Offer, the Offering Subsector 
Member, warrants and represents that the Offering Subsector Member has 
read and understands the terms of the Reduction Agreement, the Offer, 
and the Reduction Contract and has had the opportunity to seek 
independent legal counsel regarding such documents and/or agreements and 
the consequences of submitting an Offer.
    (4) Posting offers--(i) Current offers. For each Offer received 
during a Submission Period, the Auditor shall post on the Website no 
later than 5 p.m. (Pacific time) on the following Tuesday all of the 
details of such Offer as set forth on the Offer Form. In addition, the 
Auditor shall post, as available to Auditor, a summary by year of up to 
ten (10) years catch history during the period 1995-2004 in total round 
weight equivalents and percentage of Longline Subsector ITAC harvested 
for any vessel that is included in the Offer. Subsector Member (or 
vessel owner, if other than the Subsector Member) expressly authorizes 
Auditor to release the catch history summary information previously 
prepared for that Subsector Member or vessel owner by the Auditor as 
part of the analysis of FLCC's membership's catch history previously 
conducted by the Auditor on behalf of the FLCC.
    (ii) Posting order. Offers shall be posted on the Website by the 
Auditor in alphabetical order of the Offering Subsector Member's name.
    (iii) Questions as to offer. The Auditor shall respond to no 
questions from Subsector Member regarding Offers except

[[Page 174]]

to confirm that the posting accurately reflects the details of the 
Offer. If an Offering Subsector Member notices an error in an Offer 
posting on the Website, such Subsector Member shall notify the Auditor 
as soon as practicable. The Auditor shall review such notice, the 
posting and the original Offer. If an error was made in posting the 
Auditor shall correct the posting as soon as practicable and notify the 
Subsector Members via e-mail or mail of the correction. In the event 
such an error is not discovered prior to Ranking, an Offering Subsector 
Member shall be bound to the terms of the submitted Offer, not the terms 
of the posted Offer.
    (iv) Archive. The Auditor shall maintain on the Website an archive 
of prior Offers posted, which shall be available for review by all 
Subsector Members.
    (5) Ranking--(i) Eligibility. Each Subsector Member that has not 
submitted an Offer during the preceding Submission Period, or whose 
vessel is not included as a withdrawing vessel in an Offer during the 
preceding Submission Period (i.e., a Nonoffering Subsector Member), may 
submit to the Auditor a Ranking Form during a Ranking Period. With 
respect to Ranking, a Subsector Member that holds more than one LLP 
License may participate in the Ranking process for each LLP License not 
included in an Offer.
    (ii) Ranking period. The initial Ranking Period shall commence 
immediately after the Offers from the preceding Submission Period have 
been posted and end at 5 p.m. (Pacific time) on the Friday of that week. 
Subsequent Ranking Periods shall commence immediately after the Offers 
from the preceding Submission Period have been posted and end at 5 p.m. 
(Pacific time) on the Friday of that week.
    (iii) Ranking form. Prior to each Ranking Period, the Auditor will 
post a Ranking Form on the Website in ``pdf'' file format. Each eligible 
Subsector Member wishing to rank the current Offers shall rank the 
Offers on the Ranking Form numerically in the Subsector Member's 
preferred order of purchase. The Offer that Subsector Member would most 
like to have accepted should be ranked number one (1), and subsequent 
Offers ranked sequentially until the Offer that the Subsector Member 
would least like to see accepted is ranked with the highest numerical 
score. A Subsector Member wishing to call for a Closing Vote shall, in 
lieu of ranking the Current Offers, mark the Ranking Form to accept the 
Selected Offers selected during the prior Ranking Period and close the 
Selection Process. To be valid, the Ranking Form must rank each Current 
Offer listed on the Ranking Form or, if applicable, be marked to call 
for a Closing Vote. Ranking Forms shall be submitted by sending a 
completed Ranking Form, signed by an Authorized Party, to the Auditor by 
facsimile or mail prior to the end of the Ranking Period. A Subsector 
Member is not required to rank the Offers during a Ranking Period or 
call for a Closing Vote.
    (iv) Validity of subsector member ranking. The Auditor shall examine 
each Ranking Form for completeness, whether the form either ranks the 
Offers or calls for a Closing Vote (but not both), and authorized 
signature. Any incomplete or otherwise noncompliant Ranking Form(s) 
shall be invalid, and shall not be included in the Rankings of the 
Current Offers. The Auditor shall notify the Subsector Member of the 
reason for declaring any Ranking Form invalid as soon as practicable. A 
Subsector Member may cure the submission of an invalid Ranking Form by 
submitting a complying Ranking Form if accomplished before the end of 
the applicable Ranking Period.
    (6) Ranking results--(i) Compiling the rankings. Unless two-thirds 
(\2/3\) of the Nonoffering Subsector Members have called for a Closing 
Vote, the Auditor shall compile the results of the Ranking Forms by 
assigning one point for each position on a Ranking Form. That is, the 
Offer ranked number one (1) on a Ranking Form shall be awarded one (1) 
point, the Offer ranked two (2) shall receive two (2) points, and 
continuing on in this manner until all Offers have been assigned points 
correlating to its ranking on each valid Ranking Form. The Offer with 
the least number of total points assigned shall be the highest ranked 
Offer, and the Offer with the greatest total points assigned shall be 
the lowest ranked Offer.

[[Page 175]]

    (ii) Posting rankings. The Auditor shall post the results of the 
compilation of the Ranking Forms on the Website in alphabetical order 
based on the Offering Subsector Member's name no later than 5 p.m. 
(Pacific time) on the Monday following the Ranking Period. The Auditor 
shall post the highest consecutive ranking Offers that total thirty six 
million dollars ($36,000,000) or less. Those Offering Subsector Members 
whose Offers are posted shall be deemed Selected Offerors and their 
Offers shall be deemed Selected Offers. Those Offering Subsector Members 
whose Offers are not posted shall be deemed Rejected Offerors.
    (iii) Selected offer information or confidentiality. The Auditor 
shall post the name of the Offering Subsector Member, the amount of the 
Offer, and a summary of the total number of Ranking Forms received and 
the number of such forms on which the Members called for a Closing Vote. 
Other than the foregoing, the Auditor shall not post any details of the 
compilation of the Ranking Forms.
    (iv) Selected offerors. Selected Offerors may not withdraw their 
Offers unless in subsequent rankings their Offers no longer are within 
the highest ranking Offers and they become Rejected Offerors. A Selected 
Offeror may, however, modify a Selected Offer solely to the extent such 
modification consists of a reduction in the Offer price. A Selected 
Offeror may submit a modified Offer to the Auditor during the next 
Offering Period as set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Unless 
a Selected Offeror becomes a Rejected Offeror in a subsequent Ranking, a 
Selected Offeror shall be bound by the terms of the lowest Selected 
Offer submitted as if such modified Offer had been the original Selected 
Offer. In the event a Selected Offeror submits a modified Offer and such 
Offer is not ranked because sufficient votes are received to call for a 
Closing Vote, the previously Selected Offer shall remain the Selected 
Offer.
    (v) Rejected offerors. The Offer of a Rejected Offeror is terminated 
and the Rejected Offeror is no longer bound by the terms of its Offer. A 
Rejected Offeror may, at its sole discretion, resubmit the same Offer, 
submit a revised Offer, or elect not to submit an Offer during any 
subsequent Submission Period until the Selection Process is closed.
    (vi) Ties. In the event there is a tie with respect to Offers which 
results in the tied Offers exceeding thirty-six million dollars 
($36,000,000), the tied Offers and all Offers ranked lower than the tied 
Offers shall be deemed to be rejected and the Rejected Offerors may, at 
their option, submit an Offer in a subsequent Submission Period.
    (vii) Archive. Auditor shall maintain on the Website an archive of 
prior Offer Rankings as posted over the course of the Selection Process, 
which shall be available for Subsector Member review.
    (7) Closing. The Selection Process will close when two-thirds (\2/
3\) or more of the Nonoffering Subsector Members of the Longline 
Subsector, as determined by the Auditor, affirmatively vote to accept 
the Selected Offerors selected during the prior Ranking Period as part 
of the Reduction Plan to be submitted to the Secretary.
    (i) Call for vote. A Closing Vote will be held when: at least two-
thirds (\2/3\) of the Nonoffering Subsector Members submit Ranking Forms 
electing to accept the Selected Offerors and close the Selection Process 
in lieu of Ranking the current Offers; and there are no unresolved 
Protests or Arbitrations. The Auditor shall notify all Subsector Members 
by e-mail or mail and posting a notice on the Website as soon as 
practicable that a Closing Vote is to be held. Such notice shall state 
the starting and ending dates and times of the voting period, which 
shall be not less than three (3) nor more than seven (7) calendar days 
from the date of such notice. A voting period shall commence at 9 a.m. 
(Pacific time) on Monday and end at 5 p.m. on the Friday of that week.
    (ii) Voting. No less than three (3) calendar days prior to the 
voting period, the Auditor will post a Closing Ballot on the Website in 
``pdf'' file format. Each eligible Nonoffering Subsector Member wishing 
to vote shall print out the Closing Ballot, and, with respect to each of 
the currently Selected Offers on the Closing Ballot, vote either in 
favor of or opposed to accepting that Selected Offer and submit a 
completed

[[Page 176]]

and signed Closing Ballot to the Auditor preferably by facsimile prior 
to the end of the Voting Period.
    (iii) Ballot verification. The Auditor shall examine each submitted 
Closing Ballot for completeness and authorized signature. Any incomplete 
Closing Ballot shall be void, and shall not be included in the voting 
results. The Auditor shall not notify the Subsector Member of an invalid 
Closing Ballot.
    (iv) Voting results. The Auditor shall post the results of the Vote 
as soon as practicable after voting closes. Each Offer on the Closing 
Ballot that receives votes approving acceptance of such Offer from two-
thirds (\2/3\) or more of the total number of Nonoffering Subsector 
Members shall be a Selected Offeror and shall be the basis for the 
Reduction Plan submitted to NMFS. Any Offer on the Closing Ballot that 
does not receive such two-thirds (\2/3\) approval shall be rejected and 
shall not be included among the Offers included among the Reduction Plan 
submitted to NMFS.
    (v) Notification to NMFS. Upon closing of the Selection Process, 
FLCC shall notify NMFS in writing of the identities of the Selected 
Offerors and provide to NMFS a completed and fully executed original 
Reduction Agreement from each of the Selected Offerors and a certified 
copy of the fully executed Reduction Agreement and Reduction Contract.
    (e) Submission of reduction plan, including repayment. Upon 
completion of the offering process, the FLCC on behalf of the Subsector 
Members shall submit to NMFS the Reduction Plan which shall include the 
provisions set forth in this paragraph (e).
    (1) Capacity reduction. The Reduction Plan shall identify as the 
proposed capacity reduction, without auction process, the LLP Licenses 
as well as the vessels and the catch histories related to the LLP 
Licenses, linked crab LLP Licenses, and any other fishing rights or 
other interests associated with the LLP Licenses and vessels included in 
the Selected Offers. The aggregate of all Reduction Agreements and 
Reduction Contracts signed by Subsector Members whose offers to 
participate in this buyback were accepted by votes of the Subsector 
Members, will together with the FLCC's supporting documents and 
rationale for recognizing that these offers represent the expenditure of 
the least money for the greatest capacity reduction, constitute the 
Reduction Plan to be submitted to NMFS for approval on behalf of the 
Secretary of Commerce.
    (2) Loan repayment--(i) Term. As authorized by Section 219(B)(2) of 
the Act, the capacity reduction loan (the ``Reduction Loan'') shall be 
amortized over a thirty (30) year term. The Reduction Loan's original 
principal amount may not exceed thirty-six million dollars 
($36,000,000), but may be less if the reduction cost is less. Subsector 
Members acknowledge that in the event payments made under the Reduction 
Plan are insufficient to repay the actual loan, the term of repayment 
shall be extended by NMFS until the loan is paid in full.
    (ii) Interest. The Reduction Loan's interest rate will be the U.S. 
Treasury's cost of borrowing equivalent maturity funds plus 2 percent. 
NMFS will determine the Reduction Loan's initial interest rate when NMFS 
borrows from the U.S. Treasury the funds with which to disburse 
reduction payments. The initial interest rate will change to a final 
interest rate at the end of the Federal fiscal year in which NMFS 
borrows the funds from the U.S. Treasury. The final interest rate will 
be 2 percent plus a weighted average, throughout that fiscal year, of 
the U.S. Treasury's cost of borrowing equivalent maturity funds. The 
final interest rate will be fixed, and will not vary over the remainder 
of the reduction loan's 30-year term. The Reduction loan will be subject 
to a level debt amortization. There is no prepayment penalty.
    (iii) Fees. The Reduction Loan shall be repaid by fees collected 
from the Longline Subsector. The fee amount will be based upon: The 
principal and interest due over the next twelve months divided by the 
product of the Hook & Line, Catcher Processor (Longline Subsector; 
sometimes referred to as the ``H&LCP Subsector'') portion of the BSAI 
Pacific cod ITAC (in metric tons) set by the North Pacific Fishery 
Management Council (NPFMC) in December of each year multiplied by 2,205 
(i.e., the number of

[[Page 177]]

pounds in a metric ton). In the event that the Longline Subsector 
portion for the ensuing year is not available, the Longline Subsector 
portion forecast from the preceding year will be used to calculate the 
fee.
    (A) The fee will be expressed in cents per pound rounded up to the 
next one-tenth of a cent. For example: If the principal and interest due 
equal $2,900,000 and the Longline Subsector portion equals 100,000 
metric tons, then the fee per round weight pound of Pacific cod will 
equal 1.4 cents per pound. [2,900,000 /(100,000 x 2,205) = .01315]. The 
fee will be accessed and collected on Pacific cod to the extent possible 
and if not, will be accessed and collected as provided for in this 
paragraph (e).
    (B) Fees must be accessed and collected on Pacific cod used for bait 
or discarded. Although the fee could be up to 5 percent of the ex-vessel 
production value of all post-reduction Longline Subsector landings, the 
fee will be less than 5 percent if NMFS projects that a lesser rate can 
amortize the fishery's reduction loan over the reduction loan's 30-year 
term. In the event that the total principal and interest due exceeds 5 
percent of the ex-vessel Pacific cod revenues, a penny per pound round 
weight fee will be calculated based on the latest available revenue 
records and NMFS conversion factors for pollock, arrowtooth flounder, 
Greenland turbot, skate, yellowfin sole and rock sole.
    (C) The additional fee will be limited to the amount necessary to 
amortize the remaining twelve months principal and interest in addition 
to the 5 percent fee accessed against Pacific cod. The additional fee 
will be a minimum of one cent per pound. In the event that collections 
exceed the total principal and interest needed to amortize the payment 
due, the principal balance of the loan will be reduced. To verify that 
the fees collected do not exceed 5 percent of the fishery revenues, the 
annual total of principal and interest due will be compared to the 
latest available annual Longline Subsector revenues to ensure it is 
equal to or less than 5 percent of the total ex-vessel production 
revenues. In the event that any of the components necessary to calculate 
the next year's fee are not available, or for any other reason NMFS 
believes the calculation must be postponed, the fee will remain at the 
previous year's amount until such a time that new calculations are made 
and communicated to the post reduction fishery participants.
    (D) It is possible that the fishery may not open during some years 
and no Longline Subsector portion of the ITAC is granted. Consequently, 
the fishery will not produce fee revenue with which to service the 
reduction loan during those years. However, interest will continue to 
accrue on the principal balance. When this happens, if the fee rate is 
not already at the maximum 5 percent, NMFS will increase the fisheries' 
fee rate to the maximum 5 percent of the revenues for Pacific cod and 
the species mentioned in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B), apply all subsequent 
fee revenue first to the payment of accrued interest, and continue the 
maximum fee rates until all principal and interest payments become 
current. Once all principal and interest payments are current, NMFS will 
make a determination about adjusting the fee rate.
    (iv) Reduction loan. NMFS has promulgated framework regulations 
generally applicable to all fishing capacity reduction programs (Sec. 
600.1000 et seq.). The reduction loan shall be subject to the provisions 
of Sec. 600.1012, except that: the borrower's obligation to repay the 
reduction loan shall be discharged by the owner of the Longline 
Subsector license regardless of which vessel catches fish under this 
license and regardless of who processes the fish in the reduction 
fishery in accordance with Sec. 600.1013. Longline Subsector license 
owners in the reduction fishery shall be obligated to collect the fee in 
accordance with Sec. 600.1013.
    (v) Collection. The LLP License holder of the vessel harvesting in 
the post-capacity reduction plan Longline Subsector shall be responsible 
for self-collecting the repayment fees owed by that LLP License holder. 
Fees shall be submitted to NMFS monthly and shall be due no later than 
fifteen (15) calendar days following the end of each calendar month.
    (vi) Record keeping and Reporting. The holder of the LLP License on 
which a

[[Page 178]]

vessel harvesting in the post-capacity reduction plan Longline Subsector 
is designated shall be responsible for compliance with the applicable 
record keeping and reporting requirements.
    (3) Agreement with Secretary. Each Selected Offeror, and vessel 
owner if not the Subsector Member, that has submitted a Selected Offer 
shall complete and deliver to the FLCC for inclusion in the Reduction 
Plan submitted to NMFS, designee for the Secretary, a completed and 
fully executed Reduction Contract. Any and all LLP License(s) and or 
vessels set forth on a Selected Offer shall be included as Reduction 
Fishing Interests in such Reduction Contract.
    (f) Decisions of the Auditor and the FLCC. Time is of the essence in 
developing and implementing a Reduction Plan and, accordingly, the 
Offerors shall be limited to, and bound by, the decisions of the Auditor 
and the FLCC.
    (1) The Auditor's examination of submitted applications, Offers, 
Prequalification Offers and Rankings shall be solely ministerial in 
nature. That is, the Auditor will verify whether the documents submitted 
by Subsector Members are, on their face, consistent with each other and 
the Database, in compliance with the requirements set forth in the 
Reduction Agreement, and, signed by an Authorized Party. The Auditor may 
presume the validity of all signatures on documents submitted. The 
Auditor shall not make substantive decisions as to compliance (e.g., 
whether an interim LLP License satisfies the requirements of the Act, or 
whether a discrepancy in the name appearing on LLP Licenses and other 
documents is material).
    (2) [Reserved]
    (g) Enforcement/specific performance. The parties to the Reduction 
Agreement have agreed that the opportunity to develop and submit a 
capacity reduction program for the Longline Subsector under the terms of 
the Act is both unique and finite and that failure of a Selected 
Offeror, and vessel owner, if not a Subsector Member, to perform the 
obligations provided by the Reduction Agreement will result in 
irreparable damage to the FLCC, the Subsector Members and other Selected 
Offerors. Accordingly, the parties to the Reduction Agreement expressly 
acknowledge that money damages are an inadequate means of redress and 
agree that upon the failure of the Selected Offeror, and vessel owner if 
not a Subsector Member, to fulfill its obligations under the Reduction 
Agreement that specific performance of those obligations may be obtained 
by suit in equity brought by the FLCC in any court of competent 
jurisdiction without obligation to arbitrate such action.
    (h) Miscellaneous--(1) Time/Holidays. All times related to the 
Selection Process shall be the time kept in the Pacific time zone as 
calculated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. In the 
event that any date occurring within the Selection Process is a Federal 
holiday, the date shall roll over to the next occurring business day.
    (2) Termination. The Reduction Agreement shall automatically 
terminate if no vote of acceptance is completed by December 31, 2007. 
The Reduction Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to approval 
of the Reduction Plan by NMFS, on behalf of the Secretary, by written 
notice from 50 percent of Subsector Members.
    (3) Choice of law/venue. The Reduction Agreement shall be construed 
and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington 
without regard to its choice of law provisions. The parties submit to 
the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the United States District Court 
located in Seattle, Washington, with respect to any litigation arising 
out of or relating to the Reduction Agreement or out of the performance 
of services hereunder.
    (4) Incorporation. All executed counterparts of the Reduction 
Agreement, Application Forms and Offers constitute the agreement between 
the parties with respect to the subject matter of the Reduction 
Agreement and are incorporated into the Reduction Agreement as if fully 
written.
    (5) Counterparts. The Reduction Agreement may be executed in 
multiple counterparts and will be effective as to signatories on the 
Effective Date. The Reduction Agreement may be executed in duplicate 
originals, each of which shall be deemed to be an original instrument. 
All such counterparts and

[[Page 179]]

duplicate originals together shall constitute the same agreement, 
whether or not all parties execute each counterpart.
    (i) The facsimile signature of any party to the Reduction Agreement 
shall constitute the duly authorized, irrevocable execution and delivery 
of the Reduction Agreement as fully as if the Reduction Agreement 
contained the original ink signatures of the party or parties supplying 
a facsimile signature.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (i) Amendment. Subsector Member acknowledges that the Reduction 
Agreement, the Reduction Contract, and the Reduction Plan may be subject 
to amendment to conform to the requirements for approval of the 
Reduction Plan by NMFS on behalf of the Secretary. The Auditor shall 
distribute to each Subsector Member in electronic format the amended 
form of the Reduction Agreement, the Reduction Contract, and the 
Reduction Plan, which amended documents in the form distributed by the 
Auditor and identified by the Auditor by date and version, the version 
of each such document then in effect at the time of any dispute arising 
or action taken shall be deemed binding upon the parties with respect to 
such dispute and/or action.
    (j) Warranties. Subsector Member must expressly warrant and 
represent in the Reduction Agreement that:
    (1) Subsector Member has had an opportunity to consult with 
Subsector Member's attorney or other advisors of Subsector Member with 
respect to the Reduction Agreement, the Reduction Contract, and the Act 
and the ramifications of the ratification of the Reduction Plan 
contemplated therein;
    (2) Subsector Member has full understanding and appreciation of the 
ramifications of executing and delivering the Reduction Agreement and, 
free from coercion of any kind by the FLCC or any of its members, 
officers, agents and/or employees, executes and delivers the Reduction 
Agreement as the free and voluntary act of Subsector Member;
    (3) The execution and delivery of the Reduction Agreement, does not 
and will not conflict with any provisions of the governing documents of 
Subsector Member;
    (4) The person executing the Reduction Agreement has been duly 
authorized by Subsector Member to execute and deliver the Reduction 
Agreement and to undertake and perform the actions contemplated herein; 
and
    (5) Subsector Member has taken all actions necessary for the 
Reduction Agreement to constitute the valid and binding obligation of 
Subsector Member, enforceable in accordance with its terms.
    (k) Approval of the reduction plan. Acceptance of the Offers are at 
the sole discretion of NMFS on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce. To 
be approved by NMFS, on behalf of the Secretary, any Reduction Plan 
developed and submitted in accordance with this section and subpart M to 
this part must be found by the Assistant Administrator of NMFS, to:
    (1) Be consistent with the requirements of Section 219(e) of the FY 
2005 Appropriations Act (Public Law 108-447);
    (2) Be consistent with the requirements of Section 312(b) of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 
1861(a)) except for the requirement that a Council or Governor of a 
State request such a program (as set out in section 312(b)(1)) and for 
the requirements of section 312(b)(4);
    (3) Contain provisions for a fee system that provides for full and 
timely repayment of the capacity reduction loan by the Longline 
Subsector and that it provide for the assessment of such fees;
    (4) Not require a bidding or auction process;
    (5) Result in the maximum sustained reduction in fishing capacity at 
the least cost and in the minimum amount of time; and
    (6) Permit vessels in the Longline Subsector to be upgraded to 
achieve efficiencies in fishing operations provided that such upgrades 
do not result in the vessel exceeding the applicable length, tonnage, or 
horsepower limitations set out in Federal law or regulation.
    (l) Referenda. The provisions of Sec. 600.1010 (including 
Sec. Sec. 600.1004(a),

[[Page 180]]

600.1008, 600.1009, 600.1013, 600.1014, and 600.1017(a)(5), (6) and (7)) 
shall apply to the Reduction Plan of this section to the extent that 
they do not conflict with this section or with subpart M of this part.

Appendix to Sec. 600.1105--Fishing Capacity Reduction Contract: Bering 
      Sea and Aleutian Islands Longline Catcher Processor Subsector

  Fishing Capacity Reduction Contract: Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands 
                  Longline Catcher Processor Subsector

    This agreement, (the ``Reduction Contract'') is entered into by and 
between the party or parties named in section 46 of this contract 
entitled, ``Fishing Capacity Reduction Offer Submission Form and 
Reduction Fishing Interests Identification,'' as the qualifying Offeror 
and as the co-Offeror (if there is a co-Offeror) (collectively the 
``Offeror'') and the United States of America, acting by and through the 
Secretary of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 
National Marine Fisheries Service, Financial Services Division 
(``NMFS''). The Reduction Contract is effective when NMFS signs the 
Reduction Contract and, thereby, accepts the Offeror's offer, subject to 
the condition subsequent of NMFS' formal notification of a successful 
referendum.

                               Witnesseth

    Whereas, Section 219, Title II, Division B of the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, 2005, as enacted on December 8, 2004, (the ``Act'') 
authorizes a fishing capacity reduction program implementing capacity 
reduction plans submitted to NMFS by catcher processor subsectors of the 
Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (``BSAI'') non-pollock groundfish 
fishery as set forth in the Act;
    Whereas, the longline catcher processor subsector (the ``Longline 
Subsector'') is among the catcher processor subsectors eligible to 
submit to NMFS a capacity reduction plan under the terms of the Act;
    Whereas, the Freezer Longline Conservation Cooperative (the 
``FLCC'') has developed and is submitting to NMFS concurrently with this 
Reduction Contract a capacity reduction plan for the Longline Subsector 
(the ``Reduction Plan'');
    Whereas, the selection process will be pursuant to the fishing 
capacity Reduction Contract and the Reduction Plan;
    Whereas, the term ``Reduction Fishery'' is defined by the Reduction 
Plan as the longline catcher processor subsector of the BSAI non-pollock 
groundfish fishery;
    Whereas, the Reduction Plan's express objective is to permanently 
reduce harvesting capacity in the Reduction Fishery; Whereas, NMFS 
implements the Reduction Plan pursuant to Section 219 of the Act as well 
as the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 
U.S.C. 1861a(b)-(e))(as excepted by the Act, including inter alia, any 
requirement that the Reduction Plan include a bidding or auction 
process) and other applicable law;
    Whereas, NMFS has promulgated framework regulations generally 
applicable to all fishing capacity reduction programs, portions of which 
are applicable to the Reduction Plan, (50 CFR 600.1000 et seq.);
    Whereas, NMFS can implement the Reduction Plan only after giving 
notice to all members of the Longline Subsector of the Reduction Plan 
pursuant to Section 219(3)(b) of the Act and approval of the Reduction 
Plan by referendum of the Longline Subsector; and
    Whereas, this Reduction Contract is submitted by Offeror and the 
FLCC as an integral element of the Reduction Plan and is expressly 
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the framework 
regulations, the final rule (as used in this contract ``final rule'' 
means the final rule promulgated by NMFS which sets forth the 
regulations implementing the Reduction Plan for the Longline Subsector) 
and applicable law.
    Now therefore, for good and valuable consideration and the premises 
and covenants hereinafter set forth the receipt and sufficiency of which 
the parties to the Reduction Contract hereby acknowledge, and intending 
to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:
    1. Incorporation of Recitals. The foregoing recitals are true and 
correct and are expressly incorporated herein by this reference.
    2. Further Incorporation. The Act, framework regulations, final rule 
and any other rule promulgated pursuant to the Act are expressly 
incorporated herein by this reference. In the event of conflicting 
language, the framework regulations, the final rule and any other rule 
promulgated pursuant to the Act, take precedence over the Reduction 
Contract.
    3. Contract Form. By completing and submitting the Reduction 
Contract to NMFS the Offeror hereby irrevocably offers to relinquish its 
Reduction Fishing Interests. If NMFS discovers any deficiencies in the 
Offeror's submission to NMFS, NMFS may, at its sole discretion, contact 
the Offeror in an attempt to correct such offer deficiency. ``Reduction 
Fishing Interests'' means all of Offeror(s) rights, title and interest 
to the Groundfish Reduction Permit, Reduction Permit(s), Reduction 
Fishing Privilege and Reduction Fishing History as defined in this 
Reduction Contract.
    4. Groundfish Reduction Permit. Offeror expressly acknowledges that 
it hereby offers to permanently surrender, relinquish, and have

[[Page 181]]

NMFS permanently revoke the valid non-interim Federal License Limitation 
Program groundfish license issued pursuant to 50 CFR 679.4(k) (or 
successor regulation) endorsed for Bering Sea or Aleutian Islands 
catcher processor fishing activity, C/P, Pacific cod, and hook and line 
gear identified in section 46 of this contract as well as any present or 
future claims of eligibility for any fishery privilege based upon such 
permit, including any Latent License and any offered and accepted 
interim permit that Offeror causes to become a non-interim permit, (the 
``Groundfish Reduction Permit'').
    5. Reduction Permit(s). Offeror hereby acknowledges that it offers 
to permanently surrender, relinquish, and have NMFS permanently revoke 
any and all Federal fishery licenses, fishery permits, and area and 
species endorsements issued for any vessel named on the Groundfish 
Reduction Permit as well as any present or future claims of eligibility 
for any fishery privilege based upon such permit, including any Latent 
License, (the ``Reduction Permits'').
    6. Reduction Privilege Vessel. The Reduction Privilege Vessel is the 
vessel listed on the Offeror's License Limitation Program license.
    7. Reduction Fishing Privilege. If a vessel is specified in section 
46 of this contract (the ``Reduction Privilege Vessel''), Offeror hereby 
acknowledges that Offeror offers to relinquish and surrender the 
Reduction Privilege Vessel's fishing privilege and consents to the 
imposition of Federal vessel documentation restrictions that have the 
effect of permanently revoking the Reduction Privilege Vessel's legal 
ability to fish anywhere in the world as well as its legal ability to 
operate under foreign registry or control--including the Reduction 
Privilege Vessel's: fisheries trade endorsement under the Commercial 
Fishing Industry Vessel Anti-Reflagging Act (46 U.S.C. 12108); 
eligibility for the approval required under section 9(c)(2) of the 
Shipping Act, 1916 (46 U.S.C. App. 808(c)(2)), for the placement of a 
vessel under foreign flag or registry, as well as its operation under 
the authority of a foreign country; and the privilege otherwise to ever 
fish again anywhere in the world (the ``Reduction Fishing Privilege''). 
Offeror agrees to instruct the United States Coast Guard's Vessel 
Documentation Center to remove the fishery endorsement from the 
Reduction Privilege Vessel. If the Reduction Privilege Vessel is not a 
federally documented vessel, the Offeror offers to promptly scrap the 
vessel and allow NMFS whatever access to the scrapping NMFS deems 
reasonably necessary to document and confirm the scrapping.
    8. Reduction Fishing History. Offeror surrenders, relinquishes, and 
consents to NMFS' permanent revocation of the following Reduction 
Fishing History (the ``Reduction Fishing History''):
    a. The Reduction Privilege Vessel's full and complete documented 
harvest of groundfish;
    b. For any documented harvest of the Reduction Privilege Vessel 
whatsoever, including that specified in section 8 of this contract, any 
right or privilege to make any claim in any way related to any fishery 
privilege derived in whole or in part from any such other and documented 
harvest which could ever qualify any party for any future limited access 
system fishing license, permit, and other harvest authorization of any 
kind; including without limitation crab LLP licenses linked to License 
Limitation Program (``LLP'') licenses, state fishing rights appurtenant 
to Reduction Fishing Vessels, and all fishing history associated 
therewith, but without prejudice to any party who before submission of 
this offer may have for value independently acquired the fishing history 
involving any such documented harvest;
    c. Any documented harvest on any other vessel (Reduction Fishing 
Vessel) that gave rise to the Groundfish Reduction Permit; and
    d. All fishing history associated with the latent LLP license 
identified on the Selected Offer and any fishing history associated with 
the fishing vessel that gave rise to the latent LLP license that remains 
in the Offeror's possession as of August 11, 2006 (i.e., date of 
publication of the proposed rule in the Federal Register).
    9. Halibut, Sablefish and Crab IFQs Excluded. Notwithstanding any 
other provision of this Reduction Contract, no right, title and/or 
interest to harvest, process or otherwise utilize individual fishing 
quota (``IFQ'') quota share in the halibut, sablefish and crab fisheries 
pursuant to 50 CFR parts 679 and 680, nor crab LLP license history to 
the extent necessary for the issuance of crab IFQ pursuant to 50 CFR 
part 680 as in effect as of the date of this Contract, shall be included 
among Offeror's Reduction Fishing Interests.
    10. Representations and Warranties. Offeror represents and warrants 
that, as of the date of submission of this Reduction Contract, Offeror 
is:
    a. The holder of record, according to NMFS' official fishing license 
records, at the time of offer, of the Groundfish Reduction Permit and 
the Reduction Permit(s).
    b. The Reduction Privilege Vessel's owner of record, according to 
the National Vessel Documentation Center's official vessel documentation 
records, at the time of offer, and that the Reduction Privilege Vessel 
is neither lost nor destroyed at the time of offer.
    c. In retention of and fully and legally entitled to offer and 
dispose of hereunder, full and complete rights to the Reduction 
Privilege Vessel's full and complete Reduction

[[Page 182]]

Fishing History necessary to fully and completely comply with the 
requirements of section 8 of this contract.
    11. Offer Amount. NMFS' payment to Offeror in the exact amount of 
the amount set forth by Offeror in section 46 of this contract is full 
and complete consideration for the Offeror's offer.
    12. Additional Offer Elements. Offeror shall include with its offer 
an exact photocopy of the Reduction Privilege Vessel's official vessel 
documentation or registration (i.e., the certificate of documentation 
the U.S. Coast Guard's National Vessel Documentation Center issued for 
federally documented vessels or the registration a State issues for 
State registered vessels) and an exact photocopy of the Groundfish 
Reduction Permit and all Reduction Permit(s). The Offeror shall also 
include with the offer all other information required in this Reduction 
Contract and otherwise comply with Reduction Contract requirements.
    13. Use of Official Fishing License or Permit Databases. Offeror 
expressly acknowledges that NMFS shall use the appropriate official 
governmental fishing license or permit database to:
    Determine the Offeror's address of record; verify the Offeror's 
qualification to offer; determine the holder of record of the Groundfish 
Reduction Permit and Reduction Permit(s); and verify the Offeror's 
inclusion in the offer of all permits and licenses required to be 
offered in the Offer.
    14. Use of National Vessel Documentation Center Database. Offeror 
expressly acknowledges that NMFS shall use the records of the National 
Vessel Documentation Center to determine the owner of record for a 
federally documented Reduction Privilege Vessel and the appropriate 
State records to determine the owner of record of a non-federally 
documented Reduction Privilege Vessel.
    15. Offeror to Ensure Accurate Records. Offeror shall, to the best 
of its ability, ensure that the records of the databases relevant to 
sections 13 and 14 of this contract are true, accurate, and complete.
    16. Submissions are Irrevocable. The parties hereto expressly 
acknowledge as the essence hereof that the Offeror voluntarily submits 
to NMFS this firm and irrevocable offer. The Offeror expressly 
acknowledges that it hereby waives any privilege or right to withdraw, 
change, modify, alter, rescind, or cancel any portion of the Reduction 
Contract and that the receipt date and time which NMFS marks on the 
Reduction Contract constitutes the date and time of the offer's 
submission.
    17. Offer Rejection. NMFS shall reject an offer that NMFS deems is 
in any way unresponsive or not in conformance with the Reduction 
Contract, and the applicable law or regulations unless the Offeror 
corrects the defect and NMFS, in its sole discretion, accepts the 
correction.
    18. Notarized Offeror Signature(s) Required. NMFS shall deem as non-
responsive and reject an offer whose Offer Submission Form does not 
contain the notarized signatures of all persons required to sign the 
form on behalf of the Offeror.
    19. Offer Rejections Constitute Final Agency Action. NMFS's offer 
rejections are conclusive and constitute final agency action as of the 
rejection date.
    20. Effect of Offer Submission. Submitting an irrevocable offer 
conforming to the requirements stated herein entitles the Offeror to 
have NMFS accept the offer if NMFS, in its sole discretion, deems that 
the offer is fully responsive and complies with the Act, the final rule 
and any other rule promulgated pursuant to the Act.
    21. Offeror Retains Use. After submitting an offer, the Offeror 
shall continue to hold, own, or retain unimpaired every aspect of any 
and all LLP License(s) and or vessels set forth on an Offer included as 
Reduction Fishing Interests, until such time as: NMFS notifies the 
Offeror that the Reduction Plan is not in compliance with the Act or 
other applicable law and will not be approved by NMFS; notifies the 
Offeror that the referendum was unsuccessful; NMFS tenders the reduction 
payment and the Offeror complies with its obligations under the 
Reduction Contract; or NMFS otherwise excuses the Offeror's performance.
    22. Acceptance by Referendum. NMFS shall formally notify the Offeror 
in writing whether the referendum is successful, which written notice 
shall inform Offeror that the condition subsequent has been satisfied. 
Therefore, Offeror expressly acknowledges that all parties must perform 
under the Reduction Contract and the Reduction Contract is enforceable 
against, and binding on, the Reduction Contract parties in accordance 
with the terms and conditions herein.
    23. Reduction Contract Subject to Federal Law. The Reduction 
Contract is subject to Federal law.
    24. Notice to Creditors. Upon NMFS' offer acceptance notice to the 
Offeror, Offeror agrees to notify all parties with secured interests in 
the Reduction Fishing Interests that the Offeror has entered into the 
Reduction Contract.
    25. Referendum. Offeror acknowledges that the outcome of the 
referendum of the Reduction Plan is an occurrence over which NMFS has no 
control.
    26. Unsuccessful Referendum Excuses Performance. An unsuccessful 
referendum excuses all parties hereto from every obligation to perform 
under the Reduction Contract. In such event, NMFS need not tender 
reduction payment and the Offeror need not

[[Page 183]]

surrender and relinquish or allow the revocation or restriction of any 
element of the Reduction Fishing Interest specified in the Reduction 
Contract. An unsuccessful referendum shall cause the Reduction Contract 
to have no further force or effect.
    27. Offeror Responsibilities upon Successful Referendum. Upon NMFS' 
formal notification to the Offeror that the referendum was successful 
and that NMFS had accepted the Reduction Contract, Offeror shall 
immediately become ready to surrender and relinquish and allow the 
revocation or restriction of (as NMFS deems appropriate) the Reduction 
Fishing Interests.
    28. Written Payment Instructions. After a successful referendum, 
NMFS shall tender reduction payment by requesting the Offeror to provide 
to NMFS, and the Offeror shall subsequently so provide, written payment 
instructions for NMFS' disbursement of the reduction payment to the 
Offeror or to the Offeror's order.
    29. Request for Written Payment Instructions Constitutes Tender. 
NMFS' request to the Offeror for written payment instructions 
constitutes reduction payment tender, as specified in 50 CFR 600.1011.
    30. Offeror Responsibilities upon Tender. Upon NMFS' reduction 
payment tender to the Offeror, the Offeror shall immediately surrender 
and relinquish and allow the revocation or restriction of (as NMFS deems 
appropriate) the Reduction Fishing Interests. The Offeror must then 
return the original of its Groundfish Reduction Permit and Reduction 
Permit(s) to NMFS. Concurrently with NMFS' reduction payment tender, the 
Offeror shall forever cease all fishing for any species with the 
Reduction Privilege Vessel and immediately retrieve all fishing gear, 
irrespective of ownership, previously deployed from the Reduction 
Privilege Vessel. Offeror agrees to authorize the United States Coast 
Guard to cancel the fishery endorsement in the Reduction Privilege 
Vessel.
    31. Reduction Privilege Vessel Lacking Federal Documentation. Upon 
NMFS' reduction payment tender to the Offeror, the Offeror shall 
immediately scrap any vessel which the Offeror specified as a Reduction 
Privilege Vessel and which is documented solely under state law or 
otherwise lacks documentation under Federal law. The Offeror shall scrap 
such vessel at the Offeror's expense. The Offeror shall allow NMFS, its 
agents, or its appointees reasonable opportunity to observe and confirm 
such scrapping. The Offeror shall conclude such scrapping within a 
reasonable time.
    32. Future Harvest Privilege and Reduction Fishing History 
Extinguished. Upon NMFS' reduction payment tender to the Offeror, the 
Offeror shall surrender and relinquish and consent to the revocation, 
restriction, withdrawal, invalidation, or extinguishment by other means 
(as NMFS deems appropriate), of any claim in any way related to any 
fishing privilege derived, in whole or in part, from the use or 
holdership of the Groundfish Reduction Permits and the Reduction 
Permit(s), from the use or ownership of the Reduction Privilege Vessel 
(subject to and in accordance with the provisions of section 8 of this 
contract), and from any documented harvest fishing history arising under 
or associated with the same which could ever qualify the Offeror for any 
future limited access fishing license, fishing permit, and other harvest 
authorization of any kind.
    33. Post Tender Use of Federally Documented Reduction Privilege 
Vessel. After NMFS' reduction payment tender to the Offeror, the Offeror 
may continue to use a federally documented Reduction Privilege Vessel 
for any lawful purpose except ``fishing'' as defined under the Magnuson-
Stevens Act and may transfer--subject to all restrictions in the 
Reduction Contract, other applicable regulations, and the applicable 
law--the vessel to a new owner. The Offeror or any subsequent owner 
shall only operate the Reduction Privilege Vessel under the United 
States flag and shall not operate such vessel under the authority of a 
foreign country. In the event the Offeror fails to abide by such 
restrictions, the Offeror expressly acknowledges and hereby agrees to 
allow NMFS to pursue any and all remedies available to it, including, 
but not limited to, recovering the reduction payment and seizing the 
Reduction Privilege Vessel and scrapping it at the Offeror's expense.
    34. NMFS' Actions upon Tender. Contemporaneously with NMFS' 
reduction payment tender to the Offeror, and without regard to the 
Offeror's refusal or failure to perform any of its Reduction Contract 
duties and obligations, NMFS shall: Permanently revoke the Offeror's 
Groundfish Reduction Permit and Reduction Permit(s); notify the National 
Vessel Documentation Center to permanently revoke the Reduction 
Privilege Vessel's fishery trade endorsement; notify the U.S. Maritime 
Administration to make the Reduction Privilege Vessel permanently 
ineligible for the approval of requests to place the vessel under 
foreign registry or operate the vessel under a foreign country's 
authority; record in the appropriate NMFS records that the Reduction 
Fishing History represented by any documented harvest fishing history 
accrued on, under, or as a result of the operation of the Reduction 
Privilege Vessel and/or Reduction Fishing Vessel (subject to and in 
accordance with the provisions of section 8 of this contract), the 
Groundfish Reduction Permit, and the Reduction Permit(s) which could 
ever qualify the Offeror for any future limited access fishing license, 
fishing permit, or other harvesting privilege of any kind shall never 
again be available to

[[Page 184]]

anyone for any fisheries purpose; and implement any other restrictions 
the applicable law or regulations impose.
    35. Material Disputes to be Identified. Members of the public shall, 
up until NMFS receives the Offeror's written payment instructions, be 
able to advise NMFS in writing of any material dispute with regard to 
any aspect of any accepted Reduction Contract. Such a material dispute 
shall neither relieve the Offeror of any Reduction Contract duties or 
obligations nor affect NMFS' right to enforce performance of the 
Reduction Contract terms and conditions.
    36. Reduction Payment Disbursement. Once NMFS receives the Offeror's 
written payment instructions and certification of compliance with the 
Reduction Contract, NMFS shall as soon as practicable disburse the 
reduction payment to the Offeror. Reduction payment disbursement shall 
be in strict accordance with the Offeror's written payment instructions. 
Unless the Offeror's written payment instructions direct NMFS to the 
contrary, NMFS shall disburse the whole of the reduction payment to the 
Offeror. If the qualifying Offeror offers with a co-Offeror, both the 
qualifying Offeror and the co-Offeror must approve and sign the written 
payment instructions.
    37. Reduction Payment Withheld for Scrapping or for Other Reasons. 
In the event that a Reduction Privilege Vessel which is not under 
Federal documentation must be scrapped, NMFS shall withhold from 
reduction payment disbursement an amount sufficient to scrap such 
vessel. NMFS shall withhold such sum until the vessel is completely 
scrapped before disbursing any amount withheld. NMFS may confirm, if 
NMFS so chooses, that the vessel has been scrapped before disbursing any 
amount withheld. If NMFS has reason to believe the Offeror has failed to 
comply with any of the Reduction Contract terms and conditions, NMFS 
shall also withhold reduction payment disbursement until such time as 
the Offeror performs in accordance with the Reduction Contract terms and 
conditions.
    38. Offeror Assistance with Restriction. The Offeror shall, upon 
NMFS' request, furnish such additional documents, undertakings, 
assurances, or take such other actions as may be reasonably required to 
enable NMFS' revocation, restriction, invalidation, withdrawal, or 
extinguishment by other means (as NMFS deems appropriate) of all 
components of the Reduction Contract's Reduction Fishing Interest in 
accordance with the requirements of the Reduction Contract terms and 
conditions, applicable regulations and the applicable law.
    39. Recordation of Restrictions. Upon the Reduction Fishing 
Privilege's revocation, the Offeror shall do everything reasonably 
necessary to ensure that such revocation is recorded on the Reduction 
Privilege Vessel's Federal documentation (which the National Vessel 
Documentation Center maintains in accordance with Federal maritime law 
and regulations) in such manner as is acceptable to NMFS and as shall 
prevent the Reduction Privilege Vessel, regardless of its subsequent 
ownership, from ever again being eligible for a fishery trade 
endorsement or ever again fishing. The term ``fishing'' includes the 
full range of activities defined in the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1802).
    40. Reduction Element Omission. In the event NMFS accepts the offer 
and the Offeror has failed, for any reason, to specify in the Reduction 
Contract any Groundfish Reduction Permit, non-Groundfish Reduction 
Permit(s), Reduction Privilege Vessel, Reduction Fishing Vessel, 
Reduction Fishing History, or any other element of the Reduction Fishing 
Interest which the Offeror should under Reduction Contract, applicable 
regulations and the applicable law have specified in Reduction Contract, 
such omitted element shall nevertheless be deemed to be included in the 
Reduction Contract and to be subject to the Reduction Contract's terms 
and conditions; and all Reduction Contract terms and conditions which 
should have applied to such omitted element had it not be omitted shall 
apply as if such element had not been omitted. Upon the Offeror 
discovering any such omission, the Offeror shall immediately and fully 
advise NMFS of such omission. Upon either NMFS or the Offeror 
discovering any such omission, the Offeror shall act in accordance with 
the Reduction Contract, applicable regulations and the applicable law.
    41. Remedy for Breach. Because money damages are not a sufficient 
remedy for the Offeror breaching any one or more of the Reduction 
Contract terms and conditions, the Offeror explicitly agrees to and 
hereby authorizes specific performance of the Reduction Contract, in 
addition to any money damages, as a remedy for such breach. In the event 
of such breach, NMFS shall take any reasonable action, including 
requiring and enforcing specific performance of the Reduction Contract, 
NMFS deems necessary to carry out the Reduction Contract, applicable 
regulations and the applicable law.
    42. Waiver of Data Confidentiality. The Offeror consents to the 
public release of any information provided in connection with the 
Reduction Contract or pursuant to Reduction Plan requirements, including 
any information provided in the Reduction Contract or by any other means 
associated with, or necessary for evaluation of, the Offeror's Reduction 
Contract if NMFS finds that the release of such information is necessary 
to achieve the Reduction Plan's authorized purpose. The Offeror hereby 
explicitly waives any claim of confidentiality otherwise afforded to 
catch, or harvest data and fishing histories otherwise protected from 
release

[[Page 185]]

under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 
U.S.C. 1881 a(b)) or any other law. In the event of such information 
release, the Offeror hereby forever fully and unconditionally releases 
and holds harmless the United States and its officers, agents, 
employees, representatives, of and from any and all claims, demands, 
debts, damages, duties, causes of action, actions and suits whatsoever, 
in law or equity, on account of any act, failure to act or event arising 
from, out of, or in any way related to, the release of any information 
associated with the Reduction Program.
    43. Oral Agreement Invalid. The Reduction Contract, any addendums to 
section 46 of this contract, and enclosures of photocopies of licenses 
and permits required under section 46 of this contract, contain the 
final terms and conditions of the agreement between the Offeror and NMFS 
and represent the entire and exclusive agreement between them. NMFS and 
the Offeror forever waive all right to sue, or otherwise counterclaim 
against each other, based on any claim of past, present, or future oral 
agreement between them.
    44. Severable Provisions. The Reduction Contract provisions are 
severable; and, in the event that any portion of the Reduction Contract 
is held to be void, invalid, non-binding, or otherwise unenforceable, 
the remaining portion thereof shall remain fully valid, binding, and 
enforceable against the Offeror and NMFS.
    45. Disputes. Any and all disputes involving the Reduction Contract, 
and any other Reduction Plan aspect affecting them shall in all respects 
be governed by the Federal laws of the United States; and the Offeror 
and all other parties claiming under the Offeror irrevocably submit 
themselves to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts of the United 
States and/or to any other Federal administrative body which the 
applicable law authorizes to adjudicate such disputes.
    46. Fishing Capacity Reduction Offer Submission Form and Reduction 
Fishing Interests Identification.
    a. Completion and Submission. The Offeror must fully, faithfully, 
and accurately complete this section 46 of this contract and thereafter 
submit the full and complete Reduction Contract to NMFS in accordance 
with the Reduction Contract. If completing this section requires 
inserting more information than the places provided for the insertion of 
such information allows, the Offeror should attach an addendum to the 
Reduction Contract that: Includes and identifies the additional 
information, states that the addendum is a part of the Reduction Fishing 
Interests Identification portion of the Reduction Contract, states (as a 
means of identifying the Reduction Contract to which the addendum 
relates) the NMFS license number designated on the Reduction Contract's 
Groundfish Reduction Permit, and is signed by all persons who signed the 
Reduction Contract as the Offeror.
    b. Offeror Information.
    (1) Offeror name(s). Insert in the table provided under this section 
46.b(1) of this contract the name(s) of the qualifying Offeror and of 
the co-Offeror (if there is a co-Offeror), and check the appropriate box 
for each name listed.
    Each name the Offeror inserts must be the full and exact legal name 
of record of each person, partnership, corporation or other business 
entity identified on the offer. If any Reduction Fishing Interest 
element is co-owned by more than one person, partnership, corporation or 
other business entity, the Offeror must insert each co-owner's name.
    In each case, the Offeror is the holder of record, at the time of 
Offeror's execution of this Reduction Contract, of the Groundfish 
Reduction Permit and the Reduction Permit(s). A co-Offeror is not 
allowed for either the Groundfish Reduction Permit or the Reduction 
Permit(s). If the Offeror is also the owner of record, at the time of 
offering, of the Reduction Privilege Vessel, the qualifying Offeror is 
the sole Offeror. If, however, the owner of record, at the time of 
execution of this Reduction Contract, of the Reduction Privilege Vessel 
is not exactly the same as the Offeror, then the owner of record is the 
co-Offeror; and the Offeror and the co-Offeror jointly offer together as 
the Offeror.

Fishing History--all as identified in the Reduction Contract or as 
required under applicable regulations, or the applicable law.
    The Offeror expressly acknowledges that NMFS' acceptance of the 
Offeror's offer hereunder and NMFS' tender, following a successful 
referendum, of a reduction payment in the same amount specified in 
section 46.g of this contract (less any sum withheld for scrapping any 
Reduction Privilege Vessel lacking Federal documentation or for any 
other purpose) to the Offeror shall, among other things, render the 
Reduction Privilege Vessel permanently ineligible or any fishing 
worldwide, including, but not limited to, fishing on the high seas or in 
the jurisdiction of any foreign country while operating under United 
States flag, and shall impose or create other legal and contractual 
restrictions, impediments, limitations, obligations, or other provisions 
which restrict, revoke, withdraw, invalidate, or extinguish by other 
means (as NMFS deems appropriate) the complete Reduction Fishing

Groundfish Reduction Permit, any Reduction Permit(s), the Reduction 
Privilege Vessel, and the Reduction Fishing History--all as more fully

applicable law.
    By completing and signing the Reduction Contract, the Offeror 
expressly acknowledges that the Offeror has fully and completely read 
the entire Reduction Contract. The Offeror expressly states, declares, 
affirms, attests, warrants, and represents to NMFS that the Offeror is 
fully able to enter into the Reduction Contract and that the Offeror 
legally holds, owns, or retains, and is fully able under the Reduction 
Contract provisions to offer and dispose of, the full Reduction Fishing 
Interest which the Reduction Contract specifies and the applicable 
regulations, and the applicable law requires that any person or entity 
completing the Reduction Contract and/or signing the Reduction Contract 
on behalf of another person or entity, expressly attests, warrants, and 
represents to NMFS that such completing and/or signing person or entity 
has the express and written permission or other grant of authority to 
bind such other person or entity to the Reduction Contract's terms and 
conditions. The Offeror expressly attests, warrants, and represents to 
NMFS that every co-owner of the Offeror necessary to constitute the 
Offeror's full and complete execution of the Reduction Contract has 
signed the Reduction Contract. The Offeror expressly attests, warrants, 
and represents to NMFS that the Offeror: Fully understands the 
consequences of submitting the completed Reduction Contract of which it 
is a party to NMFS; pledges to abide by the terms and conditions of the 
Reduction Contract; and is aware of, understands, and consents to, any 
and all remedies available to NMFS for the Offeror's breach of the 
Reduction Contract or submission of an offer which fails to conform with 
the Reduction Contract, final rule, applicable regulations and the 
applicable law. The Offeror expressly attests, warrants, and represents 
to NMFS that all information which the Offeror inserted in the Reduction 
Contract is true, accurate, complete, and fully in accordance with the 
Reduction Contract, final rule, other applicable regulations and the 
applicable law.
    In witness whereof, the Offeror has, in the place provided below, 
executed the Reduction Contract either as an Offeror offering alone or 
as an Offeror and co-Offeror (if there is a co-Offeror) jointly offering 
together, in accordance with the requirements specified above, and on 
the date written below. The Reduction Contract is effective as of the 
date NMFS accepts the Offeror's offer by signing the Reduction Contract.
    The Offeror and co-Offeror (if there is a co-Offeror) must each sign 
the Reduction Contract exactly as instructed herein. Each co-owner (if 
there is a co-owner) of each Offeror and co-Offeror (if there is a co-
Offeror) must also sign the Reduction Contract exactly as instructed 
herein. A notary public must, for each person or entity signing on 
behalf of the Offeror, complete and sign the acknowledgment and 
certification provision associated with each such person or entity's 
signature.

                                                       acknowledged that
                                                         he/she did so

Law 109-479, with appropriations authorized by Section 121 of Public Law 
109-479 and Public Law 110-161. The intent of the program is to 
permanently reduce, through an industry-financed permit buyback, the 
most harvesting capacity in the Reduction Fishery at the least cost, 
increase harvesting productivity for post-reduction Permit Holders and 
improve flexibility in the conservation and management of the fishery. 
Fishery participants will finance this program through a federal loan 
that will be repaid over 40 years through a fee collection system. The 
intent of the fee collection system is to establish the post-reduction 
Permit Holders' obligation to repay the Reduction Loan's principal and 
accrued interest over the repayment term, and to ensure repayment of the 
loan.

Bid, and before payment of the bid amount (Appendix A to Sec. 
600.1107).
    Secretary means the Secretary of Commerce or his/her designee.
    Southeast Revitalization Association (SRA) means the qualified 
fishery association authorized to develop and implement this capacity 
reduction program under Alaska Statute 16.40.250 and Federal law.
    (c) Enrollment in the capacity reduction program--(1) Distribution. 
The SRA shall mail a copy of the following four documents via certified 
mail to each Permit Holder: Bid; Fleet Consolidation Relinquishment 
Contract (Relinquishment Contract); Conditional Notice to CFEC and 
Request by Permit Holder; and (Conditional Relinquishment of Southeast 
Salmon Purse Seine Entry Permit. Such mailing shall include a closing 
date after which the SRA will not accept new bids.
    (2) Application. Any Permit Holder, regardless of whether having 
received the mailing described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, may 
participate in the Capacity Reduction Program by submitting all of the 
following documents to the SRA no later than the bid closing date:
    (i) A fully executed Bid consistent with Appendix A to this section;
    (ii) A photocopy of the permit evidencing the applicant's 
qualification as a participant in the fishery;
    (iii) A fully executed Relinquishment Contract: Southeast Alaska 
Salmon Purse Seine Permit Holders consistent with the appendix B to this 
section;
    (iv) A fully executed Conditional Notice to CFEC and Request by 
Permit Holder consistent with the appendix C to this section; and
    (v) A fully executed Conditional Relinquishment of Southeast Salmon 
Purse Seine Entry Permit consistent with the appendix D to this section.
    (A) The submitted Bid shall include the following information: Name, 
address, telephone number, social security number, and (if available) 
electronic mail address of the submitting Permit Holder, permit number, 
and whether any authorized party holds a security interest in the 
permit. Each application must be submitted to the SRA, c/o Elgee, 
Rehfeld, Mertz, LLC, Professional Plaza Building B, 9309 Glacier 
Highway, Suite B-200, Juneau, Alaska 99801. The initial determination 
that an application conforms to the prescribed requirements is made by 
this independent accounting firm and not the SRA.
    (B) The SRA or the independent accounting firm will notify the 
Permit Holder if the Bid is non-conforming and, in such cases, the 
Permit Holder may submit a revised, conforming Bid within the prescribed 
period (i.e., until the bid closing date).
    (3) Enrollment period. Applications that meet all requirements will 
be accepted until the bid selection process is completed but no later 
than the bid closing date specified by the SRA. The SRA will have a 
period of 21 days after the bid closing date to consult with CFEC and 
examine bid results to complete the selection process.
    (4) Effective date. The effective date of any Bid shall be when the 
SRA has

[[Page 192]]

completed the selection process and signed the Bid.
    (5) Notice. The SRA will notify each Accepted Bidder, via certified 
mail, of the effective date of the Bid Agreement.
    (6) Conflicts. Where terms and conditions in the Bid, Relinquishment 
Contract, Conditional Notice, and Conditional Relinquishment conflict 
with this regulation, the terms and conditions in the regulation are 
controlling.
    (d) Bid selection process. The fishing capacity removed by the 
Reduction Plan shall be represented by the total number of valid CFEC 
permits, whether active or latent, that are voluntarily offered by 
Permit Holders and selected by the SRA up to an aggregate amount of 
$23,476,500. Due to a rescission of funds, the underlying appropriations 
for this Reduction Program were reduced from $250,000 to $234,765, 
resulting in a loan ceiling of $23,476,500.
    (1) Overview. The Selection Process shall begin upon the receipt by 
the SRA of the first application and shall continue until: The bid 
closing date specified by the SRA (paragraph (c)(1) of this section); or 
the ranking of the next lowest bid would cause the total program costs 
to exceed $23,476,500. The SRA will have a period of 21 days after the 
bid closing date to consult with CFEC and examine bid results to 
complete the selection process. When either one of these events is 
reached, the Selection Process shall be completed.
    (i) During the selection process, the SRA in consultation with the 
CFEC shall examine each submitted Bid for consistency and the necessary 
elements, including the validity of the permit and whether any 
authorized party holds a security interest in the permit.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (2) Bids. By submitting the Bid, the bidder expressly acknowledges 
that he makes an irrevocable offer to relinquish to CFEC a permit for a 
specific price, and once having submitted the Bid, the bidder is not 
entitled to withdraw or in any way amend the Bid. The permit will be 
relinquished for the price set forth in the Bid contingent on such Bid 
being accepted by the SRA at the closing of the Selection Process. Any 
attempted withdrawal by a bidder shall be invalid, and the Bid shall 
remain a binding, irrevocable offer, unaffected by the attempted 
withdrawal. Any bid that is submitted by a Permit Holder but is not 
accepted by the SRA shall be deemed terminated and both the Permit 
Holder and the SRA will have no further obligation with respect to the 
Bid.
    (i) If a Permit Holder holds more than one permit, the Permit Holder 
must submit a separate Bid for each permit that he/she offers to 
relinquish.
    (ii) By submitting a Bid, the Permit Holder warrants and represents 
that he/she has read and understands the terms of the Program 
Regulations, Bid, Relinquishment Contract, Conditional Notice and 
Conditional Relinquishment, and has had the opportunity to seek 
independent legal counsel regarding such documents and the consequences 
of submitting the Bid Agreement.
    (3) Ranking. The SRA shall rank all conforming bids by using a 
reverse auction in which the SRA ranks the Bid with the lowest dollar 
amount and successively ranks each additional Bid with the next lowest 
dollar amount until there are no more Bids or the ranking of the next 
lowest bid would cause the total program cost to exceed $23,476,500. In 
the event of a tie with bids which results in the tied bids exceeding 
$23,476,500, the SRA will select the tied bid first received, if known. 
If the receipt time cannot be determined, neither bid will be accepted.
    (4) Acceptance and post-acceptance restriction of renewals and 
transfers. Upon expiration of the bid closing date, the SRA shall 
determine whether the number of ranked bids it is willing to accept is 
sufficient to achieve a substantial reduction in harvest capacity and 
increased economic efficiencies for those Permit Holders remaining in 
the fishery. If the SRA makes such a determination and thereafter 
accepts bids, the SRA shall send CFEC the Conditional Notice form 
restricting renewal and transfer of each permit for which a bid was 
accepted. The Bid, Relinquishment Contract, Conditional Notice and 
Conditional Relinquishment are terminated for any rejected bid and the 
applicant is no longer bound by the terms of these documents.

[[Page 193]]

    (e) Plan submission and approval--(1) Submitting the reduction plan. 
Within 30 days of concluding the selection process, the SRA shall submit 
the Reduction Plan, consisting of the aggregate of all Bid Agreements, 
Relinquishment Contracts, Conditional Notices and Conditional 
Relinquishments, together with supporting documents and rationale, to 
NMFS for final approval on behalf of the Secretary. The Reduction Plan 
shall include a listing of accepted bids arranged by bid amount from 
lowest to highest bid, attended by a statement from the SRA that all 
other bids received were higher than the largest dollar amount of the 
last bid accepted.
    (2) Required findings. In order to approve a Reduction Plan, the 
Assistant Administrator of NMFS, on behalf of the Secretary, must find 
that: The Reduction Plan is consistent with the amended Consolidated 
Appropriations Act of 2005 and applicable sections of the Magnuson-
Stevens Act, particularly that it is cost-effective; the Reduction Plan 
will result in the maximum sustained reduction in fishing capacity at 
the least cost; and the Reduction Plan will increase harvesting 
productivity for post-reduction Permit Holders participating in the 
fishery.
    (3) The referendum. If NMFS approves the Reduction Plan and 
subsequent to the publication of a final rule resulting from this rule, 
NMFS shall conduct a referendum to determine the industry's willingness 
to repay a fishing capacity reduction loan to purchase the permits 
identified in the Reduction Plan. NMFS shall publish a notice in the 
Federal Register requesting votes by Permit Holders on whether to accept 
or reject the Reduction Plan for implementation. The notice shall state 
the starting and ending dates and times of the voting period, which 
shall be not less than twenty one (21) nor more than thirty (30) 
calendar days from the date of such notice.
    (i) Such notice shall state the name and address of record of each 
eligible voter, as well as the basis for having determined the 
eligibility of those voters. This shall constitute notice and 
opportunity to respond about adding eligible voters, deleting ineligible 
voters, and/or correcting any voter's name and address of record, and 
will provide a 15 day period to make these changes. If, in NMFS' 
discretion, the comments received in response to such notice warrants 
it, or for other good cause, NMFS may modify such list by publishing 
another notice in the Federal Register. NMFS shall issue ballots to 
eligible voters, tally votes, and notify voters whether the referendum 
was successful or unsuccessful in approving the Reduction Plan 
consistent with the provisions of Sec. 600.1010.
    (ii) A successful referendum by a majority of the Permit Holders in 
the Reduction Fishery shall bind all parties and complete the reduction 
process. NMFS shall publish a notice in the Federal Register advising 
the public that the referendum was successful. Thereafter the Reduction 
Program shall be implemented.
    (iii) The provisions of Sec. 600.1010 and Sec. 600.1017(a)(1)-(4) 
shall apply to any referendum on the Reduction Plan of this section to 
the extent that they do not conflict with this section or with subpart M 
of this part.
    (f) Implementation--(1) Reduction payments. Within 60 days of a 
successful referendum, the CFEC will provide notice to NMFS of the 
permits retired from the Reduction Fishery. Upon receiving such 
notification, NMFS will then tender the accepted bid amounts to the 
Permit Holders. Reduction payments may not exceed $23,476,500 and if the 
SRA accepts a total number of bids in an aggregate amount less than 
$23,476,500, any remaining funds would be available for reduction 
payments as part of a later, separate Reduction Plan conforming to these 
regulations. Upon NMFS tendering the reduction program's payments to the 
selected Permit Holders, each such Permit Holder must permanently stop 
all fishing with the relinquished permit(s).
    (2) Repayment term. As authorized by the Act, the Reduction Loan 
shall be amortized over a forty (40) year term. The Reduction Loan's 
original principal amount may not exceed $23,476,500, but may be less if 
the ultimate reduction cost is less. The final Reduction Loan periodic 
payment amount will be determined by NMFS' analysis of the ability of 
the post-reduction fishery to service debt. The provisions of Sec. Sec. 
600.1012-600.1017 shall

[[Page 194]]

apply to any reduction loan, fee payment and collection under this 
section to the extent they do not conflict with this section or with 
subpart M of this part.
    (3) Loan repayment. Permit Holders operating in the fishery shall be 
obligated to pay the fee in accordance with this section. In the event 
that payments made under the Reduction Plan are insufficient to pay the 
Reduction Loan within the 40-year term, NMFS shall extend the term of 
the repayment until the Reduction Loan is paid in full.
    (i) Interest. The Reduction Loan's interest rate will be the U.S. 
Treasury's cost of borrowing equivalent maturity funds plus two percent. 
NMFS will determine the Reduction Loan's initial interest rate when NMFS 
borrows from the U.S. Treasury the funds with which to disburse 
reduction payments. Interest will begin accruing on the Reduction Loan 
from the date on which NMFS disburses such loan. The initial interest 
rate will change to a final interest rate at the end of the Federal 
fiscal year in which NMFS borrows the funds from the U.S. Treasury. The 
final interest rate will be two percent plus a weighted average, 
throughout that fiscal year, of the U.S. Treasury's cost of borrowing 
equivalent maturity funds. The final interest rate will be fixed and 
will not vary over the remainder of the reduction loan's 40-year term. 
The Reduction Loan will be subject to a level debt amortization. There 
is no prepayment penalty.
    (ii) Fees. Post-reduction Permit Holders operating in the fishery 
shall be obligated to pay the fee in accordance with paragraph (f) of 
this section. The amount of such fee will be calculated by NMFS on an 
annual basis as the principal and interest payment amount necessary to 
amortize the loan over a 40-year term. The fee shall be expressed as a 
percentage of the ex-vessel value of all salmon harvested and landed in 
the fishery. In the event that payments made under the Reduction Plan 
are insufficient to repay the Reduction Loan within the 40-year term, 
NMFS shall extend the term of the repayment until the Reduction Loan is 
paid in full.
    (A) Fees must be assessed and collected on all salmon harvested in 
the fishery. Although the fee could be up to three percent of the ex-
vessel price of all post-reduction landings, the fee will be less than 
three percent if NMFS projects that a lesser rate can amortize the 
Reduction Loan over the 40-year term. To verify that the fees collected 
do not exceed three percent of the fishery revenues, NMFS will compare 
the annual total of principal and interest due with the latest available 
annual revenues in the fishery to ensure that it is equal to or less 
than three percent of the total ex-vessel production revenues. In the 
event that any of the components necessary to calculate the next year's 
fee are not available, or postponed, the fee will remain at the previous 
year's amount until such time as new calculations are made and 
communicated to the post-reduction fishery participants.
    (B) If the fishery does not open during a year, interest will 
continue to accrue on the principal balance even though no fee revenue 
will be generated. When this happens, if the fee is not already at the 
maximum three percent, NMFS shall increase the fee to the maximum three 
percent, apply all subsequent fee revenue first to the payment of 
accrued interest, and continue the maximum fee rates until the principal 
and interest payments become current. Once all principal and interest 
payments are current, NMFS will make a determination about adjusting the 
fee rate.
    (iii) Collection. The buyer who first purchases the salmon landed in 
the fishery shall be responsible for collecting and submitting the 
repayment fees to NMFS monthly. The fees shall be submitted to NMFS no 
later than fifteen (15) calendar days following the end of each calendar 
month.
    (iv) Recordkeeping and reporting. The dealer who first purchases the 
salmon landed in the fishery shall be responsible for compliance with 
the applicable recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
    (A) All requirements and penalties set forth in the provisions of 
Sec. Sec. 600.1013 (Fee payment and collection), 600.1014 (Fee 
collection deposits, disbursements, records, and reports), 600.1015 
(Late charges), and 600.1017 (Prohibitions and penalties) shall apply to 
any

[[Page 195]]

dealer who purchases salmon in the fishery, and to any fee collection 
under this section, to the extent they do not conflict with this section 
or with subpart M of this part.
    (B) [Reserved]
    (g) Specific performance under the relinquishment contract. The 
parties to the Relinquishment Contract have agreed that the opportunity 
to develop and submit a capacity reduction program for the fishery under 
the terms of the Act is both unique and finite. The failure of a Permit 
Holder, whose bid was accepted, to perform the obligations under the 
Relinquishment Contract will result in irreparable damage to the SRA and 
all the other Permit Holders. Accordingly, the parties to the 
Relinquishment Contract expressly acknowledge that money damages are an 
inadequate means of redress and agree, that upon failure of the Permit 
Holder to fulfill his/her obligations under the Relinquishment Contract, 
that specific performance of those obligations may be obtained by suit 
in equity brought by the SRA in any court of competent jurisdiction 
without obligation to arbitrate such action.
    (h) Enforcement for failure to pay fees. The provisions and 
requirements of Sec. 600.1016 (Enforcement) shall also apply to fish 
sellers and fish buyers subject to this fishery.
    (i) Prohibitions and penalties. Fish buyers are prohibited from 
purchasing fish from fish sellers who do not pay the required landing 
fees. Fish sellers are prohibited from selling to fish buyers who do not 
pay the required landing fees.

    Whereas Alaska Statute 16.40.250 and the Act authorize a fishing 
capacity reduction program for the fishery;
    Whereas, within 30 days of concluding the selection process, the SRA 
shall submit the Reduction Plan, together with supporting documents and

    Whereas, the reduction Plan's express objective is to reduce fishing 
capacity by permanently revoking permits thereby promoting economic 
efficiency, improving flexibility in the conservation and management of 
the fishery and obtain the maximum reduction in permits at the least 
cost;
    Whereas, the SRA can implement the Reduction Plan only after giving 
notice to all Permit Holders and subsequent approval of the reduction 
Plan by referendum.

[[Page 196]]

    Whereas, the Agreement submitted by the bidder and the SRA is an 
integral element of the Reduction Plan.
    Now, therefore, for good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency 
of which is hereby acknowledged, the SRA and bidder agree as follows:

                        III. Terms and Conditions

    1. Form. By completing and submitting this Bid to the SRA the bidder 
hereby offers to permanently relinquish, and have the CFEC revoke, the 
permit. The SRA signing the Bid and subsequent NMFS payment to bidder in 
the exact bid amount set forth in section III, 11(f) of the Bid is full 
and complete consideration.
    2. Irrevocable. The bidder expressly acknowledges that by submitting 
the Bid he/she makes an irrevocable offer to relinquish the permit and 
once having submitted the Bid is not entitled to withdraw or in any 
manner amend the Bid. The receipt date that the SRA marks on the Bid 
constitutes the date of the bidder's submittal.
    3. Warranty. The bidder warrants and represents that he/she is the 
holder of record of the permit, according to the CFEC records, and that 
he/she has read and understands the terms of the Program Regulations, 
Bid, Relinquishment Contract, Conditional Notice and the Conditional 
Relinquishment and has had the opportunity to seek independent legal 
counsel regarding such documents and the consequences of submitting the 
Bid.
    4. Validity. The SRA, in consultation with the CFEC, shall examine 
each Bid for completeness and consistency. The SRA shall notify the 
bidder if the Bid is non-conforming. In such cases, the bidder may 
submit a revised, conforming Bid within the prescribed period (i.e., 
until the bid closing date).
    5. Ranking. The SRA shall rank the bid amount entered in section 
III, 11(f) of this Bid by using a reverse auction in which the SRA ranks 
the Bid with the lowest dollar amount and successively ranks each 
additional Bid with the next lowest dollar amount until there are no 
more Bids or the ranking of the next lowest Bid would exceed the total 
program cost. In the event of a tie with bids which results in the tied 
bids exceeding $23,476,500, the SRA will select the tied bid first 
received.
    6. Acceptance and Rejection. If the Bid is accepted, the SRA shall 
formally notify the bidder in writing. If the SRA rejects the Bid, the 
SRA will formally notify the bidder in writing and the Bid shall 
terminate without further obligation.
    7. Restriction of Transfer of permit: Upon acceptance, the SRA will 
send the CFEC the Conditional Notice, restricting transfer of the permit 
until such time as: The SRA notifies the bidder that the Plan is not in 
compliance with the Act and will not be approved; or NMFS notifies the 
bidder the referendum was unsuccessful.
    8. Payment. Within 60 days from the close of the voting period of a 
successful referendum, the CFEC will provide notice to NMFS of the 
permits retired from the Reduction Fishery. Upon receiving such notice, 
NMFS will then tender the accepted bid amounts to the Permit Holders.
    9. Specific Performance. The failure of a bidder whose Bid was 
accepted to comply with the terms of this Bid will result in irreparable 
damage to the SRA and its members because the Bid was part of the basis 
for the Plan submitted to the Secretary for approval. Accordingly, the 
SRA and bidder expressly acknowledge that money damages are an 
inadequate means of redress and agree that specific performance of those 
obligations may be obtained by suit in equity brought by the SRA in any 
court of competent jurisdiction without obligation to arbitrate such 
action.
    10. Submission. This Bid must be submitted within the prescribed 
period to the SRA, c/o Elgee, Rehfeld, Mertz, LLC, Professional Plaza 
Building B, 9309 Glacier Highway, Suite B-200, Juneau, AK 99801.

Appendix B to Sec. 600.1107--Relinquishment Contract: Southeast Alaska 
                    Salmon Purse Seine Permit Holders

    This Relinquishment Contract (``Contract'') and agreement is entered 
into between the Southeast Revitalization Association (``SRA'') and the 
bidder named in Section 11(a) of the Bid. The contract is effective when 
the bidder signs the Bid and this contract and, thereby, agrees to 
relinquish his/her permit, issued by the Alaska Commercial Fisheries 
Entry Commission (``CFEC'') for the Southeast Alaska salmon purse seine 
fishery (``fishery'').
    Whereas Alaska Statute 16.40.250 and Federal law authorize a fishing 
capacity reduction program for the fishery;
    Whereas, upon accepting and signing the Bid, the SRA shall submit a 
Reduction Plan to NMFS;
    Whereas, the Reduction Plan's express objective is to reduce fishing 
capacity by permanently revoking permits thereby promoting economic 
efficiency, improving flexibility in the conservation and management of 
the fishery and obtain the maximum reduction in permits at the least 
cost;
    Whereas, this contract is subject to the terms and conditions set 
forth herein, including the CFEC forms marked as Appendices C and D to 
Sec. 600.1107;
    Now, therefore, for valuable consideration and the covenants 
hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:
    1. The foregoing, including the Bid and specifically the definitions 
under section 1, are expressly incorporated herein by this reference.

[[Page 198]]

    2. Under AS 16.43.150(i), the Bidder agrees to permanently 
relinquish and have the CFEC revoke the permit.
    3. The Bidder represents that, as of the date of submitting the 
contract, he or she is the holder of record of the permit according to 
the CFEC official permit records.
    4. Upon notification by the SRA to the Bidder that the SRA accepted 
the bid; the SRA will submit to the CFEC the Permit Holder's executed 
notice form (Appendix C to Sec. 600.1107) and executed relinquishment 
form (Appendix D to Sec. 600.1107).
    5. In the event an authorized third party holds a security interest 
in the permit, NMFS will not make payment until receiving notice of 
written consent by the third party to the SRA and the CFEC on a form 
provided by the CFEC.
    6. NMFS' payment to the accepted bidder in the exact amount of the 
accepted bid amount is full and complete consideration for the CFEC 
revoking the permit.
    7. The bidder shall, upon the SRA or the CFEC request, furnish such 
additional documents, information, or take such other actions as may be 
reasonably required to enable the CFEC to implement relinquishment of 
the permit.
    8. The bidder consents to the public release of any information 
provided in connection with the contract or program requirements after 
completion of the plan.
    9. The contract contains the final terms and conditions of this 
agreement between the parties and represents the entire and exclusive 
agreement between them.
    10. The contract terms are severable, and, in the event that any 
portion of the contract is held to be unenforceable, the remaining 
portion shall remain fully enforceable against the parties.
    11. Any and all disputes involving the contract shall be governed by 
laws of the State of Alaska. The bidder expressly acknowledges that by 
submitting the Bid, he/she makes an irrevocable offer to relinquish the 
permit, and once having submitted the Bid, is not entitled to withdraw 
or in any way amend the Bid.
    12. The failure of a bidder to perform his/her obligations under the 
Bid will result in irreparable damage to the SRA and its members upon 
submittal of the Plan to the Secretary for approval. Accordingly, the 
SRA and the bidder expressly acknowledge that money damages are an 
inadequate means of redress and agree that upon failure of the bidder to 
fulfill his/her obligations under the Bid that specific performance of 
those obligations may be obtained by suit in equity brought by the SRA 
in any court of competent jurisdiction without obligation to arbitrate 
such action.

<R05>
Sec. 600.1108  Longline catcher processor subsector of the Bering Sea 
and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) non-pollock groundfish fishery program.

    (a) Purpose. This section implements the capacity reduction program 
that Title II, section 219(e) of Public Law 108-447 established for the 
longline catcher processor subsector of the Bering Sea and Aleutian 
Islands (BSAI) non-pollock groundfish fishery.
    (b) Definitions. Unless otherwise defined in this section, the terms 
defined in Sec. 600.1000 of subpart L and Sec. 600.1105 of subpart M 
of this part expressly apply to this section. The following terms have 
the following meanings for the purpose of this section:
    Reduction fishery means the Hook & Line, Catcher Processor (Longline 
Subsector); sometimes referred to as the ``H&LCP Subsector) portion of 
the BSAI Pacific cod ITAC (in metric tons) set by the North Pacific 
Fishery Management Council (NPFMC) in December of each year multiplied 
by 2,205 (i.e., the rounded number of pounds in a metric ton)or the 
Longline Subsector of the BSAI non-pollock groundfish fishery that Sec. 
679.2 of this chapter defined as groundfish area/species endorsement.
    (c) Capacity Reduction Program. As a result of the completion of the 
Selection Process, written notification from the FLCC to NMFS 
identifying the selected offeror, and submission of the reduction plan, 
the capacity reduction program is implemented as follows:
    (1) Loan repayment--(i) Term. As authorized by section 219(B)(2) of 
the Appropriations Act, the capacity reduction loan (the Reduction Loan) 
shall be amortized over a thirty (30) year term. The Reduction Loan's 
original principal amount may not exceed the amount approved by the 
subsector. The subsector has currently approved a loan of two million 
seven hundred thousand dollars ($2,700,000). Subsector Members 
acknowledge that in the event payments made under the Reduction Plan are 
insufficient to repay the actual loan, the term of repayment shall be 
extended by NMFS until the loan is paid in full. Repayment calculations 
and records will be kept separately for each program.
    (ii) Interest. The Reduction Loan's interest rate will be the U.S. 
Treasury's cost of borrowing equivalent maturity funds plus 2 percent. 
NMFS will determine the Reduction Loan's initial interest rate when NMFS 
borrows from the U.S. Treasury the funds with which to disburse 
reduction payments. The initial interest rate will change to a final 
interest rate at the end of the Federal fiscal year in which NMFS 
borrows the funds from the U.S. Treasury. The final interest rate will 
be 2 percent plus a weighted average, throughout that fiscal year, of 
the U.S. Treasury's cost of borrowing equivalent maturity funds. The 
final interest rate will be fixed, and will not vary over the remainder 
of the reduction loan's 30-year term. The Reduction loan will be subject 
to a level debt amortization. There is no prepayment penalty.
    (iii) Fees. The Reduction Loan shall be repaid by fees collected 
from the

[[Page 200]]

Longline Subsector. The fee amount will be based upon: The principal and 
interest due over the next twelve months divided by the product of the 
Longline Subsector. In the event that the Longline Subsector portion for 
the ensuing year is not available, the Longline Subsector portion 
forecast from the preceding year will be used to calculate the fee.
    (A) The fee will be expressed in cents per pound rounded up to the 
next one-tenth of a cent. For example: If the principal and interest due 
equal $2,900,000 and the Longline Subsector portion equals 100,000 
metric tons, then the fee per round weight pound of Pacific cod will 
equal 1.4 cents per pound. [2,900,000/(100,000 x 2,205) = .01315]. The 
fee will be assessed and collected on Pacific cod to the extent possible 
and if not, will be assessed and collected as provided for in paragraph 
(c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section.
    (B) Fees must be assessed and collected on Pacific cod used for bait 
or discarded. Although the fee could be up to 5 percent of the ex-vessel 
production value of all post-reduction Longline Subsector landings, the 
fee will be less than 5 percent if NMFS projects that a lesser rate can 
amortize the fishery's reduction loan over the reduction loan's 30-year 
term. In the event that the total principal and interest due exceeds 5 
percent of the ex-vessel Pacific cod revenues, a standardized additional 
fee will be assessed. The additional fee shall be one cent per pound 
round weight, which is calculated based on the latest available revenue 
records and NMFS conversion factors for pollock, arrowtooth flounder, 
Greenland turbot, skate, yellowfin sole and rock sole.
    (C) To verify that the fees collected do not exceed 5 percent of the 
fishery revenues, the annual total of principal and interest due will be 
compared to the latest available annual Longline Subsector revenues. In 
the event that any of the components necessary to calculate the next 
year's fee are not available, or for any other reason NMFS believes the 
calculation must be postponed, the fee will remain at the previous 
year's amount until such a time that new calculations are made and 
communicated to the post-reduction fishery participants.
    (D) It is possible that the fishery may not open during some years 
and no Longline Subsector portion of the ITAC is granted. Consequently, 
the fishery will not produce fee revenue with which to service the 
reduction loan during those years. However, interest will continue to 
accrue on the principal balance. When this happens, if the fee rate is 
not already at the maximum 5 percent, NMFS will increase the fishery's 
fee rate to the maximum 5 percent of revenue for Pacific cod, apply all 
subsequent fee revenue first to the payment of accrued interest, and 
continue the maximum fee rates until all principal and interest payments 
become current. Once all principal and interest payments are current, 
NMFS will make a determination about adjusting the fee rate.
    (iv) Reduction loan. NMFS has promulgated framework regulations 
generally applicable to all fishing capacity reduction programs in 
subpart L of this part. The reduction loan shall be subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 600.1012, except that: the subsector members' 
obligation to repay the reduction loan shall be discharged by the owner 
of the Longline Subsector license regardless of which vessel catches 
fish under this license and regardless of who processes the fish in the 
reduction fishery in accordance with Sec. 600.1013. Longline Subsector 
license owners in the reduction fishery shall be obligated to collect 
the fee in accordance with Sec. 600.1013.
    (v) Collection. The LLP License holders of vessels harvesting in the 
post-capacity reduction plan Longline Subsector shall be responsible for 
self-collecting the repayment fees owed by the LLP License holder. Fees 
shall be submitted to NMFS monthly and shall be due no later than 
fifteen (15) calendar days following the end of each calendar month.
    (vi) Recordkeeping and reporting. The holder of the LLP Licenses on 
which vessels harvesting in the post-capacity reduction plan Longline 
Subsector is designated shall be responsible for compliance with the 
applicable recordkeeping and reporting requirements.

[[Page 201]]

    (2) Agreement with Secretary. The Selected Offeror shall complete 
and deliver to the FLCC for inclusion in the Reduction Plan submitted to 
NMFS, designee for the Secretary, a completed and fully executed 
Reduction Contract. The LLP License set forth on the Selected Offer 
shall be included as Reduction Fishing Interests in such Reduction 
Contract.
    (d) Decisions of the Auditor and the FLCC. Time was of the essence 
in developing and implementing a Reduction Plan and, accordingly, the 
Offeror is limited to, and bound by, the decisions of the Auditor and 
the FLCC.
    (1) The Auditor's examination of submitted applications, Offers, 
Prequalification Offers and Rankings was solely ministerial in nature. 
That is, the Auditor verified whether the documents submitted by 
Subsector Members were, on their face, consistent with each other and 
the Database, in compliance with the requirements set forth in the 
Reduction Agreement, and signed by an Authorized Party. The Auditor 
presumed the validity of all signatures on documents submitted. The 
Auditor made no substantive decisions as to compliance (e.g., whether an 
interim LLP License satisfies the requirements of the Act, or whether a 
discrepancy in the name appearing on LLP Licenses and other documents 
was material).
    (2) [Reserved]
    (e) Specific performance. The parties to the Reduction Agreement 
have agreed that the opportunity to develop and submit a capacity 
reduction program for the Longline Subsector under the terms of the 
Appropriations Act is both unique and finite and that failure of the 
Selected Offeror to perform the obligations provided by the Reduction 
Agreement will result in irreparable damage to the FLCC and the 
Subsector Members. Accordingly, the parties to the Reduction Agreement 
expressly acknowledge that money damages are an inadequate means of 
redress and agree that upon the failure of the Selected Offeror to 
fulfill their obligations under the Reduction Agreement that specific 
performance of those obligations may be obtained by suit in equity 
brought by the FLCC in any court of competent jurisdiction without 
obligation to arbitrate such action.
    (f) Miscellaneous-- (1) Termination. The Reduction Agreement may be 
terminated at any time prior to approval of the Reduction Plan by NMFS, 
on behalf of the Secretary, by written notice from 50 percent of 
Subsector Members.
    (2) Choice of law/venue. The Reduction Agreement shall be construed 
and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington 
without regard to its choice of law provisions. The parties submit to 
the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the United States District Court 
located in Seattle, Washington, with respect to any litigation arising 
out of or relating to the Reduction Agreement or out of the performance 
of services hereunder.
    (3) Incorporation. All executed counterparts of the Reduction 
Agreement, Application Forms and Offers constitute the agreement between 
the parties with respect to the subject matter of the Reduction 
Agreement and are incorporated into the Reduction Agreement as if fully 
written.
    (4) Counterparts. The Reduction Agreement may be executed in 
multiple counterparts and will be effective as to signatories on the 
Effective Date. The Reduction Agreement may be executed in duplicate 
originals, each of which shall be deemed to be an original instrument. 
All such counterparts and duplicate originals together shall constitute 
the same agreement, whether or not all parties execute each counterpart.
    (i) The facsimile signature of any party to the Reduction Agreement 
shall constitute the duly authorized, irrevocable execution and delivery 
of the Reduction Agreement as fully as if the Reduction Agreement 
contained the original ink signatures of the party or parties supplying 
a facsimile signature.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (g) Amendment. All Subsector Members acknowledge that the Reduction 
Agreement, the Reduction Contract, and the Reduction Plan may be subject 
to amendment to conform to the requirements for approval of the 
Reduction Plan by NMFS on behalf of the Secretary. The Auditor shall 
distribute

[[Page 202]]

to each Subsector Member in electronic format the amended form of the 
Reduction Agreement, the Reduction Contract, and the Reduction Plan, 
which amended documents in the form distributed by the Auditor and 
identified by the Auditor by date and version, the version of each such 
document then in effect at the time of any dispute arising or action 
taken shall be deemed binding upon the parties with respect to such 
dispute and/or action.
    (h) Warranties. The Offeror must expressly warrant and represent in

Sec. Sec. 600.1300-600.1309  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 600.1310  New England and Gulf of Mexico Individual Fishing Quota 
Referenda.

    (a) Purpose and scope. This section establishes procedures and 
guidelines for referenda to be conducted on Individual Fishing Quota 
(IFQ) program proposals developed by the New England Fishery Management 
Council (NEFMC) and the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council 
(GMFMC). These procedures and guidelines also apply to IFQ program 
proposals developed by NMFS for fisheries under the jurisdiction of the 
NEFMC or GMFMC, except for certain provisions that only apply to a 
fishery management council. This section provides guidance on developing 
voter eligibility and vote weighting, and establishes general procedures 
to ensure referenda are conducted in a fair and equitable manner.
    (b) Initiating IFQ referenda. (1) The NEFMC and the GMFMC shall not 
submit, and the Secretary shall not approve, an FMP or FMP amendment 
that would create an IFQ program until the IFQ program proposal, as 
ultimately developed, has been approved by a referendum of eligible 
voters. Paragraph (h) of this section provides criteria for determining 
the outcome of IFQ referenda.
    (2) To initiate a referendum on a proposed IFQ program:
    (i) The relevant Council must have held public hearings on the FMP 
or FMP amendment in which the IFQ program is proposed;
    (ii) The relevant Council must have considered public comments on 
the proposed IFQ program;
    (iii) The relevant Council must have selected preferred alternatives 
for the proposed IFQ program;
    (iv) The chair of the Council with jurisdiction over such proposed 
IFQ fishery must request a referendum on the proposed IFQ program in a 
letter to the

[[Page 206]]

appropriate NMFS Regional Administrator;
    (v) The letter requesting initiation of a referendum must recommend 
voter eligibility criteria that are consistent with the applicable 
requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section and may also include 
recommended criteria for vote weighting. The letter must provide the 
rationale supporting the Council's recommendation, as well as such 
additional information and analyses as needed, consistent with 
applicable law and provisions of this section. If a Council recommends 
vote weighting criteria, the letter should fully describe the rationale 
for and the expected effects of such weighting on the referendum;
    (vi) NEFMC referenda initiation letters must: recommend criteria 
that are consistent with paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section for NMFS 
to use in determining the eligibility of other fishery participants to 
vote in the referendum; include the minimum percentage of a crew 
member's total income that must have been earned during the eligibility 
periods in the proposed IFQ fishery as discussed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) 
of this section; and include criteria for ``referendum eligible 
vessels'' as described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (vii) GMFMC letters initiating referenda of multispecies permit 
holders in the Gulf of Mexico must include recommended criteria to be 
used in identifying those permit holders who have substantially fished 
the species to be included in the proposed IFQ program, along with 
alternatives to the recommendation, and supporting analyses. Guidelines 
for developing such recommendations are provided at paragraph (c)(3) of 
this section.
    (3) Following a referendum that has failed to approve the IFQ 
proposal, any request from a Council for a new referendum in the same 
fishery must include an explanation of the substantive changes to the 
proposed IFQ program or the changes of circumstances in the fishery that 
would warrant initiation of an additional referendum.
    (c) Referenda voter eligibility--(1) Permit holders and other 
fishery participants. (i) To be eligible to vote in IFQ referenda, 
permit holders and other fishery participants must meet voter 
eligibility criteria.
    (ii) Holders of multispecies permits in the Gulf of Mexico must have 
substantially fished the species proposed to be included in the IFQ 
program to be eligible to vote in a referendum on the proposed program.
    (iii) When developing eligibility criteria for permit holders in an 
IFQ program referendum, the relevant Council or Secretary must consider, 
but is not limited to considering:
    (A) The full range of entities likely to be eligible to receive 
initial quota allocation under the proposed IFQ program;
    (B) Current and historical harvest and participation in the fishery; 
and
    (C) Other factors as may be determined by the Council with 
jurisdiction over the fishery for which an IFQ program is proposed to be 
relevant to the fishery and to the proposed IFQ program.
    (2) Crew member eligibility in NEFMC IFQ referenda. (i) For the 
purposes of this section, ``referendum-eligible vessel'' means a vessel, 
the permit holder or owner of which has been determined to be eligible 
to vote in the referendum on the basis of such vessel's history or other 
characteristics.
    (ii) To be eligible to vote in an NEFMC IFQ referendum, crew members 
must meet the following requirements:
    (A) The crew member must have worked aboard a referendum-eligible 
vessel at sea, during the qualifying period(s), while the vessel was 
engaged in fishing;
    (B) If requested, the crew member must produce documentary proof of 
employment or service as a crew member and income during the qualifying 
periods. Documents that may be required include, but are not limited to, 
signed crew contracts, records of payment, settlement sheets, income tax 
records, a signed statement from the permit holder, and other 
documentary evidence of the period of employment and the vessel upon 
which the crew member worked;
    (C) During the qualifying period(s), the crew member must have 
derived a percentage of his/her total income from

[[Page 207]]

the fishery under the proposed IFQ program that is equal to or greater 
than the percentage determined to be significant relative to the 
economic value and employment practices of the fishery; and
    (D) Any additional eligibility criteria promulgated by the NMFS.
    (iii) When developing criteria for determining whether other fishery 
participants, including crew members, may participate in a NEFMC IFQ 
referendum, the Council or Secretary must consider, but is not limited 
to considering:
    (A) The full range of entities likely to be eligible to receive 
initial quota under the proposed IFQ program;
    (B) A crew member's current and historical participation in the 
fishery aboard a referendum-eligible vessel;
    (C) The economic value of the proposed IFQ fishery, employment 
practices in the proposed IFQ fishery, and other economic and social 
factors that would bear on a determination of what percentage of a crew 
member's total income from the fishery should be considered significant 
for the purposes of this section;
    (D) The availability of documentary proof of employment and income 
to validate eligibility; and
    (E) Any other factors as may be determined by the Council to be 
relevant to the fishery and the proposed IFQ program.
    (3) GMFMC's substantially fished criterion. When developing criteria 
for identifying those multispecies permit holders who have substantially 
fished the species to be included in the IFQ program proposal, the 
Council or Secretary must consider, but is not limited to considering:
    (i) Current and historical harvest and participation in the fishery;
    (ii) The economic value of and employment practices in the fishery; 
and
    (iii) Any other factors determined by the Council with jurisdiction 
over the fishery for which an IFQ program is proposed to be relevant to 
the fishery and the proposed IFQ program.
    (d) Council-recommended criteria under paragraph (c) of this section 
may include, but are not limited to, levels of participation or reliance 
on the fishery as represented by landings, sales, expenditures, or other 
considerations. A Council may also apply the same criteria for weighting 
eligible referendum votes.
    (e) Actions by NMFS: Review of Council referendum criteria and 
Secretarial IFQ plans. (1) NMFS shall determine whether Council 
recommended referendum criteria will provide for a fair and equitable 
referendum and will be consistent with national standards and other 
provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and other applicable legal 
standards. The Secretary's considerations shall include, but shall not 
be limited to:
    (i) Whether the criteria are rationally connected to or further the 
objectives of the proposed IFQ program;
    (ii) Whether the criteria are designed in such a way to prevent any 
person or single entity from obtaining an excessive share of voting 
privileges;
    (iii) Whether the criteria are reasonable relative to the 
availability of documentary evidence and the possibility of validating a 
participant's eligibility; and
    (iv) Whether the referendum can be administered and executed in a 
fair and equitable manner, in a reasonable time, and without subjecting 
industry members, the Council, or NMFS to administrative burdens, costs 
or other requirements that would be considered onerous.
    (2) If NMFS determines that referendum criteria would not provide 
for a fair and equitable referendum; would not be consistent with 
national standards and other provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and 
other applicable legal standards; or, in the case of a referendum 
request subsequent to a failed referendum in the same fishery, that the 
Council has not substantively amended the IFQ proposal or circumstances 
have not changed sufficiently to warrant initiation of a new referendum, 
NMFS shall inform the Council of the Agency's decision to deny the 
referendum request and of the reasons for the decision.
    (3) If NMFS determines that referendum criteria would provide for a 
fair and equitable referendum and would be consistent with national 
standards and other provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and other 
applicable legal standards; then NMFS

[[Page 208]]

shall conduct the referendum in accordance with procedures and 
guidelines provided in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (4) In accordance with paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section, 
NMFS may initiate a referendum and promulgate referendum criteria for 
any IFQ program proposal advanced through a Secretarial fishery 
management plan (FMP) or FMP amendment under the authority of section 
304(c) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act for a New England or Gulf of Mexico 
fishery. Such criteria must provide for a fair and equitable referendum 
and NMFS shall conduct the referendum in accordance with procedures and 
guidelines provided in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (f) Conducting IFQ referenda. (1) NMFS shall promulgate specific 
referenda procedural requirements, voter eligibility requirements, and 
any vote weighting criteria through appropriate rulemaking.
    (i) Proposed rule. A proposed rule shall seek public comment on the 
specific schedule, procedures, and other requirements for the referendum 
process.
    (A) For NEFMC IFQ program referenda, the proposed rule shall 
establish procedures for documenting or certifying that other fishery 
participants, including crew members, meet the proposed voter 
eligibility criteria.
    (B) For GMFMC IFQ program referenda for multispecies permit holders, 
the proposed rule shall include criteria to be used in identifying those 
permit holders who have substantially fished the species that are the 
subject of the proposed IFQ program.
    (ii) Final rule. (A) If NMFS decides to proceed with the referendum 
after reviewing public comments, NMFS shall publish implementing 
regulations through a final rule in the Federal Register as soon as 
practicable after the Council determines the IFQ program proposal and 
supporting analyses are complete and ready for Secretarial review. 
Otherwise, NMFS shall publish a notice in the Federal Register to inform 
the Council and the public of its decision not to conduct the 
referendum, as proposed, including reasons for the Agency's decision.
    (B) Upon implementation of the referendum through a final rule, NMFS 
shall provide eligible voters referenda ballots and shall make available 
information about the schedule, procedures, and eligibility requirements 
for the referendum process and the proposed IFQ program.
    (2) NMFS shall notify the public in the region of the subject 
fishery of the referendum eligibility criteria.
    (3) Individuals who wish to vote as other fishery participants in a 
NEFMC IFQ referendum, based on criteria established by the NEFMC under 
(c)(2), must contact NMFS and produce all required documentation and 
certifications to receive a ballot. NMFS shall provide sufficient time 
in the referendum process to allow for crew members to request, receive, 
and submit referendum ballots.
    (g) Referenda ballots. (1) Ballots shall be composed such that 
voters will indicate approval or disapproval of the preferred IFQ 
program proposal.
    (2) NMFS may require voters to self-certify on referenda ballots 
that they meet voter eligibility criteria. To be considered valid, 
ballots must be signed by the eligible voter.
    (3) Referenda ballots shall be numbered serially or otherwise 
designed to guard against submission of duplicate ballots.
    (4) If votes are weighted, the value of weighted votes shall be 
indicated on the ballot. The weighted vote must be cast as a single 
unit. Its value may not be split. The full value must be applied to the 
selection made on the ballot.
    (5) NMFS shall allow at least 30 days for eligible voters to receive 
and return their ballots and shall specify a deadline by which ballots 
must be received. Ballots received after the deadline shall not be 
considered valid.
    (h) Determining the outcome of an IFQ referendum. (1) NMFS shall 
tally and announce the results of the referendum within 90 days of the 
deadline by which completed ballots must be received. NMFS may declare a 
referendum invalid if the Agency can demonstrate the referendum was not 
conducted in accordance with the procedures established in the final 
rule implementing the referendum.

[[Page 209]]

    (2) A NEFMC IFQ program referendum shall be considered approved only 
if more than \2/3\ of the votes submitted on valid ballots are in favor 
of the referendum question.
    (3) A GMFMC IFQ program referendum shall be considered approved only 
if a majority of the votes submitted on valid ballots are in favor of 
the referendum question.

<R05>
Sec. 600.1415  Procedures for designating exempted states-general 
provisions.

    (a) States with an exempted state designation must:
    (1) Submit state angler and for-hire vessel license holder data to 
NMFS for inclusion in a national or regional registry database; or
    (2) Participate in regional surveys of recreational catch and effort 
and make the data from those surveys available to NMFS.
    (b) Process for getting an exempted state designation:
    (1) To apply for exempted state designation, a state must submit:
    (i) A complete description of the data it intends to submit to NMFS;
    (ii) An assessment of how the data conforms to the requirements of 
Sec. Sec. 600.1416 or 600. 1417;
    (iii) A description of the database in which the data exists and 
will be transmitted; and
    (iv) The proposed process, schedule and frequency of submission of 
the data.
    (2) If NMFS determines the submitted material meets the requirements 
of Sec. Sec. 600.1416 or 600.1417, NMFS will initiate negotiations with 
the state on a Memorandum of Agreement. The Memorandum of Agreement must 
include the terms and conditions of the data-sharing program. The 
Memorandum of Agreement and state designation may be limited to data-
sharing related to only anglers or only for-hire fishing vessels.
    (3) Following execution of a Memorandum of Agreement, NMFS will 
publish a notice of the exempted state designation in the Federal 
Register.


<R05>
Sec. 600.1416  Requirements for exempted state designation based on 
submission of state license holder data.

    (a) A state must annually update and submit to NMFS, in a format 
consistent with NMFS guidelines, the name, address and, to the extent 
available in the state's database, telephone number and date of birth, 
of all persons and for-hire vessel operators, and the name and state 
registration number or U.S. Coast Guard documentation number of for-hire 
vessels that are licensed to fish, or are registered as fishing, in the 
EEZ, in the tidal waters of the state, or for anadromous species. The 
Memorandum of Agreement developed in accordance with Sec. 
600.1415(b)(2) will specify the timetable for a state to compile and 
submit complete information telephone numbers and dates of birth for its 
license holders/registrants. The waters of the state for which such 
license-holder data must be submitted will be specified in the 
Memorandum of Agreement.
    (b) A state is eligible to be designated as an exempted state even 
if its licensing program excludes anglers who are:
    (1) Under 17 years of age;
    (2) Over age 59 (see Sec. 600.1416(d)(1));
    (3) Customers on licensed for-hire vessels;
    (4) Customers on state-licensed fishing piers, provided that the 
pier license holder provides to the state complete angler contact 
information or angler effort information for users of the pier;
    (5) On active military duty while on furlough; or
    (6) Disabled or a disabled Veteran as defined by the state.
    (7) Fishing on days designated as ``free fishing days'' by states. 
``Free fishing days'' means fishing promotion programs by which states 
allow new anglers to fish for a specified day without a license or 
registration.

[[Page 212]]

    (c) Unless the state can demonstrate that a given category of 
anglers is so small it has no significant probability of biasing 
estimates of fishing effort if these anglers are not included in a 
representative sample, a state may not be designated as an exempted 
state if its licensing or registration program excludes anglers in any 
category other than those listed in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Required enhancements to exempted state license-holder data. An 
exempted state must submit the following angler identification data by 
Jan. 1, 2012, or within two years of the effective date of the 
Memorandum of Agreement, whichever is later, and thereafter in 
accordance with the Memorandum of Agreement. States that provide NMFS 
with notice that they are required to enact legislation or to enter into 
formal memoranda of agreement or contracts with other state agencies to 
comply with this requirement must submit the data within three years of 
the effective date of the Memorandum of Agreement:
    (1) Name, address and telephone number, updated annually, of 
excluded anglers over age 59, unless the state can demonstrate that the 
number of anglers excluded from the license or registration requirement 
based on having a date of birth before June 1, 1940 is so small it has 
no significant probability of biasing estimates of fishing effort if 
these anglers are not included in a representative sample;
    (2) Name, address and telephone number, updated annually, of holders 
of state lifetime and multi-year licenses;
    (3) Name, address and telephone number of state combination license 
holders who fished in tidal waters in the prior year, or who intend to 
fish in tidal waters. The Memorandum of Agreement will define the 
boundaries of the state's tidal waters for this purpose.

[73 FR 79717, Dec. 30, 2008, as amended at 77 FR 42191, July 18, 2012]


<R05>
Sec. 600.1417  Requirements for exempted state designation based on 
submission of recreational survey data.

    (a) To be designated as an exempted state based on the state's 
participation in a regional survey of marine and anadromous recreational 
fishing catch and effort, a state may submit to NMFS a proposal that 
fully describes the state's participation in a qualifying regional 
survey, and the survey's sample design, data collection and 
availability.
    (b) A qualifying regional survey must:
    (1) Include all of the states within each region as follows:
    (i) Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, 
New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North 
Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida (Atlantic coast);
    (ii) Florida (Gulf of Mexico coast), Alabama, Mississippi, 
Louisiana, and Texas;
    (iii) Puerto Rico;

    (v) California, Oregon and Washington;
    (vi) Alaska;
    (vii) Hawaii; or
    (viii) American Samoa, Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern 
Mariana Islands.
    (2) Utilize angler registry data, or direct field counts to obtain 
angler effort, or other appropriate statistical means to obtain fishing 
effort;
    (3) Utilize angler registry data to identify individuals to be 
surveyed by telephone, mail or Internet if such regional survey includes 
a telephone survey component; and
    (4) Meet NMFS survey design and data collection standards.

Sec. 622.2  Definitions and acronyms.

    In addition to the definitions in the Magnuson Act and in Sec. 
600.10 of this chapter, and the acronyms in Sec. 600.15 of this 
chapter, the terms and acronyms used in this part have the following 
meanings:
    Accountability measure means a management control implemented such 
that overfishing is prevented, where possible, and mitigated if it 
occurs.
    Actual ex-vessel price means the total monetary sale amount a 
fisherman receives per pound of fish for IFQ landings from a registered 
IFQ dealer before any deductions are made for transferred (leased) 
allocation and goods and services (e.g. bait, ice, fuel, repairs, 
machinery replacement, etc.).
    Allowable chemical means a substance, generally used to immobilize 
marine life so that it can be captured alive, that, when introduced into 
the water, does not take Gulf and South Atlantic prohibited coral and is 
allowed by Florida for the harvest of tropical fish (e.g., quinaldine, 
quinaldine compounds, or similar substances).
    Allowable octocoral means an erect, nonencrusting species of the 
subclass Octocorallia, except the seafans Gorgonia flabellum and G. 
ventalina, plus the attached substrate within 1 inch (2.54 cm) of an 
allowable octocoral.

    Note: An erect, nonencrusting species of the subclass Octocorallia, 
except the seafans Gorgonia flabellum and G. ventalina, with attached 
substrate exceeding 1 inch (2.54 cm) is considered to be live rock and 
not allowable octocoral.

    Annual catch limit (ACL) means the level of catch that serves as the 
basis for invoking accountability measures.
    Annual catch target (ACT) means an amount of annual catch of a stock 
or stock complex that is the management target of the fishery, and 
accounts for management uncertainty in controlling the actual catch at 
or below the ACL.
    Aquacultured live rock means live rock that is harvested under a 
Federal aquacultured live rock permit, as required under Sec. 
622.4(a)(3)(iii).
    Atlantic means the North Atlantic, Mid-Atlantic, and South Atlantic.
    Authorized statistical reporting agent means:
    (1) Any person so designated by the SRD; or
    (2) Any person so designated by the head of any Federal or State 
agency that has entered into an agreement with the Assistant 
Administrator to collect fishery data.
    Automatic reel means a reel that remains attached to a vessel when 
in use from which a line and attached hook(s) are deployed. The line is 
payed out

[[Page 215]]

from and retrieved on the reel electrically or hydraulically.

fishing (i.e., harvest and first sale of fish) or from charter fishing 
during one of the three calendar years preceding the application. See 
paragraph (q) of this section regarding a limited access system 
applicable to commercial vessel permits for king mackerel, transfers of 
permits under the limited access system, and limited exceptions to the 
earned income or gross sales requirement for a permit.
    (iv) Spanish mackerel. For a person aboard a vessel to be eligible 
for exemption from the bag limits, a commercial vessel permit for 
Spanish mackerel must have been issued to the vessel and must be on 
board. To obtain or renew a commercial vessel permit for Spanish 
mackerel, at least 25 percent of the applicant's earned income, or at 
least $10,000, must have been derived from commercial fishing (i.e., 
harvest and first sale of fish) or from charter fishing during one of 
the 3 calendar years preceding the application.
    (v) Gulf reef fish. For a person aboard a vessel to be eligible for 
exemption from the bag limits, to fish under a quota, as specified in 
Sec. 622.42(a)(1), or to sell Gulf reef fish in or from the Gulf EEZ, a 
commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish must have been issued to the 
vessel and must be on board. If Federal regulations for Gulf reef fish 
in subparts A, B, or C of this part are more restrictive than state 
regulations, a person aboard a vessel for which a commercial vessel 
permit for Gulf reef fish has been issued must comply with such Federal 
regulations regardless of where the fish are harvested. See paragraph 
(a)(2)(ix) of this section regarding an IFQ vessel account required to 
fish for, possess, or land Gulf red snapper or Gulf groupers and 
tilefishes and paragraph (a)(2)(xiv) of this section regarding an 
additional bottom longline endorsement required to fish for Gulf reef 
fish with bottom longline gear in a portion of the eastern Gulf. To 
obtain or renew a commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish, more than 
50 percent of the applicant's earned income must have been derived from 
commercial fishing (i.e., harvest and first sale of fish) or from 
charter fishing during either of the 2 calendar years preceding the 
application. See paragraph (m) of this section regarding a limited 
access system for commercial vessel permits for Gulf reef fish and

[[Page 222]]

limited exceptions to the earned income requirement for a permit.
    (A) Option to consolidate commercial vessel permits for Gulf reef 
fish. A person who has been issued multiple commercial vessel permits 
for Gulf reef fish and wants to consolidate some or all of those 
permits, and the landings histories associated with those permits, into 
one permit must submit a completed permit consolidation application to 
the RA. The permits consolidated must be valid, non-expired permits and 
must be issued to the same entity. The application form and instructions 
are available online at sero.nmfs.noaa.gov. After consolidation, such a 
person would have a single permit, and the permits that were 
consolidated into that permit will be permanently terminated.
    (B) [Reserved]
    (vi) South Atlantic snapper-grouper. For a person aboard a vessel to 
be eligible for exemption from the bag limits for South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper in or from the South Atlantic EEZ, to sell South 
Atlantic snapper-grouper in or from the South Atlantic EEZ, to engage in 
the directed fishery for tilefish in the South Atlantic EEZ, to use a 
longline to fish for South Atlantic snapper-grouper in the South 
Atlantic EEZ, or to use a sea bass pot in the South Atlantic EEZ between 
35[deg]15.19[min] N. lat. (due east of Cape Hatteras Light, NC) and 
28[deg]35.1[min] N. lat. (due east of the NASA Vehicle Assembly 
Building, Cape Canaveral, FL), a commercial vessel permit for South 
Atlantic snapper-grouper must have been issued to the vessel and must be 
on board. A vessel with longline gear and more than 200 lb (90.7 kg) of 
tilefish on board is considered to be in the directed fishery for 
tilefish. It is a rebuttable presumption that a fishing vessel with more 
than 200 lb (90.7 kg) of tilefish on board harvested such tilefish in 
the EEZ. See Sec. 622.18 for limitations on the use, transfer, and 
renewal of a commercial vessel permit for South Atlantic snapper-
grouper.
    (vii) Wreckfish. For a person aboard a vessel to be eligible for 
exemption from the bag limit for wreckfish in or from the South Atlantic 
EEZ, to fish under a quota for wreckfish in or from the South Atlantic 
EEZ, or to sell wreckfish in or from the South Atlantic EEZ, a 
commercial vessel permit for wreckfish and a commercial permit for South 
Atlantic snapper-grouper must have been issued to the vessel and must be 
on board. To obtain a commercial vessel permit for wreckfish, the 
applicant must be a wreckfish shareholder; and either the shareholder 
must be the vessel owner or the owner or operator must be an employee, 
contractor, or agent of the shareholder. (See Sec. 622.15 for 
information on wreckfish shareholders.)
    (viii) South Atlantic rock shrimp. (A) Until January 27, 2010, the 
permit requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(viii)(A)(1) and (2) 
of this section apply.
    (1) For a person aboard a vessel to fish for rock shrimp in the 
South Atlantic EEZ or possess rock shrimp in or from the South Atlantic 
EEZ, a commercial vessel permit for rock shrimp must be issued to the 
vessel and must be on board. (See paragraph (a)(5) of this section for 
the requirements for operator permits for the South Atlantic rock shrimp 
fishery.)
    (2) In addition, for a person aboard a vessel to fish for rock 
shrimp in the South Atlantic EEZ off Georgia or off Florida or possess 
rock shrimp in or from the South Atlantic EEZ off Georgia or off 
Florida, a limited access endorsement for South Atlantic rock shrimp 
must be issued to the vessel and must be on board. See Sec. 622.19 for 
limitations on the issuance, transfer, renewal, and reissuance of a 
limited access endorsement for South Atlantic rock shrimp.
    (B) During January 2010, and prior to January 26, 2010, a currently 
valid (not expired) commercial vessel permit for rock shrimp with an 
expiration date after January 27, 2010, that does not have a limited 
access endorsement for South Atlantic rock shrimp will be replaced by 
the RA with a Commercial Vessel Permit for Rock Shrimp (Carolinas Zone), 
and a currently valid (not expired) commercial vessel permit for rock 
shrimp with an expiration date after January 27, 2010, that has a 
limited access endorsement for South Atlantic rock shrimp will be 
replaced by the RA with a Commercial Vessel Permit for Rock Shrimp 
(South Atlantic

[[Page 223]]

EEZ). However, a person with an expired limited access endorsement for 
South Atlantic rock shrimp who desires a Commercial Vessel Permit for 
Rock Shrimp (South Atlantic EEZ) must apply for such a permit before the 
date 1 year after the expiration date of the expired limited access 
endorsement for South Atlantic rock shrimp.
    (C) On and after January 27, 2010, the permit requirements specified 
in paragraphs (a)(2)(viii)(C)(1) and (2) of this section apply.
    (1) For a person aboard a vessel to fish for rock shrimp in the 
South Atlantic EEZ off North Carolina or off South Carolina or possess 
rock shrimp in or from the South Atlantic EEZ off those states, a 
Commercial Vessel Permit for Rock Shrimp (Carolinas Zone) or a 
Commercial Vessel Permit for Rock Shrimp (South Atlantic EEZ) must be 
issued to the vessel and must be on board.
    (2) For a person aboard a vessel to fish for rock shrimp in the 
South Atlantic EEZ off Georgia or off Florida or possess rock shrimp in 
or from the South Atlantic EEZ off those states, a Commercial Vessel 
Permit for Rock Shrimp (South Atlantic EEZ) must be issued to the vessel 
and must be on board. A Commercial Vessel Permit for Rock Shrimp (South 
Atlantic EEZ) is a limited access permit. See Sec. 622.19(b) for 
limitations on the issuance, transfer or renewal of a Commercial Vessel 
Permit for Rock Shrimp (South Atlantic EEZ).
    (D) The provisions of paragraph (f) of this section notwithstanding, 
neither a commercial vessel permit for rock shrimp nor a limited access 
endorsement for South Atlantic rock shrimp remains valid on or after 
January 27, 2010.
    (ix) Gulf IFQ vessel accounts. For a person aboard a vessel, for 
which a commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish has been issued, to 
fish for, possess, or land Gulf red snapper or Gulf groupers (including 
DWG and SWG, as specified in Sec. 622.20(a)) or tilefishes (including 
goldface tilefish, blueline tilefish, and tilefish), regardless of where 
harvested or possessed, a Gulf IFQ vessel account for the applicable 
species or species groups must have been established. As a condition of 
the IFQ vessel account, a person aboard such vessel must comply with the 
requirements of Sec. 622.16 when fishing for red snapper or Sec. 
622.20 when fishing for groupers or tilefishes regardless of where the 
fish are harvested or possessed. An owner of a vessel with a commercial 
vessel permit for Gulf reef fish, who has established an IFQ account for 
the applicable species, as specified in Sec. 622.16(a)(3)(i) or Sec. 
622.20(a)(3)(i), online via the NMFS IFQ website ifq.sero.nmfs.noaa.gov, 
may establish a vessel account through that IFQ account for that 
permitted vessel. If such owner does not have an online IFQ account, the 
owner must first contact IFQ Customer Service at 1-866-425-7627 to 
obtain information necessary to access the IFQ website and establish an 
online IFQ account. There is no fee to set-up an IFQ account or a vessel 
account. Only one vessel account may be established per vessel under 
each IFQ program. An owner with multiple vessels may establish multiple 
vessel accounts under each IFQ account. The purpose of the vessel 
account is to hold IFQ allocation that is required to land the 
applicable IFQ species. A vessel account must hold sufficient IFQ 
allocation in the appropriate share category, at least equal to the 
pounds in gutted weight of the red snapper or groupers and tilefishes on 
board, from the time of advance notice of landing through landing 
(except for any overage allowed as specified in Sec. 622.16(c)(1)(ii) 
for red snapper and Sec. 622.20(c)(1)(ii) for groupers and tilefishes). 
The vessel account remains valid as long as the vessel permit remains 
valid; the vessel has not been sold or transferred; and the vessel owner 
is in compliance with all Gulf reef fish and IFQ reporting requirements, 
has paid all applicable IFQ fees, and is not subject to sanctions under 
15 CFR part 904. The vessel account is not transferable to another 
vessel. The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to fishing for or 
possession of Gulf groupers and tilefishes under the bag limit specified 
in Sec. 622.39 (b)(1)(ii) or Gulf red snapper under the bag limit 
specified in Sec. 622.39 (b)(1)(iii). See Sec. 622.16 regarding other 
provisions pertinent to the Gulf red snapper IFQ system and Sec. 622.20 
regarding other provisions pertinent to the IFQ system for Gulf groupers 
and tilefishes.

[[Page 224]]

    (x) South Atlantic golden crab. For a person aboard a vessel to fish 
for golden crab in the South Atlantic EEZ, possess golden crab in or 
from the South Atlantic EEZ, off-load golden crab from the South 
Atlantic EEZ, or sell golden crab in or from the South Atlantic EEZ, a 
commercial vessel permit for golden crab must be issued to the vessel 
and must be on board. It is a rebuttable presumption that a golden crab 
on board a vessel in the South Atlantic or off-loaded from a vessel in a 
port adjoining the South Atlantic was harvested from the South Atlantic 
EEZ. See Sec. 622.17 for limitations on the use, transfer, and renewal 
of a commercial vessel permit for golden crab.
    (xi) Gulf shrimp fisheries--(A) Gulf shrimp permit. For a person 
aboard a vessel to fish for shrimp in the Gulf EEZ or possess shrimp in 
or from the Gulf EEZ, a commercial vessel permit for Gulf shrimp must 
have been issued to the vessel and must be on board. See paragraph (s) 
of this section regarding a moratorium on commercial vessel permits for 
Gulf shrimp and the associated provisions. See the following paragraph, 
(a)(2)(xi)(B) of this section, regarding an additional endorsement 
requirement related to royal red shrimp.
    (B) Gulf royal red shrimp endorsement. Effective March 26, 2007, for 
a person aboard a vessel to fish for royal red shrimp in the Gulf EEZ or 
possess royal red shrimp in or from the Gulf EEZ, a commercial vessel 
permit for Gulf shrimp with a Gulf royal red shrimp endorsement must be 
issued to the vessel and must be on board.
    (xii) Atlantic dolphin and wahoo. (A) For a person aboard a vessel 
to be eligible for exemption from the bag and possession limits for 
dolphin or wahoo in or from the Atlantic EEZ or to sell such dolphin or 
wahoo, a commercial vessel permit for Atlantic dolphin and wahoo must be 
issued to the vessel and must be on board, except as provided in 
paragraph (a)(2)(xii)(B) of this section. (See paragraph (a)(5) of this 
section for the requirements for operator permits in the Atlantic 
dolphin and wahoo fishery).
    (B) The provisions of paragraph (a)(2)(xii)(A) of this section 
notwithstanding, a fishing vessel, except a vessel operating as a 
charter vessel or headboat, that does not have a commercial vessel 
permit for Atlantic dolphin and wahoo but has a Federal commercial 
vessel permit in any other fishery, is exempt from the bag and 
possession limits for dolphin and wahoo and may sell dolphin and wahoo, 
subject to the trip and geographical limits specified in Sec. 
622.44(f)(2). (A charter vessel/headboat permit is not a commercial 
vessel permit.)
    (xiii) South Atlantic penaeid shrimp. For a person aboard a trawler 
to fish for penaeid shrimp in the South Atlantic EEZ or possess penaeid 
shrimp in or from the South Atlantic EEZ, a valid commercial vessel 
permit for South Atlantic penaeid shrimp must have been issued to the 
vessel and must be on board.
    (xiv) Eastern Gulf reef fish bottom longline endorsement. For a 
person aboard a vessel, for which a valid commercial vessel permit for 
Gulf reef fish has been issued, to use a bottom longline for Gulf reef 
fish in the Gulf EEZ east of 85[deg]30[min] W. long., a valid eastern 
Gulf reef fish bottom longline endorsement must have been issued to the 
vessel and must be on board. A permit or endorsement that has expired is 
not valid. This endorsement must be renewed annually and may only be 
renewed if the associated vessel has a valid commercial vessel permit 
for Gulf reef fish or if the endorsement and associated permit are being 
concurrently renewed. The RA will not reissue this endorsement if the 
endorsement is revoked or if the RA does not receive a complete 
application for renewal of the endorsement within 1 year after the 
endorsement's expiration date.
    (A) Initial eligibility. To be eligible for an initial eastern Gulf 
reef fish bottom longline endorsement a person must have been issued and 
must possess a valid or renewable commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef 
fish that has bottom longline landings of Gulf reef fish averaging at 
least 40,000 lb (18,144 kg), gutted weight, annually during the period 
1999 through 2007. In addition, for a commercial reef fish permit with 
reef fish longline landings after February 7, 2007, and with reef fish 
trap or longline landings during 1999 through February 7, 2007, such 
reef fish trap landings may

[[Page 225]]

be applied toward satisfaction of the eligibility requirement for an 
initial eastern Gulf reef fish bottom longline endorsement. All 
applicable reef fish landings associated with a current reef fish permit 
for the applicable landings history, including those reported by a 
person(s) who held the license prior to the current license owner, will 
be attributed to the current license owner. However, landings 
accumulated via permit stacking are not creditable for the purpose of 
determining eligibility for an initial eastern Gulf reef fish bottom 
longline endorsement. Only legal landings reported in compliance with 
applicable state and Federal regulations will be accepted.
    (B) Initial issuance. On or about May 26, 2010 the RA will mail each 
eligible permittee an eastern Gulf reef fish bottom longline endorsement 
via certified mail, return receipt requested, to the permittee's address 
of record as listed in NMFS' permit files. An eligible permittee who 
does not receive an endorsement from the RA, must contact the RA no 
later than June 25, 2010 to clarify his/her endorsement status. A 
permittee who is denied an endorsement based on the RA's initial 
determination of eligibility and who disagrees with that determination 
may appeal to the RA.
    (C) Procedure for appealing longline endorsement eligibility and/or 
landings information. The only items subject to appeal are initial 
eligibility for an eastern Gulf reef fish bottom longline endorsement 
based on ownership of a qualifying reef fish permit, the accuracy of the 
amount of landings, and correct assignment of landings to the permittee. 
Appeals based on hardship factors will not be considered. Appeals must 
be submitted to the RA postmarked no later than August 24, 2010, and 
must contain documentation supporting the basis for the appeal. The RA 
will review all appeals, render final decisions on the appeals, and 
advise the appellant of the final decision.
    (1) Eligibility appeals. NMFS' records of reef fish permits are the 
sole basis for determining ownership of such permits. A person who 
believes he/she meets the permit eligibility criteria based on ownership 
of a vessel under a different name, as may have occurred when ownership 
has changed from individual to corporate or vice versa, must document 
his/her continuity of ownership.
    (2) Landings appeals. Appeals regarding landings data for 1999 
through 2007 will be based on NMFS' logbook records. If NMFS' logbooks 
are not available, the RA may use state landings records or data for the 
period 1999 through 2007 that were submitted in compliance with 
applicable Federal and state regulations on or before December 31, 2008.
    (D) Transferability. An owner of a vessel with a valid eastern Gulf 
reef fish bottom longline endorsement may transfer that endorsement to 
an owner of a vessel that has a valid commercial vessel permit for Gulf 
reef fish.
    (E) Fees. There is no fee for initial issuance of an eastern Gulf 
reef fish bottom longline endorsement. A fee is charged for each 
renewal, transfer, or replacement of such endorsement. The amount of 
each fee is calculated in accordance with the procedures of the NOAA 
Finance Handbook, available from the RA, for determining the 
administrative costs of each special product or service. The fee may not 
exceed such costs and is specified with each application form. The 
appropriate fee must accompany each application for renewal, transfer, 
or replacement.
    (xv) South Atlantic black sea bass pot endorsement. For a person 
aboard a vessel, for which a valid commercial vessel permit for South 
Atlantic snapper-grouper unlimited has been issued, to use a black sea 
bass pot in the South Atlantic EEZ, a valid South Atlantic black sea 
bass pot endorsement must have been issued to the vessel and must be on 
board. A permit or endorsement that has expired is not valid. NMFS will 
renew this endorsement automatically when renewing the commercial vessel 
permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper unlimited associated with the 
vessel. The RA will not reissue this endorsement if the endorsement or 
the commercial vessel permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper 
unlimited is revoked or if the RA does not receive a complete 
application for renewal of the commercial vessel permit for South 
Atlantic snapper-grouper unlimited

[[Page 226]]

within 1 year after the permit's expiration date.
    (A) Initial eligibility. To be eligible for an initial South 
Atlantic black sea bass pot endorsement, a person must have been issued 
and must possess a valid or renewable commercial vessel permit for South 
Atlantic snapper-grouper that has black sea bass landings using black 
sea bass pot gear averaging at least 2,500 lb (1,134 kg), round weight, 
annually during the period January 1, 1999 through December 31, 2010. 
Excluded from this eligibility, are trip-limited permits (South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper permits that have a 225-lb (102.1-kg) limit of snapper-
grouper) and valid or renewable commercial vessel permits for South 
Atlantic snapper-grouper unlimited that have no reported landings of 
black sea bass using black sea bass pots from January 1, 2008, through 
December 31, 2010. NMFS will attribute all applicable black sea bass 
landings associated with a current snapper-grouper permit for the 
applicable landings history, including those reported by a person(s) who 
held the permit prior to the current permit owner, to the current permit 
owner. Only legal landings reported in compliance with applicable state 
and Federal regulations are acceptable.
    (B) Initial issuance. On or about June 1, 2012, the RA will mail 
each eligible permittee a black sea bass pot endorsement via certified 
mail, return receipt requested, to the permittee's address of record as 
listed in NMFS' permit files. An eligible permittee who does not receive 
an endorsement from the RA, must contact the RA no later than July 1, 
2012, to clarify his/her endorsement status. A permittee denied an 
endorsement based on the RA's initial determination of eligibility and 
who disagrees with that determination may appeal to the RA.
    (C) Procedure for appealing black sea bass pot endorsement 
eligibility and/or landings information. The only items subject to 
appeal are initial eligibility for a black sea bass pot endorsement 
based on ownership of a qualifying snapper-grouper permit, the accuracy 
of the amount of landings, and correct assignment of landings to the 
permittee. Appeals based on hardship factors will not be considered. 
Appeals must be submitted to the RA postmarked no later than October 1, 
2012, and must contain documentation supporting the basis for the 
appeal. The RA will review all appeals, render final decisions on the 
appeals, and advise the appellant of the final NMFS decision.
    (1) Eligibility appeals. NMFS' records of snapper-grouper permits 
are the sole basis for determining ownership of such permits. A person 
who believes he/she meets the permit eligibility criteria based on 
ownership of a vessel under a different name, for example, as a result 
of ownership changes from individual to corporate or vice versa, must 
document his/her continuity of ownership.
    (2) Landings appeals. Determinations of appeals regarding landings 
data for 1999 through 2010 will be based on NMFS' logbook records. If 
NMFS' logbooks are not available, the RA may use state landings records 
or data for the period 1999 through 2010 that were submitted in 
compliance with applicable Federal and state regulations on or before 
December 31, 2011.
    (D) [Reserved]
    (E) Fees. No fee applies to initial issuance of a black sea bass pot 
endorsement. NMFS charges a fee for each renewal or replacement of such 
endorsement and calculates the amount of each fee in accordance with the 
procedures of the NOAA Finance Handbook for determining the 
administrative costs of each special product or service. The fee may not 
exceed such costs and is specified with each application form. The 
handbook is available from the RA. The appropriate fee must accompany 
each application for renewal or replacement.
    (3) Coral permits--(i) Allowable chemical. For an individual to take 
or possess fish or other marine organisms with an allowable chemical in 
a coral area, other than fish or other marine organisms that are landed 
in Florida, a Federal allowable chemical permit must have been issued to 
the individual. Such permit must be available when the permitted 
activity is being conducted and when such fish or other marine organisms 
are possessed, through landing ashore.
    (ii) Allowable octocoral. For an individual to take or possess 
allowable

[[Page 227]]

octocoral in the South Atlantic EEZ, other than allowable octocoral that 
is landed in Florida, a Federal allowable octocoral permit must have 
been issued to the individual. Such permit must be available for 
inspection when the permitted activity is being conducted and when 
allowable octocoral is possessed, through landing ashore.
    (iii) Aquacultured live rock. For a person to take or possess 
aquacultured live rock in the Gulf or South Atlantic EEZ, a Federal 
aquacultured live rock permit must have been issued for the specific 
harvest site. Such permit, or a copy, must be on board a vessel 
depositing or possessing material on an aquacultured live rock site or 
harvesting or possessing live rock from an aquacultured live rock site.
    (iv) Prohibited coral. A Federal permit may be issued to take or 
possess Gulf and South Atlantic prohibited coral or Caribbean prohibited 
coral only as scientific research activity, exempted fishing, or 
exempted educational activity. See Sec. 600.745 of this chapter for the 
procedures and limitations for such activities and fishing.
    (v) Florida permits. Appropriate Florida permits and endorsements 
are required for the following activities, without regard to whether 
they involve activities in the EEZ or Florida's waters:
    (A) Landing in Florida fish or other marine organisms taken with an 
allowable chemical in a coral area.
    (B) Landing allowable octocoral in Florida.
    (C) Landing live rock in Florida.
    (4) Dealer permits, endorsements, and conditions --(i) Permits. For 
a dealer to receive Gulf reef fish harvested from the Gulf EEZ; golden 
crab, South Atlantic snapper-grouper, rock shrimp, or wreckfish 
harvested from the South Atlantic EEZ; or dolphin or wahoo harvested 
from the Atlantic EEZ; a dealer permit for Gulf reef fish, golden crab, 
South Atlantic snapper-grouper, rock shrimp, wreckfish, or Atlantic 
dolphin and wahoo, respectively, must be issued to the dealer.
    (ii) Gulf IFQ dealer endorsements. In addition to the requirement 
for a dealer permit for Gulf reef fish as specified in paragraph 
(a)(4)(i) of this section, for a dealer to receive red snapper subject 
to the Gulf red snapper IFQ program, as specified in Sec. 622.16(a)(1), 
or groupers and tilefishes subject to the IFQ program for Gulf groupers 
and tilefishes, as specified in Sec. 622.20(a)(1), or for a person 
aboard a vessel with a Gulf IFQ vessel account to sell such red snapper 
or groupers and tilefishes directly to an entity other than a dealer, 
such persons must also have a Gulf IFQ dealer endorsement. A dealer with 
a Gulf reef fish permit can download a Gulf IFQ dealer endorsement from 
the NMFS IFQ website at ifq.sero.nmfs.noaa.gov. If such persons do not 
have an IFQ online account, they must first contact IFQ Customer Service 
at 1-866-425-7627 to obtain information necessary to access the IFQ 
website and establish an IFQ online account. There is no fee for 
obtaining this endorsement. The endorsement remains valid as long as the 
Gulf reef fish dealer permit remains valid and the dealer is in 
compliance with all Gulf reef fish and IFQ reporting requirements, has 
paid all IFQ fees required under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and 
is not subject to any sanctions under 15 CFR part 904. The endorsement 
is not transferable. See Sec. 622.16 regarding other provisions 
pertinent to the Gulf red snapper IFQ system and Sec. 622.20 regarding 
other provisions pertinent to the IFQ system for Gulf groupers and 
tilefishes.
    (iii) State license and facility requirements. To obtain a dealer 
permit or endorsement, the applicant must have a valid state 
wholesaler's license in the state(s) where the dealer operates, if 
required by such state(s), and must have a physical facility at a fixed 
location in such state(s).
    (5) Operator permits. (i) The following persons are required to have 
operator permits:
    (A) An operator of a vessel that has or is required to have a 
Commercial Vessel Permit for Rock Shrimp (Carolinas Zone) or a

must accompany each application, request for transfer or replacement, or 
request for sea bass pot identification tags.
    (e) Initial issuance. (1) The RA will issue an initial permit at any 
time to an applicant if the application is complete and the specific 
requirements for the requested permit have been met. An application is 
complete when all requested forms, information, and documentation have 
been received.
    (2) Upon receipt of an incomplete application, the RA will notify 
the applicant of the deficiency. If the applicant fails to correct the 
deficiency within 30 days of the date of the RA's letter of 
notification, the application will be considered abandoned.
    (f) Duration. A permit remains valid for the period specified on it

[[Page 230]]

of this section for a commercial vessel moratorium permit for Gulf 
shrimp, in Sec. 622.17(c) for a commercial vessel permit for golden 
crab, in Sec. 622.18(b) for a commercial vessel permit for South 
Atlantic snapper-grouper, in Sec. 622.19(b) for a commercial vessel 
permit for South Atlantic rock shrimp, or in Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(xiv)(D) 
for an eastern Gulf reef fish bottom longline endorsement. A person who 
acquires a vessel or dealership who desires to conduct activities for 
which a permit, license, or endorsement is required must apply for a 
permit, license, or endorsement in accordance with the provisions of 
this section and other applicable sections of this part. If the acquired 
vessel or dealership is currently permitted, the application must be 
accompanied by the original permit and a copy of a signed bill of sale 
or equivalent acquisition papers. In those cases where a permit, 
license, or endorsement is transferable, the seller must sign the back 
of the permit, license, or endorsement and have the signed transfer 
document notarized.
    (2) Operator permits. An operator permit is not transferable.
    (h) Renewal--(1) Vessel permits, licenses, and endorsements and 
dealer permits. Unless specified otherwise, a vessel owner or dealer who 
has been issued a permit, license, or endorsement under this section 
must renew such permit, license, or endorsement on an annual basis. The 
RA will mail a vessel owner or dealer whose permit, license, or 
endorsement is expiring an application for renewal approximately 2 
months prior to the expiration date. A vessel owner or dealer who does 
not receive a renewal application from the RA by 45 days prior to the 
expiration date of the permit, license, or endorsement must contact the 
RA and request a renewal application. The applicant must submit a 
completed renewal application form and all required supporting documents 
to the RA prior to the applicable deadline for renewal of the permit, 
license, or endorsement and at least 30 days prior to the date on which 
the applicant desires to have the permit made effective. If the RA 
receives an incomplete application, the RA will notify the applicant of 
the deficiency. If the applicant fails to correct the deficiency within 
30 days of the date of the RA's letter of notification, the application 
will be considered abandoned. A permit, license, or endorsement that is 
not renewed within the applicable deadline will not be reissued.
    (2) Operator permits. An operator permit required by this section is 
issued for a period not longer than 3 years. A permit not renewed 
immediately upon its expiration would expire at the end of the 
operator's birth month that is between 2 and 3 years after issuance. For 
renewal, a new application must be submitted in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (i) Display. A vessel permit, license, or endorsement issued under 
this section must be carried on board the vessel. A dealer permit issued 
under this section, or a copy thereof, must be available on the dealer's 
premises. In addition, a copy of the dealer's permit must accompany each 
vehicle that is used to pick up from a fishing vessel reef fish 
harvested from the Gulf EEZ. A Gulf IFQ dealer endorsement must 
accompany each vehicle that is used to pick up Gulf IFQ red snapper and/
or Gulf IFQ groupers and tilefishes. The operator of a vessel must 
present the vessel permit, license, or endorsement for inspection upon 
the request of an authorized officer. A dealer or a vehicle operator 
must present the permit or a copy for inspection upon the request of an 
authorized officer. An operator of a vessel in a fishery in which an 
operator permit is required must present his/her operator permit and one 
other form of personal identification that includes a picture (driver's 
license, passport, etc.) for inspection upon the request of an 
authorized officer.
    (j) Sanctions and denials. (1) A permit, license, or endorsement 
issued pursuant to this section may be revoked, suspended, or modified, 
and a permit, license, or endorsement application may be denied, in 
accordance with the procedures governing enforcement-related permit 
sanctions and denials found at subpart D of 15 CFR part 904.
    (2) A person whose operator permit is suspended, revoked, or 
modified may not be aboard any fishing vessel subject to Federal fishing 
regulations in any capacity, if so sanctioned by

[[Page 231]]

NOAA, while the vessel is at sea or offloading. The vessel's owner and 
operator are responsible for compliance with this measure. A list of 
operators whose permits are revoked or suspended may be obtained from 
the RA.
    (k) Alteration. A permit, license, or endorsement that is altered, 
erased, or mutilated is invalid.
    (l) Replacement. A replacement permit, license, or endorsement may 
be issued. An application for a replacement permit, license, or 
endorsement is not considered a new application. An application for a 
replacement operator permit must include two new photographs, as 
specified in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section.
    (m) Limited access system for commercial vessel permits for Gulf 
reef fish. (1) No applications for additional commercial vessel permits 
for Gulf reef fish will be accepted. Existing vessel permits may be 
renewed, are subject to the restrictions on transfer or change in 
paragraphs (m)(2) through (5) of this section, and are subject to the 
requirement for timely renewal in paragraph (m)(6) of this section. An 
application for renewal or transfer of a commercial vessel permit for 
Gulf reef fish will not be considered complete until proof of purchase, 
installation, activation, and operational status of an approved VMS for 
the vessel receiving the permit has been verified by NMFS VMS personnel.
    (2) An owner of a permitted vessel may transfer the commercial 
vessel permit for Gulf reef fish to another vessel owned by the same 
entity.
    (3) An owner whose earned income qualified for the commercial vessel 
permit for Gulf reef fish may transfer the permit to the owner of 
another vessel, or to the new owner when he or she transfers ownership 
of the permitted vessel. Such owner of another vessel, or new owner, may 
receive a commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish for his or her 
vessel, and renew it through April 15 following the first full calendar 
year after obtaining it, without meeting the earned income requirement 
of paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section. However, to further renew the 
commercial vessel permit, the owner of the other vessel, or new owner, 
must meet the earned income requirement not later than the first full 
calendar year after the permit transfer takes place.
    (4) An owner of a permitted vessel, the permit for which is based on 
an operator's earned income and, thus, is valid only when that person is 
the operator of the vessel, may transfer the permit to the income 
qualifying operator when such operator becomes an owner of a vessel.
    (5) An owner of a permitted vessel, the permit for which is based on 
an operator's earned income and, thus, is valid only when that person is 
the operator of the vessel, may have the operator qualification on the 
permit removed, and renew it without such qualification through April 15 
following the first full calendar year after removing it, without 
meeting the earned income requirement of paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this 
section. However, to further renew the commercial vessel permit, the 
owner must meet the earned income requirement not later than the first 
full calendar year after the operator qualification is removed. To have 
an operator qualification removed from a permit, the owner must return 
the original permit to the RA with an application for the changed 
permit.
    (6) A commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish that is not 
renewed or that is revoked will not be reissued. A permit is considered 
to be not renewed when an application for renewal is not received by the 
RA within 1 year of the expiration date of the permit.
    (n) [Reserved]
    (o) Limited access system for king mackerel gillnet permits 
applicable in the southern Florida west coast subzone. Except for 
applications for renewals of king mackerel gillnet permits, no 
applications for king mackerel gillnet permits will be accepted. 
Application forms for permit renewal are available from the RA.
    (1) An owner of a vessel with a king mackerel gillnet permit issued 
under this limited access system may transfer that permit upon a change 
of ownership of a permitted vessel with such permit from one to another 
of the following: Husband, wife, son, daughter, brother, sister, mother, 
or father. Such permit also may be transferred to another vessel owned 
by the same entity.

[[Page 232]]

    (2) A king mackerel gillnet permit that is not renewed or that is 
revoked will not be reissued. A permit is considered to be not renewed 
when an application for renewal is not received by the RA within one 
year after the expiration date of the permit.
    (1)-(6) [Reserved]
    (q) Limited access system for commercial vessel permits for king 
mackerel. (1) No applications for additional commercial vessel permits 
for king mackerel will be accepted. Existing vessel permits may be 
renewed, are subject to the restrictions on transfer or change in 
paragraphs (q)(2) through (q)(5) of this section, and are subject to the 
requirement for timely renewal in paragraph (q)(6) of this section.
    (2) An owner of a permitted vessel may transfer the commercial 
vessel permit for king mackerel issued under this limited access system 
to another vessel owned by the same entity.
    (3) An owner whose percentage of earned income or gross sales 
qualified him/her for the commercial vessel permit for king mackerel 
issued under this limited access system may request that NMFS transfer 
that permit to the owner of another vessel, or to the new owner when he 
or she transfers ownership of the permitted vessel. Such owner of 
another vessel, or new owner, may receive a commercial vessel permit for 
king mackerel for his or her vessel, and renew it through April 15 
following the first full calendar year after obtaining it, without 
meeting the percentage of earned income or gross sales requirement of 
paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section. However, to further renew the 
commercial vessel permit, the owner of the other vessel, or new owner, 
must meet the earned income or gross sales requirement not later than 
the first full calendar year after the permit transfer takes place.
    (4) An owner of a permitted vessel, the permit for which is based on 
an operator's earned income and, thus, is valid only when that person is 
the operator of the vessel, may request that NMFS transfer the permit to 
the income-qualifying operator when such operator becomes an owner of a 
vessel.
    (5) An owner of a permitted vessel, the permit for which is based on 
an operator's earned income and, thus, is valid only when that person is 
the operator of the vessel, may have the operator qualification on the 
permit removed, and renew it without such qualification through April 15 
following the first full calendar year after removing it, without 
meeting the earned income or gross sales requirement of paragraph 
(a)(2)(iii) of this section. However, to further renew the commercial 
vessel permit, the owner must meet the earned income or gross sales 
requirement not later than the first full calendar year after the 
operator qualification is removed. To have an operator qualification 
removed from a permit, the owner must return the original permit to the 
RA with an application for the changed permit.
    (6) NMFS will not reissue a commercial vessel permit for king 
mackerel if the permit is revoked or if the RA does not receive an 
application for renewal within one year of the permit's expiration date.
    (r) Limited access system for charter vessel/headboat permits for 
Gulf coastal migratory pelagic fish and Gulf reef fish. No applications 
for additional charter vessel/headboat permits for Gulf coastal 
migratory pelagic fish or Gulf reef fish will be accepted. Existing 
permits may be renewed, are subject to the restrictions on transfer in 
paragraph (r)(1) of this section, and are subject to the renewal 
requirements in paragraph (r)(2) of this section.
    (1) Transfer of permits--(i) Permits without a historical captain 
endorsement. A charter vessel/headboat permit for Gulf coastal migratory 
pelagic fish or Gulf reef fish that does not have a historical captain 
endorsement is fully transferable, with or without sale of the permitted 
vessel, except that no transfer is allowed to a vessel with a greater 
authorized passenger capacity than that of the vessel to which the 
moratorium permit was originally issued, as specified on the face of the 
permit being transferred. An application to transfer a permit to an 
inspected vessel must include a copy of that vessel's current USCG 
Certificate of Inspection (COI). A vessel without a valid COI will be 
considered an uninspected vessel with an authorized passenger capacity 
restricted to six or fewer passengers.

[[Page 233]]

    (ii) Permits with a historical captain endorsement. A charter 
vessel/headboat permit for Gulf coastal migratory pelagic fish or Gulf 
reef fish that has a historical captain endorsement may only be 
transferred to a vessel operated by the historical captain, cannot be 
transferred to a vessel with a greater authorized passenger capacity 
than that of the vessel to which the moratorium permit was originally 
issued, as specified on the face of the permit being transferred, and is 
not otherwise transferable.
    (iii) Procedure for permit transfer. To request that the RA transfer 
a charter vessel/headboat permit for Gulf coastal migratory pelagic fish 
or Gulf reef fish, the owner of the vessel who is transferring the 
permit and the owner of the vessel that is to receive the transferred 
permit must complete the transfer information on the reverse side of the 
permit and return the permit and a completed application for transfer to 
the RA. See paragraph (g)(1) of this section for additional transfer-
related requirements applicable to all permits issued under this 
section.
    (2) Renewal. (i) Renewal of a charter vessel/headboat permit for 
Gulf coastal migratory pelagic fish or Gulf reef fish is contingent upon 
the permitted vessel and/or captain, as appropriate, being included in 
an active survey frame for, and, if selected to report, providing the 
information required in one of the approved fishing data surveys. 
Surveys include, but are not limited to--
    (A) NMFS' Marine Recreational Fishing Vessel Directory Telephone 
Survey (conducted by the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission);
    (B) NMFS' Southeast Headboat Survey (as required by Sec. 
622.5(b)(1);
    (C) Texas Parks and Wildlife Marine Recreational Fishing Survey; or
    (D) A data collection system that replaces one or more of the 
surveys in paragraph (r)(2)(i)(A),(B), or (C) of this section.
    (ii) A charter vessel/headboat permit for Gulf coastal migratory 
pelagic fish or Gulf reef fish that is not renewed or that is revoked 
will not be reissued. A permit is considered to be not renewed when an 
application for renewal, as required, is not received by the RA within 1 
year of the expiration date of the permit.
    (3) Requirement to display a vessel decal. Upon renewal or transfer 
of a charter vessel/headboat permit for Gulf coastal migratory pelagic 
fish or Gulf reef fish, the RA will issue the owner of the permitted 
vessel a vessel decal for the applicable permitted fishery or fisheries. 
The vessel decal must be displayed on the port side of the deckhouse or 
hull and must be maintained so that it is clearly visible.
    (s) Moratorium on commercial vessel permits for Gulf shrimp. The 
provisions of this paragraph (s) are applicable through October 26, 
2016.
    (1) Date moratorium permits are required. Beginning March 26, 2007, 
the only valid commercial vessel permits for Gulf shrimp are those 
issued under the moratorium criteria in this paragraph (s).
    (2) Initial eligibility for a moratorium permit. Initial eligibility 
for a commercial vessel moratorium permit for Gulf shrimp is limited to 
a person who
    (i) Owns a vessel that was issued a Federal commercial vessel permit 
for Gulf shrimp on or before December 6, 2003; or
    (ii) On or before December 6, 2003, owned a vessel that was issued a 
Federal commercial vessel permit for Gulf shrimp and, prior to September 
26, 2006, owns a vessel with a Federal commercial permit for Gulf shrimp 
that is equipped for offshore shrimp fishing, is at least 5 net tons 
(4.54 metric tons), is documented by the Coast Guard, and is the vessel 
for which the commercial vessel moratorium permit is being applied.
    (3) Application deadline and procedures. An applicant who desires a 
commercial vessel moratorium permit for Gulf shrimp must submit an 
application to the RA postmarked or hand delivered not later than 
October 26, 2007. After that date, no applications for additional 
commercial vessel moratorium permits for Gulf shrimp will be accepted. 
Application forms are available from the RA. Failure to apply in a 
timely manner will preclude permit issuance even when the applicant 
otherwise meets the permit eligibility criteria.

[[Page 234]]

    (4) Determination of eligibility. NMFS' permit records are the sole 
basis for determining eligibility based on permit history. An applicant 
who believes he/she meets the permit eligibility criteria based on 
ownership of a vessel under a different name, as may have occurred when 
ownership has changed from individual to corporate or vice versa, must 
document his/her continuity of ownership.
    (5) Incomplete applications. If an application that is postmarked or 
hand-delivered in a timely manner is incomplete, the RA will notify the 
applicant of the deficiency. If the applicant fails to correct the 
deficiency within 30 days of the date of the RA's notification, the 
application will be considered abandoned.
    (6) Notification of ineligibility. If the applicant does not meet 
the applicable eligibility requirements of paragraph (s)(2) of this 
section, the RA will notify the applicant, in writing, of such 
determination and the reasons for it.
    (7) Permit transferability. Commercial vessel moratorium permits for 
Gulf shrimp are fully transferable, with or without the sale of the 
vessel. To request that the RA transfer a commercial vessel moratorium 
permit for Gulf shrimp, the owner of a vessel that is to receive the 
transferred permit must complete the transfer information on the reverse 
of the permit and return the permit and a completed application for 
transfer to the RA. Transfer documents must be notarized as specified in 
paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
    (8) Renewal. (i) Renewal of a commercial vessel moratorium permit 
for Gulf shrimp is contingent upon compliance with the recordkeeping and 
reporting requirements for Gulf shrimp specified in Sec. 
622.5(a)(1)(iii).
    (ii) A commercial vessel moratorium permit for Gulf shrimp that is 
not renewed will be terminated and will not be reissued during the 
moratorium. A permit is considered to be not renewed when an application 
for renewal, as required, is not received by the RA within 1 year of the 
expiration date of the permit.

Sec. 622.6  Vessel and gear identification.

    (a) Vessel identification--(1) Applicability--(i) Official number. A 
vessel for which a permit has been issued under Sec. 622.4, and a 
vessel that fishes for or possesses pelagic sargassum in the South 
Atlantic EEZ, must display its official number--
    (A) On the port and starboard sides of the deckhouse or hull and, 
for vessels over 25 ft (7.6 m) long, on an appropriate weather deck, so 
as to be clearly visible from an enforcement vessel or aircraft.
    (B) In block arabic numerals permanently affixed to or painted on 
the vessel in contrasting color to the background.
    (C) At least 18 inches (45.7 cm) in height for vessels over 65 ft 
(19.8 m) long; at least 10 inches (25.4 cm) in height for vessels over 
25 ft (7.6 m) long; and at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) in height for vessels 
25 ft (7.6 m) long or less.
    (ii) Official number and color code. The following vessels must 
display their official number as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of 
this section and, in addition, must display their assigned color code: A 
vessel for which a permit has been issued to fish with a sea bass pot, 
as required under Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(vi); a vessel in the commercial 
Caribbean reef fish fishery fishing with traps; and a vessel in the 
Caribbean spiny lobster fishery. Color codes required for the Caribbean 
reef fish fishery and Caribbean spiny lobster fishery are assigned by 
Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands, whichever is applicable; color 
codes required in all other fisheries are assigned by the RA. The color 
code must be displayed--
    (A) On the port and starboard sides of the deckhouse or hull and, 
for vessels over 25 ft (7.6 m) long, on an appropriate weather deck, so 
as to be clearly visible from an enforcement vessel or aircraft.
    (B) In the form of a circle permanently affixed to or painted on the 
vessel.
    (C) At least 18 inches (45.7 cm) in diameter for vessels over 65 ft 
(19.8 m) long; at least 10 inches (25.4 cm) in diameter for vessels over 
25 ft (7.6 m) long; and at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) in diameter for 
vessels 25 ft (7.6 m) long or less.
    (2) Duties of operator. The operator of a vessel specified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section must keep the official number and the 
color code, if applicable, clearly legible and in good repair and must 
ensure that no part of the fishing vessel, its rigging, fishing gear, or 
any other material on board obstructs the view of the official number or 
the color code, if applicable, from an enforcement vessel or aircraft.
    (b) Gear identification--(1) Traps/pots and associated buoys--(i) 
Traps or pots--(A) Caribbean EEZ. A fish trap or spiny lobster trap used 
or possessed in the

[[Page 240]]

Caribbean EEZ must display the official number specified for the vessel 
by Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands so as to be easily identified.
    (B) South Atlantic EEZ. A sea bass pot used or possessed in the 
South Atlantic EEZ between 35[deg]15.19[min] N. lat. (due east of Cape 
Hatteras Light, NC) and 28[deg]35.1[min] N. lat. (due east of the NASA 
Vehicle Assembly Building, Cape Canaveral, FL), or a sea bass pot on 
board a vessel with a commercial permit for South Atlantic snapper-
grouper, must have a valid identification tag issued by the RA attached. 
A golden crab trap used or possessed in the South Atlantic EEZ or on 
board a vessel with a commercial permit for golden crab must have the 
commercial vessel permit number permanently affixed so as to be easily 
distinguished, located, and identified; an identification tag issued by 
the RA may be used for this purpose but is not required.
    (ii) Associated buoys. A buoy that is attached to a trap or pot must 
display the official number and assigned color code so as to be easily 
distinguished, located, and identified as follows:
    (A) Caribbean EEZ. Traps or pots used in the Caribbean spiny lobster 
or Caribbean reef fish fisheries that are fished individually, rather 
than tied together in a trap line, must have at least one buoy attached 
that floats on the surface. Traps or pots used in the Caribbean spiny 
lobster or Caribbean reef fish fisheries that are tied together in a 
trap line must have at least one buoy that floats at the surface 
attached at each end of the trap line. Each buoy must display the 
official number and color code assigned to the vessel by Puerto Rico or 
the U.S. Virgin Islands, whichever is applicable.
    (B) South Atlantic EEZ. In the South Atlantic EEZ, buoys are not 
required to be used, but, if used, each buoy must display the official 
number and color code assigned by the RA. However, no color code is 
required on a buoy attached to a golden crab trap.
    (iii) Presumption of ownership. A Caribbean spiny lobster trap, a 
fish trap, a golden crab trap, or a sea bass pot in the EEZ will be 
presumed to be the property of the most recently documented owner. This 
presumption will not apply with respect to such traps and pots that are 
lost or sold if the owner reports the loss or sale within 15 days to the 
RA.
    (iv) Unmarked traps, pots, or buoys. An unmarked Caribbean spiny 
lobster trap, a fish trap, a golden crab trap, a sea bass pot, or a buoy 
deployed in the EEZ where such trap, pot, or buoy is required to be 
marked is illegal and may be disposed of in any appropriate manner by 
the Assistant Administrator or an authorized officer. In the EEZ off 
Florida, during times other than the authorized fishing season, a 
Caribbean spiny lobster trap, buoy, or any connecting lines will be 
considered derelict and may be disposed of in accordance with Florida 
Administrative Code Chapter 68B-55: Trap retrieval and trap debris 
removal, Rule 68B-55.002: Retrieval of Trap Debris and Chapter 68B-55: 
Trap retrieval and trap debris removal, Rule 68B-55.004: Retrieval of 
Derelict and Traps Located in Areas Permanently Closed to Trapping, both 
in effect as of October 15, 2007. This incorporation by reference was

Sec. 622.9  Vessel monitoring systems (VMSs).

    (a) Requirements for use of a VMS--(1) South Atlantic rock shrimp. 
An owner or operator of a vessel that has been issued a limited access 
endorsement for South Atlantic rock shrimp (until January 27, 2010) or a 
Commercial Vessel Permit for Rock Shrimp (South Atlantic EEZ) must 
ensure that such vessel has an operating VMS approved by NMFS for use in 
the South Atlantic rock shrimp fishery on board when on a trip in the 
South Atlantic. An operating VMS includes an operating mobile 
transmitting unit on the vessel and a functioning communication link 
between the unit and NMFS as provided by a NMFS-approved communication 
service provider.
    (2) Gulf reef fish. The VMS requirements of this paragraph (a)(2) 
apply throughout the Gulf of Mexico and adjacent states.
    (i) General VMS requirement. An owner or operator of a vessel that 
has been issued a commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish, including 
a charter vessel/headboat issued such a permit even when under charter, 
must ensure that such vessel has an operating VMS approved by NMFS for 
use in the Gulf reef fish fishery on board at all times whether or not 
the vessel is underway, unless exempted by NMFS under the power-down 
exemptions specified in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section and in the 
NOAA Enforcement Vessel Monitoring System Requirements for the Reef Fish 
Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico. This NOAA Enforcement Vessel Monitoring 
System Requirements document is available from NMFS, Office

[[Page 244]]

for Law Enforcement (OLE), Southeast Region, 263 13th Avenue South, St. 
Petersburg, FL 33701; phone: 800-758-4833. An operating VMS includes an 
operating mobile transmitting unit on the vessel and a functioning 
communication link between the unit and NMFS as provided by a NMFS-
approved communication service provider. NMFS OLE maintains a current 
list of approved VMS units and communication providers which is 
available from the VMS Support Center, NMFS OLE, 8484 Georgia Avenue, 
Suite 415, Silver Spring, MD 20910 or by calling toll free 888-219-9228. 
If a VMS unit approved for the Gulf reef fish fishery is removed from 
the approved list by NMFS OLE, a vessel owner who purchased and 
installed such a VMS unit prior to its removal from the approved list 
will be considered to be in compliance with the requirement to have an 
approved unit, unless otherwise notified by NMFS OLE. At the end of a 
VMS unit's service life, it must be replaced with a currently approved 
unit for the fishery.
    (ii) Hourly reporting requirement. An owner or operator of a vessel 
subject to the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section must 
ensure that the required VMS unit transmits a signal indicating the 
vessel's accurate position at least once an hour, 24 hours a day every 
day unless exempted under paragraphs (a)(2)(iii) or (iv) of this 
section.
    (iii) In-port exemption. While in port, an owner or operator of a 
vessel with a type-approved VMS unit configured with the 4-hour 
reporting feature may utilize the 4-hour reporting feature rather than 
comply with the hourly reporting requirement specified in paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii) of this section. Once the vessel is no longer in port, the 
hourly reporting requirement specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this 
section applies. For the purposes of this paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, ``in port'' means secured at a land-based facility, or moored 
or anchored after the return to a dock, berth, beach, seawall, or ramp.
    (iv) Power-down exemptions. An owner or operator of a vessel subject 
to the requirement to have a VMS operating at all times as specified in 
paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section can be exempted from that 
requirement and may power down the required VMS unit if--
    (A) The vessel will be continuously out of the water or in port, as 
defined in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, for more than 72 
consecutive hours;
    (B) The owner or operator of the vessel applies for and obtains a 
valid letter of exemption from NMFS OLE VMS personnel as specified in 
the NOAA Enforcement Vessel Monitoring System Requirements for the Reef 
Fish Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico. This is a one-time requirement. The 
letter of exemption must be maintained on board the vessel and remains 
valid for all subsequent power-down requests conducted consistent with 
the provisions of paragraphs (a)(2)(iv)(C) and (D) of this section.
    (C) Prior to each power-down, the owner or operator of the vessel 
files a report to NMFS OLE VMS program personnel, using the VMS unit's 
e-mail, that includes the name of the person filing the report, vessel 
name, vessel U.S. Coast Guard documentation number or state registration 
number, commercial vessel reef fish permit number, vessel port location 
during VMS power down, estimated duration of the power down exemption, 
and reason for power down; and
    (D) The owner or operator enters the power-down code through the use 
of the VMS Declaration form on the terminal and, prior to powering down 
the VMS, receives a confirmation, through the VMS terminal, that the 
form was successfully delivered.
    (v) Declaration of fishing trip and gear. Prior to departure for 
each trip, a vessel owner or operator must report to NMFS any fishery 
the vessel will participate in on that trip and the specific type(s) of 
fishing gear, using NMFS-defined gear codes, that will be on board the 
vessel.
    (b) Installation and activation of a VMS. Only a VMS that has been 
approved by NMFS for the applicable fishery may be used, and the VMS 
must be installed by a qualified marine electrician. When installing and 
activating the NMFS-approved VMS, or when reinstalling and reactivating 
such VMS, the vessel owner or operator must--

[[Page 245]]

    (1) Follow procedures indicated on a NMFS-approved installation and 
activation checklist for the applicable fishery, which is available from 
NMFS Office for Law Enforcement, Southeast Region, 263 13\th\ Avenue 
South, St. Petersburg, FL 33701; phone: 800-758-4833; and
    (2) Submit to NMFS Office for Law Enforcement, Southeast Region, 263 
13\th\ Avenue South, St. Petersburg, FL 33701, a statement certifying 
compliance with the checklist, as prescribed on the checklist.
    (3) Submit to NMFS Office for Law Enforcement, Southeast Region, 263 
13\th\ Avenue South, St. Petersburg, FL 33701, a vendor-completed 
installation certification checklist, which is available from NMFS 
Office for Law Enforcement, Southeast Region, 263 13\th\ Avenue South, 
St. Petersburg, FL 33701; phone: 800-758-4833.
    (c) Interference with the VMS. No person may interfere with, tamper 
with, alter, damage, disable, or impede the operation of the VMS, or 
attempt any of the same.
    (d) Interruption of operation of the VMS. When a vessel's VMS is not 
operating properly, the owner or operator must immediately contact NMFS 
Office for Law Enforcement, Southeast Region, 263 13\th\ Avenue South, 
St. Petersburg, FL 33701, phone: 800-758-4833, and follow instructions 
from that office. If notified by NMFS that a vessel's VMS is not 
operating properly, the owner and operator must follow instructions from 
that office. In either event, such instructions may include, but are not 
limited to, manually communicating to a location designated by NMFS the 
vessel's positions or returning to port until the VMS is operable.
    (e) Access to position data. As a condition of authorized fishing 
for or possession of fish in a fishery subject to VMS requirements in 
this section, a vessel owner or operator subject to the requirements for 
a VMS in this section must allow NMFS, the USCG, and their authorized 
officers and designees access to the vessel's position data obtained 
from the VMS.

<R05>
Sec. 622.15  Wreckfish individual transferable quota (ITQ) system.

    The provisions of this section apply to wreckfish in or from the 
South Atlantic EEZ.
    (a) Percentage shares. (1) In accordance with the procedure 
specified in the Fishery Management Plan for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery 
of the South Atlantic Region, percentage shares of the quota for 
wreckfish have been assigned. Each person has been notified by the RA of 
his or her percentage share and shareholder certificate number.
    (2) All or a portion of a person's percentage shares may be 
transferred to another person. Transfer of shares must be reported on a 
form available from the RA. The RA will confirm, in writing, each 
transfer of shares. The effective date of each transfer is the 
confirmation date provided by the RA. The confirmation date will 
normally be not later than 3 working days after receipt of a properly 
completed transfer form. A fee is charged for each transfer of shares. 
The amount of the fee is calculated in accordance with the procedures of 
the NOAA Finance Handbook, available from the RA, for determining the 
administrative costs of each special product or service provided by NOAA 
to non-Federal recipients. The fee may not exceed such costs and is 
specified with each transfer form. The appropriate fee must accompany 
each transfer form.
    (b) Lists of wreckfish shareholders and permitted vessels. Annually, 
on or about March 1, the RA will provide each wreckfish shareholder with 
a list of all wreckfish shareholders and their percentage shares, 
reflecting share transactions on forms received through February 15. 
Annually by April 15, the RA will provide each dealer who holds a dealer 
permit for wreckfish, as required under Sec. 622.4(a)(4), with a list 
of vessels for which wreckfish permits have been issued, as required 
under Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(vii). Annually, by April 15, the RA will provide 
each wreckfish shareholder with a list of dealers who have been issued 
dealer permits for wreckfish. From April 16 through January 14, updated 
lists will be provided when required. Updated lists may be obtained at 
other times or by a person who is not a wreckfish shareholder or 
wreckfish dealer permit holder by written request to the RA.
    (c) ITQs. (1) Annually, as soon after March 1 as the TAC for 
wreckfish for the fishing year that commences April 16 is known, the RA 
will calculate each wreckfish shareholder's ITQ. Each ITQ is the product 
of the wreckfish TAC, in round weight, for the ensuing fishing year, the 
factor for converting round weight to eviscerated weight, and each 
wreckfish shareholder's percentage share, reflecting share transactions 
reported on forms received by the RA through February 15. Thus, the ITQs 
will be in terms of eviscerated weight of wreckfish.
    (2) The RA will provide each wreckfish shareholder with ITQ coupons 
in various denominations, the total of which equals his or her ITQ, and 
a copy of the calculations used in determining his or her ITQ. Each 
coupon will be coded to indicate the initial recipient.
    (3) An ITQ coupon may be transferred from one wreckfish shareholder 
to another by completing the sale endorsement thereon (that is, the 
signature and shareholder certificate number of the buyer). An ITQ 
coupon may be possessed only by the shareholder to whom it has been 
issued, or by the shareholder's employee, contractor, or agent, unless 
the ITQ coupon has been transferred to another shareholder. An ITQ 
coupon that has been transferred to another shareholder may be possessed 
only by the shareholder whose signature appears on the coupon as the

[[Page 248]]

buyer, or by the shareholder's employee, contractor, or agent, and with 
all required sale endorsements properly completed.
    (4) Wreckfish may not be possessed on board a fishing vessel that 
has been issued a commercial vessel permit for South Atlantic snapper-
grouper and a commercial vessel permit for wreckfish--
    (i) In an amount exceeding the total of the ITQ coupons on board the 
vessel; or
    (ii) That does not have on board logbook forms for that fishing 
trip, as required under Sec. 622.5(a)(1)(iv)(C)(1).
    (5) Prior to termination of a trip, a signature and date signed must 
be affixed in ink to the ``Fisherman'' part of ITQ coupons in 
denominations equal to the eviscerated weight of the wreckfish on board. 
The ``Fisherman'' part of each such coupon must be separated from the 
coupon and submitted with the logbook forms required by Sec. 
622.5(a)(1)(iv)(C)(1) for that fishing trip.
    (6) The ``Fish House'' part of each such coupon must be given to the 
dealer to whom the wreckfish are transferred in amounts totaling the 
eviscerated weight of the wreckfish transferred to that dealer. A 
wreckfish may be transferred only to a dealer who holds a dealer permit 
for wreckfish, as required under Sec. 622.4(a)(4).
    (7) A dealer may receive a wreckfish only from a vessel for which a 
commercial permit for wreckfish has been issued, as required under Sec. 
622.4(a)(2)(vii). A dealer must receive the ``Fish House'' part of ITQ 
coupons in amounts totaling the eviscerated weight of the wreckfish 
received; enter the permit number of the vessel from which the wreckfish 
were received, enter the date the wreckfish were received, enter the 
dealer's permit number, and sign each such ``Fish House'' part; and 
submit all such parts with the dealer reports required by Sec. 
622.5(c)(5)(i).
    (8) An owner or operator of a vessel and a dealer must make 
available to an authorized officer all ITQ coupons in his or her 
possession upon request.
    (d) Wreckfish limitations. (1) A wreckfish taken in the South 
Atlantic EEZ may not be transferred at sea, regardless of where the 
transfer takes place; and a wreckfish may not be transferred in the 
South Atlantic EEZ.
    (2) A wreckfish possessed by a fisherman or dealer shoreward of the 
outer boundary of the South Atlantic EEZ or in a South Atlantic coastal 
state will be presumed to have been harvested from the South Atlantic 
EEZ unless accompanied by documentation that it was harvested from other 
than the South Atlantic EEZ.
    (3) A wreckfish harvested by a vessel that has been issued a 
commercial vessel permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper and a 
commercial vessel permit for wreckfish may be offloaded from a fishing 
vessel only between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., local time.
    (4) If a wreckfish harvested by a vessel that has been issued a 
commercial vessel permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper and a 
commercial vessel permit for wreckfish is to be offloaded at a location 
other than a fixed facility of a dealer who holds a dealer permit for 
wreckfish, as required under Sec. 622.4(a)(4), the wreckfish 
shareholder or the vessel operator must advise the NMFS Office for Law 
Enforcement, Southeast Region, St. Petersburg, FL, by telephone (727-
824-5344), of the location not less than 24 hours prior to offloading.

Sec. 622.15  Wreckfish individual transferable quota (ITQ) system.

                                * * * * *

    (a) General--(1) Percentage shares--(i) Initial ITQ shares. In 
accordance with the procedure specified in the Fishery Management Plan 
for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery of the South Atlantic Region, percentage 
shares of the quota for wreckfish were assigned at the beginning of the 
program. Each person was notified by the RA of his or her percentage 
share and shareholder certificate number.
    (ii) Reverted ITQ shares. Any shares determined by NMFS to be 
inactive, will be redistributed proportionately among remaining 
shareholders (subject to cap restrictions)

[[Page 249]]

based on shareholder landings history. Inactive shares are, for purposes 
of this section, those shares held by ITQ shareholders who have not 
reported any wreckfish landings between April 16, 2006, and January 14, 
2011.
    (iii) Percentage share set-aside to accommodate resolution of 
appeals. During the 2012-2013 fishing year, the RA will reserve 1.401 
percent of wreckfish ITQ shares prior to redistributing shares (see 
paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section) to accommodate resolution of 
appeals, if necessary. NMFS will distribute any portion of the 1.401-
percent share remaining after the appeals process as soon as possible 
among the remaining shareholders.
    (iv) Procedure for appealing wreckfish quota share status and 
landings information. Appeals must be submitted to the RA postmarked no 
later than January 24, 2013 and must contain documentation supporting 
the basis for the appeal. The only items subject to appeal are the 
status of wreckfish quota shares, as active or inactive, and the 
accuracy of the amount of landings. The RA will review and evaluate all 
appeals, render final decisions on the appeals, and advise the appellant 
of the final decision. Appeals based on hardship factors will not be 
considered. The RA will determine the outcome of appeals based on NMFS' 
logbooks. If NMFS' logbooks are not available, the RA may use state 
landings records. Appellants must submit NMFS' logbooks or state 
landings records, as appropriate, to support their appeal.
    (2) Share transfers. All or a portion of a person's percentage 
shares are transferrable. Transfer of shares must be reported on a form 
available from the RA. The RA will confirm, in writing, each transfer of 
shares. The effective date of each transfer is the confirmation date 
provided by the RA. NMFS charges a fee for each transfer of shares and 
calculates the amount in accordance with the procedures of the NOAA 
Finance Handbook. The handbook is available from the RA. The fee may not 
exceed such costs and is specified with each transfer form. The 
appropriate fee must accompany each transfer form.
    (3) ITQ share cap. No person, including a corporation or other 
entity, may individually or collectively hold ITQ shares in excess of 49 
percent of the total shares. For the purposes of considering the share 
cap, a corporation's total ITQ share is determined by adding the 
corporation's ITQ shares to any other ITQ shares the corporation owns in 
another corporation. If an individual ITQ shareholder is also a 
shareholder in a corporation that holds ITQ shares, an individual's 
total ITQ share is determined by adding the applicable ITQ shares held 
by the individual to the applicable ITQ shares equivalent to the 
corporate share the individual holds in a corporation. A corporation 
must provide the RA the identity of the shareholders of the corporation 
and their percent of shares in the corporation, and provide updated 
information to the RA within 30 days of when a change occurs. This 
information must also be provided to the RA any time a commercial vessel 
permit for wreckfish is renewed or transferred.

<R05>
Sec. 622.16  Gulf red snapper individual fishing quota (IFQ) program.

    (a) General. This section establishes an IFQ program for the 
commercial red snapper component of the Gulf reef fish fishery. Shares 
determine the amount of Gulf red snapper IFQ allocation, in pounds 
gutted weight, a shareholder is initially authorized to possess, land, 
or sell in a given calendar year. As of January 1, 2012, IFQ shares and 
allocation can only be transferred to U.S. citizens and permanent 
resident aliens. See Sec. 622.16(b)(9) regarding eligibility to 
participate in the Gulf red snapper IFQ program as of January 1, 2012. 
Shares and annual IFQ allocation are transferable. See Sec. 
622.4(a)(2)(ix) regarding a requirement for a vessel landing red snapper 
subject to this IFQ program to have a Gulf red snapper IFQ vessel 
account. See Sec. 622.4(a)(4)(ii) regarding a requirement for a Gulf 
IFQ dealer endorsement. Details regarding eligibility, applicable 
landings history, account setup and transaction requirements, 
constraints on transferability, and other provisions of this IFQ system 
are provided in the following paragraphs of this section.
    (1) Scope. The provisions of this section regarding the harvest and 
possession of Gulf IFQ red snapper apply to Gulf red snapper in or from 
the Gulf EEZ and, for a person aboard a vessel with a Gulf red snapper 
IFQ vessel account as required by Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(ix) or for a person 
with a Gulf IFQ dealer endorsement as required by Sec. 622.4(a)(4)(ii), 
these provisions apply to Gulf red snapper regardless of where harvested 
or possessed.
    (2) Duration. The IFQ program established by this section will 
remain in effect until it is modified or terminated; however, the 
program will be evaluated by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management 
Council every 5 years.

[[Page 250]]

    (3) Electronic system requirements. (i) The administrative functions 
associated with this IFQ program, e.g., registration and account setup, 
landing transactions, and transfers, are designed to be accomplished 
online; therefore, a participant must have access to a computer and 
Internet access and must set up an appropriate IFQ online account to 
participate. The computer must have browser software installed, e.g. 
Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox; as well as the software Adobe 
Flash Player version 9.0 or greater, which may be downloaded from the 
Internet for free. Assistance with online functions is available from 
IFQ Customer Service by calling 1-(866) 425-7627 Monday through Friday 
between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. eastern time.
    (ii) The RA mailed initial shareholders and dealers with Gulf reef 
fish dealer permits information and instructions pertinent to setting up 
an IFQ online account. Other eligible persons who desire to become IFQ 
participants by purchasing IFQ shares or allocation or by obtaining a 
Gulf red snapper IFQ dealer endorsement must first contact IFQ Customer 
Service at 1-(866) 425-7627 to obtain information necessary to set up 
the required IFQ online account. As of January 1, 2012, all U.S. 
citizens and permanent resident aliens are eligible to establish an IFQ 
online account. As of January 1, 2012, all current IFQ participants must 
complete and submit the application for an IFQ Online Account to certify 
their citizenship status and ensure their account information (e.g., 
mailing address, corporate shareholdings, etc.) is up to date. See Sec. 
622.16(b)(9) regarding requirements for the application for an IFQ 
Online Account. Each IFQ participant must monitor his/her online account 
and all associated messages and comply with all IFQ online reporting 
requirements.
    (iii) During catastrophic conditions only, the IFQ program provides 
for use of paper-based components for basic required functions as a 
backup. The RA will determine when catastrophic conditions exist, the 
duration of the catastrophic conditions, and which participants or 
geographic areas are deemed affected by the catastrophic conditions. The 
RA will provide timely notice to affected participants via publication 
of notification in the Federal Register, NOAA weather radio, fishery 
bulletins, and other appropriate means and will authorize the affected 
participants' use of paper-based components for the duration of the 
catastrophic conditions. NMFS will provide each IFQ dealer the necessary 
paper forms, sequentially coded, and instructions for submission of the 
forms to the RA. The paper forms will also be available from the RA. The 
program functions available to participants or geographic areas deemed 
affected by catastrophic conditions will be limited under the paper-
based system. There will be no mechanism for transfers of IFQ shares or 
allocation under the paper-based system in effect during catastrophic 
conditions. Assistance in complying with the requirements of the paper-
based system will be available via IFQ Customer Service 1-(866) 425-7627 
Monday through Friday between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. eastern time.
    (4) IFQ allocation. IFQ allocation is the amount of Gulf red 
snapper, in pounds gutted weight, an IFQ shareholder or allocation 
holder is authorized to possess, land, or sell during a given fishing 
year. IFQ allocation is derived at the beginning of each year by 
multiplying a shareholder's IFQ share times the annual commercial quota 
for Gulf red snapper. If the quota is increased after the beginning of 
the fishing year, then IFQ allocation is derived by multiplying a 
shareholder's IFQ share at the time of the quota increase by the amount 
the annual commercial quota for red snapper is increased.
    (5) Initial shareholder IFQ account setup information. As soon as 
possible after an IFQ Online Account is established, the RA will provide 
IFQ account holders information pertinent to the IFQ program. This 
information will include:
    (i) General instructions regarding procedures related to the IFQ 
online system; and
    (ii) A user identification number--the personal identification 
number (PIN) is provided in a subsequent letter.
    (6) Dealer notification and IFQ account setup information. As soon 
as possible after November 22, 2006, the RA mailed each dealer with a 
valid Gulf reef fish

[[Page 251]]

dealer permit information pertinent to the IFQ program. Any such dealer 
is eligible to receive a Gulf IFQ dealer endorsement, which can be 
downloaded from the IFQ Web site at http://ifq.sero.nmfs.noaa.gov once 
an IFQ account has been established. The information package included 
general information about the IFQ program and instructions for accessing 
the IFQ Web site and establishing an IFQ dealer account.
    (b) IFQ operations and requirements--(1) IFQ Landing and transaction 
requirements. (i) Gulf red snapper subject to this IFQ program can only 
be possessed or landed by a vessel with a Gulf red snapper IFQ vessel 
account with allocation at least equal to the pounds of red snapper on 
board, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. Such 
red snapper can only be received by a dealer with a Gulf IFQ dealer 
endorsement.
    (ii) A person on board a vessel with an IFQ vessel account landing 
the shareholder's only remaining allocation, can legally exceed, by up 
to 10 percent, the shareholder's allocation remaining on that last 
fishing trip of the fishing year, i.e., a one-time per fishing year 
overage. Any such overage will be deducted from the shareholder's 
applicable allocation for the subsequent fishing year. From the time of 
the overage until January 1 of the subsequent fishing year, the IFQ 
shareholder must retain sufficient shares to account for the allocation 
that will be deducted the subsequent fishing year. Share transfers that 
would violate this requirement will be prohibited.
    (iii) The dealer is responsible for completing a landing transaction 
report for each landing and sale of Gulf red snapper via the IFQ Web 
site at http://ifq.sero.nmfs.noaa.gov at the time of the transaction in 
accordance with the reporting form(s) and instructions provided on the 
Web site. This report includes, but is not limited to, date, time, and 
location of transaction; weight and actual ex-vessel price of red 
snapper landed and sold; and information necessary to identify the 
fisherman, vessel, and dealer involved in the transaction. The fisherman 
must validate the dealer transaction report by entering his unique PIN 
when the transaction report is submitted. After the dealer submits the 
report and the information has been verified, the Web site will send a 
transaction approval code to the dealer and the allocation holder.
    (iv) If there is a discrepancy regarding the landing transaction 
report after approval, the dealer or vessel account holder (or his or 
her authorized agent) must initiate a landing transaction correction 
form to correct the landing transaction. This form is available via the 
IFQ Web site at http://ifq.sero.nmfs.noaa.gov. The dealer must then 
print out the form, both parties must sign it, and the form must be 
mailed to NMFS. The form must be received by NMFS no later than 15 days 
after the date of the initial landing transaction.
    (2) IFQ cost recovery fees. As required by section 304(d)(2)(A)(i) 
of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the RA will collect a fee to recover the 
actual costs directly related to the management and enforcement of the 
Gulf red snapper IFQ program. The fee cannot exceed 3 percent of the ex-
vessel value of Gulf red snapper landed under the IFQ program as 
described in the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Such fees will be deposited in 
the Limited Access System Administration Fund (LASAF). Initially, the 
fee will be 3 percent of the actual ex-vessel price of Gulf red snapper 
landed per trip under the IFQ program, as documented in each landings 
transaction report. The RA will review the cost recovery fee annually to 
determine if adjustment is warranted. Factors considered in the review 
include the catch subject to the IFQ cost recovery, projected ex-vessel 
value of the catch, costs directly related to the management and 
enforcement of the IFQ program, the projected IFQ balance in the LASAF, 
and expected non-payment of fee liabilities. If the RA determines that a 
fee adjustment is warranted, the RA will publish a notification of the 
fee adjustment in the Federal Register.
    (i) Payment responsibility. The IFQ allocation holder specified in 
the documented red snapper IFQ landing transaction report is responsible 
for payment of the applicable cost recovery fees.

[[Page 252]]

    (ii) Collection and submission responsibility. A dealer who receives 
Gulf red snapper subject to the IFQ program is responsible for 
collecting the applicable cost recovery fee for each IFQ landing from 
the IFQ allocation holder specified in the IFQ landing transaction 
report. Such dealer is responsible for submitting all applicable cost 
recovery fees to NMFS on a quarterly basis. The fees are due and must be 
submitted, using pay.gov via the IFQ system at the end of each calendar-
year quarter, but no later than 30 days after the end of each calendar-
year quarter. Fees not received by the deadline are delinquent.
    (iii) Fee payment procedure. For each IFQ dealer, the IFQ system 
will post, on individual message boards, an end-of-quarter statement of 
cost recovery fees that are due. The dealer is responsible for 
submitting the cost recovery fee payments using pay.gov via the IFQ 
system. Authorized payments methods are credit card, debit card, or 
automated clearing house (ACH). Payment by check will be authorized only 
if the RA has determined that the geographical area or an individual(s) 
is affected by catastrophic conditions.
    (iv) Fee reconciliation process--delinquent fees. The following 
procedures apply to an IFQ dealer whose cost recovery fees are 
delinquent.
    (A) On or about the 31st day after the end of each calendar-year 
quarter, the RA will send the dealer an electronic message via the IFQ 
Web site and official notice via mail indicating the applicable fees are 
delinquent, and the dealer's IFQ account has been suspended pending 
payment of the applicable fees.
    (B) On or about the 91st day after the end of each calendar-year 
quarter, the RA will refer any delinquent IFQ dealer cost recovery fees 
to the appropriate authorities for collection of payment.
    (3) Measures to enhance IFQ program enforceability--(i) Advance 
notice of landing. For the purpose of this paragraph, landing means to 
arrive at a dock, berth, beach, seawall, or ramp. The owner or operator 
of a vessel landing IFQ red snapper is responsible for ensuring that 
NMFS is contacted at least 3 hours, but no more than 12 hours, in 
advance of landing to report the time and location of landing, estimated 
red snapper landings in pounds gutted weight, vessel identification 
number (Coast Guard registration number or state registration number), 
and the name and address of the IFQ dealer where the red snapper are to 
be received. The vessel landing red snapper must have sufficient IFQ 
allocation in the IFQ vessel account, at least equal to the pounds in 
gutted weight of red snapper on board (except for any overage up to the 
10 percent allowed on the last fishing trip) from the time of the 
advance notice of landing through landing. Authorized methods for 
contacting NMFS and submitting the report include calling IFQ Customer 
Service at 1-(866) 425-7627, completing and submitting to NMFS the 
notification form provided through the VMS unit, or providing the 
required information to NMFS through the web-based form available on the 
IFQ Web site at http://ifq.sero.nmfs.noaa.gov. As new technology becomes 
available, NMFS will add other authorized methods for complying with the 
advance notification requirement, via appropriate rulemaking. Failure to 
comply with this advance notice of landing requirement is unlawful and 
will preclude authorization to complete the landing transaction report 
required in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section and, thus, will 
preclude issuance of the required transaction approval code.
    (ii) Time restriction on offloading. For the purpose of this 
paragraph, offloading means to remove IFQ red snapper from a vessel. IFQ 
red snapper may be offloaded only between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., local time.
    (iii) Restrictions on transfer of IFQ red snapper. At-sea or 
dockside transfer of IFQ red snapper from one vessel to another vessel 
is prohibited.
    (iv) Requirement for transaction approval code. If IFQ red snapper 
are offloaded to a vehicle for transportation to a dealer or are on a 
vessel that is trailered for transport to a dealer, on-site capability 
to accurately weigh the fish and to connect electronically to the online 
IFQ system to complete the transaction and obtain the transaction 
approval code is required. After a landing transaction has been 
completed, a transaction approval

[[Page 253]]

code verifying a legal transaction of the amount of IFQ red snapper in 
possession and a copy of the dealer endorsement must accompany any IFQ 
red snapper from the landing location through possession by a dealer. 
This requirement also applies to IFQ red snapper possessed on a vessel 
that is trailered for transport to a dealer.
    (v) Approved landing locations. Landing locations must be approved 
by NMFS Office for Law Enforcement prior to landing or offloading at 
these sites. Proposed landing locations may be submitted online via the 
IFQ Web site at http://ifq.sero.nmfs.noaa.gov, or by calling IFQ 
Customer Service at 1-(866) 425-7627, at any time; however, new landing 
locations will be approved only at the end of each calendar-year 
quarter. To have a landing location approved by the end of the calendar-
year quarter, it must be submitted at least 45 days before the end of 
the calendar-year quarter. NMFS will evaluate the proposed sites based 
on, but not limited to, the following criteria:
    (A) Landing locations must have a street address. If there is no 
street address on record for a particular landing location, global 
positioning system (GPS) coordinates for an identifiable geographic 
location must be provided.
    (B) Landing locations must be publicly accessible by land and water, 
and must satisfy the following criteria:
    (1) Vehicles must have access to the site via public roads;
    (2) Vessels must have access to the site via navigable waters;
    (3) No other condition may impede free and immediate access to the 
site by an authorized law enforcement officer. Examples of such 
conditions include, but are not limited to: A locked gate, fence, wall, 
or other barrier preventing 24-hour access to the site; a gated 
community entry point; a guard animal; a posted sign restricting access 
to the site; or any other physical deterrent.
    (4) Transfer of IFQ shares and allocation. Until January 1, 2012, 
IFQ shares and allocations can be transferred only to a person who holds 
a valid commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish; thereafter, IFQ 
shares and allocations can be transferred only to a U.S. citizen or 
permanent resident alien. However, a valid commercial permit for Gulf 
reef fish, a Gulf red snapper IFQ vessel account, and Gulf red snapper 
IFQ allocation are required to possess (at and after the time of the 
advance notice of landing), land or sell Gulf red snapper subject to 
this IFQ program.
    (i) Share transfers. Share transfers are permanent, i.e., they 
remain in effect until subsequently transferred. Transfer of shares will 
result in the corresponding allocation being automatically transferred 
to the person receiving the transferred share beginning with the fishing 
year following the year the transfer occurred. However, within the 
fishing year the share transfer occurs, transfer of shares and 
associated allocation are independent--unless the associated allocation 
is transferred separately, it remains with the transferor for the 
duration of that fishing year. A share transfer transaction that remains 
in pending status, i.e., has not been completed and verified with a 
transaction approval code, after 30 days from the date the shareholder 
initiated the transfer will be cancelled, and the pending shares will be 
re-credited to the shareholder who initiated the transfer.
    (ii) Share transfer procedures. Share transfers must be accomplished 
online via the IFQ Web site. An IFQ shareholder must initiate a share 
transfer request by logging onto the IFQ Web site at http://
ifq.sero.nmfs.noaa.gov. Following the instructions provided on the Web 
site, the shareholder must enter pertinent information regarding the 
transfer request including, but not limited to, amount of shares to be 
transferred, which must be a minimum of 0.0001 percent; name of the 
eligible transferee; and the value of the transferred shares. An IFQ 
shareholder who is subject to a sanction under 15 CFR part 904 is 
prohibited from initiating a share transfer. An IFQ shareholder who is 
subject to a pending sanction under 15 CFR part 904 must disclose in 
writing to the prospective transferee the existence of any pending 
sanction at the time of the transfer. For the first 5 years this IFQ 
program is in effect, an eligible transferee is a person who has a valid 
commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish; is in compliance with all 
reporting requirements for the Gulf

[[Page 254]]

reef fish fishery and the red snapper IFQ program; is not subject to 
sanctions under 15 CFR part 904; and who would not be in violation of 
the share cap as specified in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. 
Thereafter, share transferee eligibility will only include U.S. citizens 
and permanent resident aliens who are otherwise in compliance with the 
provisions of this section. The online system will verify the transfer 
information entered. If the information is not accepted, the online 
system will send the shareholder an electronic message explaining the 
reason(s) why the transfer request cannot be completed. If the 
information is accepted, the online system will send the transferee an 
electronic message of the pending transfer. The transferee must approve 
the share transfer by electronic signature. If the transferee approves 
the share transfer, the online system will send a transaction approval 
code to both the transferor and transferee confirming the transaction. 
All share transfers must be completed and the transaction approval code 
received prior to December 31 at 6 p.m. eastern time each year.
    (iii) Allocation transfers. An allocation transfer is valid only for 
the remainder of the fishing year in which it occurs; it does not carry 
over to the subsequent fishing year. Any allocation that is unused at 
the end of the fishing year is void. Allocation may be transferred to a 
vessel account from any IFQ account. Allocation held in a vessel 
account, however, may only be transferred back to the IFQ account 
through which the vessel account was established.
    (iv) Allocation transfer procedures. Allocation transfers must be 
accomplished online via the IFQ Web site. An IFQ account holder must 
initiate an allocation transfer by logging onto the IFQ Web site at 
http://ifq.sero.nmfs.noaa.gov, entering the required information, 
including but not limited to, name of an eligible transferee and amount 
of IFQ allocation to be transferred and price, and submitting the 
transfer electronically. An IFQ allocation holder who is subject to a 
sanction under 15 CFR part 904 is prohibited from initiating an 
allocation transfer. An IFQ allocation holder who is subject to a 
pending sanction under 15 CFR part 904 must disclose in writing to the 
prospective transferee the existence of any pending sanction at the time 
of the transfer. If the transfer is approved, the online system will 
provide a transaction approval code to the transferor and transferee 
confirming the transaction.
    (5) Restricted transactions during the 20-hour online maintenance 
window. All electronic IFQ transactions must be completed by December 31 
at 6 p.m. eastern time each year. Electronic IFQ functions will resume 
again on January 1 at 2 p.m. eastern time the following fishing year. 
The remaining 6 hours prior to the end of the fishing year, and the 14 
hours at the beginning of the next fishing year, are necessary to 
provide NMFS time to reconcile IFQ accounts, adjust allocations for the 
upcoming year if the commercial quotas for Gulf red snapper have 
changed, and update shares and allocations for the upcoming fishing 
year. No electronic IFQ transactions will be available during these 20 
hours. An advance notice of landing may still be submitted during the 
20-hour maintenance window by using the vessel's VMS unit or calling IFQ 
Customer Service at 1-(866) 425-7627.
    (6) IFQ share cap. No person, including a corporation or other 
entity, may individually or collectively hold IFQ shares in excess of 
6.0203 percent of the total shares. For the purposes of considering the 
share cap, a corporation's total IFQ share is determined by adding the 
applicable IFQ shares held by the corporation and any other IFQ shares 
held by a corporation(s) owned by the original corporation prorated 
based on the level of ownership. An individual's total IFQ share is 
determined by adding the applicable IFQ shares held by the individual 
and the applicable IFQ shares equivalent to the corporate share the 
individual holds in a corporation. Initially, a corporation must provide 
the RA the identity of the shareholders of the corporation and their 
percent of shares in the corporation, and provide updated information to 
the RA within 30 days of when changes occur. This information must also 
be provided to the RA any time a commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef

[[Page 255]]

fish is renewed or transferred and at the time of renewal of the 
application for an IFQ Online Account.
    (7) Redistribution of shares resulting from permanent revocation. If 
a shareholder's IFQ shares have been permanently revoked, the RA will 
redistribute the IFQ shares held by that shareholder proportionately 
among remaining shareholders (subject to cap restrictions) based upon 
the amount of shares each held just prior to the redistribution. During 
December of each year, the RA will determine the amount of revoked 
shares, if any, to be redistributed, and the shares will be distributed 
at the beginning of the subsequent fishing year.
    (8) Annual recalculation and notification of IFQ shares and 
allocation. On or about January 1 each year, IFQ shareholders will be 
notified, via the IFQ Web site at http://ifq.sero.nmfs.noaa.gov, of 
their IFQ share and allocation for the upcoming fishing year. These 
updated share values will reflect the results of applicable share 
transfers and any redistribution of shares (subject to cap restrictions) 
resulting from permanent revocation of applicable shares. Updated 
allocation values will reflect any change in IFQ share, any change in 
the annual commercial quota for Gulf red snapper, and any debits 
required as a result of prior fishing year overages as specified in 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. IFQ participants can monitor the 
status of their shares and allocation throughout the year via the IFQ 
Web site.

Sec. 622.17  South Atlantic golden crab controlled access.

    (a) General. In accordance with the procedures specified in the 
Fishery Management Plan for the Golden Crab Fishery of the South 
Atlantic Region, initial commercial vessel permits have been issued for 
the fishery. All permits in the fishery are issued on a fishing-year 
(calendar-year) basis. No additional permits may be issued except for 
the northern zone as follows:
    (1) The RA will issue up to two new vessel permits for the northern 
zone. Selection will be made from the list of historical participants in 
the South Atlantic golden crab fishery. Such list was used at the 
October 1995 meeting of the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council 
and was prioritized based on pounds of golden crab landed, without 
reference to a specific zone. Individuals on the list who originally 
received permits will be deleted from the list.

[[Page 257]]

    (2) The RA will offer in writing an opportunity to apply for a 
permit for the northern zone to the individuals highest on the list 
until two individuals accept and apply in a timely manner. An offer that 
is not accepted within 30 days after it is received will no longer be 
valid.
    (3) An application for a permit from an individual who accepts the 
RA's offer must be received by the RA no later than 30 days after the 
date of the individual's acceptance. Application forms are available 
from the RA.
    (4) A vessel permit for the northern zone issued under paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, and any successor permit, may not be changed to 
another zone. A successor permit includes a permit issued to that vessel 
for a subsequent owner and a permit issued via transfer from that vessel 
to another vessel.
    (b) Fishing zones--(1) Designation of fishing zones. The South 
Atlantic EEZ is divided into three fishing zones for golden crab as 
follows:
    (i) Northern zone--the South Atlantic EEZ north of 28[deg] N. lat.
    (ii) Middle zone--the South Atlantic EEZ from 28[deg] N. lat. to 
25[deg] N. lat.
    (iii) Southern zone--the South Atlantic EEZ south of 25[deg] N. lat.
    (2) Authorization to fish in zones. Each vessel permit indicates one 
of the zones specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. A vessel 
with a permit to fish for golden crab in the northern zone or the middle 
zone may fish only in that zone. A vessel with a documented length 
overall greater than 65 ft (19.8 m) with a permit to fish for golden 
crab in the southern zone may fish in that zone, consistent with the 
provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. A vessel may possess 
golden crab only in a zone in which it is authorized to fish, except 
that other zones may be transited if the vessel notifies NMFS Office for 
Law Enforcement, Southeast Region, St. Petersburg, FL, by telephone 
(727-824-5344) in advance and does not fish in a zone in which it is not 
authorized to fish.
    (3) Small-vessel sub-zone. Within the southern zone, a small-vessel 
sub-zone is established bounded on the north by 24[deg]15[min] N. lat., 
on the south by 24[deg]07[min] N. lat., on the east by 81[deg]22[min] W. 
long., and on the west by 81[deg]56[min] W. long. No vessel with a 
documented length overall greater than 65 ft (19.8 m) may fish for 
golden crab in this sub-zone, and a vessel with a documented length 
overall of 65 ft (19.8 m) or less that is permitted for the southern 
zone may fish for golden crab only in this sub-zone.
    (4) Procedure for changing zones. (i) Upon request from an owner of 
a permitted vessel, the RA will change the zone specified on a permit 
from the middle or southern zone to the northern zone. No other changes 
in the zone specified on a permit are allowed, except as specified in 
paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section. An owner of a permitted vessel who 
desires a change to the northern zone must submit his/her request with 
the existing permit to the RA.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (c) Transferring permits between vessels--(1) Procedure for 
transferring. An owner of a vessel who desires a golden crab permit may 
request that NMFS transfer an existing permit or permits to his or her 
vessel by returning an existing permit or permits to the RA with an 
application for a permit for the replacement vessel.
    (2) Vessel size limitations on transferring. (i) To obtain a permit 
for the middle or southern zone via transfer, the documented length 
overall of the replacement vessel may not exceed the documented length 
overall, or aggregate documented lengths overall, of the replaced 
vessel(s) by more than 20 percent. The owner of a vessel permitted for 
the middle or southern zone who has requested that NMFS transfer that 
permit to a smaller vessel (i.e., downsized) may subsequently request 
NMFS transfer that permit to a vessel of a length calculated from the 
length of the permitted vessel immediately prior to downsizing.
    (ii) There are no vessel size limitations to obtain a permit for the 
northern zone via transfer.
    (d) Permit renewal. NMFS will not renew a commercial vessel permit 
for South Atlantic golden crab if the permit is revoked or if the RA 
does not receive a required application for renewal within 6 months 
after the permit's expiration. See Sec. 622.4(h) for the

[[Page 258]]

applicable general procedures and requirements for permit renewals.

Sec. 622.18  South Atlantic snapper-grouper limited access.

    (a) General. The only valid commercial vessel permits for South 
Atlantic snapper-grouper are those that have been issued under the 
limited access criteria specified in the Fishery Management Plan for the 
Snapper-Grouper Fishery of the South Atlantic Region. A commercial 
vessel permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper is either a 
transferable commercial permit or a trip-limited commercial permit.
    (b) Transfers of permits. A snapper-grouper limited access permit is 
valid only for the vessel and owner named on the permit. To change 
either the vessel or the owner, an application for transfer must be 
submitted to the RA.
    (1) Transferable permits. (i) An owner of a vessel with a 
transferable permit may request that the RA transfer the permit to 
another vessel owned by the same entity.
    (ii) A transferable permit may be transferred upon a change of 
ownership of a permitted vessel with such permit--
    (A) From one to another of the following: husband, wife, son, 
daughter, brother, sister, mother, or father; or
    (B) From an individual to a corporation whose shares are all held by 
the individual or by the individual and one or more of the following: 
husband, wife, son, daughter, brother, sister, mother, or father. The 
application for transfer of a permit under this paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) 
and each application for renewal of such permit must be accompanied by a 
current annual report of the corporation that specifies all shareholders 
of the corporation. A permit will not be renewed if the annual report 
shows a new shareholder other than a husband, wife, son, daughter, 
brother, sister, mother, or father.
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this 
section, a person desiring to acquire a limited access, transferable 
permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper must obtain and exchange two 
such permits for one new permit.
    (iv) A transfer of a permit that is undertaken under paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii) of this section will constitute a transfer of the vessel's 
entire catch history to the new owner.
    (2) Trip-limited permits. An owner of a vessel with a trip- limited 
permit may request that the RA transfer the permit to another vessel 
owned by the same entity.
    (c) Renewal. NMFS will not reissue a commercial vessel permit for 
South Atlantic snapper-grouper if the permit is revoked or if the RA 
does not receive an application for renewal within one year of the 
permit's expiration date.

permit will be issued provided the owner,
    (A) Has a commercial vessel permit for rock shrimp;
    (B) Had a limited access endorsement for South Atlantic rock shrimp 
and;
    (C) Was unable to renew the endorsement because the endorsement was 
``inactive'' for a period of 4 consecutive calendar years. ``Inactive'' 
means that the vessel with the endorsement did not land at least 15,000 
lb (6,804 kg) of rock shrimp from the South Atlantic EEZ in a calendar 
year.
    (iii) Application period. Applications under paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section must be received by NMFS by January 27, 2011.
    (iv) Continuity of ownership. An applicant who believes he or she 
meets the permit eligibility criteria based on ownership of a vessel

continuity of ownership.
    (c) Transfer of an existing permit. A Commercial Vessel Permit for 
Rock Shrimp (South Atlantic EEZ) is valid only for the vessel and owner 
named on the permit. To change either the vessel or the owner, a 
complete application for transfer must be submitted to the RA. An owner 
of a vessel with a permit may request that the RA transfer a valid 
permit to another vessel owned by the same entity, to the same vessel 
owned by another entity, or to another vessel with another owner. A 
transfer of a permit under this paragraph will include the transfer of 
the vessel's entire catch history of South Atlantic rock shrimp to a new 
owner; no partial transfers are allowed.
    (d) Renewal. The RA will not reissue a Commercial Vessel Permit for 
Rock Shrimp (South Atlantic EEZ) if the permit is revoked or if the RA 
does not receive an application for renewal of the permit within 1 year 
after the expiration date of the permit.
    (e) Limitation on permits. A vessel for which a permit for South 
Atlantic rock shrimp is required may be issued either a Commercial 
Vessel Permit for Rock Shrimp (Carolinas Zone) or a Commercial Vessel 
Permit for Rock Shrimp (South Atlantic EEZ), depending on its 
eligibility. However, no such vessel may be issued both permits for the 
same period of effectiveness.

Sec. 622.20  Individual fishing quota (IFQ) program for Gulf groupers
and tilefishes.

    (a) General. This section establishes an IFQ program for the 
commercial sectors of the Gulf reef fish fishery for groupers (including 
DWG, red grouper, gag, and Other SWG) and tilefishes (including goldface 
tilefish, blueline tilefish, and tilefish). For the purposes of this IFQ 
program, DWG includes yellowedge grouper, warsaw grouper, snowy grouper, 
speckled hind, and scamp, but only as specified in paragraph (a)(7) of 
this section. For the purposes of this IFQ program, Other SWG includes 
black grouper, scamp,

[[Page 260]]

yellowfin grouper, yellowmouth grouper, warsaw grouper, and speckled 
hind, but only as specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section. Under 
the IFQ program, the RA initially will assign eligible participants IFQ 
shares, in five share categories. These IFQ shares are equivalent to a 
percentage of the annual commercial quotas for DWG, red grouper, gag, 
Other SWG, and tilefishes, based on their applicable historical 
landings. Shares determine the amount of IFQ allocation for Gulf 
groupers and tilefishes, in pounds gutted weight, a shareholder is 
initially authorized to possess, land, or sell in a given calendar year. 
Shares and annual IFQ allocation are transferable. See Sec. 
622.4(a)(2)(ix) regarding a requirement for a vessel landing groupers or 
tilefishes subject to this IFQ program to have an IFQ vessel account for 
Gulf groupers and tilefishes. See Sec. 622.4(a)(4)(ii) regarding a 
requirement for a Gulf IFQ dealer endorsement. Details regarding 
eligibility, applicable landings history, account setup and transaction 
requirements, constraints on transferability, and other provisions of 
this IFQ system are provided in the following paragraphs of this 
section.
    (1) Scope. The provisions of this section apply to Gulf groupers and 
tilefishes in or from the Gulf EEZ and, for a person aboard a vessel 
with an IFQ vessel account for Gulf groupers and tilefishes as required 
by Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(ix) or for a person with a Gulf IFQ dealer 
endorsement as required by Sec. 622.4(a)(4)(ii), these provisions apply 
to Gulf groupers and tilefishes regardless of where harvested or 
possessed.
    (2) Duration. The IFQ program established by this section will 
remain in effect until it is modified or terminated; however, the 
program will be evaluated by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management 
Council every 5 years.
    (3) Electronic system requirements. (i) The administrative functions 
associated with this IFQ program, e.g., registration and account setup, 
landing transactions, and transfers, are designed to be accomplished 
online; therefore, a participant must have access to a computer and 
Internet access and must set up an appropriate IFQ online account to 
participate. The computer must have browser software installed, e.g. 
Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox; as well as the software Adobe 
Flash Player version 9.0 or greater, which may be downloaded from the 
Internet for free. Assistance with online functions is available from 
IFQ Customer Service by calling 1-(866) 425-7627 Monday through Friday 
between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. eastern time.
    (ii) The RA will mail initial shareholders and dealers with Gulf 
reef fish dealer permits information and instructions pertinent to 
setting up an IFQ online account. Other eligible persons who desire to 
become IFQ participants by purchasing IFQ shares or allocation or by 
obtaining a Gulf IFQ dealer endorsement must first contact IFQ Customer 
Service at 1-(866) 425-7627 to obtain information necessary to set up 
the required IFQ online account. All current IFQ participants must 
complete and submit the application for an IFQ Online Account to certify 
their citizenship status and ensure their account information (e.g., 
mailing address, corporate shareholdings, etc.) is up to date. See Sec. 
622.20(b)(9) regarding requirements for the application for an IFQ 
Online Account. Each IFQ participant must monitor his/her online account 
and all associated messages and comply with all IFQ online reporting 
requirements.
    (iii) During catastrophic conditions only, the IFQ program provides 
for use of paper-based components for basic required functions as a 
backup. The RA will determine when catastrophic conditions exist, the 
duration of the catastrophic conditions, and which participants or 
geographic areas are deemed affected by the catastrophic conditions. The 
RA will provide timely notice to affected participants via publication 
of notification in the Federal Register, NOAA weather radio, fishery 
bulletins, and other appropriate means and will authorize the affected 
participants' use of paper-based components for the duration of the 
catastrophic conditions. NMFS will provide each IFQ dealer the necessary 
paper forms, sequentially coded, and instructions for submission of the 
forms to the RA. The paper forms will also be available from the RA. The 
program functions available to participants or geographic

[[Page 261]]

areas deemed affected by catastrophic conditions will be limited under 
the paper-based system. There will be no mechanism for transfers of IFQ 
shares or allocation under the paper-based system in effect during 
catastrophic conditions. Assistance in complying with the requirements 
of the paper-based system will be available via IFQ Customer Service 1-
(866) 425-7627 Monday through Friday between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. 
eastern time.
    (4) IFQ allocation. IFQ allocation is the amount of Gulf groupers 
and tilefishes, in pounds gutted weight, an IFQ shareholder or 
allocation holder is authorized to possess, land, or sell during a given 
fishing year. IFQ allocation for the five respective share categories is 
derived at the beginning of each year by multiplying a shareholder's IFQ 
share times the annual commercial quota for gag, red grouper, DWG, Other 
SWG and tilefishes. If a quota is increased after the beginning of the 
fishing year, then IFQ allocation is derived by multiplying a 
shareholder's IFQ share at the time of the quota increase by the amount 
the annual commercial quota is increased.
    (5) Red grouper and gag multi-use allocation--(i) Red grouper multi-
use allocation. (A) At the time the commercial quota for red grouper is 
distributed to IFQ shareholders, a percentage of each shareholder's 
initial red grouper allocation will be converted to red grouper multi-
use allocation. Red grouper multi-use allocation, determined annually, 
will be based on the following formula:

Red Grouper multi-use allocation (in percent) = 100 * [Gag ACL--Gag 
commercial quota]/Red grouper commercial quota

    (B) Red grouper multi-use allocation may be used to possess, land, 
or sell either red grouper or gag under certain conditions. Red grouper 
multi-use allocation may be used to possess, land, or sell red grouper 
only after an IFQ account holder's (shareholder or allocation holder's) 
red grouper allocation has been landed and sold, or transferred; and to 
possess, land, or sell gag, only after both gag and gag multi-use 
allocation have been landed and sold, or transferred. However, if gag is 
under a rebuilding plan, the percentage of red grouper multi-use 
allocation is equal to zero.
    (ii) Gag multi-use allocation. (A) At the time the commercial quota 
for gag is distributed to IFQ shareholders, a percentage of each 
shareholder's initial gag allocation will be converted to gag multi-use 
allocation. Gag multi-use allocation, determined annually, will be based 
on the following formula:

Gag multi-use allocation (in percent) = 100 * [Red grouper ACL--Red 
grouper commercial quota]/Gag commercial quota

    (B) Gag multi-use allocation may be used to possess, land, or sell 
either gag or red grouper under certain conditions. Gag multi-use 
allocation may be used to possess, land, or sell gag only after an IFQ 
account holder's (shareholder or allocation holder's) gag allocation has 
been landed and sold, or transferred; and to possess, land, or sell red 
grouper, only after both red grouper and red grouper multi-use 
allocation have been landed and sold, or transferred. Multi-use 
allocation transfer procedures and restrictions are specified in 
paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section. However, if red grouper is under a 
rebuilding plan, the percentage of red grouper multi-use allocation is 
equal to zero.
    (6) Warsaw grouper and speckled hind classification. Warsaw grouper 
and speckled hind are considered DWG species and under certain 
circumstances SWG species. For the purposes of the IFQ program for Gulf 
groupers and tilefishes, after all of an IFQ account holder's DWG 
allocation has been landed and sold, or transferred, or if an IFQ 
account holder has no DWG allocation, then Other SWG allocation may be 
used to land and sell warsaw grouper and speckled hind.
    (7) Scamp classification. Scamp is considered a SWG species and 
under certain circumstances a DWG. For the purposes of the IFQ program 
for Gulf groupers and tilefishes, after all of an IFQ account holder's 
Other SWG allocation has been landed and sold, or transferred, or if an 
IFQ account holder has no SWG allocation, then DWG allocation may be 
used to land and sell scamp.

[[Page 262]]

    (8) Initial shareholder and IFQ account setup information. On or 
about October 1, 2009, the RA mailed each Gulf reef fish commercial 
vessel permittee with grouper and tilefish landings history during the 
qualifying years, information pertinent to the IFQ program. This 
information included:
    (i) Gulf grouper and tilefish landings associated with the Gulf reef 
fish commercial vessel permit during each year of the applicable 
landings history;
    (ii) The highest average annual grouper and tilefish landings, in 
each of the five share categories, based on the permittee's best 5 out 
of 6 years of applicable landings history;
    (iii) The permittee's initial IFQ share, in each of the five share 
categories, based on the highest average annual landings associated with 
the permittee's best 5 out of 6 years of applicable landings history;
    (iv) The initial IFQ allocation, in each of the five share 
categories, as well as their total IFQ allocation;
    (v) Instructions for appeals;
    (vi) General instructions regarding procedures related to the IFQ 
online system, including how to set up an online account; and
    (vii) A user identification number; and a personal identification 
number (PIN) that was provided in a subsequent letter.
    (9) Dealer notification and IFQ account setup information. On or 
about October 1, 2009, the RA mailed each dealer with a valid Gulf reef 
fish dealer permit information pertinent to the IFQ program. Any such 
dealer is eligible to receive a Gulf IFQ dealer endorsement, which can 
be downloaded from the IFQ Web site at http://ifq.sero.nmfs.noaa.gov 
once an IFQ account has been established. The information package 
included general information about the IFQ program and instructions for 
accessing the IFQ Web site and establishing an IFQ dealer account.
    (b) IFQ operations and requirements--(1) IFQ Landing and transaction 
requirements. (i) Gulf groupers and tilefishes subject to this IFQ 
program can only be possessed or landed by a vessel with a IFQ vessel 
account for Gulf groupers and tilefishes. Such groupers and tilefishes 
can only be received by a dealer with a Gulf IFQ dealer endorsement. The 
vessel landing groupers or tilefishes must have sufficient IFQ 
allocation in the IFQ vessel account, at least equal to the pounds in 
gutted weight of grouper or tilefish species to be landed, from the time 
of advance notice of landing through landing, except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) A person on board a vessel with an IFQ vessel account landing 
the shareholder's only remaining allocation from among any of the 
grouper or tilefish share categories, can legally exceed, by up to 10 
percent, the shareholder's allocation remaining on that last fishing 
trip of the fishing year, i.e. a one-time per fishing year overage. Any 
such overage will be deducted from the shareholder's applicable 
allocation for the subsequent fishing year. From the time of the overage 
until January 1 of the subsequent fishing year, the IFQ shareholder must 
retain sufficient shares to account for the allocation that will be 
deducted the subsequent fishing year. Share transfers that would violate 
this requirement will be prohibited.
    (iii) The dealer is responsible for completing a landing transaction 
report for each landing and sale of Gulf groupers and tilefishes via the 
IFQ Web site at http://ifq.sero.nmfs.noaa.gov at the time of the 
transaction in accordance with reporting form and instructions provided 
on the Web site. This report includes, but is not limited to, date, 
time, and location of transaction; weight and actual ex-vessel price of 
groupers and tilefishes landed and sold; and information necessary to 
identify the fisherman, vessel, and dealer involved in the transaction. 
The fisherman must validate the dealer transaction report by entering 
the unique PIN for the vessel account when the transaction report is 
submitted. After the dealer submits the report and the information has 
been verified by NMFS, the online system will send a transaction 
approval code to the dealer and the allocation holder.
    (iv) If there is a discrepancy regarding the landing transaction 
report after approval, the dealer or vessel account holder (or his or 
her authorized agent) must initiate a landing transaction correction 
form to correct the

[[Page 263]]

landing transaction. This form is available via the IFQ Web site at 
http://ifq.sero.nmfs.noaa.gov. The dealer must then print out the form, 
both parties must sign it, and the form must be mailed to NMFS. The form 
must be received by NMFS no later than 15 days after the date of the 
initial landing transaction.
    (2) IFQ cost recovery fees. As required by the Magnuson-Stevens Act, 
the RA will collect a fee to recover the actual costs directly related 
to the management and enforcement of the IFQ program for Gulf groupers 
and tilefishes. The fee cannot exceed 3 percent of the ex-vessel value 
of Gulf groupers and tilefishes landed under the IFQ program as 
described in the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Such fees will be deposited in 
the Limited Access System Administration Fund (LASAF). Initially, the 
fee will be 3 percent of the actual ex-vessel price of Gulf groupers and 
tilefishes landed per trip under the IFQ program, as documented in each 
landings transaction report. The RA will review the cost recovery fee 
annually to determine if adjustment is warranted. Factors considered in 
the review include the catch subject to the IFQ cost recovery, projected 
ex-vessel value of the catch, costs directly related to the management 
and enforcement of the IFQ program, the projected IFQ balance in the 
LASAF, and expected non-payment of fee liabilities. If the RA determines 
that a fee adjustment is warranted, the RA will publish a notification 
of the fee adjustment in the Federal Register.
    (i) Payment responsibility. The IFQ account holder specified in the 
documented IFQ landing transaction report for Gulf groupers and 
tilefishes is responsible for payment of the applicable cost recovery 
fees.
    (ii) Collection and submission responsibility. A dealer who receives 
Gulf groupers or tilefishes subject to the IFQ program is responsible 
for collecting the applicable cost recovery fee for each IFQ landing 
from the IFQ account holder specified in the IFQ landing transaction 
report. Such dealer is responsible for submitting all applicable cost 
recovery fees to NMFS on a quarterly basis. The fees are due and must be 
submitted, using pay.gov via the IFQ system, at the end of each 
calendar-year quarter, but no later than 30 days after the end of each 
calendar-year quarter. Fees not received by the deadline are delinquent.
    (iii) Fee payment procedure. For each IFQ dealer, the IFQ system 
will post, in individual IFQ dealer accounts, an end-of-quarter 
statement of cost recovery fees that are due. The dealer is responsible 
for submitting the cost recovery fee payments using pay.gov via the IFQ 
system. Authorized payment methods are credit card, debit card, or 
automated clearing house (ACH). Payment by check will be authorized only 
if the RA has determined that the geographical area or an individual(s) 
is affected by catastrophic conditions.
    (iv) Fee reconciliation process--delinquent fees. The following 
procedures apply to an IFQ dealer whose cost recovery fees are 
delinquent.
    (A) On or about the 31st day after the end of each calendar-year 
quarter, the RA will send the dealer an electronic message via the IFQ 
Web site and official notice via mail indicating the applicable fees are 
delinquent, and the dealer's IFQ account has been suspended pending 
payment of the applicable fees.
    (B) On or about the 91st day after the end of each calendar-year 
quarter, the RA will refer any delinquent IFQ dealer cost recovery fees 
to the appropriate authorities for collection of payment.
    (3) Measures to enhance IFQ program enforceability--(i) Advance 
notice of landing. For the purpose of this paragraph (b), landing means 
to arrive at a dock, berth, beach, seawall, or ramp. The owner or 
operator of a vessel landing IFQ groupers or tilefishes is responsible 
for ensuring that NMFS is contacted at least 3 hours, but no more than 
12 hours, in advance of landing to report the time and location of 
landing, estimated grouper and tilefish landings in pounds gutted weight 
for each share category (gag, red grouper, DWG, Other SWG, tilefishes), 
vessel identification number (Coast Guard registration number or state 
registration number), and the name and address of the IFQ dealer where 
the groupers or tilefishes are to be received. The vessel landing 
groupers or

[[Page 264]]

tilefishes must have sufficient IFQ allocation in the IFQ vessel 
account, and in the appropriate share category or categories, at least 
equal to the pounds in gutted weight of all groupers and tilefishes on 
board (except for any overage up to the 10 percent allowed on the last 
fishing trip) from the time of the advance notice of landing through 
landing. Authorized methods for contacting NMFS and submitting the 
report include calling IFQ Customer Service at 1-(866) 425-7627, 
completing and submitting to NMFS the notification form provided through 
the VMS unit, or providing the required information to NMFS through the 
Web-based form available on the IFQ Web site at http://
ifq.sero.nmfs.noaa.gov. As new technology becomes available, NMFS will 
add other authorized methods for complying with the advance notification 
requirement, via appropriate rulemaking. Failure to comply with this 
advance notice of landing requirement is unlawful and will preclude 
authorization to complete the landing transaction report required in 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section and, thus, will preclude issuance 
of the required transaction approval code.
    (ii) Time restriction on offloading. For the purpose of this 
paragraph, offloading means to remove IFQ groupers and tilefishes from a 
vessel. IFQ groupers or tilefishes may be offloaded only between 6 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., local time.
    (iii) Restrictions on transfer of IFQ groupers and tilefishes. At-
sea or dockside transfer of IFQ groupers or tilefishes from one vessel 
to another vessel is prohibited.
    (iv) Requirement for transaction approval code. If IFQ groupers or 
tilefishes are offloaded to a vehicle for transport to a dealer, on-site 
capability to accurately weigh the fish and to connect electronically to 
the online IFQ system to complete the transaction and obtain the 
transaction approval code is required. After a landing transaction has 
been completed, a transaction approval code verifying a legal 
transaction of the amount of IFQ groupers and tilefishes in possession 
and a copy of the dealer endorsement must accompany any IFQ groupers or 
tilefishes from the landing location through possession by a dealer. 
This requirement also applies to IFQ groupers and tilefishes possessed 
on a vessel that is trailered for transport to a dealer.
    (v) Approved landing locations. Landing locations must be approved 
by NMFS Office for Law Enforcement prior to landing or offloading at 
these sites. Proposed landing locations may be submitted online via the 
IFQ Web site at http://ifq.sero.nmfs.noaa.gov, or by calling IFQ 
Customer Service at 1-(866) 425-7627, at any time; however, new landing 
locations will be approved only at the end of each calendar-year 
quarter. To have your landing location approved by the end of the 
calendar-year quarter, it must be submitted at least 45 days before the 
end of the calendar-year quarter. NMFS will evaluate the proposed sites 
based on, but not limited to, the following criteria:
    (A) Landing locations must have a street address. If there is no 
street address on record for a particular landing location, global 
positioning system (GPS) coordinates for an identifiable geographic 
location must be provided.
    (B) Landing locations must be publicly accessible by land and water, 
and must satisfy the following criteria:
    (1) Vehicles must have access to the site via public roads;
    (2) Vessels must have access to the site via navigable water;
    (3) No other condition may impede free and immediate access to the 
site by an authorized law enforcement officer. Examples of such 
conditions include, but are not limited to: A locked gate, fence, wall, 
or other barrier preventing 24-hour access to the site; a gated 
community entry point; a guard; animal; a posted sign restricting access 
to the site; or any other physical deterrent.
    (4) Transfer of IFQ shares and allocation. Until January 1, 2015, 
IFQ shares and allocations can be transferred only to a person who holds 
a valid commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish; thereafter, IFQ 
shares and allocations can be transferred only to a U.S. citizen or 
permanent resident alien. However, a valid commercial permit for Gulf 
reef fish, an IFQ vessel account for Gulf groupers and tilefishes, and 
IFQ allocation for Gulf groupers or

[[Page 265]]

tilefishes are required to possess (at and after the time of the advance 
notice of landing), land or sell Gulf groupers or tilefishes subject to 
this IFQ program.
    (i) Share transfers. Share transfers are permanent, i.e., they 
remain in effect until subsequently transferred. Transfer of shares will 
result in the corresponding allocation being automatically transferred 
to the person receiving the transferred share beginning with the fishing 
year following the year the transfer occurred. However, within the 
fishing year the share transfer occurs, transfer of shares and 
associated allocation are independent--unless the associated allocation 
is transferred separately, it remains with the transferor for the 
duration of that fishing year. A share transfer transaction that remains 
in pending status, i.e., has not been completed and verified with a 
transaction approval code, after 30 days from the date the shareholder 
initiated the transfer will be cancelled, and the pending shares will be 
re-credited to the shareholder who initiated the transfer.
    (ii) Share transfer procedures. Share transfers must be accomplished 
online via the IFQ Web site. An IFQ shareholder must initiate a share 
transfer request by logging onto the IFQ Web site at http://
ifq.sero.nmfs.noaa.gov. An IFQ shareholder who is subject to a sanction 
under 15 CFR part 904 is prohibited from initiating a share transfer. An 
IFQ shareholder who is subject to a pending sanction under 15 CFR part 
904 must disclose in writing to the prospective transferee the existence 
of any pending sanction at the time of the transfer. Following the 
instructions provided on the Web site, the shareholder must enter 
pertinent information regarding the transfer request including, but not 
limited to: Amount of shares to be transferred, which must be a minimum 
of 0.000001 percent; name of the eligible transferee; and the value of 
the transferred shares. For the first 5 years this IFQ program is in 
effect, an eligible transferee is a person who has a valid commercial 
vessel permit for Gulf reef fish; is in compliance with all reporting 
requirements for the Gulf reef fish fishery and the IFQ program for Gulf 
groupers and tilefishes; is not subject to sanctions under 15 CFR part 
904; and who would not be in violation of the share or allocation caps 
as specified in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. Thereafter, share 
transferee eligibility will only include U.S. citizens and permanent 
resident aliens who are otherwise in compliance with the provisions of 
this section. The online system will verify the information entered. If 
the information is not accepted, the online system will send the 
shareholder an electronic message explaining the reason(s). If the 
information is accepted, the online system will send the transferee an 
electronic message of the pending transfer. The transferee must approve 
the share transfer by electronic signature. If the transferee approves 
the share transfer, the online system will send a transfer approval code 
to both the shareholder and transferee confirming the transaction. All 
share transfers must be completed and the transaction approval code 
received prior to December 31 at 6 p.m. eastern time each year.
    (iii) Allocation transfers. An allocation transfer is valid only for 
the remainder of the fishing year in which it occurs; it does not carry 
over to the subsequent fishing year. Any allocation that is unused at 
the end of the fishing year is void. Allocation may be transferred to a 
vessel account from any IFQ account. Allocation held in a vessel 
account, however, may only be transferred back to the IFQ account 
through which the vessel account was established.
    (iv) Allocation transfer procedures and restrictions--(A) Allocation 
transfer procedures. Allocation transfers must be accomplished online 
via the IFQ Web site. An IFQ account holder must initiate an allocation 
transfer by logging onto the IFQ Web site at http://
ifq.sero.nmfs.noaa.gov, entering the required information, including but 
not limited to, the name of an eligible transferee and amount of IFQ 
allocation to be transferred and price, and submitting the transfer 
electronically. An IFQ allocation holder who is subject to a sanction 
under 15 CFR part 904 is prohibited from initiating an allocation 
transfer. An IFQ allocation holder who is subject to a pending sanction 
under 15 CFR part 904 must disclose in

[[Page 266]]

writing to the prospective transferee the existence of any pending 
sanction at the time of the transfer. If the transfer is approved, the 
Web site will provide a transfer approval code to the transferor and 
transferee confirming the transaction.
    (B) Multi-use allocation transfer restrictions--(1) Red grouper 
multi-use allocation. Red grouper multi-use allocation may only be 
transferred after all an IFQ account holder's red grouper allocation has 
been landed and sold, or transferred.
    (2) Gag multi-use allocation. Gag multi-use allocation may only be 
transferred after all an IFQ account holder's gag allocation has been 
landed and sold, or transferred.
    (5) Restricted transactions during the 20-hour online maintenance 
window. All electronic IFQ transactions must be completed by December 31 
at 6 p.m. eastern time each year. Electronic IFQ functions will resume 
again on January 1 at 2 p.m. eastern time the following fishing year. 
The remaining 6 hours prior to the end of the fishing year, and the 14 
hours at the beginning of the next fishing year, are necessary to 
provide NMFS time to reconcile IFQ accounts, adjust allocations for the 
upcoming year if the commercial quotas or catch allowances for Gulf 
groupers and tilefishes have changed, and update shares and allocations 
for the upcoming fishing year. No electronic IFQ transactions will be 
available during these 20 hours. An advance notice of landing may still 
be submitted during the 20-hour maintenance window by using the vessel's 
VMS unit or calling IFQ Customer Service at 1-(866) 425-7627.
    (6) IFQ share and allocation caps. A corporation's total IFQ share 
(or allocation) is determined by adding the applicable IFQ shares (or 
allocation) held by the corporation and any other IFQ shares (or 
allocation) held by a corporation(s) owned by the original corporation 
prorated based on the level of ownership. An individual's total IFQ 
share is determined by adding the applicable IFQ shares held by the 
individual and the applicable IFQ shares equivalent to the corporate 
share the individual holds in a corporation. An individual's total IFQ 
allocation is determined by adding the individual's total allocation to 
the allocation derived from the IFQ shares equivalent to the corporate 
share the individual holds in a corporation.
    (i) IFQ share cap for each share category. No person, including a 
corporation or other entity, may individually or collectively hold IFQ 
shares in any share category (gag, red grouper, DWG, Other SWG, or 
tilefishes) in excess of the maximum share initially issued for the 
applicable share category to any person at the beginning of the IFQ 
program, as of the date appeals are resolved and shares are adjusted 
accordingly. A corporation must provide to the RA the identity of the 
shareholders of the corporation and their percent of shares in the 
corporation for initial issuance of IFQ shares and allocation, and 
provide updated information to the RA within 30 days of when changes 
occur. This information must also be provided to the RA any time a 
commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish is renewed or transferred 
and at the time of renewal of the application for an IFQ Online Account
    (ii) Total allocation cap. No person, including a corporation or 
other entity, may individually or collectively hold, cumulatively during 
any fishing year, IFQ allocation in excess of the total allocation cap. 
The total allocation cap is the sum of the maximum allocations 
associated with the share caps for each individual share category and is 
calculated annually based on the applicable quotas or catch allowance 
associated with each share category.
    (7) Redistribution of shares resulting from permanent revocation. If 
a shareholder's IFQ shares have been permanently revoked, the RA will 
redistribute the IFQ shares proportionately among remaining shareholders 
(subject to cap restrictions) based upon the amount of shares each held 
just prior to the redistribution. During December of each year, the RA 
will determine the amount of revoked shares, if any, to be 
redistributed, and the shares will be distributed at the beginning of 
the subsequent fishing year.
    (8) Annual recalculation and notification of IFQ shares and 
allocation. On or about January 1 each year, IFQ shareholders will be 
notified, via the IFQ

[[Page 267]]

Web site at http://ifq.sero.nmfs.noaa.gov, of their IFQ shares and 
allocations, for each of the five share categories, for the upcoming 
fishing year. These updated share values will reflect the results of 
applicable share transfers and any redistribution of shares (subject to 
cap restrictions) resulting from permanent revocation of IFQ shares. 
Allocation, for each share category, is calculated by multiplying IFQ 
share for that category times the annual commercial quota or commercial 
catch allowance for that share category. Updated allocation values will 
reflect any change in IFQ share for each share category, any change in 
the annual commercial quota or commercial catch allowance for the 
applicable categories; and any debits required as a result of prior 
fishing year overages as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this 
section. IFQ participants can monitor the status of their shares and 
allocation throughout the year via the IFQ Web site.
    (9) Gulf grouper and tilefish IFQ program participation for current 
grouper and tilefish IFQ account holders. (i) A current participant in 
the Gulf grouper and tilefish IFQ program must complete and submit the 
application for an IFQ Online Account that is available on the Web site 
http://sero.nmfs.noaa.gov, to certify status as a U.S. citizen or 
permanent resident alien. The account holder must also complete and 
submit any other information on this form that may be necessary for the 
administration of the IFQ online account.
    (ii) A person with an established IFQ online account must update and 
confirm the account information every 2 years. IFQ online accounts are 
updated through the submission of the application for an IFQ Online 
Account. Accounts must be updated prior to the account validity date 
(expiration date of the account) that is displayed on each account 
holder's IFQ online account page. The RA will provide each participant 
who has established an online account an application approximately 2 
months prior to the account validity date. A participant who is not 
provided an application at least 45 days prior to the account validity 
date must contact IFQ Customer Service at 1-(866) 425-7627 and request 
an application. Failure to submit a completed application prior to the 
participant's account validity date will lead to the suspension of the 
participant's access to his IFQ online account until a completed 
application is submitted. Participants who certify that they are either 
not a U.S. citizens or permanent resident alien will be ineligible to 
receive shares or allocation through transfer.

<R05>
Sec. 622.31  Prohibited gear and methods.

    In addition to the prohibited gear/methods specified in this 
section, see Sec. Sec. 622.33, 622.34, and 622.35 for seasonal/area 
prohibited gear/methods and Sec. 622.41 for species specific authorized 
and unauthorized gear/methods.
    (a) Explosives. An explosive (except an explosive in a powerhead) 
may not be used to fish in the Caribbean, Gulf, or South Atlantic EEZ. A 
vessel fishing in the EEZ for a species governed in this part, or a 
vessel for which a permit has been issued under Sec. 622.4, may not 
have on board any dynamite or similar explosive substance.
    (b) Chemicals and plants. A toxic chemical may not be used or 
possessed in a coral area, and a chemical, plant, or plant-derived toxin 
may not be used to harvest a Caribbean coral reef resource in the 
Caribbean EEZ.
    (c) Fish traps. A fish trap may not be used or possessed in the Gulf 
or South Atlantic EEZ. A fish trap deployed in the Gulf or South 
Atlantic EEZ may be disposed of in any appropriate manner by the 
Assistant Administrator or an authorized officer.
    (2) A fish trap may not be used or possessed in the Gulf EEZ west of 
85[deg]30[min] W. long. and, after February 7, 2007, may not be used or 
possessed in the Gulf EEZ.
    (3) A fish trap used other than where authorized in paragraph (c) 
(1) or (2) of this section may be disposed of in any appropriate manner 
by the Assistant Administrator or an authorized officer.
    (d) Longlines for wreckfish. A bottom longline may not be used to 
fish for wreckfish in the South Atlantic EEZ. A person aboard a vessel 
that has a longline on board may not retain a wreckfish in or from the 
South Atlantic EEZ. For the purposes of this paragraph, a vessel is 
considered to have a longline on board when a power-operated longline 
hauler, a cable of diameter suitable for use in the longline fishery 
longer than 1.5 mi (2.4 km) on any reel, and gangions are on board. 
Removal of any one of these three elements constitutes removal of a 
longline.
    (e) Poisons. (1) A poison, drug, or other chemical may not be used 
to fish for Caribbean reef fish in the Caribbean EEZ.
    (2) A poison may not be used to take Gulf reef fish in the Gulf EEZ.
    (3) A poison may not be used to fish for South Atlantic snapper-
grouper in the South Atlantic EEZ.
    (f) Power-assisted tools. A power-assisted tool may not be used in 
the Caribbean EEZ to take a Caribbean coral reef resource, in the Gulf 
EEZ to take prohibited coral or live rock, or in the South Atlantic EEZ 
to take allowable octocoral, prohibited coral, or live rock.
    (g) Powerheads. A powerhead may not be used in the Caribbean EEZ to 
harvest Caribbean reef fish or in the EEZ off South Carolina to harvest 
South Atlantic snapper-grouper. The possession of a mutilated Caribbean 
reef fish in or from the Caribbean EEZ, or a mutilated South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper in or from the EEZ off South Carolina, and a powerhead 
is prima facie evidence that such fish was harvested by a powerhead.
    (h) Rebreathers and spearfishing gear. In the South Atlantic EEZ, a 
person using a rebreather may not harvest South Atlantic snapper-grouper 
with spearfishing gear. The possession of such snapper-grouper while in 
the water with a rebreather is prima facie evidence that such fish was 
harvested with spearfishing gear while using a rebreather.
    (i) Sea bass pots. A sea bass pot may not be used in the South 
Atlantic EEZ south of 28[deg]35.1[min] N. lat. (due east of the NASA 
Vehicle Assembly Building, Cape Canaveral, FL). A sea bass pot deployed 
in the EEZ south of 28[deg]35.1[min] N. lat. may be disposed of in any 
appropriate manner by the Assistant Administrator or an authorized 
officer.
    (j) Spears and hooks. A spear, hook, or similar device may not be 
used in the Caribbean EEZ to harvest a Caribbean spiny lobster. The 
possession of a speared, pierced, or punctured Caribbean spiny lobster 
in or from the Caribbean EEZ is prima facie evidence of violation of 
this section.
    (k) Traps for royal red shrimp in the Gulf EEZ and transfer at sea. 
A trap may not be used to fish for royal red

[[Page 269]]

shrimp in the Gulf EEZ. Possession of a trap and royal red shrimp on 
board a vessel is prohibited. A trap used to fish for royal red shrimp 
in the Gulf EEZ may be disposed of in any appropriate manner by the 
Assistant Administrator or an authorized officer. In addition, royal red 
shrimp cannot be transferred in the Gulf EEZ, and royal red shrimp taken 
in the Gulf EEZ cannot be transferred at sea regardless of where the 
transfer takes place.
    (l) Gillnets and trammel nets in the Caribbean EEZ. A gillnet or 
trammel net may not be used in the Caribbean EEZ to fish for Caribbean 
reef fish or Caribbean spiny lobster. Possession of a gillnet or trammel 
net and any Caribbean reef fish or Caribbean spiny lobster in or from 
the Caribbean EEZ is prima facie evidence of violation of this paragraph 
(l). A gillnet or trammel net used in the Caribbean EEZ to fish for any 
other species must be tended at all times.
    (m) Weak link. A bottom trawl that does not have a weak link in the 
tickler chain may not be used to fish in the Gulf EEZ. For the purposes 
of this paragraph, a weak link is defined as a length or section of the 
tickler chain that has a breaking strength less than the chain itself 
and is easily seen as such when visually inspected.
    (n) Gulf reef fish may not be used as bait in any fishery, except 
that, when purchased from a fish processor, the filleted carcasses and 
offal of Gulf reef fish may be used as bait in trap fisheries for blue 
crab, stone crab, deep-water crab, and spiny lobster.

<R05>
Sec. 622.32  Prohibited and limited-harvest species.

    (a) General. The harvest and possession restrictions of this section 
apply without regard to whether the species is harvested by a vessel 
operating under a commercial vessel permit. The operator of a vessel 
that fishes in the EEZ is responsible for the limit applicable to that 
vessel.
    (b) Prohibited species. Prohibited species, by geographical area, 
are as follows:
    (1) Caribbean. (i) Caribbean prohibited coral may not be fished for 
or possessed in or from the Caribbean EEZ. The taking of Caribbean 
prohibited coral in the Caribbean EEZ is not considered unlawful 
possession provided it is returned immediately to the sea in the general 
area of fishing.
    (ii) No person may fish for or possess goliath grouper and Nassau 
grouper in or from the Caribbean EEZ. Such fish caught in the Caribbean 
EEZ must be released immediately with a minimum of harm.
    (iii) Egg-bearing spiny lobster in the Caribbean EEZ must be 
returned to the water unharmed. An egg-bearing spiny lobster may be 
retained in a trap, provided the trap is returned immediately to the 
water. An egg-bearing spiny lobster may not be stripped, scraped, 
shaved, clipped, or in any other manner molested, in order to remove the 
eggs.
    (iv) No person may fish for or possess on board a fishing vessel a 
Caribbean queen conch in or from the Caribbean EEZ, in the area east of 
64[deg]34[min] W. longitude which includes Lang Bank east of St. Croix, 
U.S. Virgin Islands, except during November 1 through May 31.
    (v) No person may fish for or possess midnight parrotfish, blue 
parrotfish, or rainbow parrotfish in or from the Caribbean EEZ. Such 
fish caught in the Caribbean EEZ must be released with a minimum of 
harm.
    (2) Gulf. (i) Gulf and South Atlantic prohibited coral taken as 
incidental catch in the Gulf EEZ must be returned immediately to the sea 
in the general area of fishing. In fisheries where the entire catch is 
landed unsorted, such as the scallop and groundfish fisheries, unsorted 
prohibited coral may be landed ashore; however, no person may sell or 
purchase such prohibited coral.
    (ii) Goliath grouper may not be harvested or possessed in or from 
the Gulf EEZ.
    (iii) Red drum and Nassau grouper may not be harvested or possessed 
in or from the Gulf EEZ. Such fish caught in the Gulf EEZ must be 
released immediately with a minimum of harm.

[[Page 270]]

    (3) South Atlantic. (i) Gulf and South Atlantic prohibited coral 
taken as incidental catch in the South Atlantic EEZ must be returned 
immediately to the sea in the general area of fishing. In fisheries 
where the entire catch is landed unsorted, such as the scallop and 
groundfish fisheries, unsorted prohibited coral may be landed ashore; 
however, no person may sell or purchase such prohibited coral.
    (ii) Goliath grouper and Nassau grouper may not be harvested or 
possessed in or from the South Atlantic EEZ. Goliath grouper and Nassau 
grouper taken in the South Atlantic EEZ incidentally by hook-and-line 
must be released immediately by cutting the line without removing the 
fish from the water.
    (iii) Wild live rock may not be harvested or possessed in the South 
Atlantic EEZ.
    (iv) It is intended that no female golden crabs in or from the South 
Atlantic EEZ be retained on board a vessel and that any female golden 
crab in or from the South Atlantic EEZ be released in a manner that will 
ensure maximum probability of survival. However, to accommodate 
legitimate incidental catch and retention, the number of female golden 
crabs in or from the South Atlantic EEZ retained on board a vessel may 
not exceed 0.5 percent, by number, of all golden crabs on board. See 
Sec. 622.45(f)(1) regarding the prohibition of sale of female golden 
crabs.
    (v) South Atlantic snapper-grouper may not be possessed in whole, 
gutted, or filleted form by a person aboard a vessel fishing for or 
possessing golden crab in or from the South Atlantic EEZ or possessing a 
golden crab trap in the South Atlantic. Only the head, fins, and 
backbone (collectively the ``rack'') of South Atlantic snapper-grouper 
may be possessed for use as bait.
    (vi) Red snapper may not be harvested or possessed in or from the 
South Atlantic EEZ. Such fish caught in the South Atlantic EEZ must be 
released immediately with a minimum of harm. In addition, for a person 
on board a vessel for which a valid Federal commercial or charter 
vessel/headboat permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper has been 
issued, the provisions of this closure apply in the South Atlantic, 
regardless of where such fish are harvested, i.e., in State or Federal 
waters.
    (vii) Speckled hind and warsaw grouper may not be harvested or 
possessed in or from the South Atlantic EEZ. Such fish caught in the 
South Atlantic EEZ must be released immediately with a minimum of harm. 
These restrictions also apply in the South Atlantic on board a vessel 
for which a valid Federal commercial or charter vessel/headboat permit 
for South Atlantic snapper-grouper has been issued, i.e., in State or 
Federal waters.
    (viii) Octocoral may not be harvested or possessed in or from the 
portion of the South Atlantic EEZ managed under the FMP. Octocoral 
collected in the portion of the South Atlantic EEZ managed under the FMP 
must be released immediately with a minimum of harm.
    (c) Limited-harvest species. A person who fishes in the EEZ may not 
combine a harvest limitation specified in this paragraph (c) with a 
harvest limitation applicable to state waters. A species subject to a 
harvest limitation specified in this paragraph (c) taken in the EEZ may 
not be transferred at sea, regardless of where such transfer takes 
place, and such species may not be transferred in the EEZ.
    (1) Cobia. No person may possess more than two cobia per day in or 
from the Gulf, Mid-Atlantic, or South Atlantic EEZ, regardless of the 
number of trips or duration of a trip.
    (2) Cubera snapper. No person may harvest more than two cubera 
snapper measuring 30 inches (76.2 cm), TL, or larger, per day in the 
South Atlantic EEZ off Florida and no more than two such cubera snapper 
in or from the South Atlantic EEZ off Florida may be possessed on board 
a vessel at any time.

Sec. 622.34  Gulf EEZ seasonal and/or area closures.

    (a) Alabama SMZ. The Alabama SMZ consists of artificial reefs and 
surrounding areas. In the Alabama SMZ, fishing by a vessel that is 
operating as a charter vessel or headboat, a vessel that does not have a 
commercial permit for Gulf reef fish, as required under Sec. 
622.4(a)(2), or a vessel with such a permit fishing for Gulf reef fish 
is limited

[[Page 273]]

to hook-and-line gear with three or fewer hooks per line and 
spearfishing gear. A person aboard a vessel that uses on any trip gear 
other than hook-and-line gear with three or fewer hooks per line and 
spearfishing gear in the Alabama SMZ is limited on that trip to the bag 
limits for Gulf reef fish specified in Sec. 622.39(b) and, for Gulf 
reef fish for which no bag limit is specified in Sec. 622.39(b), the 
vessel is limited to 5 percent, by weight, of all fish on board or 
landed. The Alabama SMZ is bounded by rhumb lines connecting, in order, 
the following points:

\1\ On the seaward limit of Florida's waters.

    (g) Reef fish stressed area. The stressed area is that part of the 
Gulf EEZ shoreward of rhumb lines connecting, in order, the points 
listed in Table 2, in Appendix B of this part.
    (1) A powerhead may not be used in the stressed area to take Gulf 
reef fish. Possession of a powerhead and a mutilated Gulf reef fish in 
the stressed area or after having fished in the stressed area 
constitutes prima facie evidence that such reef fish was taken with a 
powerhead in the stressed area. The provisions of this paragraph do not 
apply to hogfish.
    (2) A roller trawl may not be used in the stressed area. Roller 
trawl means a trawl net equipped with a series of large, solid rollers 
separated by several smaller spacer rollers on a separate cable or line 
(sweep) connected to the footrope, which makes it possible to fish the 
gear over rough bottom, that is, in areas unsuitable for fishing 
conventional shrimp trawls. Rigid framed trawls adapted for shrimping 
over uneven bottom, in wide use along the west coast of Florida, and 
shrimp trawls with hollow plastic rollers for fishing on soft bottoms, 
are not considered roller trawls.
    (h) Texas closure. (1) From 30 minutes after official sunset on May 
15 to 30 minutes after official sunset on July 15, trawling, except 
trawling for royal red shrimp beyond the 100-fathom (183-m) depth 
contour, is prohibited in the Gulf EEZ off Texas.
    (2) In accordance with the procedures and restrictions of the 
Fishery Management Plan for the Shrimp Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico, 
the RA may adjust the closing and/or opening date of the Texas closure 
to provide an earlier, later, shorter, or longer closure, but the 
duration of the closure may not exceed 90 days or be less than 45 days. 
Notification of the adjustment of the closing or opening date will be 
published in the Federal Register.
    (i) Tortugas shrimp sanctuary. (1) The Tortugas shrimp sanctuary is

    (2) Within the Madison and Swanson sites and Steamboat Lumps, 
possession of Gulf reef fish is prohibited, except for such possession 
aboard a vessel in transit with fishing gear stowed as specified in 
paragraph (k)(4) of this section.

[[Page 276]]

    (3) Within the Madison and Swanson sites and Steamboat Lumps during 
November through April, and within the Edges during January through 
April, all fishing is prohibited, and possession of any fish species is 
prohibited, except for such possession aboard a vessel in transit with 
fishing gear stowed as specified in paragraph (k)(4) of this section. 
The provisions of this paragraph, (k)(3), do not apply to highly 
migratory species.
    (4) For the purpose of paragraph (k) of this section, transit means 
non-stop progression through the area; fishing gear appropriately stowed 
means -
    (i) A longline may be left on the drum if all gangions and hooks are 
disconnected and stowed below deck. Hooks cannot be baited. All buoys 
must be disconnected from the gear; however, buoys may remain on deck.
    (ii) A trawl net may remain on deck, but trawl doors must be 
disconnected from the trawl gear and must be secured.
    (iii) A gillnet must be left on the drum. Any additional gillnets 
not attached to the drum must be stowed below deck.
    (iv) A rod and reel must be removed from the rod holder and stowed 
securely on or below deck. Terminal gear (i.e., hook, leader, sinker, 
flasher, or bait) must be disconnected and stowed separately from the 
rod and reel. Sinkers must be disconnected from the down rigger and 
stowed separately.
    (5) Within the Madison and Swanson sites and Steamboat Lumps, during 
May through October, surface trolling is the only allowable fishing 
activity. For the purpose of this paragraph (k)(5), surface trolling is 
defined as fishing with lines trailing behind a vessel which is in 
constant motion at speeds in excess of four knots with a visible wake. 
Such trolling may not involve the use of down riggers, wire lines, 
planers, or similar devices.
    (6) For the purpose of paragraph (k) of this section, fish means 
finfish, mollusks, crustaceans, and all other forms of marine animal and 
plant life other than marine mammals and birds. Highly migratory species 
means tuna species, marlin (Tetrapturus spp. and Makaira spp.), oceanic 
sharks, sailfishes (Istiophorus spp.), and swordfish (Xiphias gladius).
    (l) Closures of the Gulf shrimp fishery to reduce red snapper 
bycatch. During a closure implemented in accordance with this paragraph 
(l), trawling is prohibited within the specified closed area(s).
    (1) Procedure for determining need for and extent of closures. Each 
year, in accordance with the applicable framework procedure established 
in the FMP for the Shrimp Fishery in the Gulf of Mexico (FMP), the RA 
will, if necessary, establish a seasonal area closure for the shrimp 
fishery in all or a portion of the areas of the Gulf EEZ specified in 
paragraphs (l)(2) through (l)(4) of this section. The RA's determination 
of the need for such closure and its geographical scope and duration 
will be based on an annual assessment, by the Southeast Fisheries 
Science Center, of the shrimp effort and associated shrimp trawl bycatch 
mortality on red snapper in the 10-30 fathom area of statistical zones 
10-21, compared to the 67-percent target reduction of shrimp trawl 
bycatch mortality on red snapper from the benchmark years of 2001-2003 
established in the FMP (which corresponds in terms of annual shrimp 
effort to 27,328 days fished). The framework procedure provides for 
adjustment of this target reduction level, consistent with the red 
snapper stock rebuilding plan and the findings of subsequent stock 
assessments, via appropriate rulemaking. The assessment will use shrimp 
effort data for the most recent 12-month period available and will 
include a recommendation regarding the geographical scope and duration 
of the closure. The Southeast Fisheries Science Center's assessment will 
be provided to the RA on or about March 1 of each year. If the RA 
determines that a closure is necessary, the closure falls within the 
scope of the potential closures evaluated in the FMP, and good cause 
exists to waive notice and comment, NMFS will implement the closure by 
publication of a final rule in the Federal Register. If such good cause 
waiver is not justified, NMFS

[[Page 277]]

will implement the closure via appropriate notice and comment 
rulemaking. NMFS intends that any closure implemented consistent with 
this paragraph (l) will begin on the same date and time as the Texas 
closure unless circumstances dictate otherwise.
    (2) Eastern zone. The eastern zone is bounded by rhumb lines 
connecting, in order, the following points:

    (2) Within the prohibited area and time period specified in 
paragraph (q)(1) of this section, a vessel with bottom longline gear on 
board may not possess Gulf reef fish unless the bottom longline gear is 
appropriately stowed, and a vessel that is using bottom longline gear to 
fish for species other than Gulf reef fish may not possess Gulf reef 
fish. For the purposes of paragraph (q) of this section, appropriately 
stowed means that a longline may be left on the drum if all gangions and 
hooks are disconnected and stowed below deck; hooks cannot be baited; 
and all buoys must be disconnected from the gear but may remain on deck.
    (3) Within the Gulf EEZ east of 85[deg]30[min] W. long., a vessel 
for which a valid eastern Gulf reef fish bottom longline endorsement has 
been issued that is fishing bottom longline gear or has bottom longline 
gear on board cannot possess more than a total of 1000 hooks including 
hooks on board the vessel and hooks being fished and cannot possess more 
than 750 hooks rigged for fishing at any given time. For the purpose of 
this paragraph, ``hooks rigged for fishing'' means hooks attached to a 
line or other device capable of attaching to the mainline of the 
longline.

<R05>
Sec. 622.35  Atlantic EEZ seasonal and/or area closures.

    (a) Allowable octocoral closed area. No person may harvest or 
possess allowable octocoral in the South Atlantic EEZ north of 
28[deg]35.1[min] N. lat. (due east of the NASA Vehicle Assembly 
Building, Cape Canaveral, FL).
    (b) Longline closed areas. A longline may not be used to fish in the 
EEZ for South Atlantic snapper-grouper south of 27[deg]10[min] N. lat. 
(due east of the entrance to St. Lucie Inlet, FL); or north of 
27[deg]10[min] N. lat. where the charted depth is less than 50 fathoms 
(91.4 m), as shown on the latest edition of the largest scale NOAA chart 
of the location. A person aboard a vessel with a longline on board that 
fishes on a trip in the South Atlantic EEZ south of 27[deg]10[min] N. 
lat., or north of 27[deg]10[min] N. lat. where the charted depth is less 
than 50 fathoms (91.4 m), is limited on that trip to the

[[Page 279]]

bag limit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper for which a bag limit is 
specified in Sec. 622.39(d)(1), and to zero for all other South 
Atlantic snapper-grouper. For the purpose of this paragraph, a vessel is 
considered to have a longline on board when a power-operated longline 
hauler, a cable or monofilament of diameter and length suitable for use 
in the longline fishery, and gangions are on board. Removal of any one 
of these three elements constitutes removal of a longline.
    (c) Oculina Bank--(1) HAPC. The Oculina Bank HAPC encompasses an 
area bounded on the north by 28[deg]30[min] N. lat., on the south by 
27[deg]30[min] N. lat., on the east by the 100-fathom (183-m) contour, 
as shown on the latest edition of NOAA chart 11460, and on the west by 
80[deg]00[min] W. long.; and two adjacent areas: the first bounded on 
the north by 28[deg]30[min] N. lat., on the south by 28[deg]29[min] N. 
lat., on the east by 80[deg]00[min] W. long., and on the west by 
80[deg]03[min] W. long.; and the second bounded on the north by 
28[deg]17[min] N. lat., on the south by 28[deg]16[min] N. lat., on the 
east by 80[deg]00[min] W. long., and on the west by 80[deg]03[min] W. 
long. In the Oculina Bank HAPC, no person may:
    (i) Use a bottom longline, bottom trawl, dredge, pot, or trap.
    (ii) If aboard a fishing vessel, anchor, use an anchor and chain, or 
use a grapple and chain.
    (iii) Fish for rock shrimp or possess rock shrimp in or from the 
area on board a fishing vessel.
    (2) Experimental closed area. Within the Oculina Bank HAPC, the 
experimental closed area is bounded on the north by 27[deg]53[min] N. 
lat., on the south by 27[deg]30[min] N. lat., on the east by 
79[deg]56[min] W. long., and on the west by 80[deg]00[min] W. long. No 
person may fish for South Atlantic snapper-grouper in the experimental 
closed area, and no person may retain South Atlantic snapper-grouper in 
or from the area. In the experimental closed area, any South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper taken incidentally by hook-and-line gear must be 
released immediately by cutting the line without removing the fish from 
the water.
    (d) South Atlantic shrimp cold weather closure. (1) Pursuant to the 
procedures and criteria established in the FMP for the Shrimp Fishery of 
the South Atlantic Region, when Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, or 
South Carolina closes all or a portion of its waters of the South 
Atlantic to the harvest of brown, pink, and white shrimp, the Assistant 
Administrator may concurrently close the South Atlantic EEZ adjacent to 
the closed state waters by filing a notification of closure with the 
Office of the Federal Register. Closure of the adjacent EEZ will be 
effective until the ending date of the closure in state waters, but may 
be ended earlier based on the state's request. In the latter case, the 
Assistant Administrator will terminate a closure of the EEZ by filing a 
notification to that effect with the Office of the Federal Register.
    (2) During a closure, as specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section--
    (i) No person may trawl for brown shrimp, pink shrimp, or white 
shrimp in the closed portion of the EEZ (closed area); and no person may 
possess on board a fishing vessel brown shrimp, pink shrimp, or white 
shrimp in or from a closed area, except as authorized in paragraph 
(d)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (ii) No person aboard a vessel trawling in that part of a closed 
area that is within 25 nm of the baseline from which the territorial sea 
is measured may use or have on board a trawl net with a mesh size less 
than 4 inches (10.2 cm), as measured between the centers of opposite 
knots when pulled taut.
    (iii) Brown shrimp, pink shrimp, or white shrimp may be possessed on 
board a fishing vessel in a closed area, provided the vessel is in 
transit and all trawl nets with a mesh size less than 4 inches (10.2 
cm), as measured between the centers of opposite knots when pulled taut, 
are stowed below deck while transiting the closed area. For the purpose 
of this paragraph, a vessel is in transit when it is on a direct and 
continuous course through a closed area.

    (f) Golden crab trap closed areas. In the golden crab northern zone, 
a golden crab trap may not be deployed in waters less than 900 ft (274 
m) deep. In the golden crab middle and southern zones, a golden crab 
trap may not be deployed in waters less than 700 ft (213 m) deep. See 
Sec. 622.17(b) for specification of the golden crab zones.
    (g) Pelagic sargassum area and seasonal restrictions--(1) Area 
limitations. (i) No person may harvest pelagic sargassum in the South 
Atlantic EEZ between 36[deg]33[min]01.0[sec] N. lat. (directly east from 
the Virginia/North Carolina boundary) and 34[deg] N. lat., within 100 
nautical miles east of the North Carolina coast.
    (ii) No person may harvest or possess pelagic sargassum in or from 
the South Atlantic EEZ south of 34[deg] N. lat.
    (2) Seasonal limitation. No person may harvest or possess pelagic 
sargassum in or from the South Atlantic EEZ during the months of July 
through October. This prohibition on possession does not apply to 
pelagic sargassum that was harvested and landed ashore prior to the 
closed period.
    (h) Dolphin/wahoo closed areas. (1) If pelagic longline gear is on 
board a vessel, a person aboard such vessel may not fish for or retain a 
dolphin or wahoo--
    (i) In the Northeastern United States closed area from June 1 
through June 30 each year. The Northeastern United States closed area is 
that portion of the EEZ between 40[deg] N. lat. and 39[deg] N. lat. from 
68[deg] W. long. to 74[deg] W. long.
    (ii) In the Charleston Bump closed area from February 1 through 
April 30 each year. The Charleston Bump closed area is that portion of 
the EEZ off North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia between 34[deg] 
N. lat. and 31[deg] N. lat. and west of 76[deg] W. long.
    (iii) In the East Florida Coast closed area year round. The East 
Florida Coast closed area is that portion of the EEZ off Georgia and the 
east coast of Florida from the inner boundary of the EEZ at 31[deg] N. 
lat.; thence due east to 78[deg] W. long.; thence by a rhumb line to 
28[deg]17[min] N. lat., 79[deg]12[min] W. long.; thence proceeding in a 
southerly direction along the outer boundary of the EEZ to 24[deg] N.

[[Page 283]]

lat.; thence due west to 24[deg] N. lat., 81[deg]47[min] W. long.; 
thence due north to the innermost boundary of the EEZ at 81[deg]47[min] 
W. long.
    (2) A vessel is considered to have pelagic longline gear on board 
when a power-operated longline hauler, a mainline, floats capable of 
supporting the mainline, and gangions with hooks are on board. Removal 
of any one of these elements constitutes removal of pelagic longline 
gear.
    (3) If a vessel is in a closed area during a time specified in 
paragraph (h)(1) of this section with pelagic longline gear on board, it 
is a rebuttable presumption that fish on board such vessel were taken 
with pelagic longline gear in the closed area.
    (i) MPAs. (1) No person may fish for a South Atlantic snapper-
grouper in an MPA, and no person may possess a South Atlantic snapper-
grouper in an MPA. However, the prohibition on possession does not apply 
to a person aboard a vessel that is in transit with fishing gear 
appropriately stowed as specified in paragraph (i)(2) of this section. 
In addition to these restrictions, see Sec. 635.21(d)(1)(iii) of this 
chapter regarding restrictions applicable within these MPAs for any 
vessel issued a permit under part 635 of this chapter that has longline 
gear on board. MPAs consist of deepwater areas as follows:

    (2) For the purpose of paragraph (i)(1) of this section, transit 
means direct, non-stop progression through the MPA. Fishing gear 
appropriately stowed means--
    (i) A longline may be left on the drum if all gangions and hooks are 
disconnected and stowed below deck. Hooks cannot be baited. All buoys 
must be disconnected from the gear; however, buoys may remain on deck.

[[Page 284]]

    (ii) A trawl or try net may remain on deck, but trawl doors must be 
disconnected from such net and must be secured.
    (iii) A gillnet, stab net, or trammel net must be left on the drum. 
Any additional such nets not attached to the drum must be stowed below 
deck.
    (iv) Terminal gear (i.e., hook, leader, sinker, flasher, or bait) 
used with an automatic reel, bandit gear, buoy gear, handline, or rod 
and reel must be disconnected and stowed separately from such fishing 
gear. A rod and reel must be removed from the rod holder and stowed 
securely on or below deck.
    (v) A crustacean trap, golden crab trap, or sea bass pot cannot be 
baited. All buoys must be disconnected from the gear; however, buoys may 
remain on deck.
    (j) Seasonal closure of the recreational and commercial fisheries 
for gag and associated grouper species. During January through April 
each year, no person may fish for, harvest, or possess in or from the 
South Atlantic EEZ any SASWG (gag, black grouper, red grouper, scamp, 
red hind, rock hind, yellowmouth grouper, yellowfin grouper, graysby, 
and coney). In addition, for a person on board a vessel for which a 
valid Federal commercial or charter vessel/headboat permit for South 
Atlantic snapper-grouper has been issued, the provisions of this closure 
apply in the South Atlantic, regardless of where such fish are 
harvested, i.e., in state or Federal waters.
    (k) Seasonal closure of the recreational fishery for vermilion 
snapper. The recreational fishery for vermilion snapper in or from the 
South Atlantic EEZ is closed from November 1 through March 31, each 
year. In addition, for a person on board a vessel for which a valid 
Federal charter vessel/headboat permit for South Atlantic snapper-
grouper has been issued, this closure applies in the South Atlantic, 
regardless of where the fish are harvested, i.e., in state or Federal 
waters. During the closure, the bag and possession limit for vermilion 
snapper in or from the South Atlantic EEZ is zero.
    (l) Closures of the commercial and recreational sectors for red 
snapper. The commercial and recreational sectors for red snapper are 
closed, except for a limited commercial season (7-day or less openings) 
and a limited recreational season (weekends consisting of Fridays, 
Saturdays, and Sundays only) determined by the RA. The Southeast 
Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) will monitor commercial landings in-
season to determine if the ACL has been harvested. If the SEFSC 
determined the ACL has not been harvested in the first 7-day opening, 
the RA may reopen the commercial sector for an additional limited time. 
If severe weather conditions exist, the RA may modify the opening and 
closing dates. The RA will determine when severe weather conditions 
exist, the duration of the severe weather conditions, and which 
geographic areas are deemed affected by severe weather conditions. If 
severe weather conditions exist or if NMFS determines a reopening of the 
commercial sector is possible, the RA will file a notification to that 
effect with the Office of the Federal Register, and announce via NOAA 
Weather Radio and Fishery Bulletin any change in the red snapper fishing 
seasons.
    (m) Atlantic EEZ area closure related to Deepwater Horizon oil 
spill. Effective May 11, 2010, all fishing is prohibited in the portion 
of the South Atlantic EEZ identified in the map shown on the NMFS Web 
site: http://sero.nmfs.noaa.gov/deepwater--horizon--oil--spill.htm.

Sec. 622.38  Landing fish intact.

    The operator of a vessel that fishes in the EEZ is responsible for 
ensuring that fish on that vessel in the EEZ are maintained intact and, 
if taken from the EEZ, are maintained intact through offloading ashore, 
as specified in this section.
    (a) The following must be maintained with head and fins intact: 
cobia, king mackerel, and Spanish mackerel in or from the Gulf, Mid-
Atlantic, or South Atlantic EEZ, except as specified for king mackerel 
in paragraph (g) of this section; dolphin and wahoo in or from the 
Atlantic EEZ; South Atlantic snapper-grouper in or from the South 
Atlantic EEZ, except as specified in paragraph (h) of this section; 
finfish in or from the Caribbean EEZ, except as specified in paragraphs 
(c) and (d) of this section; and finfish in or from the Gulf EEZ, except 
as specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. Such fish may be 
eviscerated, gilled, and scaled, but must otherwise be maintained in a 
whole condition.
    (b) A Caribbean spiny lobster in or from the Caribbean EEZ must be 
maintained with head and carapace intact.
    (c) Shark, swordfish, and tuna species are exempt from the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) In the Gulf EEZ or Caribbean EEZ:
    (1) Bait is exempt from the requirement to be maintained with head 
and fins intact. See Sec. 622.31(n) regarding a prohibition on the use 
of Gulf reef fish as bait.
    (i) For the purpose of this paragraph (d)(1), ``bait'' means--
    (A) Packaged, headless fish fillets that have the skin attached and 
are frozen or refrigerated;
    (B) Headless fish fillets that have the skin attached and are held 
in brine; or
    (C) Small pieces no larger than 3 in3 (7.6 cm3) or strips no larger 
than 3 inches by 9 inches (7.6 cm by 22.9 cm) that have the skin 
attached and are frozen, refrigerated, or held in brine.
    (ii) Paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section notwithstanding, a finfish 
or part thereof possessed in or landed from the Gulf EEZ or Caribbean 
EEZ that is subsequently sold or purchased as a finfish species, rather 
than as bait, is not bait.

[[Page 292]]

    (2) Legal-sized finfish possessed for consumption at sea on the 
harvesting vessel are exempt from the requirement to have head and fins 
intact, provided--
    (i) Such finfish do not exceed any applicable bag limit;
    (ii) Such finfish do not exceed 1.5 lb (680 g) of finfish parts per 
person aboard; and
    (iii) The vessel is equipped to cook such finfish on board.
    (e) A golden crab in or from the South Atlantic EEZ must be 
maintained in whole condition through landing ashore. For the purposes 
of this paragraph, whole means a crab that is in its natural condition 
and that has not been gutted or separated into component pieces, e.g., 
clusters.
    (f) Queen conch in or from the Caribbean EEZ must be maintained with 
meat and shell intact.
    (g) Cut-off (damaged) king or Spanish mackerel that comply with the 
minimum size limits in Sec. 622.37(c)(2) and (c)(3), respectively, and 
the trip limits in Sec. 622.44(a) and (b), respectively, may be 
possessed in the Gulf, Mid-Atlantic, or South Atlantic EEZ on, and 
offloaded ashore from, a vessel that is operating under the respective 
trip limits. Such cut-off fish also may be sold. A maximum of five 
additional cut-off (damaged) king mackerel, not subject to the size 
limits or trip limits, may be possessed or offloaded ashore but may not 
be sold or purchased and are not counted against the trip limit.
    (h) In the South Atlantic EEZ, snapper-grouper lawfully harvested in 
Bahamian waters are exempt from the requirement that they be maintained 
with head and fins intact, provided valid Bahamian fishing and cruising 
permits are on board the vessel and the vessel is in transit through the 
South Atlantic EEZ. For the purpose of this paragraph, a vessel is in 
transit through the South Atlantic EEZ when it is on a direct and 
continuous course through the South Atlantic EEZ and no one aboard the 
vessel fishes in the EEZ.

<R05>
Sec. 622.39  Bag and possession limits.

    (a) Applicability. (1) The bag and possession limits apply for 
species/species groups listed in this section in or from the EEZ. Unless 
specified otherwise, bag limits apply to a person on a daily basis, 
regardless of the number of trips in a day. Unless specified otherwise, 
possession limits apply to a person on a trip after the first 24 hours 
of that trip. The bag and possession limits apply to a person who fishes 
in the EEZ in any manner, except a person aboard a vessel in the EEZ 
that has on board the commercial vessel permit required under Sec. 
622.4(a)(2) for the appropriate species/species group. However, see 
Sec. 622.32 for limitations on taking prohibited and limited-harvest 
species. The limitations in Sec. 622.32 apply without regard to whether 
the species is harvested by a vessel operating under a commercial vessel 
permit or by a person subject to the bag limits. The possession of a 
commercial vessel permit notwithstanding, the bag and possession limits 
apply when the vessel is operating as a charter vessel or headboat. A 
person who fishes in the EEZ may not combine a bag limit specified in 
this section with a bag or possession limit applicable to state waters. 
A species/species group subject to a bag limit specified in this section 
taken in the EEZ by a person subject to the bag limits may not be 
transferred at sea, regardless of where such transfer takes place, and 
such fish may not be transferred in the EEZ. The operator of a vessel 
that fishes in the EEZ is responsible for ensuring that the bag and 
possession limits specified in this section are not exceeded.
    (2) Paragraph (a)(1) of this section notwithstanding, bag and 
possession limits also apply for Gulf reef fish in or

[[Page 293]]

from the EEZ to a person aboard a vessel that has on board a commercial 
permit for Gulf reef fish--
    (i) When trawl gear or entangling net gear is on board. A vessel is 
considered to have trawl gear on board when trawl doors and a net are on 
board. Removal from the vessel of all trawl doors or all nets 
constitutes removal of trawl gear.
    (ii) When a longline or buoy gear is on board and the vessel is 
fishing or has fished on a trip in the reef fish longline and buoy gear 
restricted area specified in Sec. 622.34(c). A vessel is considered to 
have a longline on board when a power-operated longline hauler, a cable 
of diameter and length suitable for use in the longline fishery, and 
gangions are on board. Removal of any one of these three elements, in 
its entirety, constitutes removal of a longline.
    (iii) For a species/species group when its quota has been reached 
and closure has been effected, provided that no commercial quantities of 
Gulf reef fish, i.e., Gulf reef fish in excess of applicable bag/
possession limits, are on board as specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this 
section.
    (iv) When the vessel has on board or is tending any trap other than 
a stone crab trap or a spiny lobster trap.
    (3) Paragraph (a)(1) of this section notwithstanding, the bag and 
other limits specified in Sec. 622.35(b) apply for South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper in or from the EEZ to a person aboard a vessel for which 
a commercial permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper has been issued 
that has on board a longline in the longline closed area.
    (4) Paragraph (a)(1) of this section notwithstanding, a person 
aboard a vessel for which a commercial permit for South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper has been issued must comply with the bag limits 
specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section for South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper taken with a powerhead, regardless of where taken, when 
such snapper-grouper are possessed in an SMZ specified in Sec. 
622.35(e)(1)(xii) through (e)(1)(xviii) or (e)(1)(xl) through 
(e)(1)(li).
    (5) A person aboard a vessel that has a Federal commercial vessel 
permit for Gulf reef fish and commercial quantities of Gulf reef fish, 
i.e., Gulf reef fish in excess of applicable bag/possession limits, may 
not possess Gulf reef fish caught under a bag limit.
    (b) Gulf reef fish--(1) Bag limits. (i) Greater amberjack--1. 
However, no greater amberjack may be retained by the captain or crew of 
a vessel operating as a charter vessel or headboat. The bag limit for 
such captain and crew is zero.
    (ii) Groupers, combined, excluding goliath grouper and Nassau 
grouper--4 per person per day, but not to exceed 1 speckled hind or 1 
warsaw grouper per vessel per day, or 2 gag per person per day. However, 
no grouper may be retained by the captain or crew of a vessel operating 
as a charter vessel or headboat. The bag limit for such captain and crew 
is zero.
    (iii) Red snapper--2. However, no red snapper may be retained by the 
captain or crew of a vessel operating as a charter vessel or headboat.

snapper--10.
    (v) Gulf reef fish, combined, excluding those specified in 
paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iv) and paragraphs (b)(1)(vi) 
through (b)(1)(vii) of this section--20.
    (vi) Banded rudderfish and lesser amberjack, combined--5.
    (vii) Hogfish--5.
    (2) Possession limits. A person, or a vessel in the case of speckled 
hind or Warsaw grouper, on a trip that spans more than 24 hours may 
possess no more than two daily bag limits, provided such trip is on a 
vessel that is operating as a charter vessel or headboat, the vessel has 
two licensed operators aboard, and each passenger is issued and has in 
possession a receipt issued on behalf of the vessel that verifies the 
length of the trip.
    (c) King and Spanish mackerel--(1) Bag limits. (i) Atlantic 
migratory group king mackerel--
    (A) Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic, other than off Florida--3.
    (B) Off Florida--2, which is the daily bag limit specified by

If Florida changes its limit, the bag limit specified in this paragraph 
(c)(1)(i)(B) will be changed

[[Page 294]]

to conform to Florida's limit, provided such limit does not exceed 5.
    (ii) Gulf migratory group king mackerel--2.
    (iii) Atlantic migratory group Spanish mackerel--15.
    (iv) Gulf migratory group Spanish mackerel--15.
    (2) Possession limits. A person who is on a trip that spans more

headboat, the vessel has two licensed operators aboard, and each 
passenger is issued and has in possession a receipt issued on behalf of 
the vessel that verifies the length of the trip.
    (d) South Atlantic snapper-grouper--(1) Bag limits. (i) Greater 
amberjack--1.

Sec. 622.40  Limitations on traps and pots.

    (a) Tending--(1) Caribbean EEZ. A fish trap or Caribbean spiny 
lobster trap in the Caribbean EEZ may be pulled or tended only by a 
person (other than an authorized officer) aboard the fish trap or spiny 
lobster trap owner's vessel, or aboard another vessel if such vessel has 
on board written consent of the trap owner, or if the trap owner is 
aboard and has documentation verifying his identification number and 
color code. An owner's written consent must specify the time period such 
consent is effective and the trap owner's gear identification number and 
color code.

[[Page 296]]

    (2) South Atlantic EEZ. A sea bass pot or golden crab trap in the 
South Atlantic EEZ may be pulled or tended only by a person (other than 
an authorized officer) aboard the vessel permitted to fish such pot or 
trap or aboard another vessel if such vessel has on board written 
consent of the owner or operator of the vessel so permitted. For golden 
crab only, a vessel with written consent on board must also possess a 
valid commercial vessel permit for golden crab.
    (b) Escape mechanisms--(1) Caribbean EEZ. (i) A fish trap used or 
possessed in the Caribbean EEZ must have a panel located on one side of 
the trap, excluding the top, bottom, and side containing the trap 
entrance. The opening covered by the panel must measure not less than 8 
by 8 inches (20.3 by 20.3 cm). The mesh size of the panel may not be 
smaller than the mesh size of the trap. The panel must be attached to 
the trap with untreated jute twine with a diameter not exceeding \1/8\ 
inch (3.2 mm). An access door may serve as the panel, provided it is on 
an appropriate side, it is hinged only at its bottom, its only other 
fastening is untreated jute twine with a diameter not exceeding \1/8\ 
inch (3.2 mm), and such fastening is at the top of the door so that the 
door will fall open when such twine degrades. Jute twine used to secure 
a panel may not be wrapped or overlapped.
    (ii) A spiny lobster trap used or possessed in the Caribbean EEZ 
must contain on any vertical side or on the top a panel no smaller in 
diameter than the throat or entrance of the trap. The panel must be made 
of or attached to the trap by one of the following degradable materials:
    (A) Untreated fiber of biological origin with a diameter not 
exceeding \1/8\ inch (3.2 mm). This includes, but is not limited to tyre 
palm, hemp, jute, cotton, wool, or silk.
    (B) Ungalvanized or uncoated iron wire with a diameter not exceeding 
\1/16\ inch (1.6 mm), that is, 16 gauge wire.
    (2) South Atlantic EEZ. (i) A sea bass pot that is used or possessed 
in the South Atlantic EEZ between 35[deg]15.19[min] N. lat. (due east of 
Cape Hatteras Light, NC) and 28[deg]35.1[min] N. lat. (due east of the 
NASA Vehicle Assembly Building, Cape Canaveral, FL) is required to 
have--
    (A) On at least one side, excluding top and bottom, a panel or door 
with an opening equal to or larger than the interior end of the trap's 
throat (funnel). The hinges and fasteners of each panel or door must be 
made of one of the following degradable materials:
    (1) Ungalvanized or uncoated iron wire with a diameter not exceeding 
0.041 inches (1.0 mm), that is, 19 gauge wire.
    (2) Galvanic timed-release mechanisms with a letter grade 
designation (degradability index) no higher than J.
    (B) An unobstructed escape vent opening on at least two opposite 
vertical sides, excluding top and bottom. The minimum dimensions of an 
escape vent opening (based on inside measurement) are:
    (1) 1\1/8\ by 5\3/4\ inches (2.9 by 14.6 cm) for a rectangular vent.
    (2) 1.75 by 1.75 inches (4.5 by 4.5 cm) for a square vent.
    (3) 2.0-inch (5.1-cm) diameter for a round vent.
    (ii) A golden crab trap that is used or possessed in the South 
Atlantic EEZ must have at least one escape gap or escape ring on each of 
two opposite vertical sides. The minimum allowable inside dimensions of 
an escape gap are 2.75 by 3.75 inches (7.0 by 9.5 cm); the minimum 
allowable inside diameter of an escape ring is 4.5 inches (11.4 cm). In 
addition to the escape gaps--
    (A) A golden crab trap constructed of webbing must have an opening 
(slit) at least 1 ft (30.5 cm) long that may be closed (relaced) only 
with untreated cotton string no larger than \3/16\ inch (0.48 cm) in 
diameter.
    (B) A golden crab trap constructed of material other than webbing 
must have an escape panel or door measuring at least 11\7/8\ by 11\7/8\ 
inches (30.2 by 30.2 cm), located on at least one side, excluding top 
and bottom. The hinges or fasteners of such door or panel must be made 
of either ungalvanized or uncoated iron wire no larger than 19 gauge 
(0.04 inch (1.0 mm) in diameter) or untreated cotton string no larger 
than \3/16\ inch (4.8 mm) in diameter.
    (c) Construction requirements and mesh sizes--(1) Caribbean EEZ. A 
bare-wire fish trap used or possessed in the EEZ

[[Page 297]]

that has hexagonal mesh openings must have a minimum mesh size of 1.5 
inches (3.8 cm) in the smallest dimension measured between centers of 
opposite strands. A bare-wire fish trap used or possessed in the EEZ 
that has other than hexagonal mesh openings or a fish trap of other than 
bare wire, such as coated wire or plastic, used or possessed in the EEZ, 
must have a minimum mesh size of 2.0 inches (5.1 cm) in the smallest 
dimension measured between centers of opposite strands.
    (2) South Atlantic EEZ. (i) A sea bass pot used or possessed in the 
South Atlantic EEZ must have mesh sizes as follows (based on centerline 
measurements between opposite, parallel wires or netting strands):
    (A) For sides of the pot other than the back panel:
    (1) Hexagonal mesh (chicken wire)--at least 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) 
between the wrapped sides;
    (2) Square mesh--at least 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) between sides; or
    (3) Rectangular mesh--at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) between the longer 
sides and 2 inches (5.1 cm) between the shorter sides.
    (B) For the entire back panel, i.e., the side of the pot opposite 
the side that contains the pot entrance, mesh that is at least 2 inches 
(5.1 cm) between sides.
    (ii) A golden crab trap deployed or possessed in the South Atlantic 
EEZ may not exceed 64 ft\3\ (1.8 m\3\) in volume in the northern zone or 
48 ft\3\ (1.4 m\3\) in volume in the middle and southern zones. See 
Sec. 622.17(b) for specification of the golden crab zones.
    (d) Area-specific restrictions--(1) South Atlantic EEZ--(i) Sea bass 
pots. (A) In the South Atlantic EEZ, sea bass pots may not be used or 
possessed in multiple configurations, that is, two or more pots may not 
be attached one to another so that their overall dimensions exceed those 
allowed for an individual sea bass pot. This does not preclude 
connecting individual pots to a line, such as a ``trawl'' or trot line.
    (B) A sea bass pot must be removed from the water in the South 
Atlantic EEZ and the vessel must be returned to a dock, berth, beach, 
seawall, or ramp at the conclusion of each trip. Sea bass pots may 
remain on the vessel at the conclusion of each trip.
    (C) A sea bass pot must be removed from the water in the South 
Atlantic EEZ when the applicable quota specified in Sec. 622.42(e)(5) 
is reached. After a closure is in effect, a black sea bass may not be 
retained by a vessel that has a sea bass pot on board.
    (D) A vessel that has on board a valid Federal commercial permit for 
South Atlantic snapper-grouper and a South Atlantic black sea bass pot 
endorsement that fishes in the South Atlantic EEZ on a trip with black 
sea bass pots, may possess only 35 black sea bass pots per vessel per 
permit year. Each black sea bass pot in the water or onboard a vessel in 
the South Atlantic EEZ, must have a valid identification tag issued by 
NMFS attached. NMFS will issue new identification tags each permit year 
that will replace the tags from the previous permit year.
    (ii) Golden crab traps. Rope is the only material allowed to be used 
for a buoy line or mainline attached to a golden crab trap.
    (2) [Reserved]

Sec. 622.41  Species specific limitations.

    (a) Aquacultured live rock. In the Gulf or South Atlantic EEZ:
    (1) Aquacultured live rock may be harvested only under a permit, as 
required under Sec. 622.4(a)(3)(iii), and aquacultured live rock on a 
site may be harvested only by the person, or his or her employee, 
contractor, or agent, who has been issued the aquacultured live rock 
permit for the site. A person harvesting aquacultured live rock is 
exempt from the prohibition on taking prohibited coral for such 
prohibited coral as attaches to aquacultured live rock.
    (2) The following restrictions apply to individual aquaculture 
activities:
    (i) No aquaculture site may exceed 1 acre (0.4 ha) in size.
    (ii) Material deposited on the aquaculture site--

[[Page 298]]

    (A) May not be placed over naturally occurring reef outcrops, 
limestone ledges, coral reefs, or vegetated areas.
    (B) Must be free of contaminants.
    (C) Must be nontoxic.
    (D) Must be placed on the site by hand or lowered completely to the 
bottom under restraint, that is, not allowed to fall freely.
    (E) Must be placed from a vessel that is anchored.
    (F) In the Gulf EEZ, must be distinguishable, geologically or 
otherwise (for example, be indelibly marked or tagged), from the 
naturally occurring substrate.
    (G) In the South Atlantic EEZ, must be geologically distinguishable 
from the naturally occurring substrate and, in addition, may be 
indelibly marked or tagged.
    (iii) A minimum setback of at least 50 ft (15.2 m) must be 
maintained from natural vegetated or hard bottom habitats.
    (3) Mechanically dredging or drilling, or otherwise disturbing, 
aquacultured live rock is prohibited, and aquacultured live rock may be 
harvested only by hand. In addition, the following activities are 
prohibited in the South Atlantic: Chipping of aquacultured live rock in 
the EEZ, possession of chipped aquacultured live rock in or from the 
EEZ, removal of allowable octocoral or prohibited coral from 
aquacultured live rock in or from the EEZ, and possession of prohibited 
coral not attached to aquacultured live rock or allowable octocoral, 
while aquacultured live rock is in possession. See the definition of 
``Allowable octocoral'' for clarification of the distinction between 
allowable octocoral and live rock. For the purposes of this paragraph 
(a)(3), chipping means breaking up reefs, ledges, or rocks into 
fragments, usually by means of a chisel and hammer.
    (4) Not less than 24 hours prior to harvest of aquacultured live 
rock, the owner or operator of the harvesting vessel must provide the 
following information to the NMFS Office for Law Enforcement, Southeast 
Region, St. Petersburg, FL, by telephone (727-824-5344):
    (i) Permit number of site to be harvested and date of harvest.
    (ii) Name and official number of the vessel to be used in 
harvesting.
    (iii) Date, port, and facility at which aquacultured live rock will 
be landed.
    (b) Caribbean reef fish anchoring restriction. The owner or operator 
of any fishing vessel, recreational or commercial, that fishes for or 
possesses Caribbean reef fish in or from the Caribbean EEZ must ensure 
that the vessel uses only an anchor retrieval system that recovers the 
anchor by its crown, thereby preventing the anchor from dragging along 
the bottom during recovery. For a grapnel hook, this could include an 
incorporated anchor rode reversal bar that runs parallel along the 
shank, which allows the rode to reverse and slip back toward the crown. 
For a fluke- or plow-type anchor, a trip line consisting of a line from 
the crown of the anchor to a surface buoy would be required.
    (c) Coastal migratory pelagic fish--(1) Authorized gear. Subject to 
the prohibitions on gear/methods specified in Sec. 622.31, the 
following are the only fishing gears that may be used in the Gulf, Mid-
Atlantic, and South Atlantic EEZ in directed fisheries for coastal 
migratory pelagic fish:
    (i) King mackerel, Atlantic migratory group--
    (A) North of 34[deg]37.3[min] N. lat., the latitude of Cape Lookout 
Light, NC--all gear except drift gillnet and long gillnet.
    (B) South of 34[deg]37.3[min] N. lat.--automatic reel, bandit gear, 
handline, and rod and reel.
    (ii) King mackerel, Gulf migratory group--hook-and-line gear and, in 
the southern Florida west coast subzone only, run-around gillnet. (See 
Sec. 622.42(c)(1)(i)(A)(3) for a description of the southern Florida 
west coast subzone.)
    (iii) Spanish mackerel, Atlantic migratory group--automatic reel, 
bandit gear, handline, rod and reel, cast net, run-around gillnet, and 
stab net.
    (iv) Spanish mackerel, Gulf migratory group--all gear except drift 
gillnet, long gillnet, and purse seine.
    (v) Cobia in the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic EEZ--automatic 
reel, bandit gear, handline, rod and reel, and pelagic longline.

[[Page 299]]

    (vi) Cobia in the Gulf EEZ--all gear except drift gillnet and long 
gillnet.
    (2) Unauthorized gear. Gear types other than those specified in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section are unauthorized gear and the following 
possession limitations apply:
    (i) Long gillnets. A vessel with a long gillnet on board in, or that 
has fished on a trip in, the Gulf, Mid-Atlantic, or South Atlantic EEZ 
may not have on board on that trip a coastal migratory pelagic fish.
    (ii) Drift gillnets. A vessel with a drift gillnet on board in, or 
that has fished on a trip in, the Gulf EEZ may not have on board on that 
trip a coastal migratory pelagic fish.
    (iii) Other unauthorized gear. Except as specified in paragraph 
(c)(2)(iv) of this section, a person aboard a vessel with unauthorized 
gear other than a drift gillnet in the Gulf EEZ or a long gillnet on 
board in, or that has fished in, the EEZ where such gear is not 
authorized in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, is subject to the bag 
limit for king and Spanish mackerel specified in Sec. 622.39(c)(1)(ii) 
and to the limit on cobia specified in Sec. 622.32(c)(1).
    (iv) Exception for king mackerel in the Gulf EEZ. The provisions of 
this paragraph (c)(2)(iv) apply to king mackerel taken in the Gulf EEZ 
and to such king mackerel possessed in the Gulf. Paragraph (c)(2)(iii) 
of this section notwithstanding, a person aboard a vessel that has a 
valid commercial permit for king mackerel is not subject to the bag 
limit for king mackerel when the vessel has on board on a trip 
unauthorized gear other than a drift gillnet in the Gulf EEZ, a long 
gillnet, or a run-around gillnet in an area other than the southern 
Florida west coast subzone. Thus, the following applies to a vessel that 
has a commercial permit for king mackerel:
    (A) Such vessel may not use unauthorized gear in a directed fishery 
for king mackerel in the Gulf EEZ.
    (B) If such a vessel has a drift gillnet or a long gillnet on board 
or a run-around gillnet in an area other than the southern Florida west 
coast subzone, no king mackerel may be possessed.
    (C) If such a vessel has unauthorized gear on board other than a 
drift gillnet in the Gulf EEZ, a long gillnet, or a run-around gillnet 
in an area other than the southern Florida west coast subzone, the 
possession of king mackerel taken incidentally is restricted only by the 
closure provisions of Sec. 622.43(a)(3) and the trip limits specified 
in Sec. 622.44(a). See also paragraph (c)(4) of this section regarding 
the purse seine incidental catch allowance of king mackerel.
    (3) Gillnets--(i) King mackerel. The minimum allowable mesh size for 
a gillnet used to fish in the Gulf, Mid-Atlantic, or South Atlantic EEZ 
for king mackerel is 4.75 inches (12.1 cm), stretched mesh. A vessel in 
such EEZ, or having fished on a trip in such EEZ, with a gillnet on 
board that has a mesh size less than 4.75 (12.1 cm) inches, stretched 
mesh, may not possess on that trip an incidental catch of king mackerel 
that exceeds 10 percent, by number, of the total lawfully possessed 
Spanish mackerel on board.
    (ii) Spanish mackerel. (A) The minimum allowable mesh size for a 
gillnet used to fish for Spanish mackerel in the Gulf, Mid-Atlantic, or 
South Atlantic EEZ is 3.5 inches (8.9 cm), stretched mesh.
    (1) A vessel in the Gulf EEZ, or having fished on a trip in the Gulf 
EEZ, with a gillnet on board that has a mesh size less than 3.5 inches 
(8.9 cm), stretched mesh, may not possess on that trip any Spanish 
mackerel.
    (2) A vessel in the South Atlantic or Mid-Atlantic EEZ, or having 
fished on a trip in such EEZ, with a gillnet on board that has a mesh 
size less than 3.5 inches (8.9 cm), stretched mesh, may possess or land 
on the day of that trip no more than 500 lb (227 kg) of incidentally 
caught Spanish mackerel.
    (B) On board a vessel with a valid Spanish mackerel permit that is 
fishing for Spanish mackerel in, or that possesses Spanish mackerel in 
or from, the South Atlantic EEZ off Florida north of 25[deg]20.4[min] N. 
lat., which is a line directly east from the Miami-Dade/Monroe County, 
FL, boundary--
    (1) No person may fish with, set, place in the water, or have on 
board a gillnet with a float line longer than 800 yd (732 m).

[[Page 300]]

    (2) No person may fish with, set, or place in the water more than 
one gillnet at any one time.
    (3) No more than two gillnets, including any net in use, may be 
possessed at any one time; provided, however, that if two gillnets, 
including any net in use, are possessed at any one time, they must have 
stretched mesh sizes (as allowed under the regulations) that differ by 
at least .25 inch (.64 cm).
    (4) No person may soak a gillnet for more than 1 hour. The soak 
period begins when the first mesh is placed in the water and ends either 
when the first mesh is retrieved back on board the vessel or the 
gathering of the gillnet is begun to facilitate retrieval on board the 
vessel, whichever occurs first; providing that, once the first mesh is 
retrieved or the gathering is begun, the retrieval is continuous until 
the gillnet is completely removed from the water.
    (5) The float line of each gillnet possessed, including any net in 
use, must have the distinctive floats specified in Sec. 622.6(b)(2).
    (4) Purse seine incidental catch allowance. A vessel in the EEZ, or 
having fished in the EEZ, with a purse seine on board will not be 
considered as fishing, or having fished, for king or Spanish mackerel in 
violation of a prohibition of purse seines under paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section, in violation of the possession limits under paragraph 
(c)(2)(iii) of this section, or, in the case of king mackerel from the 
Atlantic migratory group, in violation of a closure effected in 
accordance with Sec. 622.43(a), provided the king mackerel on board 
does not exceed 1 percent, or the Spanish mackerel on board does not 
exceed 10 percent, of all fish on board the vessel. Incidental catch 
will be calculated by number and/or weight of fish. Neither calculation 
may exceed the allowable percentage. Incidentally caught king or Spanish 
mackerel are counted toward the quotas provided for under Sec. 
622.42(c) and are subject to the prohibition of sale under Sec. 
622.43(a)(3)(iii).
    (d) South Atlantic snapper-grouper--(1) Authorized gear. Subject to 
the gear restrictions specified in Sec. 622.31, the following are the 
only gear types authorized in a directed fishery for snapper-grouper in 
the South Atlantic EEZ: Bandit gear, bottom longline, buoy gear, 
handline, rod and reel, sea bass pot, and spearfishing gear.
    (2) Unauthorized gear. All gear types other than those specified in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section are unauthorized gear and the following 
possession and transfer limitations apply.
    (i) A vessel with trawl gear on board that fishes in the EEZ on a 
trip may possess no more than 200 lb (90.7 kg) of South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper, excluding wreckfish, in or from the EEZ on that trip. 
It is a rebuttable presumption that a vessel with more than 200 lb (90.7 
kg) of South Atlantic snapper-grouper, excluding wreckfish, on board 
harvested such fish in the EEZ.
    (ii) Except as specified in paragraphs (d)(3) through (d)(5) of this 
section, a person aboard a vessel with unauthorized gear on board, other 
than trawl gear, that fishes in the EEZ on a trip is limited on that 
trip to:
    (A) South Atlantic snapper-grouper species for which a bag limit is 
specified in Sec. 622.39(d)(1)--the bag limit.
    (B) All other South Atlantic snapper-grouper--zero.
    (iii) South Atlantic snapper-grouper on board a vessel with 
unauthorized gear on board may not be transferred at sea, regardless of 
where such transfer takes place, and such snapper-grouper may not be 
transferred in the EEZ.
    (iv) No vessel may receive at sea any South Atlantic snapper-grouper 
from a vessel with unauthorized gear on board, as specified in paragraph 
(d)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (3) Possession allowance regarding sink nets off North Carolina. A 
vessel that has on board a commercial permit for South Atlantic snapper-
grouper, excluding wreckfish, that fishes in the EEZ off North Carolina 
with a sink net on board, may retain, without regard to the limits 
specified in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, otherwise legal South 
Atlantic snapper-grouper taken with bandit gear, buoy gear, handline, 
rod and reel, or sea bass pot. For the purpose of this paragraph (d)(3), 
a sink net is a gillnet with stretched mesh measurements of 3 to 4.75 
inches (7.6 to 12.1 cm) that is attached to the vessel when deployed.

[[Page 301]]

    (4) Possession allowance regarding bait nets. A vessel that has on 
board a commercial permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper, excluding 
wreckfish, that fishes in the South Atlantic EEZ with no more than one 
bait net on board, may retain, without regard to the limits specified in 
paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, otherwise legal South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper taken with bandit gear, buoy gear, handline, rod and 
reel, or sea bass pot. For the purpose of this paragraph (d)(4), a bait 
net is a gillnet not exceeding 50 ft (15.2 m) in length or 10 ft (3.1 m) 
in height with stretched mesh measurements of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) or 
smaller that is attached to the vessel when deployed.
    (5) Possession allowance regarding cast nets. A vessel that has on 
board a commercial permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper, excluding 
wreckfish, that fishes in the South Atlantic EEZ with a cast net on 
board, may retain, without regard to the limits specified in paragraph 
(d)(2)(ii) of this section, otherwise legal South Atlantic snapper-
grouper taken with bandit gear, buoy gear, handline, rod and reel, or 
sea bass pot. For the purpose of this paragraph (d)(5), a cast net is a 
cone-shaped net thrown by hand and designed to spread out and capture 
fish as the weighted circumference sinks to the bottom and comes 
together when pulled by a line.
    (6) Longline species limitation. A vessel that has on board a valid 
Federal commercial permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper, excluding 
wreckfish, that fishes in the EEZ on a trip with a longline on board, 
may possess only the following South Atlantic snapper-grouper: snowy 
grouper, warsaw grouper, yellowedge grouper, misty grouper, golden 
tilefish, blueline tilefish, and sand tilefish. For the purpose of this 
paragraph, a vessel is considered to have a longline on board when a 
power-operated longline hauler, a cable of diameter suitable for use in 
the longline fishery on any reel, and gangions are on board. Removal of 
any one of these three elements constitutes removal of a longline.
    (e) South Atlantic golden crab. Traps are the only fishing gear 
authorized in directed fishing for golden crab in the South Atlantic 
EEZ. Golden crab in or from the South Atlantic EEZ may not be retained 
on board a vessel possessing or using unauthorized gear.
    (f) Caribbean queen conch. In the Caribbean EEZ, no person may 
harvest queen conch by diving while using a device that provides a 
continuous air supply from the surface.
    (g) BRD requirement for Gulf and South Atlantic shrimp. On a shrimp 
trawler in the Gulf EEZ or South Atlantic EEZ, each net that is rigged 
for fishing must have a BRD installed that is listed in paragraph (g)(2) 
of this section and is certified or provisionally certified for the area 
in which the shrimp trawler is located, unless exempted as specified in 
paragraphs (g)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section. A trawl net is rigged 
for fishing if it is in the water, or if it is shackled, tied, or 
otherwise connected to a sled, door, or other device that spreads the 
net, or to a tow rope, cable, pole, or extension, either on board or 
attached to a shrimp trawler.
    (1) Exemptions from BRD requirement--(i) Royal red shrimp exemption. 
A shrimp trawler is exempt from the requirement to have a certified or 
provisionally certified BRD installed in each net provided that at least 
90 percent (by weight) of all shrimp on board or offloaded from such 
trawler are royal red shrimp.
    (ii) Try net exemption. A shrimp trawler is exempt from the 
requirement to have a certified or provisionally certified BRD installed 
in a single try net with a headrope length of 16 ft (4.9 m) or less 
provided the single try net is either placed immediately in front of 
another net or is not connected to another net.
    (iii) Roller trawl exemption. A shrimp trawler is exempt from the 
requirement to have a certified or provisionally certified BRD installed 
in up to two rigid-frame roller trawls that are 16 ft (4.9 m) or less in 
length used or possessed on board. A rigid-frame roller trawl is a trawl 
that has a mouth formed by a rigid frame and a grid of rigid vertical 
bars; has rollers on the lower horizontal part of the frame to allow the 
trawl to roll over the bottom and any obstruction while being towed;

and has no doors, boards, or similar devices attached to keep the mouth 
of the trawl open.
    (iv) BRD certification testing exemption. A shrimp trawler that is 
authorized by the RA to participate in the pre-certification testing 
phase or to test a BRD in the EEZ for possible certification, has such 
written authorization on board, and is conducting such test in 
accordance with the ``Bycatch Reduction Device Testing Manual'' is 
granted a limited exemption from the BRD requirement specified in this 
paragraph (g). The exemption from the BRD requirement is limited to 
those trawls that are being used in the certification trials. All other 
trawls rigged for fishing must be equipped with certified or 
provisionally certified BRDs.
    (2) Procedures for certification and decertification of BRDs. The 
process for the certification of BRDs consists of two phases--an 
optional pre-certification phase and a required certification phase. The 
RA may also provisionally certify a BRD.
    (i) Pre-certification. The pre-certification phase allows a person 
to test and evaluate a new BRD design for up to 60 days without being 
subject to the observer requirements and rigorous testing requirements 
specified for certification testing in the ``Bycatch Reduction Device 
Testing Manual.''
    (A) A person who wants to conduct pre-certification phase testing 
must submit an application to the RA, as specified in the ``Bycatch 
Reduction Device Testing Manual.'' The ``Bycatch Reduction Device 
Testing Manual'', which is available from the RA, upon request, contains 
the application forms.
    (B) After reviewing the application, the RA will determine whether 
to issue a letter of authorization (LOA) to conduct pre-certification 
trials upon the vessel specified in the application. If the RA 
authorizes pre-certification, the RA's LOA must be on board the vessel 
during any trip involving the BRD testing.
    (ii) Certification. A person who proposes a BRD for certification 
for use in the Gulf EEZ or South Atlantic EEZ must submit an application 
to test such BRD, conduct the testing, and submit the results of the 
test in accordance with the ``Bycatch Reduction Device Testing Manual.'' 
The RA will issue a LOA to conduct certification trials upon the vessel 
specified in the application if the RA finds that: The operation plan 
submitted with the application meets the requirements of the ``Bycatch 
Reduction Device Testing Manual'; the observer identified in the 
application is qualified; and the results of any pre-certification 
trials conducted have been reviewed and deemed to indicate a reasonable 
scientific basis for conducting certification testing. If authorization 
to conduct certification trials is denied, the RA will provide a letter 
of explanation to the applicant, together with relevant recommendations 
to address the deficiencies resulting in the denial. To be certified for 
use in the fishery, the BRD candidate must successfully demonstrate a 30 
percent reduction in total weight of finfish bycatch. In addition, the 
BRD candidate must satisfy the following conditions: There is at least a 
50-percent probability the true reduction rate of the BRD candidate 
meets the bycatch reduction criterion and there is no more than a 10-
percent probability the true reduction rate of the BRD candidate is more 
than 5 percentage points less than the bycatch reduction criterion. If a 
BRD meets both conditions, consistent with the ``Bycatch Reduction 
Device Testing Manual'', NMFS, through appropriate rulemaking 
procedures, will add the BRD to the list of certified BRDs in paragraph 
(g)(3) of this section; and provide the specifications for the newly 
certified BRD, including any special conditions deemed appropriate based 
on the certification testing results.
    (iii) Provisional certification. Based on data provided consistent 
with the ``Bycatch Reduction Device Testing Manual'', the RA may 
provisionally certify a BRD if there is at least a 50-percent 
probability the true reduction rate of the BRD is no more than 5 
percentage points less than the bycatch reduction criterion, i.e. 25 
percent reduction in total weight of finfish bycatch. Through 
appropriate rulemaking procedures, NMFS will add the BRD to the list of 
provisionally certified BRDs in paragraph (g)(3) of this section; and

[[Page 303]]

provide the specifications for the BRD, including any special conditions 
deemed appropriate based on the certification testing results. A 
provisional certification is effective for 2 years from the date of 
publication of the notification in the Federal Register announcing the 
provisional certification.
    (iv) Decertification. The RA will decertify a BRD if NMFS determines 
the BRD does not meet the requirements for certification or provisional 
certification. Before determining whether to decertify a BRD, the RA 
will notify the appropriate Fishery Management Council in writing, and 
the public will be provided an opportunity to comment on the 
advisability of any proposed decertification. The RA will consider any 
comments from the Council and public, and if the RA elects to decertify 
the BRD, the RA will proceed with decertification via appropriate 
rulemaking.
    (3) Certified and provisionally certified BRDs--(i) Certified BRDS. 
The following BRDs are certified for use in the Gulf EEZ and South 
Atlantic EEZ unless indicated otherwise. Specifications of these 
certified BRDs are contained in appendix D to this part.
    (A) Fisheye--see appendix D to part 622 for separate specifications 
in the Gulf and South Atlantic EEZ.
    (B) Gulf fisheye--South Atlantic EEZ only.
    (C) Jones-Davis.
    (D) Modified Jones-Davis.
    (E) Expanded mesh--South Atlantic EEZ only.
    (F) Extended funnel -South Atlantic EEZ only.
    (G) Cone Fish Deflector Composite Panel.
    (H) Square Mesh Panel (SMP) Composite Panel.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (h) [Reserved]
    (i) Pre-certification. The pre-certification phase allows a person 
to test and evaluate a new BRD design for up to 60 days without being 
subject to the observer requirements and rigorous testing requirements 
specified for certification testing in the Gulf Of Mexico Bycatch 
Reduction Device Testing Protocol Manual.
    (A) A person who wants to conduct pre-certification phase testing 
must submit an application, as specified in the Gulf Of Mexico Bycatch 
Reduction Device Testing Protocol Manual, to the RA. The Gulf Of Mexico 
Bycatch Reduction Device Testing Protocol Manual, which is available 
from the RA, upon request, contains the application forms.
    (B) After reviewing the application, the RA will determine whether 
to issue a letter of authorization (LOA) to conduct pre-certification 
trials upon the vessel specified in the application. The RA will issue a 
pre-certification phase LOA if the BRD design is substantially unlike 
any BRD design previously determined not to meet the BRD certification 
criterion or, if the design is substantially similar to a BRD design 
previously determined not to meet the BRD certification criteria, and 
the application demonstrates that the design could meet the 
certification criterion through design revision or upon retesting (e.g., 
the application shows that statistical results could be improved upon 
retesting by such things as using a larger sample size than that 
previously used). If the RA authorizes pre-certification, the RA's 
letter of authorization must be on board the vessel during any trip 
involving the BRD testing.
    (ii) Certification. A person who proposes a BRD for certification 
for use in the Gulf EEZ must submit an application to test such BRD, 
conduct the testing, and submit the results of the test in accordance 
with the Gulf Of Mexico Bycatch Reduction Device Testing Protocol 
Manual. The RA will issue a LOA to conduct certification trials upon the 
vessel specified in the application if the RA finds that: The test plan 
meets the requirements of the protocol; the observer identified in the 
application is qualified and has no current or prior financial 
relationship with the entity seeking BRD certification; the application 
presents a BRD candidate substantially unlike BRDs previously determined 
not to meet the current bycatch reduction criterion, or the applicant 
has shown good cause for reconsideration (such as the likelihood of 
improved statistical results yielded from a larger sample size than that

[[Page 304]]

previously used); and for BRDs not previously tested for certification, 
the results of any pre-certification trials conducted have been reviewed 
and deemed to indicate a reasonable scientific basis for conducting 
certification testing. If authorization to conduct certification trials 
is denied, the RA will provide a letter of explanation to the applicant, 
together with relevant recommendations to address the deficiencies 
resulting in the denial. If a BRD meets the certification criterion, as 
determined under the testing protocol, NMFS will publish a notice in the 
Federal Register adding the BRD to the list of certified BRDs in 
paragraph (h)(2) of this section providing the specifications for the 
newly certified BRD, including any special conditions deemed appropriate 
based on the certification testing results.
    (iii) A shrimp trawler that is authorized to participate in the pre-
certification phase or to test a BRD in the EEZ for possible 
certification has such written authorization on board and is conducting 
such test in accordance with the Gulf Of Mexico Bycatch Reduction Device 
Testing Protocol Manual is granted a limited exemption from the BRD 
requirement specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. The exemption 
from the BRD requirement is limited to those trawls that are being used 
in the certification trials. All other trawls rigged for fishing must be 
equipped with certified BRDs.
    (i) Gulf reef fish exhibiting trap rash. Possession of Gulf reef 
fish in or from the Gulf EEZ that exhibit trap rash is prima facie 
evidence of illegal trap use and is prohibited. For the purpose of this 
paragraph, trap rash is defined as physical damage to fish that 
characteristically results from contact with wire fish traps. Such 
damage includes, but is not limited to, broken fin spines, fin rays, or 
teeth; visually obvious loss of scales; and cuts or abrasions on the 
body of the fish, particularly on the head, snout, or mouth.
    (j) Rock shrimp in the South Atlantic off Georgia and Florida. The 
minimum mesh size for the cod end of a rock shrimp trawl net in the 
South Atlantic EEZ off Georgia and Florida is 1\7/8\ inches (4.8 cm), 
stretched mesh. This minimum mesh size is required in at least the last 
40 meshes forward of the cod end drawstring (tie-off rings), and 
smaller-mesh bag liners are not allowed. A vessel that has a trawl net 
on board that does not meet these requirements may not possess a rock 
shrimp in or from the South Atlantic EEZ off Georgia and Florida.
    (k) Pelagic sargassum. The minimum allowable mesh size for a net 
used to fish for pelagic sargassum in the South Atlantic EEZ is 4.0 
inches (10.2 cm), stretched mesh, and such net must be attached to a 
frame no larger than 4 ft by 6 ft (1.2 m by 1.8 m). A vessel in the 
South Atlantic EEZ with a net on board that does not meet these 
requirements may not possess any pelagic sargassum.
    (l) Atlantic dolphin and wahoo--(1) Authorized gear. The following 
are the only authorized gear types in the fisheries for dolphin and 
wahoo in the Atlantic EEZ: Automatic reel, bandit gear, handline, 
pelagic longline, rod and reel, and spearfishing gear (including 
powerheads). A person aboard a vessel in the Atlantic EEZ that has on 
board gear types other than authorized gear types may not possess a 
dolphin or wahoo.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (m) Required gear in the Gulf reef fish fishery. For a person on 
board a vessel to fish for Gulf reef fish in the Gulf EEZ, the vessel 
must possess on board and such person must use the gear as specified in 
paragraphs (m)(1) through (m)(3) of this section.
    (1) Non-stainless steel circle hooks. Non-stainless steel circle 
hooks are required when fishing with natural baits.
    (2) Dehooking device. At least one dehooking device is required and 
must be used to remove hooks embedded in Gulf reef fish with minimum 
damage. The hook removal device must be constructed to allow the hook to 
be secured and the barb shielded without re-engaging during the removal 
process. The dehooking end must be blunt, and all edges rounded. The 
device must be of a size appropriate to secure the range of hook sizes 
and styles used in the Gulf reef fish fishery.
    (3) Venting tool. At least one venting tool is required and must be 
used to deflate the abdominal cavities of Gulf

[[Page 305]]

reef fish to release the fish with minimum damage. This tool must be a 
sharpened, hollow instrument, such as a hypodermic syringe with the 
plunger removed, or a 16-gauge needle fixed to a hollow wooden dowel. A 
tool such as a knife or an ice-pick may not be used. The venting tool 
must be inserted into the fish at a 45-degree angle approximately 1 to 2 
inches (2.54 to 5.08 cm) from the base of the pectoral fin. The tool 
must be inserted just deep enough to release the gases, so that the fish 
may be released with minimum damage.
    (n) Required gear in the South Atlantic snapper-grouper fishery. For 
a person on board a vessel to harvest or possess South Atlantic snapper-
grouper in or from the South Atlantic EEZ, the vessel must possess on 
board and such person must use the gear as specified in paragraphs 
(n)(1) and (n)(2) of this section.
    (1) Dehooking device. At least one dehooking device is required and 
must be used as needed to remove hooks embedded in South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper with minimum damage. The hook removal device must be 
constructed to allow the hook to be secured and the barb shielded 
without re-engaging during the removal process. The dehooking end must 
be blunt, and all edges rounded. The device must be of a size 
appropriate to secure the range of hook sizes and styles used in the 
South Atlantic snapper-grouper fishery.
    (2) Non-stainless steel circle hooks. Non-stainless steel circle 
hooks are required to be used when fishing with hook-and-line gear and 
natural baits north of 28[deg] N. lat.

Sec. 622.42  Quotas.

    Quotas apply for the fishing year for each species or species group, 
unless accountability measures are implemented during the fishing year 
pursuant to Sec. 622.49, due to a quota overage occurring the previous 
year, in which case a reduced quota will be specified through 
notification in the Federal Register. Annual quota increases are 
contingent on the total allowable catch for the applicable species not 
being exceeded in the previous fishing year. If the total allowable 
catch is exceeded in the previous fishing year, the RA will file a 
notification with the Office of the Federal Register to maintain the 
quota for the applicable species from the previous fishing year for 
following fishing years, unless the best scientific information 
available determines maintaining the quota from the previous year is 
unnecessary. Except for the quotas for Gulf and South Atlantic coral, 
the quotas include species harvested from state waters adjoining the 
EEZ. Quotas for species managed under this part are as follows. (See 
Sec. 622.32 for limitations on taking prohibited and limited-harvest 
species. The limitations in Sec. 622.32 apply without regard to whether 
the species is harvested by a vessel operating under a commercial vessel 
permit or by a person subject to the bag limits.)

    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Coastal migratory pelagic fish. King and Spanish mackerel quotas 
apply to persons who fish under commercial vessel permits for king or 
Spanish mackerel, as required under Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(iii) or (iv). 
Cobia quotas apply to persons who fish for cobia and sell their catch. A 
fish is counted against the quota for the area where it is caught.
    (1) Migratory groups of king mackerel--(i) Gulf migratory group. For 
the 2012 to 2013 fishing year, the quota for the Gulf migratory group of 
king mackerel is 3.808 million lb (1.728 million kg). For the 2013 to 
2014 fishing year and subsequent fishing years, the quota for the Gulf

Sec. 622.43  Closures.

    (a) Quota closures. When a quota specified in Sec. 622.42 is 
reached, or is projected to be reached, the Assistant Administrator will 
file a notification to that effect with the Office of the Federal 
Register. On and after the effective date of such notification, for the 
remainder of the fishing year, the following closure restrictions apply 
(See Sec. 622.49 for closure provisions when an ACL is reached or 
projected to be reached):

    (D) After 100 percent of the adjusted quota is taken through the end 
of the fishing year, in amounts not exceeding 500 lb (227kg).
    (2) For the purpose of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the 
adjusted quota is 2.88 million (1.31 million kg). The adjusted quota is 
the quota for Atlantic migratory group Spanish mackerel reduced by an 
amount calculated to allow continued harvests of Atlantic migratory 
group Spanish mackerel at the rate of 500 lb (227 kg) per vessel per day 
for the remainder of the fishing year after the adjusted quota is 
reached. Total commercial harvest is still subject to the annual catch 
limit and accountability measures. By filing a notification with the 
Office of the Federal Register, the Assistant Administrator will 
announce when 75 percent and 100 percent of the adjusted quota is 
reached or projected to be reached.
    (3) For the purpose of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, a day 
starts at 6 a.m., local time, and extends for 24 hours. If a vessel 
terminates a trip prior to 6 a.m., but retains Spanish mackerel on board 
after that time, the Spanish mackerel retained on board will not be 
considered in possession during the succeeding day, provided the vessel 
is not underway between 6 a.m. and the time such Spanish mackerel are 
unloaded, and provided such Spanish mackerel are unloaded prior to 6 
p.m.

<R05>
Sec. 622.49  Annual catch limits (ACLs) and accountability measures 
(AMs).

    (a) Gulf reef fish--(1) Greater amberjack--(i) Commercial sector. If 
commercial landings, as estimated by the SRD, reach or are projected to 
reach the applicable quota specified in Sec. 622.42(a)(1)(v), the 
Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, (AA) will file a 
notification with the Office of the Federal Register to close the 
commercial sector for the remainder of the fishing year. In addition, if 
despite such closure, commercial landings exceed the quota, the AA will 
file a notification with the Office of the Federal Register, at or near 
the beginning of the following fishing year to reduce the quota for that 
following year by the amount of the overage in the prior fishing year.
    (ii) Recreational sector. If recreational landings, as estimated by 
the SRD, reach or are projected to reach the applicable quota specified 
in Sec. 622.42(a)(2)(ii), the AA will file a notification with the 
Office of the Federal Register to close the recreational sector for the 
remainder of the fishing year. In addition, if despite such closure, 
recreational landings exceed the quota, the AA will file a notification 
with the Office of the Federal Register, at or near the beginning of the 
following fishing year, to reduce the quota for that following year by 
the amount of the overage in the prior fishing year, and to reduce the 
length of the recreational fishing season for the following fishing year 
by the amount necessary to recover the overage from the prior fishing 
year. Further, during that following year, if necessary, the AA may file 
additional notification with the Office of the Federal Register to 
readjust the reduced fishing season to ensure recreational harvest 
achieves but does not exceed the intended harvest level.
    (2) Gray triggerfish--(i) Commercial sector. If commercial landings, 
as estimated by the SRD, reach or are projected to reach the applicable 
quota specified in Sec. 622.42(a)(1)(vi), the AA will file a 
notification with the Office of the Federal Register to close the 
commercial sector for the remainder of the fishing year. In addition, if 
despite such closure, commercial landings exceed the applicable annual 
catch limit (ACL), the AA will file a notification with the Office of 
the Federal Register, at or near the beginning of the following fishing 
year, to reduce the quota for that following year by the amount the 
prior-year ACL was exceeded. The commercial ACL for 2010 and subsequent 
fishing years is 138,000 lb (62,596 kg).
    (ii) Recreational sector. If recreational landings, as estimated by 
the SRD, exceed the ACL, the AA will file a notification with the Office 
of the Federal Register reducing the length of the following 
recreational fishing season by the amount necessary to ensure 
recreational landings do not exceed the recreational target catch for 
that following fishing year. The recreational ACL for 2010 and 
subsequent fishing years is 457,000 lb (207,291 kg). The recreational 
ACT for 2010 and subsequent fishing years is 405,000 lb (183,705 kg). 
Recreational landings will be evaluated relative to the ACL based on a 
moving multi-year average of landings, as described in the FMP.
    (3) Other shallow-water grouper (Other SWG) combined (including 
black grouper, scamp, yellowfin grouper, and yellowmouth grouper)--(i) 
Commercial sector. The IFQ program for groupers and tilefishes in the 
Gulf of Mexico serves as the accountability measure for commercial Other 
SWG. The commercial ACL for Other SWG is equal to the applicable quota 
specified in Sec. 622.42(a)(1)(iii)(A).
    (ii) Recreational sector. If the sum of the commercial and 
recreational landings, as estimated by the SRD, exceeds the stock 
complex ACL specified in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, then 
during the following fishing year, if the sum of the commercial and 
recreational landings reaches or is projected to reach the applicable 
ACL specified in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, the AA will file 
a notification with the Office of the Federal Register to close the 
recreational sector for the remainder of that fishing year.
    (iii) The stock complex ACLs for Other SWG, in gutted weight, are 
688,000 lb (312,072 kg) for 2012, 700,000 lb

[[Page 319]]

(317,515 kg) for 2013, 707,000 lb (320,690 kg) for 2014, and 710,000 lb 
(322,051 kg) for 2015 and subsequent years.
    (4) Gag. (i) Commercial sector. The IFQ program for groupers and 
tilefishes in the Gulf of Mexico serves as the accountability measure 
for commercial gag. The applicable commercial ACLs for gag, in gutted 
weight, are 0.788 million lb (0.357 million kg) for 2012, 0.956 million 
lb (0.434 million kg) for 2013, 1.100 million lb (0.499 million kg) for 
2014, and 1.217 million lb (0.552 million kg) for 2015 and subsequent 
fishing years.
    (ii) Recreational sector. (A) Without regard to overfished status, 
if gag recreational landings, as estimated by the SRD, reach or are 
projected to reach the applicable ACLs specified in paragraph 
(a)(4)(ii)(D)of this section, the AA will file a notification with the 
Office of the Federal Register, to close the recreational sector for the 
remainder of the fishing year. On and after the effective date of such a 
notification, the bag and possession limit of gag in or from the Gulf 
EEZ is zero. This bag and possession limit applies in the Gulf on board 
a vessel for which a valid Federal charter vessel/headboat permit for 
Gulf reef fish has been issued, without regard to where such species 
were harvested, i.e. in state or Federal waters. In addition, the 
notification will reduce the length of the recreational SWG fishing 
season the following fishing year by the amount necessary to ensure gag 
recreational landings do not exceed the recreational ACT in the 
following fishing year.
    (B) If gag are not overfished, and in addition to the measures 
specified in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, if gag 
recreational landings, as estimated by the SRD, exceed the applicable 
ACLs specified in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(D) of this section, the AA will 
file a notification with the Office of the Federal Register to maintain 
the gag ACT, specified in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(D) of this section, for 
that following fishing year at the level of the prior year's ACT, unless 
the best scientific information available determines that maintaining 
the prior year's ACT is unnecessary.
    (C) In addition to the measures specified in paragraphs 
(a)(4)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, if gag recreational landings, as 
estimated by the SRD, exceed the applicable ACL specified in paragraph 
(a)(4)(ii)(D) of this section, and gag are overfished, based on the most 
recent status of U.S. Fisheries Report to Congress, the AA will file a 
notification with the Office of the Federal Register, at or near the 
beginning of the following fishing year to reduce the ACL and the ACT 
for that following year by the amount of the ACL overage in the prior 
fishing year, unless the best scientific information available 
determines that a greater, lesser, or no overage adjustment is 
necessary.
    (D) The applicable recreational ACLs for gag, in gutted weight, are 
1.232 million lb (0.559 million kg) for 2012, 1.495 million lb (0.678 
million kg) for 2013, 1.720 million lb (0.780 million kg) for 2014, and 
1.903 million lb (0.863 million kg) for 2015 and subsequent fishing 
years. The recreational ACTs for gag, in gutted weight, are 1.031 
million lb (0.468 million kg) for 2012, 1.287 million lb (0.584 million 
kg) for 2013, 1.519 million lb (0.689 million kg) for 2014, and 1.708 
million lb (0.775 million kg) for 2015 and subsequent fishing years. 
Recreational landings will be evaluated relative to the ACL based on a 
moving multi-year average of landings, as described in the FMP.
    (5) Red grouper. (i) Commercial sector. The IFQ program for groupers 
and tilefishes in the Gulf of Mexico serves as the accountability 
measure for commercial red grouper. The applicable commercial ACL for 
red grouper, in gutted weight, for 2012 and subsequent fishing years is 
6.03 million lb (2.735 million kg).
    (ii) Recreational sector. (A) Without regard to overfished status, 
if red grouper recreational landings, as estimated by the SRD, reach or 
are projected to reach the applicable ACL specified in paragraph 
(a)(5)(ii)(D) of this section, the AA will file a notification with the 
Office of the Federal Register, to close the recreational sector for the 
remainder of the fishing year. On and after the effective date of such a 
notification, the bag and possession limit of red grouper in or from the 
Gulf EEZ is zero. This bag and possession limit applies in the Gulf on 
board a

[[Page 320]]

vessel for which a valid Federal charter vessel/headboat permit for Gulf 
reef fish has been issued, without regard to where such species were 
harvested, i.e. in state or Federal waters.
    (B) If red grouper are not overfished, and in addition to the 
measures specified in paragraph (a)(5)(ii)(A) of this section, if red 
grouper recreational landings, as estimated by the SRD, exceed the 
applicable ACL specified in paragraph (a)(5)(ii)(D) of this section, the 
AA will file a notification with the Office of the Federal Register to 
maintain the red grouper ACT, specified in paragraph (a)(5)(ii)(D) of 
this section, for that following fishing year at the level of the prior 
year's ACT, unless the best scientific information available determines 
that maintaining the prior year's ACT is unnecessary. In addition, the 
notification will reduce the bag limit by one fish and reduce the length 
of the recreational SWG fishing season the following fishing year by the 
amount necessary to ensure red grouper recreational landings do not 
exceed the recreational ACT in the following fishing year. The minimum 
red grouper bag limit for 2014 and subsequent fishing years is two fish.
    (C) In addition to the measures specified in paragraphs 
(a)(5)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, if red grouper recreational 
landings, as estimated by the SRD, exceed the applicable ACL specified 
in paragraph (a)(5)(ii)(D) of this section, and red grouper are 
overfished, based on the most recent Status of U.S. Fisheries Report to 
Congress, the AA will file a notification with the Office of the Federal 
Register, at or near the beginning of the following fishing year to 
reduce the ACL and the ACT for that following year by the amount of the 
ACL overage in the prior fishing year, unless the best scientific 
information available determines that a greater, lesser, or no overage 
adjustment is necessary.
    (D) The recreational ACL for red grouper, in gutted weight, is 1.90 
million lb (0.862 million kg) for 2012 and subsequent fishing years. The 
recreational ACT for red grouper, in gutted weight, is 1.730 million lb 
(0.785 million kg) for 2012 and subsequent fishing years. Recreational 
landings will be evaluated relative to the ACL based on a moving multi-
year average of landings, as described in the FMP.
    (6) Deep-water grouper (DWG) combined (including yellowedge grouper, 
warsaw grouper, snowy grouper, and speckled hind)--
    (i) Commercial sector. The IFQ program for groupers and tilefishes 
in the Gulf of Mexico serves as the accountability measure for 
commercial DWG. The commercial ACL for DWG is equal to the applicable 
quota specified in Sec. 622.42(a)(1)(ii).
    (ii) Recreational sector. If the sum of the commercial and 
recreational landings, as estimated by the SRD, exceeds the stock 
complex ACL specified in paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this section, then 
during the following fishing year, if the sum of commercial and 
recreational landings reaches or is projected to reach the applicable 
ACL specified in (a)(6)(iii) of this section, the AA will file a 
notification with the Office of the Federal Register to close the 
recreational sector for the remainder of that fishing year.
    (iii) The stock complex ACLs for DWG, in gutted weight, are 1.216 
million lb (0.552 million kg) for 2012, 1.207 million lb (0.547 million 
kg) for 2013, 1.198 million lb (0.543 million kg) for 2014, 1.189 
million lb (0.539 million kg) for 2015, and 1.105 million lb (0.501 
million kg) for 2016 and subsequent years.
    (7) Tilefishes combined (including goldface tilefish, blueline 
tilefish, and tilefish)--(i) Commercial sector. The IFQ program for 
groupers and tilefishes in the Gulf of Mexico serves as the 
accountability measure for commercial tilefishes. The commercial ACL for 
tilefishes is equal to the applicable quota specified in Sec. 
622.42(a)(1)(iv).
    (ii) Recreational sector. If the sum of the commercial and 
recreational landings, as estimated by the SRD, exceeds the stock 
complex ACL specified in paragraph (a)(7)(iii) of this section, then 
during the following fishing year, if the sum of commercial and 
recreational landings reaches or is projected to reach the applicable 
ACL specified in (a)(7)(iii) of this section, the AA will file a 
notification with the Office of the Federal Register to close the 
recreational sector for the remainder of that fishing year.

    (B) If the combined commercial landings for the complex exceed the 
ACL, and at least one of the species in the complex (lesser amberjack, 
almaco jack, and banded rudderfish) is overfished, based on the most 
recent Status of U.S. Fisheries Report to Congress, the AA will file a 
notification with the Office of the Federal Register, at or near the 
beginning of the following fishing year to reduce the ACL for that 
following year by the amount of the overage in the prior fishing year.
    (ii) Recreational sector. If recreational landings for the complex 
(lesser amberjack, almaco jack, and banded rudderfish), combined, as 
estimated by the SRD, exceed the recreational ACL of 261,490 lb (118,610 
kg), round weight, then during the following fishing year, recreational 
landings will be monitored for a persistence in increased landings and, 
if necessary, the AA will file a notification with the Office of the 
Federal Register, to reduce the length of the following recreational 
fishing season by the amount necessary to ensure recreational landings 
do not exceed the recreational ACL in the following fishing year. 
However, the length of the recreational season will also not be reduced 
during the following fishing year

[[Page 328]]

if the RA determines, using the best scientific information available, 
that a reduction in the length of the following fishing season is 
unnecessary.

grunt, sailor's choice, tomtate, and margate, is prohibited, and harvest 
or possession of these species in or from the South Atlantic EEZ is 
limited to the bag and possession limit. This bag and possession limit 
applies in the South Atlantic on board a vessel for which a valid 
Federal charter vessel/headboat permit for South Atlantic snapper-
grouper has been issued, without regard to where such species were 
harvested, i.e., in state or Federal waters.
    (B) If the combined commercial landings for this complex exceed the 
ACL, and at least one of the species in the complex is overfished, based 
on the most recent Status of U.S. Fisheries Report to Congress, the AA 
will file a notification with the Office of the Federal Register, at or 
near the beginning of the following fishing year to reduce the ACL for

    (ii) Recreational sector. If recreational landings for white grunt, 
sailor's choice, tomtate, and margate, as estimated by the SRD, exceed 
the recreational ACL of 562,151 lb (254,987 kg), round weight, then 
during the following fishing year, recreational landings will be 
monitored for a persistence in increased landings and, if necessary, the 
AA will file a notification with the Office of the Federal Register, to 
reduce the length of the following recreational fishing season for this 
complex by the amount necessary to ensure recreational landings do not 
exceed the recreational ACL in the following fishing year. However, the 
length of the recreational season will also not be reduced during the 
following fishing year if the RA determines, using the best scientific 
information available, that a reduction in the length of the following 
fishing season is unnecessary.
    (25) Red snapper--(i) Commercial sector. The commercial season for 
red snapper specified in Sec. 622.35(l) and the commercial trip limit 
specified in Sec. 622.44(c)(9) serve as the commercial AMs for red 
snapper. The Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) will monitor 
commercial landings in-season to determine if the ACL has been 
harvested. If the SEFSC determines the ACL has not been harvested in the 
first 7-day opening, the RA may reopen the commercial sector for an 
additional limited time. The commercial ACL for red snapper is 20,818 lb 
(9,443 kg), gutted weight.
    (ii) Recreational sector. The recreational season specified in Sec. 
622.35(l) and the recreational bag limit specified in Sec. 
622.39(d)(1)(xi) serve as the recreational AMs for red snapper. The 
recreational ACL for red snapper is 9,399 fish.
    (c) Caribbean island management areas/Caribbean EEZ. If landings 
from a Caribbean island management area, as specified in Appendix E to 
part 622, except for landings of queen conch (see Sec. 622.33(d)), or 
landings from the Caribbean EEZ for tilefish and aquarium trade species, 
are estimated by the SRD to have exceeded the applicable ACL, as 
specified in paragraph (c)(1) for Puerto Rico management area species or 
species groups, paragraph (c)(2) for St. Croix management area species 
or species groups, paragraph (c)(3) for St. Thomas/St. John management 
area species or species groups, or paragraph (c)(4) for the Caribbean 
EEZ, the AA will file a notification with the Office of the Federal 
Register, at or near the beginning of the following fishing year, to 
reduce the length of the fishing season for the applicable species or 
species groups that year by the amount necessary to ensure landings do 
not exceed the applicable ACL. If NMFS determines the ACL for a 
particular species or species group was exceeded because of enhanced 
data collection and monitoring efforts instead of an increase in total 
catch of the species or species group, NMFS will not reduce the length 
of the fishing season for the applicable species or species group the 
following fishing year. Landings will be evaluated relative to the 
applicable ACL based on a moving multi-year average of landings, as 
described in the FMP. With the exceptions of Caribbean queen conch in 
Puerto Rico and St. Thomas/St. John management areas, goliath grouper, 
Nassau grouper, midnight parrotfish, blue parrotfish, and rainbow 
parrotfish, ACLs are based on

[[Page 334]]

the combined Caribbean EEZ and territorial landings for each management 
area. The ACLs specified in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3), and 
(c)(4) of this section are given in round weight. (See Sec. 622.32 for 
limitations on taking prohibited and limited harvest species. The 
limitations in Sec. 622.32 apply without regard to whether the species 
is harvested by a vessel operating under a valid commercial fishing 
license issued by Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands or by a person 
subject to the bag limits.)

Sec. 622.50  Caribbean spiny lobster import prohibitions.

    (a) Minimum size limits for imported spiny lobster. There are two 
minimum size limits that apply to importation of spiny lobster into the 
United States -one that applies any place subject to

[[Page 339]]

the jurisdiction of the United States other than Puerto Rico or the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, and a more restrictive minimum size limit that applies 
to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
    (1) No person may import a Caribbean spiny lobster with less than a 
6-ounce (170-gram) tail weight into Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin 
Islands. For the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, a 6-ounce 
(170-gram) tail weight is defined as a tail that weighs 5.9-6.4 ounces 
(167-181 grams). If the documentation accompanying an imported Caribbean 
spiny lobster (including but not limited to product packaging, customs 
entry forms, bills of lading, brokerage forms, or commercial invoices) 
indicates that the product does not satisfy the minimum tail-weight, the 
person importing such Caribbean spiny lobster has the burden to prove 
that such Caribbean spiny lobster actually does satisfy the minimum 
tail-weight requirement or that such Caribbean spiny lobster has a tail 
length of 6.2 inches (15.75 cm) or greater or that such Caribbean spiny 
lobster has or had a carapace length of 3.5 inches (8.89 cm) or greater. 
If the imported product itself does not satisfy the minimum tail-weight 
requirement, the person importing such Caribbean spiny lobster has the 
burden to prove that such Caribbean spiny lobster has a tail length of 
6.2 inches (15.75 cm) or greater or that such Caribbean spiny lobster 
has or had a carapace length of 3.5 inches (8.89 cm) or greater. If the 
burden is satisfied such Caribbean spiny lobster will be considered to 
be in compliance with the minimum 6-ounce (170-gram) tail-weight 
requirement.
    (2) See Sec. 640.27 of this chapter regarding the minimum size 
limit that applies to spiny lobster imported into any place subject to 
the jurisdiction of the United States other than Puerto Rico or the U.S. 
Virgin Islands.
    (b) Additional Caribbean spiny lobster import prohibitions--(1) 
Prohibition related to tail meat. No person may import into any place 
subject to the jurisdiction of the United States Caribbean spiny lobster 
tail meat that is not in whole tail form with the exoskeleton attached.
    (2) Prohibitions related to egg-bearing spiny lobster. No person may 
import into any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States 
Caribbean spiny lobster with eggs attached or Caribbean spiny lobster 
from which eggs or pleopods (swimmerets) have been removed or stripped. 
Pleopods (swimmerets) are the first five pairs of abdominal appendages.

        Appendix D to Part 622--Specifications for Certified BRDs

    A. Extended Funnel.

[[Page 348]]

    1. Description. The extended funnel BRD consists of an extension 
with large-mesh webbing in the center (the large-mesh escape section) 
and small-mesh webbing on each end held open by a semi-rigid hoop. A 
funnel of small-mesh webbing is placed inside the extension to form a 
passage for shrimp to the codend. It also creates an area of reduced 
water flow to allow for fish escapement through the large mesh. One side 
of the funnel is extended vertically to form a lead panel and area of 
reduced water flow. There are two sizes of extended funnel BRDs, a 
standard size and an inshore size for small trawls.
    2. Minimum Construction and Installation Requirements for Standard 
Size.
    (a) Extension Material. The small-mesh sections used on both sides 
of the large-mesh escape section are constructed of 1\5/8\ inch (4.13 
cm), No. 30 stretched mesh, nylon webbing. The front section is 120 
meshes around by 6\1/2\ meshes deep. The back section is 120 meshes 
around by 23 meshes deep.
    (b) Large-Mesh Escape Section. The large-mesh escape section is 
constructed of 8 to 10 inch (20.3 to 25.4 cm), stretched mesh, webbing. 
This section is cut on the bar to form a section that is 15 inches (38.1 
cm) in length by 95 inches (241.3 cm) in circumference. The leading edge 
is attached to the 6 1/2-mesh extension section and the rear edge is 
attached to the 23-mesh extension section.
    (c) Funnel. The funnel is constructed of 1\1/2\ inch (3.81 cm), 
stretched mesh, No. 30 depth-stretched and heat-set polyethylene 
webbing. The circumference of the leading edge is 120 meshes and the 
back edge is 78 meshes. The short side of the funnel is 34 to 36 inches 
(86.4 to 91.4 cm) long and the opposite side of the funnel extends an 
additional 22 to 24 inches (55.9 to 61.0 cm). The circumference of the 
leading edge of the funnel is attached to the forward small-mesh section 
three meshes forward of the large-mesh escape section and is evenly 
sewn, mesh for mesh, to the small-mesh section. The after edge of the 
funnel is attached to the after small-mesh section at its top and bottom 
eight meshes back from the large-mesh escape panel. Seven meshes of the 
top and seven meshes of the bottom of the funnel are attached to eight 
meshes at the top and bottom of the small-mesh section, such eight 
meshes being located immediately adjacent to the top and bottom centers 
of the small-mesh section on the side of the funnel's extended side. The 
extended side of the funnel is sewn at its top and bottom to the top and 
bottom of the small-mesh section, extending at an angle toward the top 
and bottom centers of the small-mesh section.
    (d) Semi-Rigid Hoop. A 30-inch (76.2-cm) diameter hoop constructed 
of plastic-coated trawl cable, swaged together with a \3/8\-inch (9.53-
mm) micropress sleeve, is installed five meshes behind the trailing edge 
of the large-mesh escape section. The extension webbing must be laced to 
the ring around the entire circumference and must be equally distributed 
on the hoop, that is, 30 meshes must be evenly attached to each 
quadrant.
    (e) Installation. The extended funnel BRD is attached 8 inches (20.3 
cm) behind the posterior edge of the TED. If it is attached behind a 
soft TED, a second semi-rigid hoop, as prescribed in paragraph A.2.(d), 
must be installed in the front section of the BRD extension webbing at 
the leading edge of the funnel. The codend of the trawl net is attached 
to the trailing edge of the BRD.
    3. Minimum Construction and Installation Requirements for Inshore 
Size.
    (a) Extension Material. The small-mesh sections used on both sides 
of the large-mesh escape section are constructed of 1\3/8\ inch (3.5 
cm), No. 18 stretched mesh, nylon webbing. The front section is 120 
meshes around by 6\1/2\ meshes deep. The back section is 120 meshes 
around by 23 meshes deep.
    (b) Large-Mesh Escape Section. The large-mesh escape section is 
constructed of 8 to 10 inch (20.3 to 25.4 cm), stretched mesh, webbing. 
This section is cut on the bar to form a section that is 15 inches (38.1 
cm) by 75 inches (190.5 cm) in circumference. The leading edge is 
attached to the 6 1/2-mesh extension section and the rear edge is 
attached to the 23-mesh extension section.
    (c) Funnel. The funnel is constructed of 1\3/8\ inch (3.5 cm), 
stretched mesh, No. 18 depth-stretched and heat-set polyethylene 
webbing. The circumference of the leading edge is 120 meshes and the 
back edge is 78 meshes. The short side of the funnel is 30 to 32 inches 
(76.2 to 81.3 cm) long and the opposite side of the funnel extends an 
additional 20 to 22 inches (50.8 to 55.9 cm). The circumference of the 
leading edge of the funnel is attached to the forward small-mesh section 
three meshes forward of the large-mesh escape section and is evenly 
sewn, mesh for mesh, to the small-mesh section. The after edge of the 
funnel is attached to the after small-mesh section at its top and bottom 
eight meshes back from the large-mesh escape panel. Seven meshes of the 
top and seven meshes of the bottom of the funnel are attached to eight 
meshes at the top and bottom of the small-mesh section, such eight 
meshes being located immediately adjacent to the top and bottom centers 
of the small-mesh section on the side of the funnel's extended side. The 
extended side of the funnel is sewn at its top and bottom to the top and 
bottom of the small-mesh section, extending at an angle toward the top 
and bottom centers of the small-mesh section.
    (d) Semi-Rigid Hoop. A 24-inch (61.0-cm) diameter hoop constructed 
of plastic-coated trawl cable, swaged together with a \3/8\-inch (9.53-
mm) micropress sleeve, is installed five meshes behind the trailing edge 
of the large mesh section. The extension webbing must

[[Page 349]]

be laced to the ring around the entire circumference and must be equally 
distributed on the hoop, that is, 30 meshes must be evenly attached to 
each quadrant.
    (e) Installation. The extended funnel BRD is attached 8 inches (20.3 
cm) behind the posterior edge of the TED. If it is attached behind a 
soft TED, a second semi-rigid hoop, as prescribed in paragraph A.3.(d), 
must be installed in the front section of the BRD extension webbing at 
the leading edge of the funnel. The codend of the trawl net is attached 
to the trailing edge of the BRD.
    B. Expanded Mesh. The expanded mesh BRD is constructed and installed 
exactly the same as the standard size extended funnel BRD, except that 
one side of the funnel is not extended to form a lead panel.
    C. Fisheye.
    1. Description. The fisheye BRD is a cone-shaped rigid frame 
constructed from aluminum or steel rod of at least \1/4\ inch (6.35-mm) 
diameter, which is inserted into the cod end to form an escape opening.
    2. Minimum Construction and Installation Requirements. The fisheye 
has a minimum escape opening dimension of 5 inches (12.7 cm) and a 
minimum total escape opening area of 36 in\2\ (91.4 cm\2\). When the 
fisheye BRD is installed, no part of the lazy line attachment system 
(i.e., any mechanism, such as elephant ears or choker straps, used to 
attach the lazy line to the cod end) may overlap the fisheye escape 
opening when the fisheye is installed aft of the attachment point of the 
cod end retrieval system.
    (a) In the Gulf EEZ, the fisheye BRD must be installed at the top 
center of the cod end of the trawl to create an opening in the trawl 
facing in the direction of the mouth of the trawl no further forward 
than 9 ft (2.7 m) from the cod end drawstring (tie-off rings).
    (b) In the South Atlantic EEZ, the fisheye BRD must be installed at 
the top center of the cod end of the trawl to create an escape opening 
in the trawl facing the direction of the mouth of the trawl no further 
forward than 11 ft (3.4 m) from the cod end tie-off rings.
    D. Gulf fisheye.
    1. Description. The Gulf fisheye is a cone-shaped rigid frame 
constructed from aluminum or steel rod of at least \1/4\ inch (6.35-mm) 
diameter, which is inserted into the top center of the cod end, and is 
offset not more than 15 meshes perpendicular to the top center of the 
cod end to form an escape opening.
    2. Minimum Construction and Installation Requirements. The Gulf 
fisheye has a minimum escape opening dimension of 5 inches (12.7 cm) and 
a minimum total escape opening area of 36 in\2\ (91.4 cm\2\). To be used 
in the South Atlantic EEZ, the Gulf fisheye BRD must be installed in the 
cod end of the trawl to create an escape opening in the trawl, facing in 
the direction of the mouth of the trawl, no less than 8.5 ft (2.59 m) 
and no further forward than 12.5 ft (3.81 m) from the cod end tie-off 
rings, and may be offset no more than 15 meshes perpendicular to the top 
center of the cod end. When the Gulf fisheye BRD is installed, no part 
of the lazy line attachment system (i.e., any mechanism, such as 
elephant ears or choker straps, used to attach the lazy line to the cod 
end) may overlap the fisheye escape opening when the fisheye is 
installed aft of the attachment point of the cod end retrieval system.
    E. Jones-Davis.
    1. Description. The Jones-Davis BRD is similar to the expanded mesh 
and the extended funnel BRDs except that the fish escape openings are 
windows cut around the funnel rather than large-mesh sections. In 
addition, a webbing cone fish deflector is installed behind the funnel.
    2. Minimum Construction and Installation Requirements. The Jones-
Davis BRD must contain all of the following.
    (a) Webbing extension. The webbing extension must be constructed 
from a single piece of 1 5/8-inch (3.5-cm) stretch mesh number 30 nylon 
42 meshes by 120 meshes. A tube is formed from the extension webbing by 
sewing the 42-mesh side together.
    (b) 28-inch (71.1-cm) cable hoop. A single hoop must be constructed 
of \1/2\-inch (1.3-cm) steel cable 88 inches (223.5 cm) in length. The 
cable must be joined at its ends by a 3-inch (7.6-cm) piece of \1/2\-
inch (1.3-cm) aluminum pipe and pressed with a \3/8\-inch (0.95-cm) die 
to form a hoop. The inside diameter of this hoop must be between 27 and 
29 inches (68.6 and 73.7 cm). The hoop must be attached to the extension 
webbing 17\1/2\ meshes behind the leading edge. The extension webbing 
must be quartered and attached in four places around the hoop, and every 
other mesh must be attached all the way around the hoop using number 24 
twine or larger. The hoop must be laced with \3/8\-inch (0.95-cm) 
polypropylene or polyethylene rope for chaffing.
    (c) 24-inch (61.0-cm) hoop. A single hoop must be constructed of 
either number 60 twine 80 inches (203.2 cm) in length or \3/8\-inch 
(0.95-cm) steel cable 75\1/2\ inches (191.8 cm) in length. If twine is 
used, the twine must be laced in and out of the extension webbing 39 
meshes behind the leading edge, and the ends must be tied together. If 
cable is used, the cable must be joined at its ends by a 3-inch (7.6-cm) 
piece of \3/8\-inch (0.95-cm) aluminum pipe and pressed together with a 
\1/4\-inch (0.64-cm) die to form a hoop. The inside diameter of this 
hoop must be between 23 and 25 inches (58.4 and 63.4 cm). The hoop must 
be attached to the extension webbing 39 meshes behind the leading edge. 
The extension webbing must be quartered and attached in four places 
around the hoop, and every other mesh must be attached all the way 
around the hoop using number 24 twine or larger. The hoop must be laced 
with \3/8\-inch (0.95-

[[Page 350]]

cm) polypropylene or polyethylene rope for chaffing.
    (d) Funnel. The funnel must be constructed from four sections of 1 
1/2-inch (3.8-cm) heat-set and depth-stretched polypropylene or 
polyethylene webbing. The two side sections must be rectangular in 
shape, 29\1/2\ meshes on the leading edge by 23 meshes deep. The top and 
bottom sections are 29\1/2\ meshes on the leading edge by 23 meshes deep 
and tapered 1 point 2 bars on both sides down to 8 meshes across the 
back. The four sections must be sewn together down the 23-mesh edge to 
form the funnel.
    (e) Attachment of the funnel in the webbing extension. The funnel 
must be installed two meshes behind the leading edge of the extension 
starting at the center seam of the extension and the center mesh of the 
funnel's top section leading edge. On the same row of meshes, the funnel 
must be sewn evenly all the way around the inside of the extension. The 
funnel's top and bottom back edges must be attached one mesh behind the 
28-inch (71.1-cm) cable hoop (front hoop). Starting at the top center 
seam, the back edge of the top funnel section must be attached four 
meshes each side of the center. Counting around 60 meshes from the top 
center, the back edge of the bottom section must be attached 4 meshes on 
each side of the bottom center. Clearance between the side of the funnel 
and the 28-inch (71.1-cm) cable hoop (front hoop) must be at least 6 
inches (15.2 cm) when measured in the hanging position.
    (f) Cutting the escape openings. The leading edge of the escape 
opening must be located within 18 inches (45.7 cm) of the posterior edge 
of the turtle excluder device (TED) grid. The area of the escape opening 
must total at least 864 in\2\ (5,574.2 cm\2\). Two escape openings 10 
meshes wide by 13 meshes deep must be cut 6 meshes apart in the 
extension webbing, starting at the top center extension seam, 3 meshes 
back from the leading edge and 16 meshes to the left and to the right 
(total of four openings). The four escape openings must be double 
selvaged for strength.
    (g) Alternative Method for Constructing the Funnel and Escape 
Openings. The following method for constructing the funnel and escape 
openings may be used instead of the method described in paragraphs 
F.2.d., F.2.e., and F.2.f. of this section. With this alternative 
method, the funnel and escape openings are formed by cutting a flap in 
each side of the extension webbing; pushing the flaps inward; and 
attaching the top and bottom edges along the bars of the extension 
webbing to form the v-shape of the funnel. Minimum requirements 
applicable to this method include: (1) The funnel's top and bottom back 
edges must be attached one mesh behind the 28-inch (71.1-cm) cable hoop 
(front hoop); (2) clearance between the side of the funnel and the 28-
inch (71.1-cm) cable hoop (front hoop) must be at least 6 inches (15.2 
cm) when measured in the hanging position; (3) the leading edge of the 
escape opening must be located within 18 inches (45.7 cm) of the 
posterior edge of the turtle excluder device (TED) grid; and, (4) the 
area of the escape opening must total at least 864 in\2\ (5,574.2 
cm\2\). To construct the funnel and escape openings using this method, 
begin 3\1/2\ meshes from the leading edge of the extension, at the top 
center seam, count over 18 meshes on each side, and cut 13 meshes toward 
the back of the extension. Turn parallel to the leading edge, and cut 26 
meshes toward the bottom center of the extension. Next, turn parallel to 
the top center seam, and cut 13 meshes forward toward the leading edge, 
creating a flap of webbing 13 meshes by 26 meshes by 13 meshes. Lengthen 
the flap to 18 meshes by adding a 4\1/2\-mesh by 26-mesh rectangular 
section of webbing to the 26-mesh edge. Attach the 18-mesh edges to the 
top and bottom of the extension by sewing 2 bars of the extension to 1 
mesh on the flap in toward the top center and bottom center of the 
extension, forming the exit opening and the funnel. Connect the two 
flaps together in the center with a 7-inch piece of number 42 twine to 
allow adequate clearance for fish escapement between the flaps and the 
side openings. On each side, sew a 6-mesh by 10 1/2-mesh section of 
webbing to 6 meshes of the center of the 26-mesh cut on the extension 
and 6 meshes centered between the 13-mesh cuts 3\1/2\ meshes from the 
leading edge. This forms two 10-mesh by 13-mesh openings on each side.
    (h) Cone fish deflector. The cone fish deflector is constructed of 2 
pieces of 1 5/8-inch (4.13-cm) polypropylene or polyethylene webbing, 40 
meshes wide by 20 meshes in length and cut on the bar on each side 
forming a triangle. Starting at the apex of the two triangles, the two 
pieces must be sewn together to form a cone of webbing. The apex of the 
cone fish deflector must be positioned within 10-14 inches (25.4-35.6 
cm) of the posterior edge of the funnel.
    (i) 11-inch (27.9-cm) cable hoop for cone deflector. A single hoop 
must be constructed of \5/16\-inch (0.79-cm) or \3/8\-inch (0.95-cm) 
cable 34\1/2\ inches (87.6 cm) in length. The ends must be joined by a 
3-inch (7.6-cm) piece of \3/8\-inch (0.95-cm) aluminum pipe pressed 
together with a \1/4\-inch (0.64-cm) die. The hoop must be inserted in 
the webbing cone, attached 10 meshes from the apex and laced all the way 
around with heavy twine.
    (j) Installation of the cone in the extension. The cone must be 
installed in the extension 12 inches (30.5 cm) behind the back edge of 
the funnel and attached in four places. The midpoint of a piece of 
number 60 twine 4 ft (1.22 m) in length must be attached to the apex of 
the cone. This piece of twine must be attached to the 28-inch (71.1-cm) 
cable hoop at the center of each of its sides; the points

[[Page 351]]

of attachment for the two pieces of twine must be measured 20 inches 
(50.8 cm) from the midpoint attachment. Two 8-inch (20.3-cm) pieces of 
number 60 twine must be attached to the top and bottom of the 11-inch 
(27.9-cm) cone hoop. The opposite ends of these two pieces of twine must 
be attached to the top and bottom center of the 24-inch (61-cm) cable 
hoop; the points of attachment for the two pieces of twine must be 
measured 4 inches (10.2 cm) from the points where they are tied to the 
11-inch (27.9-cm) cone hoop.
    F. Modified Jones-Davis.
    1. Description. The Modified Jones-Davis BRD is a variation to the 
alternative funnel construction method of the Jones-Davis BRD except the 
funnel is assembled by using depth-stretched and heat-set polyethylene 
webbing instead of the flaps formed from the extension webbing. In 
addition, no hoops are used to hold the BRD open.
    2. Minimum Construction and Installation Requirements. The Modified 
Jones-Davis BRD must contain all of the following.
    (a) Webbing extension. The webbing extension must be constructed 
from a single rectangular piece of 1\5/8\-inch (4.1-cm) stretch mesh 
number 30 nylon with dimensions of 39\1/2\ meshes by 150 meshes. A tube 
is formed from the extension webbing by sewing the 39 1/2-mesh-sides 
together.
    (b) Funnel. The funnel must be constructed from two sections of 1 5/
8-inch (4.1-cm) heat-set and depth-stretched polypropylene or 
polyethylene webbing. The two side sections must be rectangular in 
shape, 25 meshes on the leading edge by 21 meshes deep. The 25-mesh 
leading edge of each polyethylene webbing section must be sewn evenly 
two meshes in from the front of the extension webbing starting 25 meshes 
from the top center on each side. The 21-mesh edge must be sewn to the 
extension webbing on a 9-bar and 1-mesh angle in the top and bottom, 
forming a V-shape funnel.
    (c) Cutting the escape opening. The leading edge of the escape 
openings must be located within 18 inches (45.7 cm) of the posterior 
edge of the turtle excluder device (TED) grid. The area of the escape 
opening must total at least 635 in2 (4,097 cm2). Two escape openings, 6 
meshes wide by 12 meshes deep, must be cut 4 meshes apart in the 
extension webbing, starting at the top center extension seam, 7 meshes 
back from the leading edge, and 30 meshes to the left and to the right 
(total of four openings). The four escape openings must be double 
selvaged for strength.
    (d) Cone fish deflector. The cone fish deflector is constructed of 2 
pieces of 1 5/8-inch (4.1-cm) polypropylene or polyethylene webbing, 40 
meshes wide by 20 meshes in length and cut on the bar on each side 
forming a triangle. Starting at the apex of the two triangles, the two 
pieces must be sewn together to form a cone of webbing. The apex of the 
cone fish deflector must be positioned within 12 inches (30.5 cm) of the 
posterior edge of the funnel.
    (e) 11-inch (27.9-cm) cable hoop for cone deflector. A single hoop 
must be constructed of 5/16-inch (0.79-cm) or 3/8-inch (0.95-cm) cable 
34 \1/2\ inches (87.6 cm) in length. The ends must be joined by a 3-inch 
(7.6-cm) piece of 3/8-inch (0.95-cm) aluminum pipe pressed together with 
a 1/4-inch (0.64-cm) die. The hoop must be inserted in the webbing cone, 
attached 10 meshes from the apex and laced all the way around with heavy 
twine.
    (f) Installation of the cone in the extension. The apex of the cone 
must be installed in the extension within 12 inches (30.5 cm) behind the 
back edge of the funnel and attached in four places. The midpoint of a 
piece of number 60 twine (or at least 4-mesh wide strip of number 21 or 
heavier webbing) 3 ft (1.22 m) in length must be attached to the apex of 
the cone. This piece of twine or webbing must be attached within 5 
meshes of the aft edge of the funnel at the center of each of its sides. 
Two 12-inch (30.5-cm) pieces of number 60 (or heavier) twine must be 
attached to the top and bottom of the 11-inch (27.9-cm) cone hoop. The 
opposite ends of these two pieces of twine must be attached to the top 
and bottom center of the extension webbing to keep the cone from 
inverting into the funnel.
    G. [Reserved]
    H. Cone Fish Deflector Composite Panel.
    1. Description. The Cone Fish Deflector Composite Panel BRD is a 
variation to the alternative funnel construction method of the Jones-
Davis BRD, except the funnel is assembled by using depth-stretched and 
heat-set polyethylene webbing with square mesh panels on the inside 
instead of the flaps formed from the extension webbing. In addition, no 
hoops are used to hold the BRD open.
    2. Minimum Construction and Installation Requirements. The Cone Fish 
Deflector Composite Panel BRD must contain all of the following:
    (a) Webbing extension. The webbing extension must be constructed 
from a single rectangular piece of 1 1/2-inch to 1 3/4-inch (3.8-cm to 
4.5-cm) stretch mesh with dimensions of 24\1/2\ meshes by 150 to 160 
meshes. A tube is formed from the extension webbing piece by sewing the 
24 1/2-mesh sides together. The leading edge of the webbing extension 
must be attached no more than 4 meshes from the posterior edge of the 
TED grid.
    (b) Funnel. The V-shaped funnel consists of two webbing panels 
attached to the extension along the leading edge of the panels. The top 
and bottom edges of the panels are sewn diagonally across the extension 
toward the center to form the funnel. The panels are 2-ply in design, 
each with an inner layer of 1 1/2-inch to 1 5/8-inch (3.8-cm to 4.1-cm) 
heat-set and depth-stretched polyethylene webbing and an outer layer 
constructed of no

[[Page 352]]

larger than 2-inch (5.1-cm) square mesh webbing (1-inch bar). The inner 
webbing layer must be rectangular in shape, 36 meshes on the leading 
edge by 20 meshes deep. The 36-mesh leading edges of the polyethylene 
webbing should be sewn evenly to 24 meshes of the extension webbing 1\1/
2\ meshes from and parallel to the leading edge of the extension 
starting 12 meshes up from the bottom center on each side. Alternately 
sew 2 meshes of the polyethylene webbing to 1 mesh of the extension 
webbing then 1 mesh of the polyethylene webbing to 1 mesh of the 
extension webbing toward the top. The bottom 20-mesh edges of the 
polyethylene layers are sewn evenly to the extension webbing on a 2 bar 
1 mesh angle toward the bottom back center forming a v-shape in the 
bottom of the extension webbing. The top 20-mesh edges of the 
polyethylene layers are sewn evenly along the bars of the extension 
webbing toward the top back center. The square mesh layers must be 
rectangular in shape and constructed of no larger than 2-inch (5.1-cm) 
webbing that is 18 inches (45.7 cm) in length on the leading edge. The 
depth of the square mesh layer must be no more than 2 inches (5.1 cm) 
less than the 20 mesh side of the inner polyethylene layer when 
stretched taught. The 18-inch (45.7-cm) leading edge of each square mesh 
layer must be sewn evenly to the 36-mesh leading edge of the 
polyethylene section and the sides are sewn evenly (in length) to the 
20-mesh edges of the polyethylene webbing. This will form a v-shape 
funnel using the top of the extension webbing as the top of the funnel 
and the bottom of the extension webbing as the bottom of the funnel.
    (c) Cutting the escape opening. There are two escape openings on 
each side of the funnel. The leading edge of the escape openings must be 
located on the same row of meshes in the extension webbing as the 
leading edge of the composite panels. The lower openings are formed by 
starting at the first attachment point of the composite panels and 
cutting 9 meshes in the extension webbing on an even row of meshes 
toward the top of the extension. Next, turn 90 degrees and cut 15 points 
on an even row toward the back of the extension webbing. At this point 
turn and cut 18 bars toward the bottom front of the extension webbing. 
Finish the escape opening by cutting 6 points toward the original 
starting point. The top escape openings start 5 meshes above and mirror 
the lower openings. Starting at the leading edge of the composite panel 
and 5 meshes above the lower escape opening, cut 9 meshes in the 
extension on an even row of meshes toward the top of the extension. 
Next, turn 90 degrees, and cut 6 points on an even row toward the back 
of the extension webbing. Then cut 18 bars toward the bottom back of the 
extension. To complete the escape opening, cut 15 points forward toward 
the original starting point. The area of each escape opening must total 
at least 212 in\2\ (1,368 cm\2\). The four escape openings must be 
double selvaged for strength.
    (d) Cone fish deflector. The cone fish deflector is constructed of 2 
pieces of 1 5/8-inch (4.1-cm) polypropylene or polyethylene webbing, 40 
meshes wide by 20 meshes in length and cut on the bar on each side 
forming a triangle. Starting at the apex of the two triangles, the two 
pieces must be sewn together to form a cone of webbing. The apex of the 
cone fish deflector must be positioned within 12 inches (30.5 cm) of the 
posterior edge of the funnel.
    (e) 11-inch (27.9-cm) cable hoop for cone deflector. A single hoop 
must be constructed of \5/16\-inch (0.79-cm) or \3/8\-inch (0.95-cm) 
cable 34\1/2\ inches (87.6 cm) in length. The ends must be joined by a 
3-inch (7.6-cm) piece of \3/8\-inch (0.95-cm) aluminum pipe pressed 
together with a \1/4\-inch (0.64-cm) die. The hoop must be inserted in 
the webbing cone, attached 10 meshes from the apex and laced all the way 
around with heavy twine.
    (f) Installation of the cone in the extension. The apex of the cone 
must be installed in the extension within 12 inches (30.5 cm) behind the 
back edge of the funnel and attached in four places. The midpoint of a 
piece of number 60 twine (or at least 4-mesh wide strip of number 21 or 
heavier webbing) 3 ft (1.22 m) in length must be attached to the apex of 
the cone. This piece of twine or webbing must be attached within 5 
meshes of the aft edge of the funnel at the center of each of its sides. 
Two 12-inch (30.5-cm) pieces of number 60 (or heavier) twine must be 
attached to the top and bottom of the 11-inch (27.9-cm) cone hoop. The 
opposite ends of these two pieces of twine must be attached to the top 
and bottom center of the extension webbing to keep the cone from 
inverting into the funnel.
    I. Square Mesh Panel (SMP) Composite Panel.
    1. Description. The SMP is a panel of square mesh webbing placed in 
the top of the cod end to provide finfish escape openings.
    2. Minimum Construction and Installation Requirements. The SMP 
Composite Panel BRD must contain all of the following:
    (a) Webbing extension. The webbing extension must be constructed 
from a single rectangular piece of 1 1/2-inch to 1 3/4-inch (3.8-cm to 
4.5-cm) stretch mesh with dimensions of 24\1/2\ meshes by 150 to 160 
meshes. A tube is formed from the extension webbing piece by sewing the 
24 1/2-mesh sides together. The leading edge of the webbing extension 
must be attached no more than 4 meshes from the posterior edge of the 
TED grid.
    (b) Funnel. The V-shaped funnel consists of two webbing panels 
attached to the extension along the leading edge of the panels. The top 
and bottom edges of the panels are sewn diagonally across the extension 
toward the center to form the funnel. The panels are 2-ply in design, 
each with an inner layer of 1

[[Page 353]]

1/2-inch to 15/8-inch (3.8-cm to 4.1-cm) heat-set and depth-stretched 
polyethylene webbing and an outer layer constructed of no larger than 2-
inch (5.1-cm) square mesh webbing (1-inch bar). The inner webbing layer 
must be rectangular in shape, 36 meshes on the leading edge by 20 meshes 
deep. The 36-mesh leading edges of the polyethylene webbing should be 
sewn evenly to 24 meshes of the extension webbing 1\1/2\ meshes from and 
parallel to the leading edge of the extension starting 12 meshes up from 
the bottom center on each side. Alternately sew 2 meshes of the 
polyethylene webbing to 1 mesh of the extension webbing then 1 mesh of 
the polyethylene webbing to 1 mesh of the extension webbing toward the 
top. The bottom 20-mesh edges of the polyethylene layers are sewn evenly 
to the extension webbing on a 2 bar 1 mesh angle toward the bottom back 
center forming a v-shape in the bottom of the extension webbing. The top 
20-mesh edges of the polyethylene layers are sewn evenly along the bars 
of the extension webbing toward the top back center. The square mesh 
layers must be rectangular in shape and constructed of no larger than 2-
inch (5.1-cm) webbing that is 18 inches (45.7 cm) in length on the 
leading edge. The depth of the square mesh layer must be no more than 2 
inches (5.1 cm) less than the 20 mesh side of the inner polyethylene 
layer when stretched taught. The 18-inch (45.7-cm) leading edge of each 
square mesh layer must be sewn evenly to the 36-mesh leading edge of the 
polyethylene section and the sides are sewn evenly (in length) to the 
20-mesh edges of the polyethylene webbing. This will form a v-shape 
funnel using the top of the extension webbing as the top of the funnel 
and the bottom of the extension webbing as the bottom of the funnel.
    (c) Cutting the escape opening. There are two escape openings on 
each side of the funnel. The leading edge of the escape openings must be 
located on the same row of meshes in the extension webbing as the 
leading edge of the composite panels. The lower openings are formed by 
starting at the first attachment point of the composite panels and 
cutting 9 meshes in the extension webbing on an even row of meshes 
toward the top of the extension. Next, turn 90 degrees and cut 15 points 
on an even row toward the back of the extension webbing. At this point 
turn and cut 18 bars toward the bottom front of the extension webbing. 
Finish the escape opening by cutting 6 points toward the original 
starting point. The top escape openings start 5 meshes above and mirror 
the lower openings. Starting at the leading edge of the composite panel 
and 5 meshes above the lower escape opening, cut 9 meshes in the 
extension on an even row of meshes toward the top of the extension. 
Next, turn 90 degrees, and cut 6 points on an even row toward the back 
of the extension webbing. Then cut 18 bars toward the bottom back of the 
extension. To complete the escape opening, cut 15 points forward toward 
the original starting point. The area of each escape opening must total 
at least 212 in\2\ (1,368 cm\2\). The four escape openings must be 
double selvaged for strength.
    (d) SMP. The SMP is constructed from a single piece of square mesh 
webbing with a minimum dimension of 5 squares wide and 12 squares in 
length with a minimum mesh size of 3-inch (76-mm) stretched mesh. The 
maximum twine diameter of the square mesh is number 96 twine (4 mm).
    (e) Cutting the SMP escape opening. The escape opening is a 
rectangular hole cut in the top center of the cod end webbing. The 
posterior edge of the escape opening must be placed no farther forward 
that 8 ft (2.4 m) from the cod end drawstring (tie-off rings). The width 
of the escape opening, as measured across the cod end, must be four cod 
end meshes per square of the SMP (i.e., a cut of 20 cod end meshes for a 
SMP that is 5 meshes wide). The stretched mesh length of the escape 
opening must be equal to the total length of the SMP. No portion of the 
SMP escape opening may be covered with additional material or netting 
such as chaffing webbing, which might impede or prevent fish escapement.
    (f) Installation of the SMP. The SMP must be attached to the edge of 
the escape opening evenly around the perimeter of the escape opening cut 
with heavy twine.

<R05>
 Sec. Appendix F to Part 622--Specifications for Sea Turtle Mitigation 
          Gear and Sea Turtle Handling and Release Requirements

    A. Sea turtle mitigation gear.
    1. Long-handled line clipper or cutter. Line cutters are intended to 
cut high test monofilament line as close as possible to the hook, and 
assist in removing line from entangled sea turtles to minimize any 
remaining gear upon release. NMFS has established minimum design 
standards for the line cutters. The LaForce line cutter and the 
Arceneaux line clipper are models that meet these minimum design 
standards, and may be purchased or fabricated from readily available and 
low-cost materials. One long-handled line clipper or cutter and a set of 
replacement blades are required to be onboard. The minimum design 
standards for line cutters are as follows:
    (a) A protected and secured cutting blade. The cutting blade(s) must 
be capable of cutting 2.0-2.1 mm (0.078 in.-0.083 in.) monofilament line 
(400-lb test) or polypropylene multistrand material, known as braided or 
tarred mainline, and must be maintained in working order. The cutting 
blade must be curved, recessed, contained in a holder, or otherwise 
designed to facilitate its safe use so that direct contact between the 
cutting surface and the sea turtle or the user is prevented. The cutting 
instrument must be securely attached to an extended reach handle and be 
easily replaceable. One extra set of replacement blades meeting these 
standards must also be carried on board to replace all cutting surfaces 
on the line cutter or clipper.

[[Page 355]]

    (b) An extended reach handle. The line cutter blade must be securely 
fastened to an extended reach handle or pole with a minimum length equal 
to, or greater than, 150 percent of the freeboard, or a minimum of 6 ft 
(1.83 m), whichever is greater. It is recommended, but not required, 
that the handle break down into sections. There is no restriction on the 
type of material used to construct this handle as long as it is sturdy 
and facilitates the secure attachment of the cutting blade.
    2. Long-handled dehooker for internal hooks. A long-handled 
dehooking device is intended to remove internal hooks from sea turtles 
that cannot be boated. It should also be used to engage a loose hook 
when a turtle is entangled but not hooked, and line is being removed. 
The design must shield the barb of the hook and prevent it from re-
engaging during the removal process. One long-handled device to remove 
internal hooks is required onboard. The minimum design standards are as 
follows:
    (a) Hook removal device. The hook removal device must be constructed 
of approximately \3/16\-inch (4.76 mm) to \5/16\-inch (7.94 mm) 316 L 
stainless steel or similar material and have a dehooking end no larger 
than 1\7/8\ inches (4.76 cm) outside diameter. The device must securely 
engage and control the leader while shielding the barb to prevent the 
hook from re-engaging during removal. It may not have any unprotected 
terminal points (including blunt ones), as these could cause injury to 
the esophagus during hook removal. The device must be of a size 
appropriate to secure the range of hook sizes and styles used in the 
South Atlantic snapper-grouper fishery.
    (b) Extended reach handle. The dehooking end must be securely 
fastened to an extended reach handle or pole with a minimum length equal 
to or greater than 150 percent of the freeboard, or a minimum of 6 ft 
(1.83 m), whichever is greater. It is recommended, but not required, 
that the handle break down into sections. The handle must be sturdy and 
strong enough to facilitate the secure attachment of the hook removal 
device.
    3. Long-handled dehooker for external hooks. A long-handled dehooker 
is required for use on externally-hooked sea turtles that cannot be 
boated. The long-handled dehooker for internal hooks described in 
paragraph 2. of this appendix F would meet this requirement. The minimum 
design standards are as follows:
    (a) Construction. A long-handled dehooker must be constructed of 
approximately \3/16\-inch (4.76 mm) to \5/16\-inch (7.94 mm) 316 L 
stainless steel rod and have a dehooking end no larger than 1 \7/8\-
inches (4.76 cm) outside diameter. The design should be such that a fish 
hook can be rotated out, without pulling it out at an angle. The 
dehooking end must be blunt with all edges rounded. The device must be 
of a size appropriate to secure the range of hook sizes and styles used 
in the South Atlantic snapper-grouper fishery.
    (b) Extended reach handle. The handle must be a minimum length equal 
to the freeboard of the vessel or 6 ft (1.83 m), whichever is greater.
    4. Long-handled device to pull an ``inverted V''. This tool is used 
to pull a ``V'' in the fishing line when implementing the ``inverted V'' 
dehooking technique, as described in the document entitled ``Careful 
Release Protocols for Sea Turtle Release With Minimal Injury,'' for 
disentangling and dehooking entangled sea turtles. One long-handled 
device to pull an ``inverted V'' is required onboard. If a 6-ft (1.83 m) 
J-style dehooker is used to comply with paragraph 4. of this Appendix F, 
it will also satisfy this requirement. Minimum design standards are as 
follows:
    (a) Hook end. This device, such as a standard boat hook, gaff, or 
long-handled J-style dehooker, must be constructed of stainless steel or 
aluminum. The semicircular or ``J'' shaped end must be securely attached 
to a handle. A sharp point, such as on a gaff hook, is to be used only 
for holding the monofilament fishing line and should never contact the 
sea turtle.
    (b) Extended reach handle. The handle must have a minimum length 
equal to the freeboard of the vessel, or 6 ft (1.83 m), whichever is 
greater. The handle must be sturdy and strong enough to facilitate the 
secure attachment of the gaff hook.
    5. Dipnet. One dipnet is required onboard. Dipnets are to be used to 
facilitate safe handling of sea turtles by allowing them to be brought 
onboard for fishing gear removal, without causing further injury to the 
animal. Turtles must not be brought onboard without the use of a dipnet 
or hoist. The minimum design standards for dipnets are as follows:
    (a) Size of dipnet. The dipnet must have a sturdy net hoop of at 
least 31 inches (78.74 cm) inside diameter and a bag depth of at least 
38 inches (96.52 cm) to accommodate turtles below 3 ft (0.914 m) 
carapace length. The bag mesh openings may not exceed 3 inches (7.62 cm) 
by 3 inches (7.62 cm). There must be no sharp edges or burrs on the 
hoop, or where it is attached to the handle. There is no requirement for 
the hoop to be circular as long as it meets the minimum specifications.
    (b) Extended reach handle. The dipnet hoop must be securely fastened 
to an extended reach handle or pole with a minimum length equal to, or 
greater than, 150 percent of the freeboard, or at least 6 ft (1.83 m), 
whichever is greater. The handle must be made of a rigid material strong 
enough to facilitate the sturdy attachment of the net hoop and be able 
to support a minimum of 100 lb (34.1 kg) without breaking or significant 
bending

[[Page 356]]

or distortion. It is recommended, but not required, that the extended 
reach handle break down into sections.
    6. Cushion/support device. A standard automobile tire (free of 
exposed steel belts), a boat cushion, a large turtle hoist, or any other 
comparable cushioned elevated surface, is required for supporting a 
turtle in an upright orientation while the turtle is onboard. The 
cushion/support device must be appropriately sized to fully support a 
range of turtle sizes.
    7. Short-handled dehooker for internal hooks. One short-handled 
device for removing internal hooks is required onboard. This dehooker is 
designed to remove ingested hooks from boated sea turtles. It can also 
be used on external hooks or hooks in the front of the mouth. Minimum 
design standards are as follows:
    (a) Hook removal device. The hook removal device must be constructed 
of approximately \3/16\-inch (4.76 mm) to \5/16\-inch (7.94 mm) 316 L 
stainless steel, and must allow the hook to be secured and the barb 
shielded without re-engaging during the removal process. It must be no 
larger than 1\7/8\ inches (4.76 cm) outside diameter. It may not have 
any unprotected terminal points (including blunt ones), as this could 
cause injury to the esophagus during hook removal. A sliding PVC bite 
block must be used to protect the beak and facilitate hook removal if 
the turtle bites down on the dehooking device. The bite block should be 
constructed of a \3/4\-inch (1.91 cm) inside diameter high impact 
plastic cylinder (e.g., Schedule 80 PVC) that is 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 
15.2 cm) long to allow for 5 inches (12.7 cm) of slide along the shaft. 
The device must be of a size appropriate to secure the range of hook 
sizes and styles used in the South Atlantic snapper-grouper fishery.
    (b) Handle length. The handle should be approximately 16 to 24 
inches (40.64 cm to 60.69 cm) in length, with approximately a 4 to 6-
inch (10.2 to 15.2-cm) long tube T-handle of approximately 1 inch (2.54 
cm) in diameter.
    8. Short-handled dehooker for external hooks. One short-handled 
dehooker for external hooks is required onboard. The short-handled 
dehooker for internal hooks required to comply with paragraph 7. of this 
Appendix F will also satisfy this requirement. Minimum design standards 
are as follows:
    (a) Hook removal device. The dehooker must be constructed of 
approximately \3/16\-inch (4.76 cm) to \5/16\-inch (7.94 cm) 316 L 
stainless steel, and the design must be such that a hook can be rotated 
out without pulling it out at an angle. The dehooking end must be blunt, 
and all edges rounded. The device must be of a size appropriate to 
secure the range of hook sizes and styles used in the South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper fishery.
    (b) Handle length. The handle should be approximately 16 to 24 
inches (40.64 to 60.69 cm) long with approximately a 5-inch (12.7 cm) 
long tube T-handle, wire loop handle or similar, of approximately 1 inch 
(2.54 cm) in diameter.
    9. Long-nose or needle-nose pliers. One pair of long-nose or needle-
nose pliers is required on board. Required long-nose or needle-nose 
pliers can be used to remove deeply embedded hooks from the turtle's 
flesh that must be twisted during removal or for removing hooks from the 
front of the mouth. They can also hold PVC splice couplings, when used 
as mouth openers, in place. Minimum design standards are as follows:
    (a) General. They must be approximately 12 inches (30.48 cm) in 
length, and should be constructed of stainless steel material.
    (b) [Reserved]
    10. Bolt cutters. One pair of bolt cutters is required on board. 
Required bolt cutters may be used to cut hooks to facilitate their 
removal. They should be used to cut off the eye or barb of a hook, so 
that it can safely be pushed through a sea turtle without causing 
further injury. They should also be used to cut off as much of the hook 
as possible, when the remainder of the hook cannot be removed. Minimum 
design standards are as follows:
    (a) General. They must be approximately 14 to 17 inches (35.56 to 
43.18 cm) in total length, with approximately 4-inch (10.16 cm) long 
blades that are 2\1/4\ inches (5.72 cm) wide, when closed, and with 
approximately 10- to 13-inch (25.4 to 33.02-cm) long handles. Required 
bolt cutters must be able to cut hard metals, such as stainless or 
carbon steel hooks, up to \1/4\-inch (6.35 mm) diameter.
    (b) [Reserved]
    11. Monofilament line cutters. One pair of monofilament line cutters 
is required on board. Required monofilament line cutters must be used to 
remove fishing line as close to the eye of the hook as possible, if the 
hook is swallowed or cannot be removed. Minimum design standards are as 
follows:
    (a) General. Monofilament line cutters must be approximately 7\1/2\ 
inches (19.05 cm) in length. The blades must be 1 inch (4.45 cm) in 
length and \5/8\ inches (1.59 cm) wide, when closed.
    (b) [Reserved]
    12. Mouth openers/mouth gags. Required mouth openers and mouth gags 
are used to open sea turtle mouths, and to keep them open when removing 
internal hooks from boated turtles. They must allow access to the hook 
or line without causing further injury to the turtle. Design standards 
are included in the item descriptions. At least two of the seven 
different types of mouth openers/gags described below are required:
    (a) A block of hard wood. Placed in the corner of the jaw, a block 
of hard wood may be used to gag open a turtle's mouth. A smooth block of 
hard wood of a type that does not splinter (e.g. maple) with rounded 
edges should be sanded smooth, if necessary, and

[[Page 357]]

soaked in water to soften the wood. The dimensions should be 
approximately 11 inches (27.94 cm) by 1 inch (2.54 cm) by 1 inch (2.54 
cm). A long-handled, wire shoe brush with a wooden handle, and with the 
wires removed, is an inexpensive, effective and practical mouth-opening 
device that meets these requirements.
    (b) A set of three canine mouth gags. Canine mouth gags are highly 
recommended to hold a turtle's mouth open, because the gag locks into an 
open position to allow for hands-free operation after it is in place. 
These tools are only for use on small and medium sized turtles, as 
larger turtles may be able to crush the mouth gag. A set of canine mouth 
gags must include one of each of the following sizes: small (5 inches) 
(12.7 cm), medium (6 inches) (15.24 cm), and large (7 inches) (17.78 
cm). They must be constructed of stainless steel. The ends must be 
covered with clear vinyl tubing, friction tape, or similar, to pad the 
surface.
    (c) A set of two sturdy dog chew bones. Placed in the corner of a 
turtle's jaw, canine chew bones are used to gag open a sea turtle's 
mouth. Required canine chews must be constructed of durable nylon, 
zylene resin, or thermoplastic polymer, and strong enough to withstand 
biting without splintering. To accommodate a variety of turtle beak 
sizes, a set must include one large (5\1/2\-8 inches (13.97 cm-20.32 cm) 
in length), and one small (3\1/2\-4\1/2\ inches (8.89 cm-11.43 cm) in 
length) canine chew bones.
    (d) A set of two rope loops covered with protective tubing. A set of 
two pieces of poly braid rope covered with light duty garden hose or 
similar flexible tubing each tied or spliced into a loop to provide a 
one-handed method for keeping the turtle's mouth open during hook and/or 
line removal. A required set consists of two 3-ft (0.91 m) lengths of 
poly braid rope (\3/8\-inch (9.52 mm) diameter suggested), each covered 
with an 8-inch (20.32 cm) section of \1/2\ inch (1.27 cm) or \3/4\ inch 
(1.91 cm) tubing, and each tied into a loop. The upper loop of rope 
covered with hose is secured on the upper beak to give control with one 
hand, and the second piece of rope covered with hose is secured on the 
lower beak to give control with the user's foot.
    (e) A hank of rope. Placed in the corner of a turtle's jaw, a hank 
of rope can be used to gag open a sea turtle's mouth. A 6-ft (1.83 m) 
lanyard of approximately \3/16\-inch (4.76 mm) braided nylon rope may be 
folded to create a hank, or looped bundle, of rope. Any size soft-
braided nylon rope is allowed, however it must create a hank of 
approximately 2-4 inches (5.08 cm-10.16 cm) in thickness.
    (f) A set of four PVC splice couplings. PVC splice couplings can be 
positioned inside a turtle's mouth to allow access to the back of the 
mouth for hook and line removal. They are to be held in place with the 
needle-nose pliers. To ensure proper fit and access, a required set must 
consist of the following Schedule 40 PVC splice coupling sizes: 1 inch 
(2.54 cm), 1\1/4\ inch (3.18 cm), 1\1/2\ inch (3.81 cm), and 2 inches 
(5.08 cm).
    (g) A large avian oral speculum. A large avian oral speculum 
provides the ability to hold a turtle's mouth open and to control the 
head with one hand, while removing a hook with the other hand. The avian 
oral speculum must be 9 inches (22.86 cm) long, and constructed of \3/
16\-inch (4.76 mm) wire diameter surgical stainless steel (Type 304). It 
must be covered with 8 inches (20.32 cm) of clear vinyl tubing (\5/16\-
inch (7.9 mm) outside diameter, \3/16\-inch (4.76 mm) inside diameter), 
friction tape, or similar to pad the surface.
    B. Sea turtle handling and release requirements. Sea turtle bycatch 
mitigation gear, as specified in paragraphs A.1. through 4. of this 
Appendix F, must be used to disengage any hooked or entangled sea 
turtles that cannot be brought onboard. Sea turtle bycatch mitigation 
gear, as specified in paragraphs A.5. through 12. of this Appendix F, 
must be used to facilitate access, safe handling, disentanglement, and 
hook removal or hook cutting of sea turtles that can be brought onboard, 
where feasible. Sea turtles must be handled, and bycatch mitigation gear 
must be used, in accordance with the careful release protocols and 
handling/release guidelines specified in Sec. 622.10(c)(1), and in 
accordance with the onboard handling and resuscitation requirements 
specified in Sec. 223.206(d)(1)of this title.
    1. Boated turtles. When practicable, active and comatose sea turtles 
must be brought on board, with a minimum of injury, using a dipnet as 
specified in paragraph A.5. of this appendix F. All turtles less than 3 
ft (.91 m) carapace length should be boated, if sea conditions permit.
    (a) A boated turtle should be placed on a cushioned/support device, 
as specified in paragraph A.6. of this appendix F, in an upright 
orientation to immobilize it and facilitate gear removal. Then, it 
should be determined if the hook can be removed without causing further 
injury. All externally embedded hooks should be removed, unless hook 
removal would result in further injury to the turtle. No attempt to 
remove a hook should be made if it has been swallowed and the insertion 
point is not visible, or if it is determined that removal would result 
in further injury. If a hook cannot be removed, as much line as possible 
should be removed from the turtle using monofilament cutters as 
specified in paragraph A.11. of this appendix F, and the hook should be 
cut as close as possible to the insertion point before releasing the 
turtle, using bolt cutters as specified in paragraph A.10. of this 
appendix F. If a hook can be removed, an effective technique may be to 
cut off either the barb, or the eye, of the hook using bolt cutters, and 
then to slide

[[Page 358]]

the hook out. When the hook is visible in the front of the mouth, a 
mouth-opener, as specified in paragraph A.12. of this appendix F, may 
facilitate opening the turtle's mouth and a gag may facilitate keeping 
the mouth open. Short-handled dehookers for internal hooks, or long-nose 
or needle-nose pliers, as specified in paragraphs A.7. and A.8. of this 
appendix F, respectively, should be used to remove visible hooks from 
the mouth that have not been swallowed on boated turtles, as 
appropriate. As much gear as possible must be removed from the turtle 
without causing further injury prior to its release. Refer to the 
careful release protocols and handling/release guidelines required in 
Sec. 622.10(c)(1), and the handling and resuscitation requirements 
specified in Sec. 223.206(d)(1) of this title, for additional 
information.
    (b) [Reserved]
    2. Non-boated turtles. If a sea turtle is too large, or hooked in a 
manner that precludes safe boating without causing further damage or 
injury to the turtle, sea turtle bycatch mitigation gear specified in 
paragraphs A.1. through 4. of this appendix F must be used to 
disentangle sea turtles from fishing gear and disengage any hooks, or to 
clip the line and remove as much line as possible from a hook that 
cannot be removed, prior to releasing the turtle, in accordance with the 
protocols specified in Sec. 622.10(c)(1).
    (a) Non-boated turtles should be brought close to the boat and 
provided with time to calm down. Then, it must be determined whether or 
not the hook can be removed without causing further injury. All 
externally embedded hooks must be removed, unless hook removal would 
result in further injury to the turtle. No attempt should be made to 
remove a hook if it has been swallowed, or if it is determined that 
removal would result in further injury. If the hook cannot be removed 
and/or if the animal is entangled, as much line as possible must be 
removed prior to release, using a line cutter as specified in paragraph 
A.1. of this appendix F. If the hook can be removed, it must be removed 
using a long-handled dehooker as specified in paragraphs A.2. and A.3. 
of this Appendix F. Without causing further injury, as much gear as 
possible must be removed from the turtle prior to its release. Refer to 
the careful release protocols and handling/release guidelines required 
in Sec. 622.10(c)(1), and the handling and resuscitation requirements 
specified in Sec. 223.206(d)(1) for additional information.
    (b) [Reserved]

<R05>
Sec. 635.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The regulations in this part govern the conservation and 
management of Atlantic tunas, Atlantic billfish, Atlantic sharks, and 
Atlantic swordfish under the authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Act and 
ATCA. They implement the 2006 Consolidated Highly Migratory Species 
Fishery Management Plan and its amendments. The Atlantic tunas 
regulations govern conservation and management of Atlantic tunas in the 
management unit. The Atlantic billfish regulations govern conservation 
and management of Atlantic billfish in the management unit. The Atlantic 
swordfish regulations govern conservation and management of North and 
South Atlantic swordfish in the management unit. North Atlantic 
swordfish are managed under the authority of both ATCA and the Magnuson-
Stevens Act. South Atlantic swordfish are managed under the sole 
authority of ATCA. The shark regulations govern conservation and 
management of sharks in the management unit, under the authority of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (b) Under section 9(d) of ATCA, NMFS has determined that the 
regulations contained in this part with respect to Atlantic tunas are 
applicable within the territorial sea of the United States adjacent to, 
and within the boundaries of, the States of New Hampshire, 
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, 
Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, 
Louisiana and Texas, and the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Virgin 
Islands. NMFS will undertake a continuing review of State regulations to 
determine if regulations applicable to Atlantic tunas, swordfish or 
billfish are at least as restrictive as regulations contained in this 
part and if such regulations are effectively enforced. In such case, 
NMFS will file with the Office of the Federal Register for publication 
notification of the basis for the determination and of the specific 
regulations that shall or shall not apply in the territorial sea of the 
identified State.

Sec. 635.4  Permits and fees.

    Information on permits and permit requirements may be obtained from 
the Division Chief or where otherwise stated in this part.
    (a) General--(1) Authorized activities. Each permit issued by NMFS 
authorizes certain activities, and persons may not conduct these 
activities without the appropriate permit, unless otherwise authorized 
by NMFS in accordance with this part. In certain cases, additional 
permits may be required to authorize these same or related activities 
under federal, state or local jurisdictions.
    (2) Vessel permit inspection. The owner or operator of a vessel of 
the United States must have the appropriate valid permit on board the 
vessel to fish for, take, retain, or possess Atlantic HMS when engaged 
in recreational fishing and to fish for, take, retain or possess 
Atlantic tunas, swordfish, or sharks when engaged in commercial fishing. 
The vessel operator must make such permit available for inspection upon 
request by NMFS or by a person authorized by NMFS. The owner of the 
vessel is responsible for satisfying all of the requirements associated 
with obtaining, maintaining, and making available for inspection all 
required vessel permits.
    (3) Property rights. Limited access vessel permits or any other 
permit issued pursuant to this part do not represent either an absolute 
right to the resource or any interest that is subject to the takings 
provision of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Rather, 
limited access vessel permits represent only a harvesting privilege that 
may be revoked, suspended, or amended subject to the requirements of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act or other applicable law.
    (4) Dealer permit inspection. A dealer permit issued under this 
section, or a copy thereof, must be available at each of the dealer's 
places of business. A dealer must present the permit or a copy for 
inspection upon the request of a NMFS-authorized officer.
    (5) Display upon offloading. Upon offloading of Atlantic HMS, the 
owner or operator of the harvesting vessel must present for inspection 
the vessel's HMS Charter/Headboat permit; Atlantic tunas, shark, or 
swordfish permit; Incidental HMS squid trawl; and/or the shark research 
permit to the first receiver. The permit(s) must be presented prior to 
completing any applicable landing report specified at Sec. 635.5(a)(1), 
(a)(2), and (b)(2)(i).

[[Page 366]]

    (6) Sanctions and denials. A permit issued under this section may be 
revoked, suspended, or modified, and a permit application may be denied, 
in accordance with the procedures governing enforcement-related permit 
sanctions and denials found at subpart D of 15 CFR part 904.
    (7) Alteration. A vessel or dealer permit that is altered, erased, 
mutilated, or otherwise modified is invalid.
    (8) Replacement. NMFS may issue a replacement permit upon the 
request of the permittee. An application for a replacement permit will 
not be considered a new application. An appropriate fee, consistent with 
paragraph (b) of this section, may be charged for issuance of the 
replacement permit.
    (9) Fees. NMFS may charge a fee for each application for a permit or 
for each transfer or replacement of a permit. The amount of the fee is 
calculated in accordance with the procedures of the NOAA Finance 
Handbook, available from NMFS, for determining administrative costs of 
each special product or service. The fee may not exceed such costs and 
is specified in the instructions provided with each application form. 
Each applicant must include the appropriate fee with each application or 
request for transfer or replacement. A permit will not be issued to 
anyone who fails to pay the fee.
    (10) Permit condition. An owner of a vessel with a valid swordfish, 
shark, HMS Angling, HMS Charter/Headboat, or Incidental HMS squid trawl 
permit issued pursuant to this part must agree, as a condition of such 
permit, that the vessel's HMS fishing, catch, and gear are subject to 
the requirements of this part during the period of validity of the 
permit, without regard to whether such fishing occurs in the U.S. EEZ, 
or outside the U.S. EEZ, and without regard to where such HMS, or gear, 
are possessed, taken, or landed. However, when a vessel fishes within 
the waters of a state that has more restrictive regulations pertaining 
to HMS, persons aboard the vessel must abide by the state's more 
restrictive regulations.
    (b) HMS Charter/Headboat permits. (1) The owner of a charter boat or 
headboat used to fish for, take, retain, or possess any Atlantic HMS 
must obtain an HMS Charter/Headboat permit. A vessel issued an HMS 
Charter/Headboat permit for a fishing year shall not be issued an HMS 
Angling permit or an Atlantic Tunas permit in any category for that same 
fishing year, regardless of a change in the vessel's ownership.
    (2) While persons aboard a vessel that has been issued an HMS 
Charter/Headboat permit are fishing for or are in possession of Atlantic 
HMS, the operator of the vessel must have a valid Merchant Marine 
License or Uninspected Passenger Vessel License, as applicable, issued 
by the U.S. Coast Guard pursuant to regulations at 46 CFR part 10. Such 
Coast Guard license must be carried on board the vessel.
    (c) HMS Angling permits. (1) The owner of any vessel used to fish 
recreationally for Atlantic HMS or on which Atlantic HMS are retained or 
possessed recreationally, must obtain an HMS Angling permit, except as 
provided in Sec. 635.4(c)(2). Atlantic HMS caught, retained, possessed, 
or landed by persons on board vessels with an HMS Angling permit may not 
be sold or transferred to any person for a commercial purpose. A vessel 
issued an HMS Angling permit for a fishing year shall not be issued an 
HMS Charter/Headboat permit or an Atlantic Tunas permit in any category 
for that same fishing year, regardless of a change in the vessel's 
ownership.
    (2) A vessel with a valid Atlantic Tunas General category permit 
issued under paragraph (d) of this section may fish in a recreational 
HMS fishing tournament if the vessel has registered for, paid an entry 
fee to, and is fishing under the rules of a tournament that has 
registered with NMFS' HMS Management Division as required under Sec. 
635.5(d). When a vessel issued a valid Atlantic Tunas General category 
permit is fishing in such a tournament, such vessel must comply with HMS 
Angling category regulations, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of 
this section.
    (3) A vessel issued an Atlantic Tunas General category permit 
fishing in a tournament, as authorized under Sec. 635.4(c)(2), shall 
comply with Atlantic Tunas General category regulations

[[Page 367]]

when fishing for, retaining, possessing, or landing Atlantic tunas.
    (d) Atlantic Tunas vessel permits. (1) The owner of each vessel used 
to fish for or take Atlantic tunas commercially or on which Atlantic 
tunas are retained or possessed with the intention of sale must obtain 
an HMS Charter/Headboat permit issued under paragraph (b) of this 
section, or an Atlantic tunas permit in one, and only one, of the 
following categories: General, Harpoon, Longline, Purse Seine, or Trap.
    (2) Persons aboard a vessel with a valid Atlantic Tunas, HMS 
Angling, or HMS Charter/Headboat permit may fish for, take, retain, or 
possess Atlantic tunas, but only in compliance with the quotas, catch 
limits, size classes, and gear applicable to the permit category of the 
vessel from which he or she is fishing. Persons may sell Atlantic tunas 
only if the harvesting vessel has a valid permit in the General, 
Harpoon, Longline, Purse Seine, or Trap category of the Atlantic Tunas 
permit or a valid HMS Charter/Headboat permit.
    (3) A vessel issued an Atlantic Tunas permit in any category for a 
fishing year shall not be issued an HMS Angling permit, HMS Charter/
Headboat permit, or an Atlantic Tunas permit in any other category for 
that same fishing year, regardless of a change in the vessel's 
ownership.
    (4) A person can obtain a limited access Atlantic Tunas Longline 
category permit for a vessel only if the vessel has been issued both a 
limited access permit for shark and a limited access permit, other than 
handgear, for swordfish. Limited access Atlantic Tunas Longline category 
permits may only be obtained through transfer from current owners 
consistent with the provisions under paragraph (l)(2) of this section.
    (5) An owner of a vessel with an Atlantic Tunas permit in the Purse 
Seine category may transfer the permit to another purse seine vessel 
that he or she owns. In either case, the owner must submit a written 
request for transfer to NMFS, to an address designated by NMFS, and 
attach an application for the new vessel and the existing permit. NMFS 
will issue no more than 5 Atlantic Tunas Purse Seine category permits.
    (e) Shark vessel permits. (1) The owner of each vessel used to fish 
for or take Atlantic sharks or on which Atlantic sharks are retained, 
possessed with an intention to sell, or sold must obtain, in addition to 
any other required permits, at least one of the Federal Atlantic 
commercial shark permits described below. A Federal Atlantic commercial 
shark permit is not required if the vessel is recreationally fishing and 
retains no more sharks than the recreational retention limit specified 
in Sec. 635.22(c), is operating pursuant to the conditions of a shark 
display or EFP issued pursuant to Sec. 635.32, or fishes exclusively 
within State waters. It is a rebuttable presumption that the owner or 
operator of a vessel without a permit issued pursuant to this part on 
which sharks are possessed in excess of the recreational retention 
limits intends to sell the sharks.
    (2) The owner of vessels that fish for, take, retain, or possess the 
Atlantic oceanic sharks listed in sections A, B, or C of Table 1 of 
Appendix A with an intention to sell must obtain either a Federal 
Atlantic commercial shark directed or shark incidental limited access 
permit. The only valid Federal commercial shark directed and shark 
incidental limited access permits are those that have been issued under 
the limited access program consistent with the provisions under 
paragraphs (l) and (m) of this section.
    (3) A vessel owner issued or required to be issued a Federal 
Atlantic commercial shark directed or shark incidental limited access 
permit may harvest, consistent with the other regulations in this part, 
any shark species listed in sections A, B, or C of table 1 of appendix 
A.
    (4) [Reserved]
    (f) Swordfish vessel LAPs. (1) Except as specified in paragraph (n) 
of this section, the owner of each vessel used to fish for or take 
Atlantic swordfish or on which Atlantic swordfish are retained or 
possessed with an intention to sell or from which Atlantic swordfish are 
sold must obtain, in addition to any other required permits, only one of 
three types of commercial limited

[[Page 368]]

access swordfish permits: Swordfish directed limited access permit, 
swordfish incidental limited access permit, or swordfish handgear 
limited access permit. It is a rebuttable presumption that the owner or 
operator of a vessel on which swordfish are possessed in excess of the 
recreational retention limits intends to sell the swordfish.
    (2) The only valid commercial Federal vessel permits for swordfish 
are those that have been issued under the limited access program 
consistent with the provisions under paragraphs (l) and (m) of this 
section, or those issued under paragraph (n) of this section.
    (3) A commercial Federal permit for swordfish is not required if the 
vessel is recreational fishing.
    (4) Unless the owner has been issued a swordfish handgear permit, a 
limited access permit for swordfish is valid only when the vessel has on 
board a valid limited access permit for shark and a valid Atlantic Tunas 
Longline category permit issued for such vessel.
    (g) Dealer permits--(1) Atlantic tunas. A person that receives, 
purchases, trades for, or barters for Atlantic tunas from a fishing 
vessel of the United States, as defined under Sec. 600.10 of this 
chapter, must possess a valid dealer permit.

barters for Atlantic swordfish from a fishing vessel of the United 
States, as defined under Sec. 600.10 of this chapter, must possess a 
valid dealer permit.
    (h) Applications for permits. An owner of a vessel or a dealer must 
submit to NMFS, at an address designated by NMFS, a complete application 
and required supporting documents at least 30 days before the date on 
which the permit is to be made effective. Application forms and 
instructions for their completion are available from NMFS.
    (1) Atlantic Tunas, HMS Angling, HMS Charter/Headboat, and 
Incidental HMS squid trawl vessel permits. (i) An applicant must provide 
all information concerning his or her identification, vessel, gear used,

owner must submit such information to an address designated by NMFS.
    (iii) NMFS may require an applicant to provide documentation 
supporting the application before a permit is issued or to substantiate 
why such permit should not be revoked or otherwise sanctioned under 
paragraph (a)(7) of this section.
    (iv) An applicant for an incidental HMS squid trawl permit must 
submit, in addition to all other information specified in Sec. 
635.4(h)(1), a copy of a valid Illex squid moratorium permit, as 
described at Sec. 648.4(a)(5)(i) of this chapter.
    (2) Limited access permits for swordfish and shark. See paragraph 
(l) of this section for transfers of LAPs for shark and swordfish. See 
paragraph (m) of this section for renewals of LAPs for shark and 
swordfish.
    (3) Dealer permits. (i) An applicant for a dealer permit must 
provide all the information requested on the application form necessary 
to identify the company, its principal place of business, and mechanisms 
by which the company can be contacted.
    (ii) An applicant must also submit a copy of each state wholesaler's 
license held by the dealer and, if a business is owned by a corporation

a manner and/or to a location designated by

[[Page 369]]

NMFS. For certain information changes, a new permit may be issued to 
incorporate the new information, subject to limited access provisions 
specified in paragraph (l)(2) of this section. NMFS may require 
supporting documentation before a new permit will be issued. If a change 
in the permit information is not reported within 30 days, the permit is 
void as of the 31st day after such change.
    (j) Permit issuance. (1) NMFS will issue a permit within 30 days of 
receipt of a complete and qualifying application. An application is 
complete when all requested forms, information, and documentation have 
been received, including all reports and fishing or catch information 
required to be submitted under this part.
    (2) NMFS will notify the applicant of any deficiency in the 
application, including failure to provide information or reports 
required to be submitted under this part. If the applicant fails to 
correct the deficiency within 30 days following the date of 
notification, the application will be considered abandoned.
    (3) A vessel owner issued an Atlantic tunas permit in the General, 
Harpoon, or Trap category or an Atlantic HMS permit in the Angling or 
Charter/Headboat category under paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this 
section may change the category of the vessel permit once within 10 
calendar days of the date of issuance of the permit. After 10 calendar 
days from the date of issuance of the permit, the vessel owner may not 
change the permit category until the following fishing season, except 
during the period of January 1, 2008, through May 31, 2008, when one 
additional change is authorized.
    (k) Duration. A permit issued under this section will be valid for 
the period specified on it unless it is revoked, suspended, or modified 
pursuant to subpart D of 15 CFR part 904, the vessel or dealership is 
sold, or any other information previously submitted on the application 
changes, as specified in paragraph (i) of this section.
    (l) Transfer-- 1) General. A permit issued under this section is not 
transferable or assignable to another vessel or owner or dealer; it is 
valid only for the vessel or owner or dealer to whom it is issued. If a 
person acquires a vessel or dealership and wants to conduct activities 
for which a permit is required, that person must apply for a permit in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (h) of this section or, if 
the acquired vessel is permitted in either the shark, swordfish, or tuna 
longline fishery, in accordance with paragraph (l)(2) of this section. 
If the acquired vessel or dealership is currently permitted, an 
application must be accompanied by the original permit, by a copy of a 
signed bill of sale or equivalent acquisition papers, and the 
appropriate workshop certificates as specified in Sec. 635.8.
    (2) Shark, swordfish, and tuna longline LAPs. (i) Subject to the 
restrictions on upgrading the harvesting capacity of permitted vessels 
in paragraphs (l)(2)(ii) or (x) of this section, as applicable, and to 
the limitations on ownership of permitted vessels in paragraph 
(l)(2)(iii) of this section, an owner may transfer a shark or swordfish 
LAP or an Atlantic Tunas Longline category permit to another vessel that 
he or she owns or to another person. Directed handgear LAPs for 
swordfish may be transferred to another vessel but only for use with 
handgear and subject to the upgrading restrictions in paragraph 
(l)(2)(ii) of this section and the limitations on ownership of permitted 
vessels in paragraph (l)(2)(iii) of this section. Incidental catch LAPs 
are not subject to the requirements specified in paragraphs 
(l)(2)(ii),(iii), and (x) of this section.
    (ii) Except as specified in paragraph (l)(2)(x) of this section, an 
owner may upgrade a vessel with a shark, swordfish, or tuna longline 
limited access permit, or transfer the limited access permit to another 
vessel, and be eligible to retain or renew a limited access permit only 
if the upgrade or transfer does not result in an increase in horsepower 
of more than 20 percent or an increase of more than 10 percent in length 
overall, gross registered tonnage, or net tonnage from the vessel 
baseline specifications.
    (A) The vessel baseline specifications are the respective 
specifications (length overall, gross registered tonnage, net tonnage, 
horsepower) of the first vessel that was issued an initial

[[Page 370]]

limited access permit or, if applicable, of that vessel's replacement 
owned as of May 28, 1999.
    (B) Subsequent to the issuance of a limited access permit, the 
vessel's horsepower may be increased, relative to the baseline 
specifications of the vessel initially issued the LAP, through 
refitting, replacement, or transfer. Such an increase may not exceed 20 
percent of the baseline specifications of the vessel initially issued 
the LAP.
    (C) Subsequent to the issuance of a limited access permit, the 
vessel's length overall, gross registered tonnage, and net tonnage may 
be increased, relative to the baseline specifications of the vessel 
initially issued the LAP, through refitting, replacement, or transfer. 
An increase in any of these three specifications of vessel size may not 
exceed 10 percent of the baseline specifications of the vessel initially 
issued the LAP. This type of upgrade may be done separately from an 
engine horsepower upgrade.
    (iii) No person or entity may own or control more than 5 percent of 
the vessels for which swordfish directed, shark directed or tuna 
longline limited access permits have been issued.
    (iv) In order to transfer a swordfish, shark or tuna longline 
limited access permit to a replacement vessel, the owner of the vessel 
issued the limited access permit must submit a request to NMFS, at an 
address designated by NMFS, to transfer the limited access permit to 
another vessel, subject to requirements specified in paragraphs 
(l)(2)(ii) or (x) of this section, if applicable. The owner must return 
the current valid limited access permit to NMFS with a complete 
application for a limited access permit, as specified in paragraph (h) 
of this section, for the replacement vessel. Copies of both vessels' 
U.S. Coast Guard documentation or state registration must accompany the 
application.
    (v) For swordfish, shark, and tuna longline limited access permit 
transfers to a different person, the transferee must submit a request to 
NMFS, at an address designated by NMFS, to transfer the original limited 
access permit(s), subject to the requirements specified in paragraphs 
(l)(2)(ii), (iii), and (x) of this section, if applicable. The following 
must accompany the completed application: The original limited access 
permit(s) with signatures of both parties to the transaction on the back 
of the permit(s) and the bill of sale for the permit(s). A person must 
include copies of both vessels' U.S. Coast Guard documentation or state 
registration for limited access permit transfers involving vessels.
    (vi) For limited access permit transfers in conjunction with the 
sale of the permitted vessel, the transferee of the vessel and limited 
access permit(s) issued to that vessel must submit a request to NMFS, at 
an address designated by NMFS, to transfer the limited access permit(s), 
subject to the requirements specified in paragraphs (l)(2)(ii), (iii), 
and (x) of this section, if applicable. The following must accompany the 
completed application: The original limited access permit(s) with 
signatures of both parties to the transaction on the back of the 
permit(s), the bill of sale for the limited access permit(s) and the 
vessel, and a copy of the vessel's U.S. Coast Guard documentation or 
state registration.
    (vii) The owner of a vessel issued a limited access permit(s) who 
sells the permitted vessel but retains the limited access permit(s) must 
notify NMFS within 30 days after the sale of the change in application 
information in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section. If the 
owner wishes to transfer the limited access permit(s) to a replacement 
vessel, he/she must apply according to the procedures in paragraph 
(l)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (viii) As specified in paragraph (f)(4) of this section, a directed 
or incidental LAP for swordfish, a directed or an incidental catch LAP 
for shark, and an Atlantic Tunas Longline category permit are required 
to retain swordfish for commercial purposes. Accordingly, a LAP for 
swordfish obtained by transfer without either a directed or incidental 
catch shark LAP or an Atlantic tunas Longline category permit will not 
entitle an owner or operator to use a vessel to fish in the swordfish 
fishery.
    (ix) As specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, a directed or 
incidental LAP for swordfish, a directed or an incidental catch LAP for 
shark, and an

[[Page 371]]

Atlantic Tunas Longline category permit are required to retain Atlantic 
tunas taken by pelagic longline gear. Accordingly, an Atlantic Tunas 
Longline category permit obtained by transfer without either a directed 
or incidental catch swordfish or shark LAP will not entitle an owner or 
operator to use the permitted vessel to fish in the Atlantic tunas 
fishery with pelagic longline gear.
    (x) The owner of a vessel that, on August 6, 2007, concurrently 
possesses, or is eligible to renew, a directed or incidental swordfish 
limited access permit, a directed or incidental shark limited access 
permit, and an Atlantic Tunas Longline category permit is eligible to 
upgrade that vessel, or transfer its limited access permits to another 
vessel, subject to the following restrictions:
    (A) For eligible vessels, as defined in paragraph (l)(2)(x), any 
increase in the three specifications of vessel size (length overall, 
gross registered tonnage, and net tonnage), whether through refitting, 
replacement, or transfer, may not exceed 35 percent of the vessel 
baseline specifications, as defined in paragraph (l)(2)(ii)(A) of this 
section. Horsepower for eligible vessels is not limited for purposes 
vessel upgrades or permit transfers under paragraph (l)(2)(x).
    (B) If a vessel owner wants to request a transfer of limited access 
permits in order to be eligible for the upgrading restrictions under 
paragraph (l)(2)(x), the transferee must submit a complete 
application(s), as specified in paragraphs (h),(i),(j), and (l)(1) of 
this section, according to the procedures at paragraphs (l)(2)(iv), (v), 
or (vi) of this section, as applicable, to an address designated by 
NMFS, so that the completed application(s) are received by NMFS by 
August 6, 2007. Vessels will not be eligible for the upgrading 
restrictions under paragraph (l)(2)(x) if applications are incomplete or 
received after August 6, 2007.
    (C) Owners of directed or incidental swordfish limited access 
permit(s), directed or incidental shark limited access permit(s), and 
Atlantic Tunas Longline category permit(s) that are not assigned to a 
specific vessel may request transfer of these permits to a vessel in 
order to be eligible for the upgrading restrictions under paragraph 
(l)(2)(x). The transferee must submit complete applications, as 
specified in paragraphs (h),(i),(j), and (l)(1) of this section, 
according to the procedures at paragraphs (l)(2)(iv), (v), or (vi) of 
this section, as applicable, to an address designated by NMFS, so that 
the completed applications are received by NMFS by August 6, 2007. 
Vessels will not be eligible for the upgrading restrictions under 
paragraph (l)(2)(x) if applications are incomplete or received by NMFS 
after August 6, 2007.
    (m) Renewal--(1) General. Persons must apply annually for a dealer 
permit for Atlantic tunas, sharks, and swordfish, and for an Atlantic 
HMS Angling, HMS Charter/Headboat, tunas, shark, swordfish, or 
Incidental HMS squid trawl vessel permit. Except as specified in the 
instructions for automated renewals, persons must submit a renewal 
application to NMFS, along with a copy of the applicable valid workshop 
certificate or certificates, if required pursuant to Sec. 635.8, at an 
address designated by NMFS, at least 30 days before a permit's 
expiration to avoid a lapse of permitted status. NMFS will renew a 
permit if the specific requirements for the requested permit are met, 
including those described in paragraphs (h)(1)(iv) and (l)(2) of this 
section; all reports required under the Magnuson-Stevens Act and ATCA 
have been submitted, including those described in Sec. 635.5 and Sec. 
300.185 of this title; the applicant is not subject to a permit sanction 
or denial under paragraph (a)(6) of this section; and the workshop 
requirements specified in Sec. 635.8 are met.
    (2) Shark and swordfish LAPs. The owner of a vessel of the U.S. that 
fishes for, possesses, lands or sells shark or swordfish from the 
management unit, or that takes or possesses such shark or swordfish as 
incidental catch, must have the applicable limited access permit(s) 
issued pursuant to the requirements in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this 
section, except as specified in paragraph (n) of this section. Only 
persons holding non-expired shark and swordfish limited access permit(s) 
in the preceding year are eligible to renew those limited access 
permit(s). Transferors may not renew limited access permits

[[Page 372]]

that have been transferred according to the procedures in paragraph (l) 
of this section.
    (n) Incidental HMS Squid Trawl permits.--(1) The owner of a vessel 
in the squid trawl fishery, as described at Sec. 635.24(b)(2), on which 
Atlantic swordfish are retained, or possessed with an intention to sell, 
or from which Atlantic swordfish are sold must obtain, in addition to 
any other required permits, an Incidental HMS squid trawl permit.
    (2) An Incidental HMS squid trawl permit is valid only when the 
vessel has on board a valid Illex squid moratorium permit, as described 
at Sec. 648.4(a)(5)(i) of this chapter, and no commercial fishing gear 
other than trawl gear.

    (5) Display upon offloading. Upon offloading of Atlantic HMS, the 
owner or operator of the harvesting vessel must present for inspection 
the vessel's HMS Charter/Headboat permit; Atlantic tunas, shark, or 
swordfish permit; Incidental HMS squid trawl; HMS Commercial Caribbean 
Small Boat permit; and/or the shark research permit to the first

    (10) Permit condition. An owner of a vessel with a valid swordfish, 
shark, HMS Angling, HMS Charter/Headboat, Incidental HMS squid trawl, or 
HMS Commercial Caribbean Small Boat permit issued pursuant to this part 
must agree, as a condition of such permit, that the vessel's HMS 
fishing, catch, and gear are subject to the requirements of this part 
during the period of validity of the permit, without regard to whether 
such fishing occurs in the U.S. EEZ, or outside the U.S. EEZ, and 
without regard to where such HMS, or gear, are possessed, taken, or 
landed. However, when a vessel fishes within the waters of a state that 
has more restrictive regulations pertaining to HMS, persons aboard the 
vessel must abide by the state's more restrictive regulations.

                                * * * * *

    (d) Atlantic Tunas vessel permits. (1) The owner of each vessel used 
to fish for or take Atlantic tunas commercially or on which Atlantic 
tunas are retained or possessed with the intention of sale must obtain 
an HMS Charter/Headboat permit issued under paragraph (b) of this 
section, an HMS Commercial Caribbean Small Boat permit issued under 
paragraph (o) of this section, or an Atlantic tunas permit in one, and 
only one, of the following categories: General, Harpoon, Longline, Purse 
Seine, or Trap.
    (2) Persons aboard a vessel with a valid Atlantic Tunas, HMS 
Angling, HMS Charter/Headboat, or an HMS Commercial Caribbean Small Boat 
permit may fish for, take, retain, or possess Atlantic tunas, but only 
in compliance with the quotas, catch limits, size classes, and gear 
applicable to the permit or permit category of the vessel from which he 
or she is fishing. Persons may sell Atlantic tunas only if the 
harvesting vessel has a valid permit in the General, Harpoon, Longline, 
Purse Seine, or Trap category of the Atlantic Tunas permit, a valid HMS

[[Page 373]]

Charter/Headboat, or an HMS Commercial Caribbean Small Boat permit.
    (3) A vessel issued an Atlantic Tunas permit in any category for a 
fishing year shall not be issued an HMS Angling permit, HMS Charter/
Headboat permit, or an Atlantic Tunas permit in any other category for 
that same fishing year, regardless of a change in the vessel's 
ownership. A vessel issued an Atlantic Tunas permit may be issued an HMS 
Commercial Caribbean Small Boat permit, subject to restrictions set 
forth at Sec. 635.4(o), within that same fishing year; however, a 
vessel may not hold any other HMS fishing permit simultaneously with the 
HMS Commercial Caribbean Small Boat permit.

    (e) * * *
    (1) The owner of each vessel used to fish for or take Atlantic 
sharks or on which Atlantic sharks are retained, possessed with an 
intention to sell, or sold must obtain, in addition to any other 
required permits, at least one of the Federal Atlantic commercial shark 
permits described below or an HMS Commercial Caribbean Small Boat 
permit. A Federal Atlantic commercial shark permit or HMS Commercial 
Caribbean Small Boat permit is not required if the vessel is 
recreationally fishing and retains no more sharks than the recreational 
retention limit specified in Sec. 635.22(c), is operating pursuant to 
the conditions of a shark display or EFP issued pursuant to Sec. 
635.32, or fishes exclusively within State waters. It is a rebuttable 
presumption that the owner or operator of a vessel without a permit 
issued pursuant to this part, on which sharks are possessed in excess of 
the recreational retention limits, intends to sell the sharks.
    (2) The owner of vessels that fish for, take, retain, or possess the 
Atlantic oceanic sharks listed in sections A, B, or C of Table 1 of 
Appendix A with an intention to sell must obtain a Federal Atlantic 
commercial shark directed or incidental limited access permit or an HMS 
Commercial Caribbean Small Boat permit. The only valid Federal 
commercial shark directed and shark incidental limited access permits 
are those that have been issued under the limited access program 
consistent with the provisions under paragraphs (l) and (m) of this 
section.

    (1) Except as specified in paragraphs (n) and (o) of this section, 
the owner of each vessel used to fish for or take Atlantic swordfish or 
on which Atlantic swordfish are retained or possessed with an intention 
to sell or from which Atlantic swordfish are sold must obtain, in 
addition to any other required permits, only one of three types of 
commercial limited access swordfish permits: Swordfish directed limited 
access permit, swordfish incidental limited access permit, or swordfish 
handgear limited access permit. It is a rebuttable presumption that the 
owner or operator of a vessel on which swordfish are possessed in excess 
of the recreational retention limits intends to sell the swordfish.
    (2) The only valid commercial Federal vessel permits for swordfish 
are those that have been issued under the limited access program 
consistent with the provisions under paragraphs (l) and (m) of this 
section, or those issued under paragraphs (n) and (o) of this section.

    (1) General. Persons must apply annually for a dealer permit for 
Atlantic tunas, sharks, and swordfish, and for an Atlantic HMS Angling, 
HMS Charter/Headboat, tunas, shark, swordfish, Incidental HMS squid 
trawl, or HMS Commercial Caribbean Small Boat vessel permit. Except as 
specified in the instructions for automated renewals, persons must 
submit a renewal application to NMFS, along with a copy of the 
applicable valid workshop certificate or certificates, if required 
pursuant to Sec. 635.8, at an address designated by NMFS, at least 30 
days before a permit's expiration to avoid a lapse of permitted status. 
NMFS will renew a permit if the specific requirements for the requested 
permit are met, including those described in paragraphs (h)(1)(iv) and 
(l)(2) of this section;

[[Page 374]]

all reports required under the Magnuson-Stevens Act and ATCA have been 
submitted, including those described in Sec. Sec. 635.5 and 300.185 of 
this title; the applicant is not subject to a permit sanction or denial 
under paragraph (a)(6) of this section; and the workshop requirements 
specified in Sec. 635.8 are met.
    (2) Shark and swordfish LAPs. The owner of a vessel of the U.S. that 
fishes for, possesses, lands or sells shark or swordfish from the 
management unit, or that takes or possesses such shark or swordfish as 
incidental catch, must have the applicable limited access permit(s) 
issued pursuant to the requirements in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this 
section, except as specified in paragraphs (n) and (o) of this section. 
Only persons holding non-expired shark and swordfish limited access 
permit(s) in the preceding year are eligible to renew those limited 
access permit(s). Transferors may not renew limited access permits that 
have been transferred according to the procedures in paragraph (l) of 
this section.

    (o) HMS Commercial Caribbean Small Boat permits. (1) The owner of a 
vessel who fishes in the U.S. Caribbean, as defined at Sec. 622.2 of 
this chapter, possesses handgear or green-stick gear and retains, with 
the intention to sell, any BAYS tunas, Atlantic swordfish, or Atlantic 
sharks may obtain an HMS Commercial Caribbean Small Boat permit. An HMS 
Commercial Caribbean Small Boat permit is valid only within the U.S. 
Caribbean, as defined at Sec. 622.2 of this chapter.
    (2) To be eligible for an HMS Commercial Caribbean Small Boat 
permit, vessel owners must provide documentation that the vessel is less 
than or equal to 13.7 m (45 ft) in length overall.
    (3) A vessel issued an HMS Commercial Caribbean Small Boat permit 
may not be issued any other HMS fishing permit, except those issued 
under Sec. 635.32, as long as the HMS Commercial Caribbean Small Boat 
permit is valid.
    (4) The owner of a vessel issued an HMS Commercial Caribbean Small 
Boat permit may fish for, take, retain, or possess only BAYS tunas, 
Atlantic swordfish, and Atlantic sharks, subject to the trip limits 
specified at Sec. 635.24 and may possess unauthorized gears onboard as 
stated at Sec. 635.21(b).
    (5) HMS landed under an HMS Commercial Caribbean Small Boat permit 
may be sold by the owner or operator to individuals who do not possess a 
valid HMS dealer permit otherwise required under Sec. 635.4(g). HMS 
Commercial Caribbean Small Boat permit holders may not sell HMS 
harvested or landed by another vessel or purchase, barter, or trade for 
HMS harvested by other vessels with the intent to sell.

Sec. 635.5  Recordkeeping and reporting.

    Information on HMS vessel and dealer reporting requirements may be 
obtained from the Division Chief or where otherwise stated in this part.
    (a) Vessels--(1) Logbooks. If an owner of an HMS charter/headboat 
vessel, an Atlantic tunas vessel, a shark vessel, a swordfish vessel, or 
a vessel in the squid trawl fishery for which a permit has been issued 
under Sec. 635.4(b), (d), (e), (f), or (n) is selected for logbook 
reporting in writing by NMFS, he or she must maintain and submit a 
fishing record on a logbook form specified by NMFS. Entries are required 
regarding the vessel's fishing effort and the number of fish landed and 
discarded. Entries on a day's fishing activities must be entered on the 
logbook form within 48 hours of completing that day's activities or 
before offloading, whichever is sooner. The owner or operator of the 
vessel must submit the logbook form(s) postmarked within 7 days of 
offloading all Atlantic HMS. If no fishing occurred during a calendar 
month, a no-fishing form so stating must be submitted postmarked no 
later than 7 days after the end of that month. If an owner of an HMS 
charter/headboat vessel, Atlantic tunas vessel, shark vessel, swordfish 
vessel, or a vessel in the squid trawl fishery permitted under Sec. 
635.4(b), (d), (e), (f), or (n) is selected in writing by NMFS to 
complete the cost-earnings portion of the logbook(s), the owner or 
operator must maintain and submit the cost-earnings portion of the 
logbook postmarked no later than 30 days after completing the offloading 
for each trip fishing for Atlantic HMS during that calendar year, and 
submit the Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Annual Expenditures form(s) 
postmarked no later than the date specified on the form of the following 
year.
    (2) Weighout slips. If an owner of a permitted vessel is required to 
maintain and submit logbooks under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and 
Atlantic HMS harvested on a trip are sold, the owner or operator must 
obtain and submit copies of weighout slips for those fish. Each weighout 
slip must show the dealer to whom the fish were transferred, the date 
they were transferred, and the carcass weight of each fish for which 
individual weights are

[[Page 375]]

normally recorded. For fish that are not individually weighed, a 
weighout slip must record total weights by species and market category. 
A weighout slip for sharks prior to or as part of a commercial 
transaction involving shark carcasses or fins must record the weights of 
carcasses and any detached fins. The owner or operator must also submit 
copies of weighout slips with the logbook forms required to be submitted 
under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (3) BFT not sold. If a person who catches and lands a large medium 
or giant BFT from a vessel issued a permit in any of the commercial 
categories for Atlantic tunas does not sell or otherwise transfer the 
BFT to a dealer who has a dealer permit for Atlantic tunas, the person 
must contact a NMFS enforcement agent, at a number designated by NMFS, 
immediately upon landing such BFT, provide the information needed for 
the reports required under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, and, if 
requested, make the tuna available so that a NMFS enforcement agent or 
authorized officer may inspect the fish and attach a tag to it. 
Alternatively, such reporting requirement may be fulfilled if a dealer 
who has a dealer permit for Atlantic tunas affixes a dealer tag as 
required under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section and reports the BFT 
as being landed but not sold on the reports required under paragraph 
(b)(2)(i) of this section. If a vessel is placed on a trailer, the 
person must contact a NMFS enforcement agent, or the BFT must have a 
dealer tag affixed to it by a permitted Atlantic tunas dealer, 
immediately upon the vessel being removed from the water. All BFT landed 
but not sold will be applied to the quota category according to the 
permit category of the vessel from which it was landed.
    (4) Chartering arrangements. (i) For the purposes of this section, a 
chartering arrangement means any contract, agreement, or commitment 
between a U.S. vessel owner and a foreign entity (e.g., government, 
company, person) by which the control, use, possession, or services of a 
vessel are secured, for a period of time for fishing targeting Atlantic 
HMS. Chartering arrangements under this part do not include bareboat 
charters under which a vessel enters into a fishing agreement with a 
foreign entity, changes registration to fish under another country's 
registration then, once the agreed-upon fishing is completed, reverts 
back to the vessel's original registration.
    (ii) Before fishing under a chartering arrangement, the owner of a 
fishing vessel subject to U.S. jurisdiction must apply for, and obtain, 
a chartering permit as specified in Sec. 635.32 (e) and (f). If a 
chartering permit is obtained, the vessel owner must submit catch 
information as specified in the terms and conditions of that permit. All 
catches will be recorded and counted against the applicable quota of the 
Contracting Party to which the chartering foreign entity is a member 
and, unless otherwise provided in the chartering permit, must be 
offloaded in the ports of the chartering foreign entity or offloaded 
under the direct supervision of the chartering foreign entity.
    (iii) If the chartering arrangement terminates before the expiration 
of the charter permit, the vessel owner must notify NMFS immediately and 
in writing, upon termination of the chartering arrangement. Such 
notification requirements shall also apply to situations where the 
chartering arrangement is temporarily suspended and during intermittent 
periods where the vessel may be fishing under U.S. quotas for Atlantic 
HMS.
    (b) Dealers. Persons who have been issued a dealer permit under 
Sec. 635.4 must submit reports to NMFS, to an address designated by 
NMFS, and maintain records as follows:
    (1) Atlantic HMS. (i) Dealers that have been issued or should have 
been issued an Atlantic tunas, swordfish, and/or sharks dealer permit 
under Sec. 635.4 must submit to NMFS all reports required under this 
section. All reports must be species-specific and must include 
information about all HMS landed regardless of where harvested or 
whether the vessel is Federally permitted under Sec. 635.4. For sharks, 
each report must specify both the total fin weight and the total dressed 
weight of the carcass(es) separately from each other. In cases where 
different dealers handle the fins and the shark meat, either the report 
required in this section or the

[[Page 376]]

weighout slip required in paragraph (a)(2) of this section must indicate 
which part of the sharks being landed (e.g., fins or meat) was handled 
by the dealer submitting the report. As stated in Sec. 635.4(a)(6), 
failure to comply with these recordkeeping and reporting requirements 
may result in the existing dealer permit being revoked, suspended, or 
modified, and in the denial of any permit applications.
    (ii) Reports of Atlantic tunas, swordfish, and/or sharks received by 
dealers from U.S. vessels, as defined under Sec. 600.10 of this 
chapter, on the first through the 15\th\ of each month, must be received 
by NMFS not later than the 25\th\ of that month. Reports of Atlantic 
tunas, swordfish, and/or sharks received on the 16\th\ through the last 
day of each month must be received by NMFS not later than the 10th of 
the following month. If a dealer issued an Atlantic tunas, swordfish, or 
sharks dealer permit under Sec. 635.4 has not received any Atlantic HMS 
from U.S. vessels during a reporting period as specified in this 
section, he or she must still submit the report required under paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section stating that no Atlantic HMS were received. 
This negative report must be received by NMFS for the applicable 
reporting period as specified in this section. This negative reporting 
requirement does not apply for bluefin tuna.
    (iii) The reporting requirement of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section may be satisfied by a dealer if he or she provides a copy of 
each appropriate weighout slip or sales record, provided such weighout 
slip or sales record by itself or combined with the form available from 
NMFS includes all of the required information and identifies each fish 
by species.
    (iv) The dealer may mail or fax such report to an address designated 
by NMFS or may hand-deliver such report to a state or Federal fishery 
port agent designated by NMFS. If the dealer hand-delivers the report to 
a port agent, the dealer must deliver such report for Atlantic tunas, 
swordfish, or sharks no later than the prescribed received-by date for 
the reporting period, as required in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of 
this section.
    (2) Requirements for bluefin tuna--(i) Dealer reports--(A) Landing 
reports. Each dealer with a valid Atlantic tunas permit issued under 
Sec. 635.4 must submit a completed landing report on a form available 
from NMFS for each BFT received from a U.S. fishing vessel. Such report 
must be submitted by electronic facsimile (fax) or, once available, via 
the Internet, to a number or a web address designated by NMFS not later 
than 24 hours after receipt of the BFT. A landing report must indicate 
the name and permit number of the vessel that landed the BFT and must be 
signed by the permitted vessel's owner or operator immediately upon 
transfer of the BFT. The dealer must inspect the vessel's permit to 
verify that the required vessel name and vessel permit number as listed 
on the permit are correctly recorded on the landing report and to verify 
that the vessel permit has not expired.
    (B) Bi-weekly reports. Each dealer with a valid Atlantic tunas 
permit under Sec. 635.4 must submit a complete bi-weekly report on 
forms available from NMFS for BFT received from U.S. vessels. For BFT 
received from U.S. vessels on the 1\st\ through the 15\th\ of each 
month, the dealer must submit the bi-weekly report form to NMFS, to be 
received by NMFS, not later than the 25\th\ of that month. Reports of 
BFT received on the 16\th\ through the last day of each month must be 
received by NMFS not later than the 10\th\ of the following month.
    (ii) Dealer tags. NMFS will issue numbered dealer tags to each 
person issued a dealer permit for Atlantic tunas under Sec. 635.4. A 
dealer tag is not transferable and is usable only by the dealer to whom 
it is issued. Dealer tags may not be reused once affixed to a tuna or 
recorded on a package, container, or report.
    (A) Affixing dealer tags. A dealer or a dealer's agent must affix a 
dealer tag to each BFT purchased or received from a U.S. vessel 
immediately upon offloading the BFT. If a vessel is placed on a trailer, 
the dealer or dealer's agent must affix the dealer tag to the BFT 
immediately upon the vessel being removed from the water. The dealer tag 
must be affixed to the BFT

[[Page 377]]

between the fifth dorsal finlet and the caudal keel.
    (B) Removal of dealer tags. A dealer tag affixed to any BFT under 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section or a BSD tag affixed to an 
imported bluefin tuna must remain on the fish until it is cut into 
portions. If the bluefin tuna or bluefin tuna parts subsequently are 
packaged for transport for domestic commercial use or for export, the 
number of the dealer tag or the BSD tag must be written legibly and 
indelibly on the outside of any package containing the tuna. Such tag 
number also must be recorded on any document accompanying the shipment 
of bluefin tuna for commercial use or export.
    (3) Recordkeeping. Dealers must retain at their place of business a 
copy of each report required under paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (b)(1)(ii), and 
(b)(2)(i) of this section for a period of 2 years from the date on which 
each report was required to be submitted.
    (c) Anglers. All bluefin tuna, billfish, and North Atlantic 
swordfish non-tournament landings must be reported as specified under 
paragraphs (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, unless an alternative 
recreational catch reporting system has been established as specified 
under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Tournament landings must be 
reported as specified under paragraph (d) of this section.
    (1) Bluefin tuna. The owner of a vessel permitted, or required to be 
permitted, in the Atlantic HMS Angling or Atlantic HMS Charter/Headboat 
category must report all BFT landings under the Angling category quota 
designated at Sec. 635.27(a) through the NMFS automated catch reporting 
system within 24 hours of the landing. Such reports may be made by 
calling 1-888-872-8862 or by submitting the required information over 
the Internet at: www.nmfspermits.com.
    (2) The owner, or the owner('s) designee, of a vessel permitted, or 
required to be permitted, in the Atlantic HMS Angling or Atlantic HMS 
Charter/Headboat category must report all non-tournament landings of 
Atlantic blue marlin, Atlantic white marlin, roundscale spearfish, and 
Atlantic sailfish, and all non-tournament and non-commercial landings of 
North Atlantic swordfish to NMFS by telephone to a number designated by 
NMFS, or electronically via the internet to an internet website 
designated by NMFS, or by other means as specified by NMFS, within 24 
hours of that landing. For telephone landing reports, the owner, or the 
owner(s designee, must provide a contact phone number so that a NMFS 
designee can call the vessel owner, or the owner(s designee, for follow 
up questions and to confirm the reported landing. Regardless of how 
submitted, landing reports submitted to NMFS are not complete unless the 
vessel owner, or the owner(s designee, has received a confirmation 
number from NMFS or a NMFS designee.
    (3) Alternative recreational catch reporting. Alternative 
recreational catch reporting procedures may be established by NMFS with 
cooperation from states which may include such methodologies as 
telephone, dockside or mail surveys, mail in or phone-in reports, 
tagging programs, catch cards, or mandatory check-in stations. A census 
or a statistical sample of persons fishing under the recreational 
fishing regulations of this part may be used for these alternative 
reporting programs (after the programs have received Paperwork Reduction 
Act approval from OMB). Persons or vessel owners selected for reporting 
will be notified by NMFS or by the cooperating state agency of the 
requirements and procedures for reporting recreational catch. Each 
person so notified must comply with those requirements and procedures. 
Additionally, NMFS may determine that recreational landing reporting 
systems implemented by the states, if mandatory, at least as 
restrictive, and effectively enforced, are sufficient for recreational 
landing monitoring as required under this part. In such case, NMFS will 
file with the Office of the Federal Register for publication 
notification indicating that compliance with the state system satisfies 
the reporting requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
    (d) Tournament operators. For all tournaments that are conducted 
from a port in an Atlantic coastal state, including the U.S. Virgin 
Islands and Puerto Rico, a tournament operator must register with the 
NMFS' HMS

[[Page 378]]

Management Division, at least 4 weeks prior to commencement of the 
tournament by submitting information on the purpose, dates, and location 
of the tournament to NMFS. A tournament is not registered unless the 
tournament operator has received a confirmation number from the NMFS' 
HMS Management Division. NMFS will notify the tournament operator in 
writing when a tournament has been selected for reporting. Tournament 
operators that are selected to report must maintain and submit to NMFS a 
record of catch and effort on forms available from NMFS. Tournament 
operators must submit the completed forms to NMFS, at an address 
designated by NMFS, postmarked no later than the 7th day after the 
conclusion of the tournament, and must attach a copy of the tournament 
rules.
    (e) Inspection. Any person authorized to carry out enforcement 
activities under the regulations in this part has the authority, without 
warrant or other process, to inspect, at any reasonable time, catch on 
board a vessel or on the premises of a dealer, logbooks, catch reports, 
statistical records, sales receipts, or other records and reports 
required by this part to be made, kept, or furnished. An owner or 
operator of a fishing vessel that has been issued a permit under Sec. 
635.4 or Sec. 635.32 must allow NMFS or an authorized person to inspect 
and copy any required reports and the records, in any form, on which the 
completed reports are based, wherever they exist. An agent of a person 
issued a permit under this part, or anyone responsible for offloading, 
storing, packing, or selling regulated HMS for such permittee, shall be 
subject to the inspection provisions of this section.
    (f) Additional data and inspection. Additional data on fishing 
effort directed at Atlantic HMS or on catch of Atlantic HMS, regardless 
of whether retained, may be collected by contractors and statistical 
reporting agents, as designees of NMFS, and by authorized officers. A 
person issued a permit under Sec. 635.4 is required to provide 
requested information about fishing activity, and a person, regardless 
of whether issued a permit under Sec. 635.4, who possesses an Atlantic 
HMS is required to make such fish or parts thereof available for 
inspection by NMFS or its designees upon request.

    Effective Date Note: At 77 FR 47315, Aug. 8, 2012, Sec. 635.5 was 
amended by revising paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) and removing 
paragraph (b)(1)(iv), effective Jan. 1, 2013. For the convenience of the 
user, the revised text is set forth as follows:

    (b) * * *
    (1) * * *
    (i) Dealers that have been issued or should have been issued a 
Federal Atlantic BAYS tunas, swordfish, and/or shark dealer permit under 
Sec. 635.4 must submit to NMFS all reports required under this section 
within the timeframe specified under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this 
section. BAYS tunas, swordfish, and sharks commercially-harvested by a 
vessel can only be first received by dealers that have been issued or 
should have been issued an Atlantic tunas, swordfish, and/or shark 
dealer permit under Sec. 635.4. All federal Atlantic HMS dealers must 
provide a detailed report of all fish first received to NMFS within the 
period specified under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. All reports 
must be species-specific and must include the required information about 
all, swordfish, and sharks received by the dealer, including the 
required vessel information, regardless of where the fish were harvested 
or whether the harvesting vessel is permitted under Sec. 635.4. For 
sharks, each report must specify the total weight of the carcass(es) 
without the fins for each species, and the total fin weight by grade for 
all sharks combined. Dealers are also required to submit ``negative'' 
reports, indicating no receipt of any species, within the timeframe 
specified under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section if they did not 
first receive any fish during the reporting period . As stated in Sec. 
635.4(a)(6), failure to comply with these recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements may result in existing dealer permit(s) being revoked, 
suspended, or modified, and in the denial of any permit applications.
    (ii) Reports of any Atlantic BAYS tunas, sharks, and/or swordfish 
first received by dealers from a vessel must be submitted electronically 
on a weekly basis through a NMFS-approved electronic reporting system by 
the dealer and received by NMFS no later

[[Page 379]]

than midnight, local time, of the first Tuesday following the end of the 
reporting week unless the dealer is otherwise notified by NMFS. Reports 
of BAYS tunas, sharks, and/or swordfish may be modified for not more 
than 30 days from when the dealer report is submitted to NMFS. NMFS will 
require BAYS tunas, swordfish, and shark dealers to submit dealer 
reports to NMFS on a weekly basis. Atlantic BAYS tunas, sharks, and 
swordfish dealers must submit electronic negative reports stating that 
no BAYS tunas, sharks, and/or swordfish were first received when they 
received no fish of these species, and no parts thereof, during the 
reporting period. Reporting requirements for bluefin tuna are specified 
in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The negative reporting requirement 
does not apply for bluefin tuna.
    (iii) Atlantic HMS dealers are not authorized to first receive 
Atlantic swordfish, sharks, and/or BAYS tunas if the required reports 
have not been submitted and received by NMFS according to reporting 
requirements under this section. Delinquent reports automatically result 
in an Atlantic HMS dealer becoming ineligible to first receive Atlantic 
swordfish, sharks, and/or BAYS tunas. Atlantic HMS dealers who become 
ineligible to first receive Atlantic swordfish, sharks, and/or BAYS 
tunas due to delinquent reports are authorized to first receive Atlantic 
swordfish, sharks, and/or BAYS tunas only once all required and 
delinquent reports have been completed, submitted by the dealer, and 
received by NMFS.

Sec. 635.6  Vessel and gear identification.

    (a) Vessel number. For the purposes of this section, a vessel's 
number is the vessel's official number issued by either by the U.S. 
Coast Guard or by the appropriate state agency.
    (b) Vessel identification. (1) An owner or operator of a vessel for 
which a permit has been issued under Sec. 635.4, other than an HMS 
Angling permit, must display the vessel number--
    (i) On the port and starboard sides of the deckhouse or hull and on 
an appropriate weather deck, so as to be clearly visible from an 
enforcement vessel or aircraft.
    (ii) In block arabic numerals permanently affixed to or painted on 
the vessel in contrasting color to the background.
    (iii) At least 18 inches (45.7 cm) in height for vessels over 65 ft 
(19.8 m) in length; at least 10 inches (25.4 cm) in height for all other 
vessels over 25 ft (7.6 m) in length; and at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) in 
height for vessels 25 ft (7.6 m) in length or less.
    (2) The owner or operator of a vessel for which a permit has been 
issued under Sec. 635.4 must keep the vessel's number clearly legible 
and in good repair and ensure that no part of the vessel, its rigging, 
its fishing gear, or any other material on board obstructs the view of 
the vessel's number from an enforcement vessel or aircraft.
    (c) Gear identification. (1) The owner or operator of a vessel for 
which a permit has been issued under Sec. 635.4 and that uses handline, 
buoy gear, harpoon, longline, or gillnet, must display the vessel's 
name, registration number or Atlantic Tunas, HMS Angling, or HMS 
Charter/Headboat permit number on each float attached to a handline, 
buoy gear, or harpoon, and on the terminal floats and high-flyers (if 
applicable) on a longline or gillnet used by the vessel. The vessel's 
name or number must be at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) in height in block 
letters or arabic numerals in a color that contrasts with the background 
color of the float or high-flyer.
    (2) An unmarked handline, buoy gear, harpoon, longline, or gillnet, 
is illegal and may be disposed of in an appropriate manner by NMFS or an 
authorized officer.

<R05>
Sec. 635.7  At-sea observer coverage.

    (a) Applicability. NMFS may select for at-sea observer coverage any 
vessel that has an Atlantic HMS, tunas, shark or swordfish permit issued 
under Sec. 635.4 or Sec. 635.32. Vessels permitted in the HMS Charter/
Headboat and Angling categories will be requested to take observers on a 
voluntary basis. When selected, vessels issued any other permit under 
Sec. 635.4 or Sec. 635.32 are required to take observers on a 
mandatory basis.
    (b) Selection of vessels. NMFS will notify a vessel owner, in 
writing, when his or her vessel is selected for observer coverage. 
Vessels will be selected to provide information on catch, bycatch and 
other fishery data according to the need for representative samples.
    (c) Notification of trips. The owner or operator of a vessel that is 
selected

[[Page 380]]

under paragraph (b) of this section must notify NMFS, at an address 
designated by NMFS, before commencing any fishing trip that may result 
in the incidental catch or harvest of Atlantic HMS. Notification 
procedures and information requirements such as expected gear 
deployment, trip duration and fishing area will be specified in a 
selection letter sent by NMFS.
    (d) Assignment of observers. Once notified of a trip, NMFS will 
assign an observer for that trip based on current information needs 
relative to the expected catch and bycatch likely to be associated with 
the indicated gear deployment, trip duration and fishing area. If an 
observer is not assigned for a fishing trip, NMFS will issue a waiver 
for that trip to the owner or operator of the selected vessel, so long 
as the waiver is consistent with other applicable laws. If an observer 
is assigned for a trip, the operator of the selected vessel must arrange 
to embark the observer and shall not fish for or retain any Atlantic HMS 
unless the NMFS-assigned observer is aboard.
    (e) Requirements. The owner or operator of a vessel on which a NMFS-
approved observer is embarked, regardless of whether required to carry 
the observer, must comply with Sec. Sec. 600.725 and 600.746 of this 
chapter and--
    (1) Provide accommodations and food that are equivalent to those 
provided to the crew.
    (2) Allow the observer access to and use of the vessel's 
communications equipment and personnel upon request for the transmission 
and receipt of messages related to the observer's duties.
    (3) Allow the observer access to and use of the vessel's navigation 
equipment and personnel upon request to determine the vessel's position.
    (4) Allow the observer free and unobstructed access to the vessel's 
bridge, working decks, holding bins, weight scales, holds, and any other 
space used to hold, process, weigh, or store fish.
    (5) Allow the observer to inspect and copy the vessel's log, 
communications logs, and any records associated with the catch and 
distribution of fish for that trip.
    (f) Vessel responsibilities. An owner or operator of a vessel 
required to carry one or more observer(s) must provide reasonable 
assistance to enable observer(s) to carry out their duties, including, 
but not limited to:
    (1) Measuring decks, codends, and holding bins.
    (2) Providing the observer(s) with a safe work area.
    (3) Collecting bycatch when requested by the observer(s).
    (4) Collecting and carrying baskets of fish when requested by the 
observer(s).
    (5) Allowing the observer(s) to collect biological data and samples.
    (6) Providing adequate space for storage of biological samples.

Sec. 635.8  Workshops.

    (a) Protected species release, disentanglement, and identification 
workshops. (1) Both the owner and operator of a vessel that fishes with 
longline or gillnet gear must be certified by NMFS, or its designee, as 
having completed a workshop on the safe handling, release, and 
identification of protected species before a shark or swordfish limited 
access vessel permit, pursuant to Sec. 635.4(e) and (f), is renewed in 
2007. For the purposes of this section, it is a rebuttable presumption 
that a vessel fishes with longline or gillnet gear if: longline or 
gillnet gear is onboard the vessel; logbook reports indicate that 
longline or gillnet gear was used on at least one trip in the preceding 
year; or, in the case of a permit transfer to new owners that occurred 
less than a year ago, logbook reports indicate that longline or gillnet 
gear was used on at least one trip since the permit transfer.
    (2) NMFS, or its designee, will issue a protected species safe 
handling, release, and identification workshop certificate to any person 
who completes a protected species safe handling, release, and 
identification workshop. If an owner owns multiple vessels, NMFS will 
issue a certificate for each vessel that the owner owns upon successful 
completion of one workshop. An owner who is also an operator will be 
issued multiple certificates, one as the owner of the vessel and one as 
the operator.

[[Page 381]]

    (3) The owner of a vessel that fishes with longline or gillnet gear, 
as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, is required to possess 
on board the vessel a valid protected species safe handling, release, 
and identification workshop certificate issued to that vessel owner. A 
copy of a valid protected species safe handling, release, and 
identification workshop certificate issued to the vessel owner for a 
vessel that fishes with longline or gillnet gear must be included in the 
application package to renew or obtain a shark or swordfish limited 
access permit.
    (4) An operator that fishes with longline or gillnet gear as 
specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must possess on board the 
vessel a valid protected species safe handling, release, and 
identification workshop certificate issued to that operator, in addition 
to a certificate issued to the vessel owner.
    (5) All owners and operators that attended and successfully 
completed industry certification workshops, held on April 8, 2005, in 
Orlando, FL, and on June 27, 2005, in New Orleans, LA, as documented by 
workshop facilitators, will automatically receive valid protected 
species safe handling, release, and identification workshop certificates 
issued by NMFS no later than December 31, 2006.
    (b) Atlantic shark identification workshops. (1) As of December 31, 
2007, all Federal Atlantic shark dealers permitted or required to be 
permitted pursuant to Sec. 635.4(g)(2), or a proxy for each place of 
business as specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, must be 
certified by NMFS, or its designee, as having completed an Atlantic 
shark identification workshop.
    (2) NMFS, or its designee, will issue an Atlantic shark 
identification workshop certificate to any person who completes an 
Atlantic shark identification workshop.
    (3) Dealers who own multiple businesses and who attend and 
successfully complete the workshop will be issued a certificate for each 
place of business that is permitted to receive sharks pursuant to Sec. 
635.4(g)(2).
    (4) Only dealers issued a valid shark dealer permit may send a proxy 
to the Atlantic shark identification workshops. If a dealer opts to send 
a proxy, the dealer must designate at least one proxy from each place of 
business listed on the dealer permit, issued pursuant to Sec. 
635.4(g)(2), which first receives Atlantic shark by way of purchase, 
barter, or trade. The proxy must be a person who is currently employed 
by a place of business covered by the dealer's permit; is a primary 
participant in the identification, weighing, and/or first receipt of 
fish as they are offloaded from a vessel; and fills out dealer reports 
as required under Sec. 635.5. Only one certificate will be issued to 
each proxy. If a proxy is no longer employed by a place of business 
covered by the dealer's permit, the dealer or another proxy must be 
certified as having completed a workshop pursuant to this section. At 
least one individual from each place of business listed on the dealer 
permit which first receives Atlantic sharks by way of purchase, barter, 
or trade must possess a valid Atlantic shark identification workshop 
certificate.
    (5) A Federal Atlantic shark dealer issued or required to be issued 
a shark dealer permit pursuant to Sec. 635.4(g)(2) must possess and 
make available for inspection a valid dealer or proxy Atlantic shark 
identification workshop certificate issued to the dealer or proxy at 
each place of business listed on the dealer permit which first receives 
Atlantic sharks by way of purchase, barter, or trade. For the purposes 
of this part, trucks or other conveyances of a dealer's place of 
business are considered to be extensions of a dealer's place of business 
and must possess a copy of a valid dealer or proxy Atlantic shark 
identification workshop certificate issued to a place of business 
covered by the dealer permit. A copy of a valid Atlantic shark 
identification workshop certificate must be included in the dealer's 
application package to obtain or renew an Atlantic shark dealer permit. 
If multiple businesses are authorized to receive Atlantic sharks under 
the Atlantic shark dealer's permit, a copy of the Atlantic shark 
identification workshop certificate for each place of business listed on 
the Atlantic

[[Page 382]]

shark dealer permit which first receives Atlantic sharks by way of 
purchase, barter, or trade must be included in the Atlantic shark dealer 
permit renewal application package.
    (6) Persons holding an expired Atlantic shark dealer permit and 
persons who intend to apply for a new Atlantic shark dealer permit will 
be issued a participant certificate in their name upon successful 
completion of the Atlantic shark identification workshop. A participant 
certificate issued to such persons may be used only to apply for an 
Atlantic shark dealer permit. Pursuant to Sec. 635.8(c)(4), an Atlantic 
shark dealer may not first receive, purchase, trade, or barter for 
Atlantic shark without a valid dealer or proxy Atlantic shark 
identification workshop certificate issued to the dealer or proxy. After 
an Atlantic shark dealer permit is issued to a person using an Atlantic 
shark identification workshop participant certificate, such person may 
obtain an Atlantic shark identification workshop dealer certificate for 
each location which first receives Atlantic sharks by way of purchase, 
barter, or trade by contacting NMFS at an address designated by NMFS.
    (c) Terms and conditions. (1) Certificates, as described in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, are valid for three calendar 
years. All certificates must be renewed prior to the expiration date on 
the certificate.
    (2) If a vessel fishes with longline or gillnet gear as described in 
paragraph (a) of this section, the vessel owner may not renew a shark or 
swordfish limited access permit, issued pursuant to Sec. 635.4(e) or 
(f), without submitting a valid protected species workshop certificate 
with the permit renewal application.
    (3) A vessel that fishes with longline or gillnet gear as described 
in paragraph (a) of this section and that has been, or should be, issued 
a valid limited access permit pursuant to Sec. 635.4(e) or (f), may not 
fish unless a valid protected species safe handling, release, and 
identification workshop certificate has been issued to both the owner 
and operator of that vessel.
    (4) An Atlantic shark dealer may not first receive, purchase, trade, 
or barter for Atlantic shark without a valid dealer or proxy Atlantic 
shark identification workshop certificate issued to the dealer or proxy. 
A valid dealer or proxy Atlantic shark identification workshop 
certificate issued to the dealer or proxy must be maintained on the 
premises of each place of business listed on the dealer permit which 
first receives Atlantic sharks by way of purchase, barter, or trade. An 
Atlantic shark dealer may not renew a Federal dealer permit issued 
pursuant to Sec. 635.4(g)(2) unless a copy of a valid dealer or proxy 
Atlantic shark identification workshop certificate issued to the dealer 
or proxy has been submitted with the permit renewal application. If the 
dealer is not certified and opts to send a proxy or proxies to a 
workshop, the dealer must submit a copy of a valid proxy certificate for 
each place of business listed on the dealer permit which first receives 
Atlantic sharks by way of purchase, barter, or trade.
    (5) A vessel owner, operator, shark dealer, proxy for a shark 
dealer, or participant who is issued either a protected species workshop 
certificate or an Atlantic shark identification workshop certificate may 
not transfer that certificate to another person.
    (6) Vessel owners issued a valid protected species safe handling, 
release, and identification workshop certificate may request, in the 
application for permit transfer per Sec. 635.4(l)(2), additional 
protected species safe handling, release, and identification workshop 
certificates for additional vessels that they own. Shark dealers may 
request from NMFS additional Atlantic shark identification workshop 
certificates for additional places of business authorized to receive 
sharks that they own as long as they, and not a proxy, were issued the 
certificate. All certificates must be renewed prior to the date of 
expiration on the certificate.
    (7) To receive either the protected species safe handling, release, 
and identification workshop certificate or Atlantic shark identification 
workshop certificate, persons required to attend the workshop must show 
a copy of their HMS permit, as well as proof of identification to NMFS 
or NMFS' designee at the workshop. If a permit holder is a corporation, 
partnership, association, or any other entity, the

[[Page 383]]

individual attending on behalf of the permit holder must show proof that 
he or she is the permit holder's agent and a copy of the HMS permit to 
NMFS or NMFS' designee at the workshop. For proxies attending on behalf 
of a shark dealer, the proxy must have documentation from the shark 
dealer acknowledging that the proxy is attending the workshop on behalf 
of the Atlantic shark dealer and must show a copy of the Atlantic shark 
dealer permit to NMFS or NMFS' designee at the workshop.

<R04>
                      Subpart C_Management Measures


<R05>
Sec. 635.20  Size limits.

    (a) General. The CFL will be the sole criterion for determining the 
size and/or size class of whole (head on) Atlantic tunas for a vessel 
that has been issued a limited access North Atlantic swordfish permit 
under Sec. 635.4.
    (b) BFT size classes. The size class of a BFT found with the head 
removed shall be determined using pectoral fin curved fork length 
(PFCFL) multiplied by a conversion factor of 1.35. The CFL, as 
determined by conversion of the PFCFL, will be the sole criterion for 
determining the size class of a beheaded BFT. The conversion factor may 
be adjusted after consideration of additional scientific information and 
fish measurement data, and will be made effective by filing with the 
Office of the Federal Register for publication notification of the 
adjustment.
    (c) BFT, bigeye tuna, and yellowfin tuna. (1) No person shall take, 
retain, or possess a BFT, bigeye tuna, or yellowfin tuna in the Atlantic 
Ocean that is less than 27 inches (69 cm) CFL;
    (2) Applying the conversion factor from PFCFL to CFL for a beheaded 
BFT in Sec. 635.20(b) means that no person shall retain or possess a 
BFT, with the head removed, that is less than 20 inches (51 cm) PFCFL.
    (3) No person shall remove the head of a bigeye tuna or yellowfin 
tuna if the remaining portion would be less than 27 inches (69 cm) from 
the fork of the tail to the forward edge of the cut.
    (d) Billfish. (1) No person shall take, retain or possess a blue 
marlin taken from its management unit that is less than 99 inches (251 
cm), LJFL.
    (2) No person shall take, retain or possess a white marlin taken 
from its management unit that is less than 66 inches (168 cm), LJFL.
    (3) No person shall take, retain or possess shoreward of the outer 
boundary of the EEZ a sailfish taken from its management unit that is 
less than 63 inches (160 cm), LJFL.
    (4) No person shall take, retain or possess a roundscale spearfish 
taken from its management unit that is less than 66 inches (168 cm), 
LJFL.
    (5) The Atlantic blue marlin, white marlin, and roundscale spearfish 
minimum size limits, specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this 
section, may be adjusted to sizes between 117 and 138 inches (297.2 and 
350.5 cm) for blue marlin and 70 and 79 inches (177.8 and 200.7 cm) for 
white marlin and roundscale spearfish, to achieve, but not exceed, the 
annual Atlantic marlin landing limit specified in Sec. 635.27(d). 
Minimum size limit increases will be based upon a review of landings, 
the period of time remaining in the current fishing year, current and 
historical landing trends, and any other relevant factors. NMFS will 
adjust the minimum size limits specified in this section by filing an 
adjustment with the Office of the Federal Register for publication. In 
no case shall the adjustments be effective less than 14 calendar days 
after the date of publication. The adjusted minimum size limits will 
remain in effect through the end of the applicable fishing year or until 
otherwise adjusted.
    (e) Sharks. The following size limits change depending on the 
species being caught and the retention limit under which they are being 
caught as specified under Sec. 635.22(c).
    (1) All sharks landed under the recreational retention limits 
specified at Sec. 635.22(c) must have the head, tail, and fins 
naturally attached.
    (2) All sharks landed under the recreational retention limits 
specified at Sec. 635.22(c)(2) must be at least 54 inches (137 cm) FL.
    (3) There is no size limit for Atlantic sharpnose or bonnethead 
sharks taken under the recreational retention limits specified at Sec. 
635.22(c)(3).
    (4) [Reserved]
    (f) Swordfish. (1) For a swordfish that has its head naturally 
attached, the LJFL is the sole criterion for determining the size of a 
swordfish. No person shall take, retain, possess, or land a whole (head 
on) North or South Atlantic swordfish taken from its management unit 
that is not equal to or greater than 47 inches (119 cm) LJFL.

[[Page 385]]

A swordfish with the head naturally attached that is damaged by shark 
bites may be retained only if the length of the remainder of the fish is 
equal to or greater than 47 inches (119 cm) LJFL.
    (2) If the head of a swordfish is no longer naturally attached, the 
CK measurement is the sole criterion for determining the size of a 
swordfish. No person shall take, retain, possess, or land a dressed 
North or South Atlantic swordfish taken from its management unit that is 
not equal to or greater than 25 inches (63 cm) CK length. A swordfish 
that is damaged by shark bites may be retained only if the length of the 
remainder of the carcass is equal to or greater than 25 inches (63 cm) 
CK length.
    (3) No person shall import into the United States an Atlantic 
swordfish weighing less than 33 lb (15 kg) dressed weight, or a part 
derived from a swordfish that weighs less than 33 lb (15 kg) dressed 
weight.
    (4) Except for a swordfish landed in a Pacific state and remaining 
in that Pacific state of landing, a swordfish, or part thereof, not 
meeting the minimum size measurements specified in Sec. 635.20(f)(1) or 
(2) will be deemed to be an Atlantic swordfish harvested by a vessel of 
the United States and to be in violation of the minimum size requirement 
of this section unless such swordfish, or part thereof, is accompanied 
by a swordfish statistical document attesting that the swordfish was 
lawfully imported. Refer to Sec. 300.186 of this title for the 
requirements related to the swordfish statistical document.
    (5) A swordfish, or part thereof, will be monitored for compliance 
with the minimum size requirement of this section from the time it is 
landed in, or imported into, the United States up to, and including, the 
point of first transaction in the United States.

<R05>
Sec. 635.21  Gear operation and deployment restrictions.

    The green-stick gear authorization requirements under paragraphs 
(c)(2)(v)(A), (c)(2)(v)(B), (c)(5)(iii)(C)(3), (e)(1)(ii), (e)(1)(iii), 
(e)(1)(v), and (g) of this section are effective on October 23, 2008. 
The sea turtle bycatch mitigation gear requirements under paragraphs 
(c)(2)(v)(D), (c)(2)(v)(G), (c)(5)(i) introductory text, (c)(5)(i)(M), 
(c)(5)(ii)(A), and (c)(5)(ii)(C)(1) of this section are effective on 
January 1, 2009.
    (a) All Atlantic HMS fishing gears. (1) An Atlantic HMS harvested 
from its management unit that is not retained must be released in a 
manner that will ensure maximum probability of survival, but without 
removing the fish from the water.
    (2) If a billfish is caught by a hook and not retained, the fish 
must be released by cutting the line near the hook or by using a 
dehooking device, in either case without removing the fish from the 
water.
    (3) All vessels that have pelagic or bottom longline gear onboard 
and that have been issued, or are required to have, a limited access 
swordfish, shark, or tuna longline category permit for use in the 
Atlantic Ocean including the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico must 
possess inside the wheelhouse the document provided by NMFS entitled 
``Careful Release Protocols for Sea Turtle Release with Minimal 
Injury,'' and must also post inside the wheelhouse the sea turtle 
handling and release guidelines provided by NMFS.
    (4) Area closures for all Atlantic HMS fishing gears. (i) No person 
may fish for, catch, possess, or retain any Atlantic highly migratory 
species or anchor a fishing vessel that has been issued a permit or is 
required to be permitted under this part, in the areas designated at 
Sec. 622.34(d) of this chapter.
    (ii) From November through April of each year, no vessel issued, or 
required to be issued, a permit under this part may fish or deploy any 
type of fishing gear in the Madison-Swanson closed area or the Steamboat 
Lumps closed area, as defined in Sec. 635.2.
    (iii) From May through October of each year, no vessel issued, or 
required to be issued, a permit under this part may fish or deploy any 
type of fishing

[[Page 386]]

gear in the Madison-Swanson or the Steamboat Lumps closed areas except 
for surface trolling, as specified below under paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of 
this section.
    (iv) For the purposes of paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section, 
surface trolling is defined as fishing with lines trailing behind a 
vessel which is in constant motion at speeds in excess of four knots 
with a visible wake. Such trolling may not involve the use of down 
riggers, wire lines, planers, or similar devices.
    (v) From January through April of each year, no vessel issued, or 
required to be issued, a permit under this part may fish or deploy any 
type of fishing gear in the Edges 40 Fathom Contour closed area, as 
defined in Sec. 635.2.
    (vi) [Reserved]
    (vii) Caribbean, Gulf, and South Atlantic EEZ area closures related 
to Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Effective May 11, 2010, no vessel 
issued, or required to be issued, a permit under this part, may fish or 
deploy any type of fishing gear in the areas designated at Sec. Sec. 
622.33(c), 622.34(n), or 622.35(m) of this chapter.
    (b) General. No person may fish for, catch, possess, or retain any 
Atlantic HMS with gears other than the primary gears specifically 
authorized in this part. Consistent with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of 
this section, secondary gears may be used at boat side to aid and assist 
in subduing, or bringing on board a vessel, Atlantic HMS that have first 
been caught or captured using primary gears. For purposes of this part, 
secondary gears include, but are not limited to, dart harpoons, gaffs, 
flying gaffs, tail ropes, etc. Secondary gears may not be used to 
capture, or attempt to capture, free-swimming or undersized HMS. Except 
as specified in this paragraph (b), a vessel using or having onboard in 
the Atlantic Ocean any unauthorized gear may not possess an Atlantic HMS 
on board.
    (c) Pelagic longlines. For purposes of this part, a vessel is 
considered to have pelagic longline gear on board when a power-operated 
longline hauler, a mainline, floats capable of supporting the mainline, 
and leaders (gangions) with hooks are on board. Removal of any one of 
these elements constitutes removal of pelagic longline gear. If a vessel 
issued a permit under this part is in a closed area designated under 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section with pelagic longline gear on board, it 
is a rebuttable presumption that fish on board such vessel were taken 
with pelagic longline gear in the closed area.
    (1) If a vessel issued or required to be issued a permit under this 
part:
    (i) Is in a closed area designated under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section and has bottom longline gear onboard, the vessel may not, at any 
time, possess or land any pelagic species listed in table 2 of appendix 
A to this part in excess of 5 percent, by weight, of the total weight of 
pelagic and demersal species possessed or landed, that are listed in 
tables 2 and 3 of appendix A to this part.
    (ii) Has pelagic longline gear on board, persons aboard that vessel 
may not possess, retain, transship, land, sell, or store oceanic 
whitetip sharks or scalloped, smooth, or great hammerhead sharks.
    (2) If pelagic longline gear is on board a vessel issued a permit 
under this part, persons aboard that vessel may not fish or deploy any 
type of fishing gear in:
    (i) The Northeastern United States closed area from June 1 through 
June 30 each calendar year;
    (ii) In the Charleston Bump closed area from February 1 through 
April 30 each calendar year;
    (iii) In the East Florida Coast closed area at any time;
    (iv) In the Desoto Canyon closed area at any time;
    (v) In the Northeast Distant gear restricted area at any time, 
unless persons onboard the vessel comply with the following:
    (A) The vessel is limited to possessing onboard and/or using only 
18/0 or larger circle hooks with an offset not to exceed 10 degrees. The 
outer diameter of the circle hook at its widest point must be no smaller 
than 2.16 inches (55 mm) when measured with the eye on the hook on the 
vertical axis (y-axis) and perpendicular to the horizontal axis (x-
axis), and the distance between the circle hook point and the shank 
(i.e., the gap) must be no larger than 1.13 inches (28.8 mm). The 
allowable offset is measured from the

[[Page 387]]

barbed end of the hook and is relative to the parallel plane of the 
eyed-end, or shank, of the hook when laid on its side. The only 
allowable offset circle hooks are those that are offset by the hook 
manufacturer. If green-stick gear, as defined at Sec. 635.2, is 
onboard, a vessel may possess up to 20 J-hooks. J-hooks may be used only 
with green-stick gear, and no more than 10 hooks may be used at one time 
with each green-stick gear. J-hooks used with green-stick gear may be no 
smaller than 1.5 inch (38.1 mm) when measured in a straight line over 
the longest distance from the eye to any other part of the hook; and,
    (B) The vessel is limited, at all times, to possessing onboard and/
or using only whole Atlantic mackerel and/or squid bait, except that 
artificial bait may be possessed and used only with green-stick gear, as 
defined at Sec. 635.2, if green-stick gear is onboard; and,
    (C) Vessels must possess, inside the wheelhouse, a document provided 
by NMFS entitled, ``Careful Release Protocols for Sea Turtle Release 
with Minimal Injury,'' and must post, inside the wheelhouse, sea turtle 
handling and release guidelines provided by NMFS; and,
    (D) Required sea turtle bycatch mitigation gear, which NMFS has 
approved under paragraph (c)(5)(iv) of this section, on the initial list 
of ``NMFS-Approved Models For Equipment Needed For The Careful Release 
of Sea Turtles Caught In Hook And Line Fisheries,'' must be carried 
onboard, and must be used in accordance with the handling requirements 
specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(v)(E) through(G) of this section; and,
    (E) Sea turtle bycatch mitigation gear, specified in paragraph 
(c)(2)(v)(D) of this section, must be used to disengage any hooked or 
entangled sea turtles that cannot be brought on board, and to facilitate 
access, safe handling, disentanglement, and hook removal or hook cutting 
of sea turtles that can be brought on board, where feasible. Sea turtles 
must be handled, and bycatch mitigation gear must be used, in accordance 
with the careful release protocols and handling/release guidelines 
specified in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(C) of this section, and in accordance 
with the onboard handling and resuscitation requirements specified in 
Sec. 223.206(d)(1).
    (F) Boated turtles. When practicable, active and comatose sea 
turtles must be brought on board, with a minimum of injury, using a 
dipnet approved on the initial list specified in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(D) 
of this section. All turtles less than 3 ft (.91 m) carapace length 
should be boated, if sea conditions permit. A boated turtle should be 
placed on a standard automobile tire, or cushioned surface, in an 
upright orientation to immobilize it and facilitate gear removal. Then, 
it should be determined if the hook can be removed without causing 
further injury. All externally embedded hooks should be removed, unless 
hook removal would result in further injury to the turtle. No attempt to 
remove a hook should be made if the hook has been swallowed and the 
insertion point is not visible, or if it is determined that removal 
would result in further injury. If a hook cannot be removed, as much 
line as possible should be removed from the turtle using approved 
monofilament line cutters from the initial list specified in paragraph 
(c)(2)(v)(D) of this section, and the hook should be cut as close as 
possible to the insertion point before releasing the turtle using bolt 
cutters from that list. If a hook can be removed, an effective technique 
may be to cut off either the barb, or the eye, of the hook using bolt 
cutters, and then to slide the hook out. When the hook is visible in the 
front of the mouth, an approved mouth-opener from the initial list 
specified in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(D) of this section may facilitate 
opening the turtle's mouth, and an approved gag from that list may 
facilitate keeping the mouth open. Short-handled dehookers for ingested 
hooks, long-nose pliers, or needle-nose pliers from the initial list 
specified in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(D) of this section should be used to 
remove visible hooks from the mouth that have not been swallowed on 
boated turtles, as appropriate. As much gear as possible must be removed 
from the turtle without causing further injury prior to its release. 
Refer to the careful release protocols and handling/release guidelines 
required in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(C) of this section,

[[Page 388]]

and the handling and resuscitation requirements specified in Sec. 
223.206(d)(1) of this title, for additional information.
    (G) Non-boated turtles. If a sea turtle is too large, or hooked in a 
manner that precludes safe boating without causing further damage or 
injury to the turtle, sea turtle bycatch mitigation gear, specified in 
paragraph (c)(2)(v)(D) of this section, must be used to disentangle sea 
turtles from fishing gear and disengage any hooks, or to clip the line 
and remove as much line as possible from a hook that cannot be removed, 
prior to releasing the turtle, in accordance with the protocols 
specified in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(C) of this section. Non-boated turtles 
should be brought close to the boat and provided with time to calm down. 
Then, it must be determined whether or not the hook can be removed 
without causing further injury. A front flipper or flippers of the 
turtle must be secured, if possible, with an approved turtle control 
device from the list specified in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(D) of this 
section. All externally embedded hooks must be removed, unless hook 
removal would result in further injury to the turtle. No attempt should 
be made to remove a hook if it has been swallowed, or if it is 
determined that removal would result in further injury. If the hook 
cannot be removed and/or if the animal is entangled, as much line as 
possible must be removed prior to release, using an approved line cutter 
from the list specified in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(D) of this section. If 
the hook can be removed, it must be removed using a long-handled 
dehooker from the initial list specified in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(D) of 
this section. Without causing further injury, as much gear as possible 
must be removed from the turtle prior to its release. Refer to the 
careful release protocols and handling/release guidelines required in 
paragraph (c)(2)(v)(C) of this section, and the handling and 
resuscitation requirements specified in Sec. 223.206(d)(1) of this 
title, for additional information.
    (3) When a marine mammal or sea turtle is hooked or entangled by 
pelagic longline gear, the operator of the vessel must immediately 
release the animal, retrieve the pelagic longline gear, and move at 
least 1 nm (2 km) from the location of the incident before resuming 
fishing. Reports of marine mammal entanglements must be submitted to 
NMFS consistent with regulations in Sec. 229.6 of this title.
    (4) In the Gulf of Mexico: pelagic longline gear may not be fished 
or deployed from a vessel issued a permit under this part with live bait 
affixed to the hooks; and, a person aboard a vessel issued a permit 
under this part that has pelagic longline gear on board shall not 
maintain live baitfish in any tank or well on board the vessel and shall 
not possess live baitfish, and shall not set up or attach an aeration or 
water circulation device in or to any such tank or well. For the 
purposes of this section, the Gulf of Mexico includes all waters of the 
U.S. EEZ west and north of the boundary stipulated at 50 CFR 600.105(c).
    (5) The operator of a vessel required to be permitted under this 
part and that has pelagic longline gear on board must undertake the 
following sea turtle bycatch mitigation measures:
    (i) Possession and use of required mitigation gear. Required sea 
turtle bycatch mitigation gear, which NMFS has approved under paragraph 
(c)(5)(iv) of this section as meeting the minimum design standards 
specified in paragraphs (c)(5)(i)(A) through (c)(5)(i)(M) of this 
section, must be carried onboard, and must be used to disengage any 
hooked or entangled sea turtles in accordance with the handling 
requirements specified in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section.
    (A) Long-handled line clipper or cutter. Line cutters are intended 
to cut high test monofilament line as close as possible to the hook, and 
assist in removing line from entangled sea turtles to minimize any 
remaining gear upon release. NMFS has established minimum design 
standards for the line cutters. The LaForce line cutter and the 
Arceneaux line clipper are models that meet these minimum design 
standards, and may be purchased or fabricated from readily available and 
low-cost materials. One long-handled line clipper or cutter and a set of 
replacement blades are required to be onboard. The minimum design 
standards for line cutters are as follows:

[[Page 389]]

    (1) A protected and secured cutting blade. The cutting blade(s) must 
be capable of cutting 2.0-2.1 mm (0.078 in.-0.083 in.) monofilament line 
(400-lb test) or polypropylene multistrand material, known as braided or 
tarred mainline, and must be maintained in working order. The cutting 
blade must be curved, recessed, contained in a holder, or otherwise 
designed to facilitate its safe use so that direct contact between the 
cutting surface and the sea turtle or the user is prevented. The cutting 
instrument must be securely attached to an extended reach handle and be 
easily replaceable. One extra set of replacement blades meeting these 
standards must also be carried on board to replace all cutting surfaces 
on the line cutter or clipper.
    (2) An extended reach handle. The line cutter blade must be securely 
fastened to an extended reach handle or pole with a minimum length equal 
to, or greater than, 150 percent of the freeboard, or a minimum of 6 
feet (1.83 m), whichever is greater. It is recommended, but not 
required, that the handle break down into sections. There is no 
restriction on the type of material used to construct this handle as 
long as it is sturdy and facilitates the secure attachment of the 
cutting blade.
    (B) Long-handled dehooker for ingested hooks. A long-handled 
dehooking device is intended to remove ingested hooks from sea turtles 
that cannot be boated. It should also be used to engage a loose hook 
when a turtle is entangled but not hooked, and line is being removed. 
The design must shield the barb of the hook and prevent it from re-
engaging during the removal process. One long-handled device to remove 
ingested hooks is required onboard. The minimum design standards are as 
follows:
    (1) Hook removal device. The hook removal device must be constructed 
of 5/16-inch (7.94 mm) 316 L stainless steel and have a dehooking end no 
larger than 1 7/8-inches (4.76 cm) outside diameter. The device must 
securely engage and control the leader while shielding the barb to 
prevent the hook from re-engaging during removal. It may not have any 
unprotected terminal points (including blunt ones), as these could cause 
injury to the esophagus during hook removal. The device must be of a 
size appropriate to secure the range of hook sizes and styles used in 
the pelagic longline fishery targeting swordfish and tuna.
    (2) Extended reach handle. The dehooking end must be securely 
fastened to an extended reach handle or pole with a minimum length equal 
to or greater than 150 percent of the freeboard, or a minimum of 6 ft 
(1.83 m), whichever is greater. It is recommended, but not required, 
that the handle break down into sections. The handle must be sturdy and 
strong enough to facilitate the secure attachment of the hook removal 
device.
    (C) Long-handled dehooker for external hooks. A long-handled 
dehooker is required for use on externally-hooked sea turtles that 
cannot be boated. The long-handled dehooker for ingested hooks described 
in paragraph (c)(5)(i)(B) of this section would meet this requirement. 
The minimum design standards are as follows:
    (1) Construction. A long-handled dehooker must be constructed of 5/
16-inch (7.94 mm) 316 L stainless steel rod. A 5-inch (12.7-cm) tube T-
handle of 1-inch (2.54 cm) outside diameter is recommended, but not 
required. The design should be such that a fish hook can be rotated out, 
without pulling it out at an angle. The dehooking end must be blunt with 
all edges rounded. The device must be of a size appropriate to secure 
the range of hook sizes and styles used in the pelagic longline fishery 
targeting swordfish and tuna.
    (2) Extended reach handle. The handle must be a minimum length equal 
to the freeboard of the vessel or 6 ft (1.83 m), whichever is greater.
    (D) Long-handled device to pull an ``inverted V''. This tool is used 
to pull a ``V'' in the fishing line when implementing the ``inverted V'' 
dehooking technique, as described in the document entitled ``Careful 
Release Protocols for Sea Turtle Release With Minimal Injury,'' required 
under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, for disentangling and dehooking 
entangled sea turtles. One long-handled device to pull an ``inverted V'' 
is required onboard. If a 6-ft (1.83 m) J-style dehooker is used to 
comply with paragraph (c)(5)(i)(C) of

[[Page 390]]

this section, it will also satisfy this requirement. Minimum design 
standards are as follows:
    (1) Hook end. This device, such as a standard boat hook or gaff, 
must be constructed of stainless steel or aluminum. A sharp point, such 
as on a gaff hook, is to be used only for holding the monofilament 
fishing line and should never contact the sea turtle.
    (2) Extended reach handle. The handle must have a minimum length 
equal to the freeboard of the vessel, or 6 ft (1.83 m), whichever is 
greater. The handle must be sturdy and strong enough to facilitate the 
secure attachment of the gaff hook.
    (E) Dipnet. One dipnet is required onboard. Dipnets are to be used 
to facilitate safe handling of sea turtles by allowing them to be 
brought onboard for fishing gear removal, without causing further injury 
to the animal. Turtles must not be brought onboard without the use of a 
dipnet. The minimum design standards for dipnets are as follows:
    (1) Size of dipnet. The dipnet must have a sturdy net hoop of at 
least 31 inches (78.74 cm) inside diameter and a bag depth of at least 
38 inches (96.52 cm) to accommodate turtles below 3 ft (0.914 m)carapace 
length. The bag mesh openings may not exceed 3 inches (7.62 cm) 3 inches 
(7.62 cm). There must be no sharp edges or burrs on the hoop, or where 
it is attached to the handle.
    (2) Extended reach handle. The dipnet hoop must be securely fastened 
to an extended reach handle or pole with a minimum length equal to, or 
greater than, 150 percent of the freeboard, or at least 6 ft (1.83 m), 
whichever is greater. The handle must made of a rigid material strong 
enough to facilitate the sturdy attachment of the net hoop and able to 
support a minimum of 100 lbs (34.1 kg) without breaking or significant 
bending or distortion. It is recommended, but not required, that the 
extended reach handle break down into sections.
    (F) Tire. A minimum of one tire is required for supporting a turtle 
in an upright orientation while it is onboard, although an assortment of 
sizes is recommended to accommodate a range of turtle sizes. The 
required tire must be a standard passenger vehicle tire, and must be 
free of exposed steel belts.
    (G) Short-handled dehooker for ingested hooks. One short-handled 
device for removing ingested hooks is required onboard. This dehooker is 
designed to remove ingested hooks from boated sea turtles. It can also 
be used on external hooks or hooks in the front of the mouth. Minimum 
design standards are as follows:
    (1) Hook removal device. The hook removal device must be constructed 
of 1/4-inch (6.35 mm) 316 L stainless steel, and must allow the hook to 
be secured and the barb shielded without re-engaging during the removal 
process. It must be no larger than 1\5/16\ inch (3.33 cm) outside 
diameter. It may not have any unprotected terminal points (including 
blunt ones), as this could cause injury to the esophagus during hook 
removal. A sliding PVC bite block must be used to protect the beak and 
facilitate hook removal if the turtle bites down on the dehooking 
device. The bite block should be constructed of a \3/4\-inch (1.91 cm) 
inside diameter high impact plastic cylinder (e.g., Schedule 80 PVC) 
that is 10 inches (25.4 cm) long to allow for 5 inches (12.7 cm) of 
slide along the shaft. The device must be of a size appropriate to 
secure the range of hook sizes and styles used in the pelagic longline 
fishery targeting swordfish and tuna.
    (2) Handle length. The handle should be approximately 16-24 inches 
(40.64 cm-60.69 cm) in length, with approximately a 5-inch (12.7 cm) 
long tube T-handle of approximately 1 inch (2.54 cm) in diameter.
    (H) Short-handled dehooker for external hooks. One short-handled 
dehooker for external hooks is required onboard. The short-handled 
dehooker for ingested hooks required to comply with paragraph 
(c)(5)(i)(G) of this section will also satisfy this requirement. Minimum 
design standards are as follows:
    (1) Hook removal device. The dehooker must be constructed of 5/16-
inch (7.94 cm) 316 L stainless steel, and the design must be such that a 
hook can be rotated out without pulling it out at an angle. The 
dehooking end must be blunt, and all edges rounded. The device must be 
of a size appropriate to secure the range of hook sizes and styles

[[Page 391]]

used in the pelagic longline fishery targeting swordfish and tuna.
    (2) Handle length. The handle should be approximately 16-24 inches 
(40.64 cm-60.69 cm) long with approximately a 5-inch (12.7 cm) long tube 
T-handle of approximately 1 inch (2.54 cm) in diameter.
    (I) Long-nose or needle-nose pliers. One pair of long-nose or 
needle-nose pliers is required on board. Required long-nose or needle-
nose pliers can be used to remove deeply embedded hooks from the 
turtle's flesh that must be twisted during removal. They can also hold 
PVC splice couplings, when used as mouth openers, in place. Minimum 
design standards are as follows:
    (1) General. They must be approximately 12 inches (30.48 cm) in 
length, and should be constructed of stainless steel material.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (J) Bolt cutters. One pair of bolt cutters is required on board. 
Required bolt cutters may be used to cut hooks to facilitate their 
removal. They should be used to cut off the eye or barb of a hook, so 
that it can safely be pushed through a sea turtle without causing 
further injury. They should also be used to cut off as much of the hook 
as possible, when the remainder of the hook cannot be removed. Minimum 
design standards are as follows:
    (1) General. They must be approximately 17 inches (43.18 cm) in 
total length, with 4-inch (10.16 cm) long blades that are 2\1/4\ inches 
(5.72 cm) wide, when closed, and with 13-inch (33.02 cm) long handles. 
Required bolt cutters must be able to cut hard metals, such as stainless 
or carbon steel hooks, up to 1/4-inch (6.35 mm) diameter.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (K) Monofilament line cutters. One pair of monofilament line cutters 
is required on board. Required monofilament line cutters must be used to 
remove fishing line as close to the eye of the hook as possible, if the 
hook is swallowed or cannot be removed. Minimum design standards are as 
follows:
    (1) General. Monofilament line cutters must be approximately 7\1/2\ 
inches (19.05 cm) in length. The blades must be 1 in (4.45 cm) in length 
and \5/8\ in (1.59 cm) wide, when closed, and are recommended to be 
coated with Teflon (a trademark owned by E.I. DuPont de Nemours and 
Company Corp.).
    (2) [Reserved]
    (L) Mouth openers/mouth gags. Required mouth openers and mouth gags 
are used to open sea turtle mouths, and to keep them open when removing 
ingested hooks from boated turtles. They must allow access to the hook 
or line without causing further injury to the turtle. Design standards 
are included in the item descriptions. At least two of the seven 
different types of mouth openers/gags described below are required:
    (1) A block of hard wood. Placed in the corner of the jaw, a block 
of hard wood may be used to gag open a turtle's mouth. A smooth block of 
hard wood of a type that does not splinter (e.g. maple) with rounded 
edges should be sanded smooth, if necessary, and soaked in water to 
soften the wood. The dimensions should be approximately 11 inches (27.94 
cm) 1 inch (2.54 cm) 1 inch (2.54 cm). A long-handled, wire shoe brush 
with a wooden handle, and with the wires removed, is an inexpensive, 
effective and practical mouth-opening device that meets these 
requirements.
    (2) A set of three canine mouth gags. Canine mouth gags are highly 
recommended to hold a turtle's mouth open, because the gag locks into an 
open position to allow for hands-free operation after it is in place. A 
set of canine mouth gags must include one of each of the following 
sizes: small (5 inches)(12.7 cm), medium (6 inches) (15.24 cm), and 
large (7 inches)(17.78 cm). They must be constructed of stainless steel. 
A 1 -inch (4.45 cm) piece of vinyl tubing (3/4-inch (1.91 cm) outside 
diameter and 5/8-inch (1.59 cm) inside diameter) must be placed over the 
ends to protect the turtle's beak.
    (3) A set of two sturdy dog chew bones. Placed in the corner of a 
turtle's jaw, canine chew bones are used to gag open a sea turtle's 
mouth. Required canine chews must be constructed of durable nylon, 
zylene resin, or thermoplastic polymer, and strong enough to withstand 
biting without splintering. To accommodate a variety of turtle beak 
sizes, a set must include one large (5\1/2\-

[[Page 392]]

8 inches(13.97 cm-20.32 cm) in length), and one small (3\1/2\-4\1/2\ 
inches (8.89 cm-11.43 cm) in length) canine chew bones.
    (4) A set of two rope loops covered with hose. A set of two rope 
loops covered with a piece of hose can be used as a mouth opener, and to 
keep a turtle's mouth open during hook and/or line removal. A required 
set consists of two 3-foot (0.91 m) lengths of poly braid rope (3/8-inch 
(9.52 mm) diameter suggested), each covered with an 8-inch (20.32 cm) 
section of \1/2\ inch (1.27 cm) or \3/4\ inch (1.91 cm) light-duty 
garden hose, and each tied into a loop. The upper loop of rope covered 
with hose is secured on the upper beak to give control with one hand, 
and the second piece of rope covered with hose is secured on the lower 
beak to give control with the user's foot.
    (5) A hank of rope. Placed in the corner of a turtle's jaw, a hank 
of rope can be used to gag open a sea turtle's mouth. A 6-foot (1.83 m) 
lanyard of approximately 3/16-inch (4.76 mm) braided nylon rope may be 
folded to create a hank, or looped bundle, of rope. Any size soft-
braided nylon rope is allowed, however it must create a hank of 
approximately 2-4 inches (5.08 cm-10.16 cm) in thickness.
    (6) A set of four PVC splice couplings. PVC splice couplings can be 
positioned inside a turtle's mouth to allow access to the back of the 
mouth for hook and line removal. They are to be held in place with the 
needle-nose pliers. To ensure proper fit and access, a required set must 
consist of the following Schedule 40 PVC splice coupling sizes: 1 inch 
(2.54 cm), 1\1/4\ inch (3.18 cm), 1\1/2\ inch (3.81 cm), and 2 inches 
(5.08 cm).
    (7) A large avian oral speculum. A large avian oral speculum 
provides the ability to hold a turtle's mouth open and to control the 
head with one hand, while removing a hook with the other hand. The avian 
oral speculum must be 9-inches (22.86 cm) long, and constructed of 3/16-
inch (4.76 mm) wire diameter surgical stainless steel (Type 304). It 
must be covered with 8 inches (20.32 cm) of clear vinyl tubing (\5/16\-
inch (7.9 mm) outside diameter, 3/16-inch (4.76 mm) inside diameter).
    (M) Turtle control devices. Effective January 1, 2009, one turtle 
control device, as described in paragraph (c)(5)(i)(M)(1) or (2) of this 
section, is required onboard and must be used to secure a front flipper 
of the sea turtle so that the animal can be controlled at the side of 
the vessel. It is strongly recommended that a pair of turtle control 
devices be used to secure both front flippers when crew size and 
conditions allow. Minimum design standards consist of:
    (1) Turtle tether and extended reach handle. Approximately 15-20 
feet of 1/2-inch hard lay negative buoyance line is used to make an 
approximately 30-inch loop to slip over the flipper. The line is fed 
through a 3/4-inch fair lead, eyelet, or eyebolt at the working end of a 
pole and through a 3/4-inch eyelet or eyebolt in the midsection. A 1/2-
inch quick release cleat holds the line in place near the end of the 
pole. A final 3/4-inch eyelet or eyebolt should be positioned 
approximately 7-inches behind the cleat to secure the line, while 
allowing a safe working distance to avoid injury when releasing the line 
from the cleat. The line must be securely fastened to an extended reach 
handle or pole with a minimum length equal to, or greater than, 150 
percent of the freeboard, or a minimum of 6 feet (1.83 m), whichever is 
greater. There is no restriction on the type of material used to 
construct this handle, as long as it is sturdy. The handle must include 
a tag line to attach the tether to the vessel to prevent the turtle from 
breaking away with the tether still attached.
    (2) T&G ninja sticks and extended reach handles. Approximately 30-35 
feet of 1/2-inch to 5/8-inch soft lay polypropylene or nylon line or 
similar is fed through 2 PVC conduit, fiberglass, of similar sturdy 
poles and knotted using an overhand (recommended) knot at the end of 
both poles or otherwise secured. There should be approximately 18-24 
inches of exposed rope between the poles to be used as a working surface 
to capture and secure the flipper. Knot the line at the ends of both 
poles to prevent line slippage if they are not otherwise secured. The 
remaining line is used to tether the apparatus to the boat unless an 
additional tag line is used. Two lengths of sunlight resistant 3/4-inch 
schedule 40 PVC electrical conduit, fiberglass, aluminum, or similar 
material should be used to construct

[[Page 393]]

the apparatus with a minimum length equal to, or greater than, 150 
percent of the freeboard, or a minimum of 6 feet (1.83 m), whichever is 
greater.
    (ii) Handling and release requirements. (A) Sea turtle bycatch 
mitigation gear, as required by paragraphs (c)(5)(i)(A) through (D) of 
this section, must be used to disengage any hooked or entangled sea 
turtles that cannot be brought onboard. Sea turtle bycatch mitigation 
gear, as required by paragraphs (c)(5)(i)(E) through (M) of this 
section, must be used to facilitate access, safe handling, 
disentanglement, and hook removal or hook cutting of sea turtles that 
can be brought onboard, where feasible. Sea turtles must be handled, and 
bycatch mitigation gear must be used, in accordance with the careful 
release protocols and handling/release guidelines specified in paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section, and in accordance with the onboard handling and 
resuscitation requirements specified in Sec. 223.206(d)(1)of this 
title.
    (B) Boated turtles. When practicable, active and comatose sea 
turtles must be brought on board, with a minimum of injury, using a 
dipnet as required by paragraph (c)(5)(i)(E) of this section. All 
turtles less than 3 ft (.91 m) carapace length should be boated, if sea 
conditions permit.
    (1) A boated turtle should be placed on a standard automobile tire, 
or cushioned surface, in an upright orientation to immobilize it and 
facilitate gear removal. Then, it should be determined if the hook can 
be removed without causing further injury. All externally embedded hooks 
should be removed, unless hook removal would result in further injury to 
the turtle. No attempt to remove a hook should be made if it has been 
swallowed and the insertion point is not visible, or if it is determined 
that removal would result in further injury. If a hook cannot be 
removed, as much line as possible should be removed from the turtle 
using monofilament cutters as required by paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this 
section, and the hook should be cut as close as possible to the 
insertion point before releasing the turtle, using boltcutters as 
required by paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section. If a hook can be 
removed, an effective technique may be to cut off either the barb, or 
the eye, of the hook using bolt cutters, and then to slide the hook out. 
When the hook is visible in the front of the mouth, a mouth-opener, as 
required by paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, may facilitate opening 
the turtle's mouth and a gag may facilitate keeping the mouth open. 
Short-handled dehookers for ingested hooks, long-nose pliers, or needle-
nose pliers, as required by paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, should 
be used to remove visible hooks from the mouth that have not been 
swallowed on boated turtles, as appropriate. As much gear as possible 
must be removed from the turtle without causing further injury prior to 
its release. Refer to the careful release protocols and handling/release 
guidelines required in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and the 
handling and resuscitation requirements specified in Sec. 223.206(d)(1) 
of this title, for additional information.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (C) Non-boated turtles. If a sea turtle is too large, or hooked in a 
manner that precludes safe boating without causing further damage or 
injury to the turtle, sea turtle bycatch mitigation gear required by 
paragraphs (c)(5)(i)(A)-(D) of this section must be used to disentangle 
sea turtles from fishing gear and disengage any hooks, or to clip the 
line and remove as much line as possible from a hook that cannot be 
removed, prior to releasing the turtle, in accordance with the protocols 
specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
    (1) Non-boated turtles should be brought close to the boat and 
provided with time to calm down. Then, it must be determined whether or 
not the hook can be removed without causing further injury. A front 
flipper or flippers of the turtle must be secured with an approved 
turtle control device from the list specified in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(D) 
of this section. All externally embedded hooks must be removed, unless 
hook removal would result in further injury to the turtle. No attempt 
should be made to remove a hook if it has been swallowed, or if it is 
determined that removal would result in further injury. If the hook 
cannot be removed and/or if the animal is entangled, as much line as 
possible must be removed

[[Page 394]]

prior to release, using a line cutter as required by paragraph (c)(5)(i) 
of this section. If the hook can be removed, it must be removed using a 
long-handled dehooker as required by paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this 
section. Without causing further injury, as much gear as possible must 
be removed from the turtle prior to its release. Refer to the careful 
release protocols and handling/release guidelines required in paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section, and the handling and resuscitation requirements 
specified in Sec. 223.206(d)(1) for additional information.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (iii) Gear modifications. The following measures are required of 
vessel operators to reduce the incidental capture and mortality of sea 
turtles:
    (A) Gangion length. The length of any gangion on vessels that have 
pelagic longline gear on board and that have been issued, or are 
required to have, a limited access swordfish, shark, or tuna longline 
category permit for use in the Atlantic Ocean including the Caribbean 
Sea and the Gulf of Mexico must be at least 10 percent longer than any 
floatline length if the total length of any gangion plus the total 
length of any floatline is less than 100 meters.
    (B) Corrodible hooks. Vessels that have pelagic longline gear on 
board and that have been issued, or are required to have, a limited 
access swordfish, shark, or tuna longline category permit for use in the 
Atlantic Ocean including the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico must 
only have corrodible hooks on board.
    (C) Hook size, type, and bait. Vessels fishing outside of the NED 
closed area, as defined at Sec. 635.2, that have pelagic longline gear 
on board, and that have been issued, or are required to have, a limited 
access swordfish, shark, or tuna longline category permit for use in the 
Atlantic Ocean, including the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, are 
limited, at all times, to possessing on board and/or using only whole 
finfish and/or squid bait, and the following types and sizes of fishing 
hooks:
    (1) 18/0 or larger circle hooks with an offset not to exceed 
10[deg]; and/or,
    (2) 16/0 or larger non-offset circle hooks.
    (i) For purposes of paragraphs (c)(5)(iii)(C)(1) and 
(c)(5)(iii)(C)(2) of this section, the outer diameter of an 18/0 circle 
hook at its widest point must be no smaller than 2.16 inches (55 mm), 
and the outer diameter of a 16/0 circle hook at its widest point must be 
no smaller than 1.74 inches (44.3 mm), when measured with the eye of the 
hook on the vertical axis (y-axis) and perpendicular to the horizontal 
axis (x-axis). The distance between the hook point and the shank (i.e., 
the gap) on an 18/0 circle hook must be no larger than 1.13 inches (28.8 
mm), and the gap on a 16/0 circle hook must be no larger than 1.01 
inches (25.8 mm). The allowable offset is measured from the barbed end 
of the hook, and is relative to the parallel plane of the eyed-end, or 
shank, of the hook when laid on its side. The only allowable offset 
circle hooks are those that are offset by the hook manufacturer. In the 
Gulf of Mexico, as described at Sec. 600.105(c), circle hooks also must 
be constructed of corrodible round wire stock that is no larger than 
3.65 mm in diameter.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (3) If green-stick gear, as defined at Sec. 635.2, is onboard, a 
vessel may possess up to 20 J-hooks. J-hooks may be used only with 
green-stick gear, and no more than 10 hooks may be used at one time with 
each green-stick gear. J-hooks used with green-stick gear may be no 
smaller than 1.5 inch (38.1 mm) when measured in a straight line over 
the longest distance from the eye to any other part of the hook. If 
green-stick gear is onboard, artificial bait may be possessed, but used 
only with green-stick gear.
    (iv) Approval of sea turtle bycatch mitigation gear. NMFS will file 
with the Office of the Federal Register for publication an initial list 
of required sea turtle bycatch mitigation gear that NMFS has approved as 
meeting the minimum design standards specified under paragraph (c)(5)(i) 
of this section. Other devices proposed for use as line clippers or 
cutters or dehookers, as specified under paragraphs (c)(5)(i)(A), (B), 
(C), (G), (H), and (K) of this section, must be approved as meeting the 
minimum design standards before being used. NMFS will examine new 
devices, as they become available, to determine if

[[Page 395]]

they meet the minimum design standards, and will file with the Office of 
the Federal Register for publication notification of any new devices 
that are approved as meeting the standards.
    (d) Bottom longlines. For the purposes of this part, a vessel is 
considered to have bottom longline gear on board when a power-operated 
longline hauler, a mainline, weights and/or anchors capable of 
maintaining contact between the mainline and the ocean bottom, and 
leaders (gangions) with hooks are on board. Removal of any one of these 
elements constitutes removal of bottom longline gear. Bottom longline 
vessels may have a limited number of floats and/or high flyers onboard 
for the purposes of marking the location of the gear but removal of 
these floats does not constitute removal of bottom longline gear. If a 
vessel issued a permit under this part is in a closed area designated 
under paragraph (d)(1) of this section with bottom longline gear on 
board, it is a rebuttable presumption that any fish on board such a 
vessel were taken with bottom longline in the closed area.
    (1) If bottom longline gear is onboard a vessel issued a permit 
under this part, persons aboard that vessel may not fish or deploy any 
type of fishing gear in the following areas:
    (i) The mid-Atlantic shark closed area from January 1 through July 
31 each calendar year;
    (ii) The areas designated at Sec. 622.33(a)(1) through (3) of this 
chapter, year-round; and
    (iii) The areas described in paragraphs (d)(1)(iii)(A) through (H) 
of this section, year-round.

    (2) When a marine mammal, sea turtle, or smalltooth sawfish is 
hooked or entangled by bottom longline gear, the operator of the vessel 
must immediately release the animal, retrieve the bottom longline gear, 
and move at

[[Page 396]]

least 1 nmi (2 km) from the location of the incident before resuming 
fishing. Reports of marine mammal entanglements must be submitted to 
NMFS consistent with regulations in Sec. 229.6 of this title.
    (3) The operator of a vessel required to be permitted under this 
part and that has bottom longline gear on board must undertake the 
following bycatch mitigation measures to release sea turtles, prohibited 
sharks, or smalltooth sawfish, as appropriate.
    (i) Possession and use of required mitigation gear. The equipment 
listed in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section must be carried on board 
and must be used to handle, release, and disentangle hooked or entangled 
sea turtles, prohibited sharks, or smalltooth sawfish in accordance with 
requirements specified in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Handling and release requirements. Sea turtle bycatch 
mitigation gear, as required by paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, 
must be used to disengage any hooked or entangled sea turtle as stated 
in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section. This mitigation gear should 
also be employed to disengage any hooked or entangled species of 
prohibited sharks as listed under heading D of Table 1 of appendix A of 
this part, any hooked or entangled species of sharks that exceed the 
retention limits as specified in Sec. 635.24(a), and any hooked or 
entangled smalltooth sawfish. In addition, if a smalltooth sawfish is 
caught, the fish should be kept in the water while maintaining water 
flow over the gills and the fish should be examined for research tags. 
All smalltooth sawfish must be released in a manner that will ensure 
maximum probability of survival, but without removing the fish from the 
water or any research tags from the fish.
    (iii) Corrodible hooks. Vessels that have bottom longline gear on 
board and that have been issued, or required to have, a limited access 
shark permit for use in the Atlantic Ocean, including the Caribbean Sea 
and the Gulf of Mexico, must only have corrodible hooks on board.
    (4) If a vessel issued or required to be issued a permit under this 
part is in a closed area designated under paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section and has pelagic longline gear onboard, the vessel may not, at 
any time, possess or land any demersal species listed in Table 3 of 
Appendix A to this part in excess of 5 percent, by weight, of the total 
weight of pelagic and demersal species possessed or landed, that are 
listed in Tables 2 and 3 of Appendix A to this part.
    (e) Authorized gear--(1) Atlantic tunas. A person that fishes for, 
retains, or possesses an Atlantic bluefin tuna may not have on board a 
vessel or use on board a vessel any primary gear other than those 
authorized for the category for which the Atlantic tunas or HMS permit 
has been issued for such vessel. Primary gears are the gears 
specifically authorized in this section. When fishing for Atlantic tunas 
other than BFT, primary gear authorized for any Atlantic Tunas permit 
category may be used, except that purse seine gear may be used only on 
board vessels permitted in the Purse Seine category and pelagic longline 
gear may be used only on board vessels issued an Atlantic Tunas Longline 
category tuna permit, a LAP other than handgear for swordfish, and a LAP 
for sharks.
    (i) Angling. Speargun (for BAYS tunas only), and rod and reel 
(including downriggers)and handline (for all tunas).
    (ii) Charter/Headboat. Rod and reel (including downriggers), bandit 
gear, handline, and green-stick gear are authorized for all recreational 
and commercial Atlantic tuna fisheries. Speargun is authorized for 
recreational Atlantic BAYS tuna fisheries only.
    (iii) General. Rod and reel (including downriggers), handline, 
harpoon, bandit gear, and green-stick.
    (iv) Harpoon. Harpoon.
    (v) Longline. Longline and green-stick.
    (vi) Purse Seine. Purse seine.
    (A) Mesh size. A purse seine used in directed fishing for BFT must 
have a mesh size equal to or smaller than 4.5 inches (11.4 cm) in the 
main body (stretched when wet) and must have at least 24-count thread 
throughout the net.
    (B) Inspection of purse seine vessels. Persons that own or operate a 
purse seine vessel conducting a directed fishery for Atlantic tunas must 
have their

[[Page 397]]

fishing gear inspected for mesh size by an enforcement agent of NMFS 
prior to commencing fishing for the season in any fishery that may 
result in the harvest of Atlantic tunas. Such persons must request such 
inspection at least 24 hours before commencement of the first fishing 
trip of the season. If NMFS does not inspect the vessel within 24 hours 
of such notification, the inspection requirement is waived. In addition, 
at least 24 hours before commencement of offloading any BFT after a 
fishing trip, such persons must request an inspection of the vessel and 
catch by notifying NMFS. If, after notification by the vessel, NMFS does 
not arrange to inspect the vessel and catch at offloading, the 
inspection requirement is waived.
    (vii) Trap. Pound net and fish weir.
    (2) Billfish. (i) Only persons who have been issued a valid HMS 
Angling or valid Charter/Headboat permit, or who have been issued a 
valid Atlantic Tunas General category permit and are participating in a 
tournament as provided in 635.4 (c) of this part, may possess a blue 
marlin, white marlin, or roundscale spearfish in, or take a blue marlin, 
white marlin, or roundscale spearfish from, its management unit. Blue 
marlin, white marlin, or roundscale spearfish may only be harvested by 
rod and reel.
    (ii) Only persons who have been issued a valid HMS Angling or valid 
Charter/Headboat permit, or who have been issued a valid Atlantic Tunas 
General category permit and are participating in a tournament as 
provided in Sec. 635.4(c) of this part, may possess or take a sailfish 
shoreward of the outer boundary of the Atlantic EEZ. Sailfish may only 
be harvested by rod and reel.
    (iii) After December 31, 2007, persons who have been issued or are 
required to be issued a permit under this part and who are participating 
in a ``tournament'', as defined in Sec. 635.2, that bestows points, 
prizes, or awards for Atlantic billfish must deploy only non-offset 
circle hooks when using natural bait or natural bait/artificial lure 
combinations, and may not deploy a J-hook or an offset circle hook in 
combination with natural bait or a natural bait/artificial lure 
combination.
    (3) Sharks. (i) No person may possess a shark in the EEZ taken from 
its management unit without a permit issued under Sec. 635.4. No person 
issued a Federal Atlantic commercial shark permit under Sec. 635.4 may 
possess a shark taken by any gear other than rod and reel, handline, 
bandit gear, longline, or gillnet. No person issued an HMS Angling 
permit or an HMS Charter/headboat permit under Sec. 635.4 may possess a 
shark if the shark was taken from its management unit by any gear other 
than rod and reel or handline, except that persons on a vessel issued 
both an HMS Charter/Headboat permit and a Federal Atlantic commercial 
shark permit may possess sharks taken with rod and reel, handline, 
bandit gear, longline, or gillnet if the vessel is not engaged in a for-
hire fishing trip.
    (ii) No person may fish for sharks with a gillnet with a total 
length of 2.5 km or more. No person may have on board a vessel a gillnet 
with a total length of 2.5 km or more.
    (iii) Persons fishing with gillnet gear must comply with the 
provisions implementing the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, 
the Bottlenose Dolphin Take Reduction Plan, the Harbor Porpoise Take 
Reduction Plan, and any other relevant Take Reduction Plan set forth in 
Sec. Sec. 229.32 through 229.35 of this title. If a listed whale is 
taken, the vessel operator must cease fishing operations immediately and 
contact NOAA Fisheries as required under Sec. 229 of this title.
    (iv) While fishing with a gillnet for or in possession of any of the 
large coastal, small coastal, and pelagic sharks listed in section A, B, 
and/or C of table 1 of appendix A of this part, the gillnet must remain 
attached to at least one vessel at one end, except during net checks.
    (v) Vessel operators fishing with gillnet for or in possession of 
any of the large coastal, small coastal, and pelagic sharks listed in 
sections A, B, and/or C of table 1 of appendix A of this part are 
required to conduct net checks every 0.5 to 2 hours to look for and 
remove any sea turtles, marine mammals, or smalltooth sawfish.

[[Page 398]]

Smalltooth sawfish should not be removed from the water while being 
removed from the net.
    (4) Swordfish. (i) No person may possess north Atlantic swordfish 
taken from its management unit by any gear other than handgear or 
longline, except that such swordfish taken incidentally while fishing 
with a squid trawl may be retained by a vessel issued a valid Incidental 
HMS squid trawl permit, subject to restrictions specified in Sec. 
635.24(b)(2). No person may possess south Atlantic swordfish taken from 
its management unit by any gear other than longline.
    (ii) An Atlantic swordfish may not be retained or possessed on board 
a vessel with a gillnet. A swordfish will be deemed to have been 
harvested by gillnet when it is onboard, or offloaded from a vessel 
using or having on board a gillnet.
    (iii) A person aboard a vessel issued or required to be issued a 
valid directed handgear LAP for Atlantic swordfish may not fish for 
swordfish with any gear other than handgear. A swordfish will be deemed 
to have been harvested by longline when the fish is on board or 
offloaded from a vessel using or having on board longline gear. Only 
vessels that have been issued, or that are required to have been issued, 
a valid directed or handgear swordfish LAP under this part may utilize 
or possess buoy gear. Vessels utilizing buoy gear may not possess or 
deploy more than 35 floatation devices, and may not deploy more than 35 
individual buoy gears per vessel. Buoy gear must be constructed and 
deployed so that the hooks and/or gangions are attached to the vertical 
portion of the mainline. Floatation devices may be attached to one but 
not both ends of the mainline, and no hooks or gangions may be attached 
to any floatation device or horizontal portion of the mainline. If more 
than one floatation device is attached to a buoy gear, no hook or 
gangion may be attached to the mainline between them. Individual buoy 
gears may not be linked, clipped, or connected together in any way. Buoy 
gears must be released and retrieved by hand. All deployed buoy gear 
must have some type of monitoring equipment affixed to it including, but 
not limited to, radar reflectors, beeper devices, lights, or reflective 
tape. If only reflective tape is affixed, the vessel deploying the buoy 
gear must possess on board an operable spotlight capable of illuminating 
deployed floatation devices. If a gear monitoring device is positively 
buoyant, and rigged to be attached to a fishing gear, it is included in 
the 35 floatation device vessel limit and must be marked appropriately.
    (iv) Except for persons aboard a vessel that has been issued a 
limited access North Atlantic swordfish permit or Incidental HMS squid 
trawl permit under Sec. 635.4, no person may fish for North Atlantic 
swordfish with, or possess a North Atlantic swordfish taken by, any gear 
other than handline or rod and reel.
    (f) Speargun fishing gear. Speargun fishing gear may only be 
utilized when recreational fishing for Atlantic BAYS tunas and only from 
vessels issued either a valid HMS Angling or valid HMS Charter/Headboat 
permit. Persons fishing for Atlantic BAYS tunas using speargun gear, as 
specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, must be physically in the 
water when the speargun is fired or discharged, and may freedive, use 
SCUBA, or other underwater breathing devices. Only free-swimming BAYS 
tunas, not those restricted by fishing lines or other means, may be 
taken by speargun fishing gear. ``Powerheads'', as defined at Sec. 
600.10 of this chapter, or any other explosive devices, may not be used 
to harvest or fish for BAYS tunas with speargun fishing gear.
    (g) Green-stick gear. Green-stick gear may only be utilized when 
fishing from vessels issued a valid Atlantic Tunas General, HMS Charter/
Headboat, or Atlantic Tunas Longline category permit. The gear must be 
attached to the vessel, actively trolled with the mainline at or above 
the water's surface, and may not be deployed with more than 10 hooks or 
gangions attached.

    (b) General. No person may fish for, catch, possess, or retain any 
Atlantic HMS with gears other than the primary gears specifically 
authorized in this part. Consistent with paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of 
this section, secondary gears may be used at boat side to aid and assist 
in subduing, or bringing on board a vessel, Atlantic HMS that have first 
been caught or captured using primary gears. For purposes of this part, 
secondary gears include, but are not limited to, dart harpoons, gaffs, 
flying gaffs, tail ropes, etc. Secondary gears may not be used to 
capture, or attempt to capture, free-swimming or undersized HMS. Except 
for vessels permitted under Sec. 635.4(o) or as specified in this 
paragraph (b), a vessel using or having onboard in the Atlantic Ocean 
any unauthorized gear may not possess an Atlantic HMS on board.

    (1) Atlantic tunas. A person that fishes for, retains, or possesses 
an Atlantic bluefin tuna (BFT) may not have on board a vessel or use on 
board a vessel any primary gear other than those authorized for the 
category for which the Atlantic tunas or HMS permit has been issued for 
such vessel. Primary gears are the gears specifically authorized in this 
section. When fishing for Atlantic tunas other than BFT, primary gear 
authorized for any Atlantic Tunas permit category may be used, except 
that purse seine gear may be used only on board vessels permitted in the 
Purse Seine category and pelagic longline gear may be used only on board 
vessels issued an Atlantic Tunas Longline category tuna permit, a LAP 
other than handgear for swordfish, and a LAP for sharks. A person issued 
an HMS Commercial Caribbean Small Boat permit who fishes for, retains, 
or possesses BAYS tunas in the U.S. Caribbean, as defined at Sec. 
622.2, may have on board and use handline, harpoon, rod and reel, bandit 
gear, green-stick gear, and buoy gear.

issued a Federal Atlantic commercial shark permit under Sec. 635.4 may 
possess a shark taken by any gear other than rod and reel, handline, 
bandit gear, longline, or gillnet. No person issued an HMS Commercial 
Caribbean Small Boat permit may possess a shark taken from the U.S. 
Caribbean, as defined at Sec. 622.2, by any gear other than with rod 
and reel, handline or bandit gear. No person issued an HMS Angling 
permit or an HMS Charter/headboat permit under Sec. 635.4 may possess a 
shark if the shark was taken from its management unit by any gear other 
than rod and reel or handline, except that persons on a vessel issued 
both an HMS Charter/Headboat permit and a Federal Atlantic commercial 
shark permit may possess sharks taken with rod and reel, handline, 
bandit gear, longline, or gillnet if the vessel is not engaged in a for-
hire fishing trip.

    (iii) A person aboard a vessel issued or required to be issued a 
valid directed handgear LAP for Atlantic swordfish or an HMS Commercial 
Caribbean Small Boat permit may not fish for swordfish with any gear 
other than handgear. A swordfish will be deemed to have been harvested 
by longline when the fish is on board or offloaded from a vessel using 
or having on board longline gear. Only vessels that have been issued, or 
that are required to have been issued, a valid directed or handgear 
swordfish LAP or an HMS Commercial Caribbean Small Boat permit under 
this part may utilize or possess buoy gear. Vessels utilizing buoy gear 
may not possess or deploy more than 35 floatation devices, and may not 
deploy more than 35 individual buoy gears per vessel. Buoy gear must be 
constructed and deployed so that the hooks and/or gangions are attached 
to the vertical portion of the mainline. Floatation devices may be 
attached to one but not both ends of the mainline, and no hooks or 
gangions may be attached to any floatation device or horizontal portion 
of the mainline. If more than one floatation device is attached to a 
buoy gear, no hook or gangion may be attached to the mainline between 
them. Individual buoy gears may not be linked, clipped, or connected 
together in any way. Buoy gears must be released and retrieved by hand. 
All deployed buoy gear must have some type of monitoring equipment 
affixed to it including, but not limited to, radar reflectors, beeper 
devices, lights, or reflective tape. If only reflective tape is affixed, 
the vessel deploying the buoy gear must possess on board an operable 
spotlight capable of illuminating deployed floatation devices. If a gear 
monitoring device is positively buoyant, and rigged to be attached to a 
fishing gear, it is included in the 35 floatation device vessel limit 
and must be marked appropriately.
    (iv) Except for persons aboard a vessel that has been issued a 
limited access North Atlantic swordfish permit, Incidental HMS squid 
trawl permit, or an HMS Commercial

[[Page 400]]

Caribbean Small Boat permit under Sec. 635.4, no person may fish for 
North Atlantic swordfish with, or possess a North Atlantic swordfish 
taken by, any gear other than handline or rod and reel.

Sec. 635.22  Recreational retention limits.

    (a) General. (1) Atlantic HMS caught, possessed, retained, or landed 
under these recreational limits may not be sold or transferred to any 
person for a commercial purpose. Recreational retention limits apply to 
a longbill spearfish taken or possessed shoreward of the outer boundary 
of the Atlantic EEZ, to a shark taken from or possessed in the Atlantic 
Ocean including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, to a North 
Atlantic swordfish taken from or possessed in the Atlantic Ocean, and to 
bluefin and yellowfin tuna taken from or possessed in the Atlantic 
Ocean. The operator of a vessel for which a retention limit applies is 
responsible for the vessel retention limit and for the cumulative 
retention limit based on the number of persons aboard. Federal 
recreational retention limits may not be combined with any recreational 
retention limit applicable in state waters.
    (2) Vessels issued an HMS General Category permit under Sec. 
635.4(d) that are participating in a HMS registered tournament, vessels 
issued a HMS Angling category permit under Sec. 635.4(c), or vessels 
issued a HMS Charter/Headboat permit under Sec. 635.4(b) may not 
retain, possess or land oceanic whitetip sharks or scalloped, smooth, or 
great hammerhead sharks if swordfish, tuna, or billfish are retained or 
possessed on board, or offloaded from, the vessel. Such vessels also may 
not retain, possess or land swordfish, tuna, or billfish if oceanic 
whitetip sharks, or scalloped, smooth, or great hammerhead sharks are 
retained or possessed on board, or offloaded from, the vessel.
    (b) Billfish. No longbill spearfish from the management unit may be 
taken, retained, or possessed shoreward of the outer boundary of the 
EEZ.
    (c) Sharks. (1) The recreational retention limit for sharks applies 
to any person who fishes in any manner, except to persons aboard a 
vessel that has been issued a Federal Atlantic commercial shark vessel 
permit under Sec. 635.4. The retention limit can change depending on 
the species being caught and the size limit under which they are being 
caught as specified under Sec. 635.20(e). If a commercial Atlantic 
shark quota is closed under Sec. 635.28, the recreational retention 
limit for sharks and no sale provision in paragraph (a) of this section 
may be applied to persons aboard a vessel issued a Federal Atlantic 
commercial shark vessel permit under Sec. 635.4, only if that vessel 
has also been issued an HMS Charter/Headboat permit issued under Sec. 
635.4 and is engaged in a for-hire fishing trip.
    (2) Only one shark from the following list may be retained per 
vessel per trip, subject to the size limits described in Sec.

finetooth (C. isodon), blacknose (C. Acronotus), and bonnethead (Sphyrna 
tiburo).
    (3) In addition to the sharks listed under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, one Atlantic sharpnose shark and one bonnethead shark may be 
retained per person per trip, subject to the size limits described in 
Sec. 635.20(e)(3).
    (4) No prohibited sharks, including parts or pieces of prohibited 
sharks, which are listed in section D of Table 1 of Appendix A to this 
part, may be retained regardless of where harvested.
    (5) Sharks listed in Table 1 of Appendix A that are not listed in 
this section, must be released by persons aboard a vessel that has not 
been issued a Federal Atlantic commercial shark vessel permit under 
Sec. 635.4.
    (6) [Reserved]
    (d) Yellowfin tuna. Three yellowfin tunas per person per day may be 
retained. Regardless of the length of a trip, no more than three 
yellowfin tuna per person may be possessed on board a vessel. The 
recreational retention limit for yellowfin tuna applies to a person who 
fishes in any manner, except to a

[[Page 401]]

person aboard a vessel issued an Atlantic Tunas vessel permit under 
Sec. 635.4. The recreational retention limit for yellowfin tuna applies 
to persons, including captain and crew, aboard a vessel that has been 
issued an Atlantic HMS Charter/Headboat permit only when the vessel is 
engaged in a for-hire trip.
    (e) Bluefin tuna. Refer to Sec. 635.23 for Atlantic bluefin tuna 
recreational retention limits.
    (f) North Atlantic swordfish. The recreational retention limits for 
North Atlantic swordfish apply to persons who fish in any manner, except 
to persons aboard a vessel that has been issued a limited access North 
Atlantic swordfish permit under Sec. 635.4.

Sec. 635.23  Retention limits for BFT.

    The retention limits in this section are subject to the quotas and 
closure provisions in Sec. Sec. 635.27 and 635.28.
    (a) General category. (1) No person aboard a vessel that has a 
General category Atlantic Tunas permit may possess, retain, land, or 
sell a BFT in the school, large school, or small medium size class.
    (2) On an RFD, no person aboard a vessel that has been issued a 
General category Atlantic Tunas permit may fish for, possess, retain, 
land, or sell a BFT of any size class, and catch-and-release or tag-and-
release fishing for BFT under Sec. 635.26 is not authorized from such 
vessel. On days other than RFDs, and when the General category is open, 
one large medium or giant BFT may be caught and landed from such vessel 
per day. NMFS will annually publish a schedule of RFDs in the Federal 
Register.
    (3) Regardless of the length of a trip, no more than a single day's 
retention limit of large medium or giant BFT may be possessed or 
retained aboard a vessel that has a General category Atlantic Tunas 
permit. On days other than RFDs, when the General category is open, no 
person aboard such vessel may continue to fish, and the vessel must 
immediately proceed to port once the applicable limit for large medium 
or giant BFT is retained.
    (4) To provide for maximum utilization of the quota for BFT, NMFS 
may increase or decrease the daily retention limit of large medium and 
giant BFT over a range from zero (on RFDs) to a maximum of five per 
vessel. Such increase or decrease will be based on the criteria provided 
under Sec. 635.27(a)(8). NMFS will adjust the daily retention limit 
specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section by filing an adjustment 
with the Office of the Federal Register for publication. In no case 
shall such adjustment be effective less than 3 calendar days after the 
date of filing with the Office of the Federal Register, except that 
previously designated RFDs may be waived effective upon closure of the 
General category fishery so that persons aboard vessels permitted in the 
General category may conduct tag-and-release fishing for BFT under Sec. 
635.26.
    (b) Angling category. BFT may be retained and landed under the daily 
limits and quotas applicable to the Angling category by persons aboard 
vessels issued an HMS Angling permit as follows:
    (1) Large medium and giant BFT. (i) No large medium or giant BFT may 
be retained, possessed, landed, or sold in the

[[Page 402]]

Gulf of Mexico, except one per vessel per year may be landed if caught 
incidentally to fishing for other species.
    (ii) One per vessel per year may be retained, possessed, and landed 
outside the Gulf of Mexico.
    (iii) When a large medium or giant BFT has been caught and retained 
under this paragraph (b)(1), no person aboard the vessel may continue to 
fish, the vessel must immediately proceed to port, and no such BFT may 
be sold or transferred to any person for a commercial purpose.
    (2) School, large school, or small medium BFT. (i) No school, large 
school, or small medium BFT may be retained, possessed, landed, or sold 
in the Gulf of Mexico.
    (ii) One school, large school, or small medium BFT per vessel per 
day may be retained, possessed, or landed outside the Gulf of Mexico. 
Regardless of the length of a trip, no more than a single day's 
allowable catch of school, large school, or small medium BFT may be 
possessed or retained.
    (3) Changes to retention limits. To provide for maximum utilization 
of the quota for BFT over the longest period of time, NMFS may increase 
or decrease the retention limit for any size class of BFT, or change a 
vessel trip limit to an angler trip limit and vice versa. Such increase 
or decrease in retention limit will be based on the criteria provided 
under Sec. 635.27 (a)(8). The retention limits may be adjusted 
separately for persons aboard a specific vessel type, such as private 
vessels, headboats, or charter boats. NMFS will adjust the daily 
retention limit specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section by filing 
an adjustment with the Office of the Federal Register for publication. 
In no case shall such adjustment be effective less than 3 calendar days 
after the date of filing with the Office of the Federal Register.
    (c) HMS Charter/Headboat. Persons aboard a vessel issued an HMS 
Charter/Headboat permit may retain and land BFT under the daily limits 
and quotas applicable to the Angling category or the General category as 
follows:
    (1) When fishing in the Gulf of Mexico, the restrictions applicable 
to the Angling category specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
apply.
    (2) When fishing other than in the Gulf of Mexico when the fishery 
for the General category is closed, the restrictions applicable to the 
Angling category specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this 
section apply.
    (3) When fishing other than in the Gulf of Mexico and when the 
fishery under the General category has not been closed under Sec. 
635.28, a person aboard a vessel that has been issued an HMS Charter/
Headboat permit may fish under either the retention limits applicable to 
the General category specified in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this 
section or the retention limits applicable to the Angling category 
specified in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section. The size 
category of the first BFT retained will determine the fishing category 
applicable to the vessel that day.
    (d) Harpoon category. Persons aboard a vessel permitted in the 
Atlantic Tunas Harpoon category may retain, possess, or land an 
unlimited number of giant BFT per day. An incidental catch of only four 
large medium BFT per vessel per day may be retained, possessed, or 
landed.
    (e) Purse Seine category. Persons aboard a vessel permitted in the 
Atlantic Tunas Purse Seine category,
    (1) May retain, possess, land, or sell large medium BFT in amounts 
not exceeding 15 percent, by weight, of the total amount of giant BFT 
landed during that fishing year.
    (2) May retain, possess or land BFT smaller than the large medium 
size class that are taken incidentally when fishing for skipjack tuna or 
yellowfin tuna in an amount not exceeding 1 percent, by weight, of the 
skipjack tuna and yellowfin tuna landed on that trip. Landings of BFT 
smaller than the large medium size class may not be sold and are counted 
against the Purse Seine category BFT quota allocated to that vessel.
    (f) Longline category. Persons aboard a vessel permitted in the 
Atlantic Tunas Longline category may retain, possess, land, and sell 
large medium and giant BFT taken incidentally when fishing for other 
species. For vessels fishing North or South of 31[deg]00[min] N. lat., 
limits on retention, possession, landing and sale are as follows:

[[Page 403]]

    (1) One large medium or giant BFT per vessel per trip may be landed, 
provided that at least 2,000 lb (907 kg) of species other than BFT are 
legally caught, retained, and offloaded from the same trip and are 
recorded on the dealer weighout slip as sold. Two large medium or giant 
BFT per vessel per trip may be landed, provided that at least 6,000 lb 
(2,727 kg) of species other than BFT are legally caught, retained, and 
offloaded from the same trip and are recorded on the dealer weighout 
slip as sold. Three large medium or giant BFT per vessel per trip may be 
landed, provided that at least 30,000 lb (13,620 kg) of species other 
than BFT are legally caught, retained, and offloaded from the same trip 
and are recorded on the dealer weighout slip as sold.
    (2) NMFS may increase or decrease the Longline category retention 
limit of large medium and giant BFT over a range from zero to a maximum 
of three per trip, or, for a given BFT retention limit, increase or 
decrease the target catch requirement by 25 percent from the level 
specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Such increase or decrease 
in the BFT retention limit or target catch requirement will be based on 
a review of dealer reports, observer reports, vessel logbooks, landing 
trends, availability of the species on the fishing grounds, and any 
other relevant factors, and will consider the likelihood of increasing 
dead discards of BFT and/or exceeding the incidental landings quota 
established for the pelagic longline fishery. Such adjustments may be 
made separately for vessels fishing North or South of 31[deg]00[min] N. 
lat. NMFS will adjust the retention limits and target catch requirements 
specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section by filing the adjustment 
with the Office of the Federal Register for publication. In no case 
shall such adjustment be effective less than 21 calendar days after the 
adjustment is filed with the Office of the Federal Register for 
publication.
    (g) Trap category. Persons aboard a vessel permitted in the Atlantic 
Tunas Trap category may retain, possess, land, and sell each fishing 
year only one large medium or giant BFT that is taken incidentally while 
fishing for other species with a pound net or fish weir. No other 
Atlantic tunas caught in a pound net or fish weir may be retained.

or operates a vessel that has been issued a directed LAP for sharks and 
does not have a valid shark research permit, or a person who owns or 
operates a vessel that has been issued a directed LAP for sharks and 
that has been issued a valid shark research permit but does not have a 
NMFS-approved observer on board, may retain, possess, or land no more 
than 33 non-sandbar LCS per vessel per trip if the fishery is open per 
Sec. Sec. 635.27 and 635.28. Such persons may not retain, possess, or 
land sandbar sharks. As of January 1, 2013, a person who owns or 
operates a vessel that has been issued a directed LAP for sharks and 
does not have a valid shark research permit, or a person who owns or 
operates a vessel that has been issued a directed LAP for sharks and 
that has been issued a shark research permit but does not have a NMFS-

per Sec. Sec. 635.27 and 635.28.
    (iii) A person who owns or operates a vessel that has been issued an 
incidental shark LAP may retain, possess, or land no more than 16 SCS 
and pelagic sharks, combined, per trip, if the respective fishery is 
open per Sec. Sec. 635.27 and 635.28.
    (5) A person who owns or operates a vessel that has been issued a 
Federal Atlantic commercial shark permit may not retain, possess, land, 
sell, or purchase prohibited sharks, including any parts or pieces of 
prohibited sharks, which are listed in section D of Table 1 of Appendix 
A to this part under prohibited sharks.
    (6) A person who owns or operates a vessel that has been issued a 
Federal Atlantic commercial shark permit, and who decides to retain 
sharks, must retain, subject to the trip limits, all dead, legal-sized, 
non-prohibited sharks that are brought onboard the vessel and cannot 
replace those sharks with sharks of higher quality or size that are 
caught later in the trip. Any fish that are to be released cannot be 
brought onboard the vessel and must be released in the water in a manner 
that maximizes survival.
    (7) Only persons who own or operate a vessel that has been issued a 
Federal commercial smoothhound permit may retain, possess, and land 
smoothhound sharks if the smoothhound fishery is open per Sec. Sec. 
635.27 and 635.28.
    (8) Inseason trip limit adjustment criteria. NMFS will file with the 
Office of the Federal Register for publication notification of any 
inseason adjustments to trip limits. Before making any adjustment, NMFS 
will consider the following criteria and other relevant factors:
    (i) The amount of remaining shark quota in the relevant area or 
region, to date, based on dealer reports;
    (ii) The catch rates of the relevant shark species/complexes, to 
date, based on dealer reports;
    (iii) Estimated date of fishery closure based on when the landings 
are projected to reach 80 percent of the quota given the realized catch 
rates;
    (iv) Effects of the adjustment on accomplishing the objectives of 
the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP and its amendments;
    (v) Variations in seasonal distribution, abundance, or migratory 
patterns of the relevant shark species based on scientific and fishery-
based knowledge; and/or
    (vi) Effects of catch rates in one part of a region precluding 
vessels in another part of that region from having a reasonable 
opportunity to harvest a portion of the relevant quota.
    (9) Notwithstanding other provisions in this subsection, possession, 
retention, transshipment, landing, sale, or storage of oceanic whitetip 
sharks and scalloped, smooth, and great hammerhead sharks is prohibited 
on vessels issued a permit under this part that have PLL gear on board.
    (b) Swordfish. (1) Persons aboard a vessel that has been issued an 
incidental LAP for swordfish may retain, possess, land, or sell no more 
than 30 swordfish per trip in or from the Atlantic Ocean north of 5[deg] 
N. lat.

issued an Incidental HMS squid trawl

[[Page 405]]

permit may retain, possess, land, or sell no more than 15 swordfish per 
trip in or from the Atlantic Ocean north of 5[deg] N. lat. A vessel is 
considered to be in the squid trawl fishery when it has no commercial 
fishing gear other than trawls on board and when squid constitute not 
less than 75 percent by weight of the total fish on board or offloaded 
from the vessel.

Sec. 635.25  Fishing areas.

    (a) General. Persons on board fishing vessels subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States are authorized to fish for, catch, 
retain, or land species governed by an international catch sharing 
agreement implemented under this part only in or from those management 
areas for which the United States has received an allocation.
    (b) Exemptions. Persons and vessels subject to the jurisdiction of 
the United States intending to fish for regulated species in fishing 
areas not otherwise authorized under this part, whether for the purposes 
of scientific research or commercial fishing under a chartering 
arrangement, must have a permit from NMFS issued under Sec. 635.32.
    (c) Atlantic bluefin tuna. No person aboard a U.S. fishing vessel 
shall fish for bluefin tuna in, or possess on board that fishing vessel 
a bluefin tuna taken from, the Mediterranean Sea.

Sec. 635.26  Catch and release.

    (a) BFT. (1) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this part, a 
person aboard a vessel issued a permit under this part, other than a 
person aboard a vessel permitted in the General category on a designated 
RFD, may fish with rod and reel or handline gear for BFT under a catch-
and-release or tag-and-release program. When fishing under a tag-and-
release program, vessel owner/operators should use tags issued or 
approved by NMFS. If a BFT is tagged, the tag information, including 
information on any previously applied tag remaining on the fish, must be 
reported to NMFS. All BFT caught under the catch-and-release or tag-and-
release programs must be returned to the sea immediately with a minimum 
of injury.
    (2) Persons may obtain NMFS-issued conventional tags, reporting 
cards, and detailed instructions for their use from the NMFS Cooperative 
Tagging Center. Persons may use a conventional tag obtained from a 
source other than NMFS to tag BFT, provided the use of such tags is 
registered each year with the Cooperative Tagging Center and the NMFS 
program manager has approved the use of a conventional tag from that 
source. An angler using an alternative source of tags wishing to tag BFT 
may contact the NMFS Cooperative Tagging Center at the Southeast Fishery 
Science Center.

[[Page 406]]

    (3) An angler registering for the HMS tagging program is required to 
provide his or her name, address, phone number and, if applicable, the 
identity of the alternate source of tags.
    (b) Billfish. NMFS is encouraging further catch and release of 
Atlantic billfish by establishing a recreational catch-and-release 
fishery management program, consistent with the guidance of Sec. 
600.350(c).
    (c) Sharks. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this part, a 
person may fish for white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) with rod and 
reel, provided the person releases such fish to the sea immediately with 
a minimum of injury, and that such fish may not be removed from the 
water.

<R05>
Sec. 635.27  Quotas.

    (a) BFT. Consistent with ICCAT recommendations, and with paragraph 
(a)(10)(iv) of this section, NMFS may subtract the most recent, 
complete, and available estimate of dead discards from the annual U.S. 
BFT quota, and make the remainder available to be retained, possessed, 
or landed by persons and vessels subject to U.S. jurisdiction. The 
remaining baseline annual U.S. BFT quota will be allocated among the 
General, Angling, Harpoon, Purse Seine, Longline, Trap, and Reserve 
categories. BFT may be taken by persons aboard vessels issued Atlantic 
Tunas permits, HMS Angling permits, or HMS Charter/Headboat permits. The 
baseline annual U.S. BFT quota is 923.7 mt, not including an additional 
annual 25 mt allocation provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. 
The baseline annual U.S. BFT quota is divided among the categories as 
follows: General--47.1 percent (435.1 mt); Angling--19.7 percent (182.0 
mt), which includes the school BFT held in reserve as described under 
paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section; Harpoon--3.9 percent (36.0 mt); 
Purse Seine--18.6 percent (171.8 mt); Longline--8.1 percent (74.8 mt), 
which does not include the additional annual 25 mt allocation provided 
in paragraph (a)(3) of this section; and Trap--0.1 percent (0.9 mt). The 
remaining 2.5 percent (23.1 mt) of the baseline annual U.S. BFT quota 
will be held in reserve for inseason or annual adjustments based on the 
criteria in paragraph (a)(8) of this section. NMFS may apportion a quota 
allocated to any category to specified fishing periods or to geographic 
areas and will make annual adjustments to quotas, as specified in 
paragraph (a)(10) of this section. BFT quotas are specified in whole 
weight.
    (1) General category quota. In accordance with the framework 
procedures of the HMS FMP, NMFS will publish in the Federal Register, 
prior to the beginning of each fishing year or as early as feasible, the 
General category effort control schedule, including daily retention 
limits and restricted-fishing days.
    (i) Catches from vessels for which General category Atlantic Tunas 
permits have been issued and certain catches from vessels for which an 
HMS Charter/Headboat permit has been issued are counted against the 
General category quota in accordance with Sec. 635.23(c)(3). The amount 
of large medium and giant BFT that may be caught, retained, possessed, 
landed, or sold under the General category quota is 47.1 percent (435.1 
mt) of the baseline annual U.S. BFT quota, and is apportioned as 
follows:
    (A) January 1 through the effective date of a closure notice filed 
by NMFS announcing that the January subquota is reached, or projected to 
be reached under Sec. 635.28(a)(1), or until March 31, whichever comes 
first--5.3 percent (25.2 mt);
    (B) June 1 through August 31--50 percent (217.6 mt);
    (C) September 1 through September 30--26.5 percent (115.3 mt);
    (D) October 1 through November 30--13 percent (56.6 mt); and
    (E) December 1 through December 31--5.2 percent (22.6 mt).
    (ii) NMFS will adjust each period's apportionment based on 
overharvest or underharvest in the prior period.
    (iii) When the coastwide General category fishery has been closed in 
any quota period specified under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, 
NMFS will publish a closure action as specified in Sec. 635.28. The 
subsequent time-period subquota will automatically open in accordance 
with the dates specified

[[Page 407]]

under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.
    (2) Angling category quota. In accordance with the framework 
procedures of the Consolidated HMS FMP, prior to each fishing year, or 
as early as feasible, NMFS will establish the Angling category daily 
retention limits. The total amount of BFT that may be caught, retained, 
possessed, and landed by anglers aboard vessels for which an HMS Angling 
permit or an HMS Charter/Headboat permit has been issued is 19.7 percent 
(182 mt) of the baseline annual U.S. BFT quota. No more than 2.3 percent 
(4.2 mt) of the annual Angling category quota may be large medium or 
giant BFT. In addition, over each 2-consecutive-year period (starting in 
2011, inclusive), no more than 10 percent of the annual U.S. BFT quota, 
inclusive of the allocation specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, may be school BFT. The Angling category quota includes the 
amount of school BFT held in reserve under paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this 
section. The size class subquotas for BFT are further subdivided as 
follows:
    (i) After adjustment for the school BFT quota held in reserve (under 
paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section), 52.8 percent (40.8 mt) of the 
school BFT Angling category quota may be caught, retained, possessed, or 
landed south of 39[deg]18[min] N. lat. The remaining school BFT Angling 
category quota (36.5 mt) may be caught, retained, possessed or landed 
north of 39[deg]18[min] N. lat.
    (ii) An amount equal to 52.8 percent (43.8 mt) of the large school/
small medium BFT Angling category quota may be caught, retained, 
possessed, or landed south of 39[deg]18[min] N. lat. The remaining large 
school/small medium BFT Angling category quota (39.1 mt) may be caught, 
retained, possessed or landed north of 39[deg]18[min] N. lat.
    (iii) An amount equal to 66.7 percent (2.8 mt) of the large medium 
and giant BFT Angling category quota may be caught, retained, possessed, 
or landed south of 39[deg]18[min] N. lat. The remaining large medium and 
giant BFT Angling category quota (1.4 mt) may be caught, retained, 
possessed or landed north of 39[deg]18[min] N. lat.
    (3) Longline category quota. The total amount of large medium and 
giant BFT that may be caught incidentally and retained, possessed, or 
landed by vessels that possess Longline category Atlantic Tunas permits 
is 8.1 percent (74.8 mt) of the baseline annual U.S. BFT quota. No more 
than 60.0 percent (44.9 mt) of the Longline category quota may be 
allocated for landing in the area south of 31[deg]00[min] N. lat. In 
addition, 25 mt shall be allocated for incidental catch by pelagic 
longline vessels fishing in the Northeast Distant gear restricted area.
    (4) Purse Seine category quota. (i) The total amount of large medium 
and giant BFT that may be caught, retained, possessed, or landed by 
vessels that possess Purse Seine category Atlantic Tunas permits is 18.6 
percent (171.8 mt) of the baseline annual U.S. BFT quota. The directed 
purse seine fishery for BFT commences on July 15 of each year unless 
NMFS takes action to delay the season start date. Based on cumulative 
and projected landings in other commercial fishing categories, and the 
potential for gear conflicts on the fishing grounds or market impacts 
due to oversupply, NMFS may delay the BFT purse seine season start date 
from July 15 to no later than August 15 by filing an adjustment with the 
Office of the Federal Register prior to July 1. The Purse Seine category 
fishery closes on December 31 of each year.
    (ii) An owner of a vessel for which a Purse Seine category Atlantic 
Tunas permit has been issued must apply in writing to NMFS at an address 
designated by NMFS, for an allocation of BFT from the Purse Seine 
category quota. The application must be postmarked no later than April 
15 for an allocation of the quota that becomes available on June 1.
    (iii) On or about May 1 of each year, NMFS will make equal 
allocations of the available size classes of BFT among purse seine 
vessel permit holders so requesting, adjusted as necessary to account 
for underharvest or overharvest by each participating vessel or the 
vessel it replaces from the previous fishing year, consistent with 
paragraph (a)(10)(i) of this section. Such allocations are freely 
transferable, in whole or in part, among vessels that have Purse Seine 
category Atlantic Tunas permits. Any purse seine vessel permit

[[Page 408]]

holder intending to land bluefin tuna under an allocation transferred 
from another purse seine vessel permit holder must provide written 
notice of such intent to NMFS, at an address designated by NMFS, 3 days 
before landing any such bluefin tuna. Such notification must include the 
transfer date, amount (in metric tons) transferred, and the permit 
numbers of vessels involved in the transfer. Trip or seasonal catch 
limits otherwise applicable under Sec. 635.23(e) are not affected by 
transfers of bluefin tuna allocation. Purse seine vessel permit holders 
who, through landing and/or transfer, have no remaining bluefin tuna 
allocation may not use their permitted vessels in any fishery in which 
Atlantic bluefin tuna might be caught, regardless of whether bluefin 
tuna are retained.
    (iv) An owner of a vessel for which a Purse Seine category Atlantic 
Tunas permit has been issued may apply to NMFS to permanently 
consolidate Purse Seine category vessel permits issued under Sec. 
635.4. Upon written approval of consolidation by NMFS, the Purse Seine 
Category Atlantic Tunas Permit of a transferring vessel will be 
canceled, and the receiving owner may apply for allocations of BFT 
commensurate with the number of consolidated permits. An owner of a 
purse seine vessel whose permit is canceled through consolidation may 
not use his or her vessel in any purse seine fishery in which BFT might 
be caught.
    (5) Harpoon category quota. The total amount of large medium and 
giant BFT that may be caught, retained, possessed, landed, or sold by 
vessels that possess Harpoon category Atlantic Tunas permits is 3.9 
percent (36.0 mt) of the baseline annual U.S. BFT quota. The Harpoon 
category fishery commences on June 1 of each year, and closes on 
November 15 of each year.
    (6) Trap category quota. The total amount of large medium and giant 
BFT that may be caught, retained, possessed, or landed by vessels that 
possess Trap category Atlantic Tunas permits is 0.1 percent (1.0 mt) of 
the baseline annual U.S. BFT quota.
    (7) Reserve. (i) The total amount of BFT that is held in reserve for 
inseason or annual adjustments and fishery-independent research using 
quotas or subquotas is 2.5 percent (23.1 mt) of the baseline annual U.S. 
BFT quota. Consistent with paragraph (a)(8) of this section, NMFS may 
allocate any portion of this reserve for inseason or annual adjustments 
to any category quota in the fishery.
    (ii) The total amount of school BFT that is held in reserve for 
inseason or annual adjustments and fishery-independent research is 18.5 
percent (17.6 mt) of the total school BFT Angling category quota as 
described under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. This amount is in 
addition to the amounts specified in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this 
section. Consistent with paragraph (a)(8) of this section, NMFS may 
allocate any portion of the school BFT Angling category quota held in 
reserve for inseason or annual adjustments to the Angling category.
    (8) Determination criteria. NMFS will file with the Office of the 
Federal Register for publication notification of any inseason or annual 
adjustments. Before making any adjustment, NMFS will consider the 
following criteria and other relevant factors:
    (i) The usefulness of information obtained from catches in the 
particular category for biological sampling and monitoring of the status 
of the stock.
    (ii) The catches of the particular category quota to date and the 
likelihood of closure of that segment of the fishery if no adjustment is 
made.
    (iii) The projected ability of the vessels fishing under the 
particular category quota to harvest the additional amount of BFT before 
the end of the fishing year.
    (iv) The estimated amounts by which quotas for other gear categories 
of the fishery might be exceeded.
    (v) Effects of the adjustment on BFT rebuilding and overfishing.
    (vi) Effects of the adjustment on accomplishing the objectives of 
the fishery management plan.
    (vii) Variations in seasonal distribution, abundance, or migration 
patterns of BFT.
    (viii) Effects of catch rates in one area precluding vessels in 
another area from having a reasonable opportunity to harvest a portion 
of the category's quota.

[[Page 409]]

    (ix) Review of dealer reports, daily landing trends, and the 
availability of the BFT on the fishing grounds.
    (9) Inseason adjustments. Within a fishing year, NMFS may transfer 
quotas among categories or, as appropriate, subcategories, based on the 
criteria in paragraph (a)(8) of this section. NMFS may transfer inseason 
any portion of the remaining quota of a fishing category to any other 
fishing category or to the reserve as specified in paragraph (a)(7) of 
this section.
    (10) Annual adjustments. (i) If NMFS determines, based on landings 
statistics and other available information, that a BFT quota for any 
category or, as appropriate, subcategory has been exceeded or has not 
been reached, with the exception of the Purse Seine category, NMFS shall 
subtract the overharvest from, or add the underharvest to, that quota 
category for the following fishing year. These adjustments would be made 
provided that the underharvest being carried forward does not exceed 100 
percent of each category's baseline allocation specified in paragraph 
(a) of this section, and the total of the adjusted category quotas and 
the reserve are consistent with ICCAT recommendations. For the Purse 
Seine category, if NMFS determines, based on landings statistics and 
other available information, that a purse seine vessel's allocation, as 
adjusted, has been exceeded or has not been reached, NMFS shall subtract 
the overharvest from, or add the underharvest to, that vessel's 
allocation for the following fishing year. Purse seine vessel 
adjustments would take place provided that the underharvest being 
carried forward does not exceed 100 percent of the purse seine category 
baseline allocation. Any of the unharvested quota amounts being carried 
forward, as described in this paragraph, that exceed the 100 percent 
limit will be transferred to the reserve, or another domestic quota 
category provided the transfers are consistent with paragraph (a)(8) of 
this section.
    (ii) NMFS may allocate any quota remaining in the reserve at the end 
of a fishing year to any fishing category, provided such allocation is 
consistent with the criteria specified in paragraph (a)(8) of this 
section.
    (iii) Regardless of the estimated landings in any year, NMFS may 
adjust the annual school BFT quota to ensure that the average take of 
school BFT over each 2-consecutive-year period beginning in the 2009 
fishing year does not exceed 10 percent by weight of the total annual 
U.S. BFT quota, inclusive of the allocation specified in paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section, for that period.
    (iv) NMFS may subtract the best available estimate of dead discards 
from the amount of BFT that can be landed in the subsequent fishing year 
by those categories accounting for the dead discards.
    (v) NMFS will file any annual adjustment with the Office of the 
Federal Register for publication and specify the basis for any quota 
reductions or increases made pursuant to this paragraph (a)(10).
    (b) Sharks--(1) Commercial quotas. The commercial quotas for sharks 
specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(vi) of this section 
apply to all sharks harvested from the management unit, regardless of 
where harvested. Sharks taken and landed from state waters, even by 
fishermen without Federal shark permits, must be counted against the 
fishery quota. Commercial quotas are specified for each of the 
management groups of sandbar sharks, non-sandbar LCS, SCS, blue sharks, 
porbeagle sharks, and pelagic sharks other than blue or porbeagle 
sharks. Any sharks landed as unclassified will be counted against the 
appropriate species' quota based on the species composition calculated 
from data collected by observers on non-research trips and/or dealer 
data. No prohibited sharks, including parts or pieces of prohibited 
sharks, which are listed under heading D of Table 1 of Appendix A to 
this part, may be retained except as authorized under Sec. 635.32.
    (i) Annual adjustments. NMFS will publish in the Federal Register 
any annual adjustments to the base annual commercial quotas or the 2008 
through 2012 adjusted base quotas. The base annual quota and the 
adjusted base annual quota will not be available, and the fishery will 
not open, until such adjustments are published and effective in the 
Federal Register.

[[Page 410]]

    (A) Overharvests. Except as noted in this paragraph, if the 
available commercial quota for any shark species or complex, as 
described in this section, is exceeded in any fishing year, NMFS will 
deduct an amount equivalent to the overharvest(s) from the following 
fishing year or, depending on the level of overharvest(s), NMFS may 
deduct an amount equivalent to the overharvest(s) spread over a number 
of subsequent fishing years to a maximum of five years. If the annual 
quota for non-sandbar LCS is exceeded in either region (see section 
(b)(1)(iii)(B)) or in the research fishery in any fishing year, NMFS 
will deduct an amount equivalent to the overharvest(s) from the 
following fishing year or, depending on the level of overharvest(s), 
NMFS may deduct an amount equivalent to the overharvest(s) spread over a 
number of subsequent fishing years to a maximum of five years, in the 
specific region or research fishery where the overharvest occurred. If 
the blue shark quota is exceeded, NMFS will reduce the annual commercial 
quota for pelagic sharks by the amount that the blue shark quota is 
exceeded prior to the start of the next fishing year or, depending on 
the level of overharvest(s), deduct an amount equivalent to the 
overharvest(s) spread over a number of subsequent fishing years to a 
maximum of five years.
    (B) Underharvests. Except as noted in this paragraph, if an annual 
quota for any shark species or complex, as described in this section, is 
not exceeded, NMFS may adjust the annual quota depending on the status 
of the stock or quota group. If the annual quota for non-sandbar LCS is 
not exceeded in either region or in the research fishery, NMFS may 
adjust the annual quota in either region (see paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B) 
of this section) or the research fishery depending on the status of the 
stock or quota group. If the stock (e.g., sandbar shark, porbeagle 
shark, pelagic shark, or blue shark) or specific species within a quota 
group (e.g., non-sandbar LCS or non-blacknose SCS) is declared to be 
overfished, to have overfishing occurring, or to have an unknown status, 
NMFS may not adjust the following fishing year's quota for any 
underharvest, and the following fishing year's quota will be equal to 
the base annual quota (or the adjusted base quota for sandbar and non-
sandbar LCS until December 31, 2012). If the stock is not declared to be 
overfished, to have overfishing occurring, or to have an unknown status, 
NMFS may increase the following year's base annual quota (or the 
adjusted base quota for sandbar and non-sandbar LCS until December 31, 
2012) by an equivalent amount of the underharvest up to 50 percent above 
the base annual quota. For the non-sandbar LCS fishery, underharvests 
are not transferable between regions and/or the research fishery.
    (ii) Opening fishing season criteria. NMFS will file with the Office 
of the Federal Register for publication notification of the opening 
dates of the shark fishery for each species/complex. Before making any 
decisions, NMFS would consider the following criteria and other relevant 
factors in establishing the opening dates:
    (A) The available annual quotas for the current fishing season for 
the different species/complexes based on any over- and/or underharvests 
experienced during the previous commercial shark fishing seasons;
    (B) Estimated season length based on available quota(s) and average 
weekly catch rates of different species/complexes in the Atlantic and 
Gulf of Mexico regions from the previous years;
    (C) Length of the season for the different species/complexes in the 
previous years and whether fishermen were able to participate in the 
fishery in those years;
    (D) Variations in seasonal distribution, abundance, or migratory 
patterns of the different species/complexes based on scientific and 
fishery information;
    (E) Effects of catch rates in one part of a region precluding 
vessels in another part of that region from having a reasonable 
opportunity to harvest a portion of the different species/complexes 
quotas;
    (F) Effects of the adjustment on accomplishing the objectives of the 
2006 Consolidated HMS FMP and its amendments; and/or,
    (G) Effects of a delayed opening with regard to fishing 
opportunities in other fisheries.

[[Page 411]]

    (iii) Sandbar sharks. The base annual commercial quota for sandbar 
sharks is 116.6 mt dw. However, from July 24, 2008 through December 31, 
2012, to account for overharvests that occurred in 2007, the adjusted 
base quota is 87.9 mt dw. Both the base quota and the adjusted base 
quota may be further adjusted per paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. 
This quota is available only to the owners of commercial shark vessels 
that have been issued a valid shark research permit and that have a 
NMFS-approved observer onboard.
    (iv) Non-sandbar LCS. (A) The total base quota for non-sandbar LCS 
is 677.8 mt dw. This base quota is split between the two regions and the 
shark research fishery as follows: Gulf of Mexico = 439.5 mt dw; 
Atlantic = 188.3 mt dw; and Shark Research Fishery = 50 mt dw. However, 
from July 24, 2008 through December 31, 2012, to account for 
overharvests that occurred in 2007, the total adjusted base quota is 
615.8 mt dw. This adjusted base quota is split between the regions and 
the shark research fishery as follows: Gulf of Mexico = 390.5 mt dw; 
Atlantic = 187.8 mt dw; and Shark Research Fishery = 37.5 mt dw. Both 
the base quota and the adjusted base quota may be further adjusted per 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
    (B) The commercial quotas for non-sandbar LCS are split between two 
regions: the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic. For the purposes of this 
section, the boundary between the Gulf of Mexico region and the Atlantic 
region is defined as a line beginning on the east coast of Florida at 
the mainland at 25[deg]20.4[min] N. lat, proceeding due east. Any water 
and land to the south and west of that boundary is considered, for the 
purposes of quota monitoring and setting of quotas, to be within the 
Gulf of Mexico region. Any water and land to the north and east of that 
boundary, for the purposes of quota monitoring and setting of quotas, is 
considered to be within the Atlantic region.
    (C) Except for non-sandbar LCS landed by vessels issued a valid 
shark research permit with a NMFS-approved observer onboard, any non-
sandbar LCS reported by dealers located in the Florida Keys areas or in 
the Gulf of Mexico will be counted against the non-sandbar LCS Gulf of 
Mexico regional quota. Except for non-sandbar LCS landed by vessels 
issued a valid shark research permit with a NMFS-approved observer 
onboard, any non-sandbar LCS reported by dealers located in the Atlantic 
region will be counted against the non-sandbar LCS Atlantic regional 
quota. Non-sandbar LCS landed by a vessel issued a valid shark research 
permit with a NMFS-approved observer onboard will be counted against the 
non-sandbar LCS research fishery quota using scientific observer 
reports.
    (v) Small coastal sharks. The base annual commercial quota for non-
blacknose small coastal sharks is 221.6 mt dw, unless adjusted pursuant 
to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. The base annual commercial quota 
for blacknose sharks is 19.9 mt dw, unless adjusted pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
    (vi) Pelagic sharks. The base annual commercial quotas for pelagic 
sharks are 273 mt dw for blue sharks, 1.7 mt dw for porbeagle sharks, 
and 488 mt dw for pelagic sharks other than blue sharks or porbeagle 
sharks, unless adjusted pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
    (vii) [Reserved]
    (2) Public display and non-specific research quotas. All sharks 
collected under the authority of a display permit or EFP, subject to 
restrictions at Sec. 635.32, will be counted against the following:
    (i) The base annual quota for persons who collect non-sandbar LCS, 
SCS, pelagic sharks, blue sharks, porbeagle sharks, or prohibited 
species under a display permit or EFP is 57.2 mt ww (41.2 mt dw).
    (ii) The base annual quota for persons who collect sandbar sharks 
under a display permit is 1.4 mt ww (1 mt dw) and under an EFP is 1.4 mt 
ww (1 mt dw).
    (iii) No persons may collect dusky sharks under a display permit. 
Collection of dusky sharks for research under EFPs and/or SRPs may be 
considered on a case by case basis and any associated mortality would be 
deducted from the shark research and display quota.
    (iv) [Reserved]
    (c) Swordfish--(1) Categories. Consistent with ICCAT 
recommendations,

[[Page 412]]

the fishing year's total amount of swordfish that may be caught, 
retained, possessed, or landed by persons and vessels subject to U.S. 
jurisdiction is divided into quotas for the North Atlantic swordfish 
stock and the South Atlantic swordfish stock. The quota for the North 
Atlantic swordfish stock is further divided into equal semi-annual 
directed fishery quotas, an annual incidental catch quota for fishermen 
targeting other species or taking swordfish recreationally, and a 
reserve category.
    (i) North Atlantic swordfish. (A) A swordfish from the North 
Atlantic stock caught prior to the directed fishery closure by a vessel 
for which a directed fishery permit, or a handgear permit for swordfish, 
has been issued or is required to be issued is counted against the 
directed fishery quota. The total baseline annual fishery quota, before 
any adjustments, is 2,937.6 mt dw for each fishing year. Consistent with 
applicable ICCAT recommendations, a portion of the total baseline annual 
fishery quota may be used for transfers to another ICCAT contracting 
party. The annual directed category quota is calculated by adjusting for 
over- or underharvests, dead discards, any applicable transfers, the 
incidental category quota, the reserve quota and other adjustments as 
needed, and is subdivided into two equal semi-annual: one for January 1 
through June 30, and the other for July 1 through December 31.
    (B) A swordfish from the North Atlantic swordfish stock landed by a 
vessel for which an incidental catch permit for swordfish or an HMS 
Angling or Charter/Headboat permit has been issued, or caught after the 
effective date of a closure of the directed fishery from a vessel for 
which a directed fishery permit or a handgear permit for swordfish has 
been issued, is counted against the incidental catch quota. The annual 
incidental category quota is 300 mt dw for each fishing year.
    (C) All swordfish discarded dead from U.S. fishing vessels, 
regardless of whether such vessels are permitted under this part, shall 
be counted against the annual directed fishing quota.
    (D) Fifty (50) mt of the annual fishery quota of North Atlantic 
swordfish may be held in reserve for inseason adjustments to fishing 
categories, to compensate for projected or actual overharvest in any 
category, for fishery research, or for other purposes consistent with 
management objectives.
    (E) In the event of an overharvest of South Atlantic swordfish, up 
to 150.4 mt dw of swordfish landed between 5 degrees North and 5 degrees 
South latitude may be applied against the North Atlantic swordfish 
quota. Otherwise, swordfish landed from this area shall be applied 
against the South Atlantic swordfish quota. For example, if the South 
Atlantic swordfish quota were 100 mt dw, and 50 mt dw were landed 
between 5 degrees North and 5 degrees South latitude, and 75 mt dw were 
caught south of 5 degrees South latitude, then 25 mt dw of the swordfish 
caught between 5 degrees North and 5 degrees South latitude would be 
applied against the North Atlantic swordfish quota. If only 25 mt dw of 
swordfish were caught between 5 degrees North and 5 degrees South 
latitude, and 150 mt dw of swordfish were caught south of 5 degrees 
South latitude, 25 mt dw would be applied against the North Atlantic 
swordfish quota. The remaining 50 mt dw overharvest would be counted 
against the following year's South Atlantic swordfish quota.
    (ii) South Atlantic Swordfish. The annual directed fishery quota for 
the South Atlantic swordfish stock is 75.2 mt dw. After December 31, 
2007, the annual quota is subdivided into two equal semi-annual quotas 
of 37.6 mt dw: one for January 1 through June 30, and the other for July 
1 through December 31. The entire quota for the South Atlantic swordfish 
stock is reserved for vessels with pelagic longline gear onboard and 
that have been issued a directed fishery permit for swordfish. No person 
may retain swordfish caught incidental to other fishing activities or 
with other fishing gear in the Atlantic Ocean south of 5 degrees North 
latitude.
    (2) Inseason adjustments. (i) NMFS may adjust the July 1 through 
December 31 semiannual directed fishery quota or, as applicable, the 
reserve category, to reflect actual directed fishery and incidental 
fishing category catches

[[Page 413]]

during the January 1 through June 30 semiannual period.
    (ii) If NMFS determines that the annual incidental catch quota will 
not be taken before the end of the fishing year, excess quota may be 
allocated to the directed fishery quota or to the reserve, as necessary. 
If NMFS determines that the annual directed catch quota will not be 
taken before the end of the fishing year, some of the excess quota may 
be allocated to the incidental fishery quota or to the reserve, as 
necessary.
    (iii) If NMFS determines that it is necessary to close the directed 
swordfish fishery prior to the scheduled end of a semi-annual fishing 
season, any estimated overharvest or underharvest of the directed 
fishery quota for that semi-annual season will be used to adjust the 
annual incidental catch quota or the reserve as necessary to maintain 
landings and discards within the required annual limits.
    (iv) NMFS will file with the Office of the Federal Register for 
publication any inseason swordfish quota adjustment and its 
apportionment to fishing categories or to the reserve made under 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (3) Annual adjustments. (i) Except for the carryover provisions of 
paragraphs (c)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section, NMFS will file with the 
Office of the Federal Register for publication notification of any 
adjustment to the annual quota necessary to meet the objectives of the 
Consolidated Highly Migratory Species Fishery Management Plan.
    (ii) If consistent with applicable ICCAT recommendations, total 
landings above or below the specific North Atlantic or South Atlantic 
swordfish annual quota will be subtracted from, or added to, the 
following year's quota for that area. As necessary to meet management 
objectives, such carryover adjustments may be apportioned to fishing 
categories and/or to the reserve. Carryover adjustments for the North 
Atlantic shall be limited to 25 percent of the baseline quota allocation 
for that year. Carryover adjustments for the South Atlantic shall be 
limited to 100 mt ww (75.2 mt dw) for that year. Any adjustments to the 
12-month directed fishery quota will be apportioned equally between the 
two semiannual fishing seasons. NMFS will file with the Office of the 
Federal Register for publication any adjustment or apportionment made 
under this paragraph.
    (iii) The dressed weight equivalent of the amount by which dead 
discards exceed the allowance specified at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of 
this section will be subtracted from the landings quota in the following 
fishing year or from the reserve category. NMFS will file with the 
Office of the Federal Register for publication any adjustment made under 
this paragraph (c)(3)(iii).
    (d) Atlantic blue and white marlin. (1) Effective January 1, 2007, 
and consistent with ICCAT recommendations and domestic management 
objectives, NMFS will establish the annual landings limit of Atlantic 
blue and white marlin to be taken, retained, or possessed by persons and 
vessels subject to U.S. jurisdiction. For the year 2007 and thereafter, 
unless adjusted under paragraph (d)(2) of this section or by ICCAT 
recommendation, this annual landings limit is 250 Atlantic blue and 
white marlin, combined. Effective January 1, 2011, annual landings of 
roundscale spearfish are also included to the blue and white marlin 
annual landings limit. Should the U.S. recreational Atlantic marlin 
landing limit be adjusted by an ICCAT recommendation, NMFS will file a 
notice identifying the new landing limit with the Office of the Federal 
Register for publication prior to the start of the next fishing year or 
as early as possible.
    (2) Consistent with ICCAT recommendations and domestic management 
objectives, and based on landings statistics and other information as 
appropriate, if NMFS determines that aggregate landings of Atlantic blue 
marlin, white marlin, and roundscale spearfish exceeded the annual 
landings limit for a given fishing year, as established in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section, NMFS will subtract any overharvest from the 
landings limit for the following fishing year. Additionally, if NMFS 
determines that aggregate landings of Atlantic blue marlin, white 
marlin, and roundscale spearfish were below the annual landings limit 
for a given fishing year, as established in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, NMFS

[[Page 414]]

may add any underharvest, or portion thereof, to the landings limit for 
the following fishing year. Such adjustments to the annual recreational 
marlin landings limit, as specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, 
if necessary, will be filed with the Office of the Federal Register for 
publication prior to the start of the next fishing year or as early as 
possible.
    (3) When the annual marlin landings limit specified in paragraph 
(d)(1) or, if adjusted, as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section 
is reached or projected to be reached, based upon a review of landings, 
the period of time remaining in the current fishing year, current and 
historical landings trends, and any other relevant factors, NMFS will 
file for publication with the Office of the Federal Register and action 
restricting fishing for Atlantic blue marlin, white marlin, and 
roundscale spearfish to catch-and-release fishing only. In no case shall 
such adjustment be effective less than 14 calendar days after the date 
of publication. From the effective date and time of such action until 
additional landings become available, no blue marlin, white marlin, or 
roundscale spearfish from the management unit may be taken, retained, or 
possessed.

directed fishery closure by a vessel for which a directed fishery 
permit, or a handgear permit for swordfish, or an HMS Commercial 
Caribbean Small Boat permit has been issued or is required to be issued 
is counted against the directed fishery quota. The total baseline annual 
fishery quota, before any adjustments, is 2,937.6 mt dw for each fishing 
year. Consistent with applicable ICCAT recommendations, a portion of the 
total baseline annual fishery quota may be used for transfers to another 
ICCAT contracting party. The annual directed category quota is 
calculated by adjusting for over- or underharvests, dead discards, any 
applicable transfers, the incidental category quota, the reserve quota 
and other adjustments as needed, and is subdivided into two equal semi-
annual: one for January 1 through June 30, and the other for July 1 
through December 31.

<R05>
Sec. 635.28  Closures.

    (a) BFT. (1) When a BFT quota, other than the Purse Seine category 
quota specified in Sec. 635.27(a)(4), is reached, or is projected to be 
reached, NMFS will file a closure notice with the Office of the Federal 
Register for publication. On and after the effective date and time of 
such action, for the remainder of the fishing year or for a specified 
period as indicated in the notice, fishing for, retaining, possessing, 
or landing BFT under that quota is prohibited until the opening of the 
subsequent

[[Page 415]]

quota period or until such date as specified in the notice.
    (2) From the commencement date of the directed BFT purse seine 
fishery, as provided under Sec. 635.27(a)(4)(i), through December 31, 
the owner or operator of a vessel that has been allocated a portion of 
the Purse Seine category quota under Sec. 635.27(a)(4) may fish for 
BFT. Such vessel may be used to fish for yellowfin, bigeye, albacore, or 
skipjack tuna at any time, however, landings of BFT taken incidental to 
fisheries targeting other Atlantic tunas or in any fishery in which BFT 
might be caught will be deducted from the individual vessel's quota for 
the following BFT fishing season. Upon reaching its individual vessel 
allocation of BFT, the vessel may not participate in a directed purse 
seine fishery for Atlantic tunas or in any fishery in which BFT might be 
caught for the remainder of the fishing year.
    (3) If NMFS determines that variations in seasonal distribution, 
abundance, or migration patterns of BFT, or the catch rate in one area, 
precludes participants in another area from a reasonable opportunity to 
harvest any allocated domestic category quota, as stated in Sec. 
635.27(a), NMFS may close all or part of the fishery under that 
category. NMFS may reopen the fishery at a later date if NMFS determines 
that reasonable fishing opportunities are available, e.g., BFT have 
migrated into the area or weather is conducive for fishing. In 
determining the need for any such interim closure or area closure, NMFS 
will also take into consideration the criteria specified in Sec. 
635.27(a)(8).
    (b) Sharks. (1) If quota is available as specified by a publication 
in the Federal Register, the commercial fishery for the shark species or 
complexes specified in Sec. 635.27(b)(1) will remain open.
    (2) When NMFS calculates that the landings for the shark species or 
complexes, as specified in Sec. 635.27(b)(1), has reached or is 
projected to reach 80 percent of the available quota as specified in 
Sec. 635.27(b)(1), NMFS will file for publication with the Office of 
the Federal Register a notice of closure for that shark species, shark 
complex, and/or region that will be effective no fewer than 5 days from 
date of filing. From the effective date and time of the closure until 
NMFS announces, via the publication of a notice in the Federal Register, 
that additional quota is available and the season is reopened, the 
fishery for the shark species or shark complex and, for non-sandbar LCS, 
region is closed, even across fishing years.
    (3) When NMFS calculates that the landings for either blacknose 
sharks or non-blacknose SCS has reached or is projected to reach 80 
percent of the available quota as specified in Sec. 635.27(b)(1), NMFS 
will file for publication with the Office of the Federal Register a 
notice of closure for the entire SCS fishery, both the blacknose and 
non-blacknose fisheries, that will be effective no fewer than 5 days 
from date of filing. From the effective date and time of the closure 
until NMFS announces, via the publication of a notice in the Federal 
Register, that additional quota is available and the season is reopened, 
the fishery for non-blacknose SCS and blacknose sharks is closed, even 
across fishing years.
    (4) When the fishery for a shark species group and/or region is 
closed, a fishing vessel, issued a Federal Atlantic commercial shark 
permit pursuant to Sec. 635.4, may not possess or sell a shark of that 
species group and/or region, except under the conditions specified in 
Sec. 635.22(a) and (c) or if the vessel possesses a valid shark 
research permit under Sec. 635.32 and a NMFS-approved observer is 
onboard. A shark dealer, issued a permit pursuant to Sec. 635.4, may 
not purchase or receive a shark of that species group and/or region from 
a vessel issued a Federal Atlantic commercial shark permit, except that 
a permitted shark dealer or processor may possess sharks that were 
harvested, off-loaded, and sold, traded, or bartered, prior to the 
effective date of the closure and were held in storage. Under a closure 
for a shark species group, a shark dealer, issued a permit pursuant to 
Sec. 635.4 may, in accordance with State regulations, purchase or 
receive a shark of that species group if the sharks were harvested, off-
loaded, and sold, traded, or bartered from a vessel that fishes only in 
State waters and

[[Page 416]]

that has not been issued a Federal Atlantic commercial shark permit, HMS 
Angling permit, or HMS Charter/Headboat permit pursuant to Sec. 635.4. 
Additionally, under a closure for a shark species group and/or regional 
closure, a shark dealer, issued a permit pursuant to Sec. 635.4, may 
purchase or receive a shark of that species group if the sharks were 
harvested, off-loaded, and sold, traded, or bartered from a vessel 
issued a valid shark research permit (per Sec. 635.32) that had a NMFS-
approved observer on board during the trip sharks were collected.
    (c) Swordfish--(1) Directed fishery closure. When the annual or 
semiannual directed fishery quota specified in Sec. 635.27(c)(1)(i) or 
(ii) is reached, or is projected to be reached, NMFS will file with the 
Office of the Federal Register for publication notification of closure 
at least 14 days before the effective date. From the effective date and 
time of the closure until additional directed fishery quota becomes 
available, the directed fishery for the appropriate stock is closed and 
the following catch limits apply:
    (i) When the directed fishery for the North Atlantic swordfish stock 
is closed,
    (A) No more than 15 swordfish per trip may be possessed in or from 
the Atlantic Ocean north of 5[deg] N. lat. or landed in an Atlantic 
coastal state on a vessel using or having on board a pelagic longline, 
or issued an Incidental HMS squid trawl permit. However, North Atlantic 
swordfish legally taken prior to the effective date of the closure may 
be possessed in the Atlantic Ocean north of 5 N. lat. or landed in an 
Atlantic coastal state on a vessel with a pelagic longline on board, 
provided the harvesting vessel does no fishing after the closure in the 
Atlantic Ocean north of 5 N. lat., and reports positions with a vessel 
monitoring system, as specified in Sec. 635.69. Additionally, legally 
taken swordfish from the South Atlantic swordfish stock may be possessed 
or landed north of 5 N. lat. provided the harvesting vessel does no 
fishing on that trip north of 5 N. lat., and reports positions with a 
vessel monitoring system as specified in Sec. 635.69. NMFS may adjust 
the incidental catch retention limit by filing with the Office of the 
Federal Register for publication notification of the change at least 14 
days before the effective date. Changes in the incidental catch limits 
will be based upon the length of the directed fishery closure and the 
estimated rate of catch by vessels fishing under the incidental catch 
quota.
    (B) No more than 2 swordfish per trip may be possessed in or from 
the Atlantic Ocean north of 5[deg] N. lat. or landed in an Atlantic 
coastal state on a vessel that has been issued a handgear permit under 
Sec. 635.4(f)(1) provided that such swordfish were not taken with a 
harpoon.
    (ii) When the directed fishery for the South Atlantic swordfish 
stock is closed, swordfish from that stock taken incidental to fishing 
for other species may not be retained.
    (2) Incidental catch closure. When the annual incidental catch quota 
specified in Sec. 635.27(c)(1)(i) is reached, or is projected to be 
reached, NMFS will file with the Office of the Federal Register for 
publication notification of closure. From the effective date and time of 
such notification until additional incidental catch quota becomes 
available, no swordfish may be landed in an Atlantic coastal state, or 
be possessed or sold in or from the Atlantic Ocean north of 5[deg] N. 
lat. unless the directed fishery is open and the appropriate permits 
have been issued to the vessel. In the event of a directed and 
incidental North Atlantic swordfish category closure, South Atlantic 
swordfish may be possessed in the Atlantic Ocean north of 5[deg] N. lat. 
and/or landed in an Atlantic coastal state on a vessel with longline 
gear onboard, provided that the harvesting vessel does not fish on that 
trip in the Atlantic Ocean north of 5[deg] N. lat., the fish were taken 
legally from waters of the Atlantic Ocean south of 5[deg] N. lat., and 
the harvesting vessel reports positions with a vessel monitoring system 
as specified in Sec. 635.69.

    (b) * * *
    (4) When the fishery for a shark species group and/or region is 
closed, a fishing vessel, issued a Federal Atlantic commercial shark 
permit pursuant to Sec. 635.4, may not possess or sell a shark of that 
species group and/or region, except under the conditions specified in 
Sec. 635.22(a) and (c) or if the vessel possesses a valid shark 
research permit under Sec. 635.32 and a NMFS-approved observer is on 
board. During the closure period, an Atlantic shark dealer, issued a 
permit pursuant to Sec. 635.4, may not first receive a shark of that 
species group and/or region from a vessel issued a Federal Atlantic 
commercial shark permit, except that a permitted Atlantic shark dealer 
or processor may possess sharks that were harvested, offloaded, and 
sold, traded, or bartered, prior to the effective date of the closure 
and were held in storage. Under a closure for a shark species group, an 
Atlantic shark dealer, issued a permit pursuant to Sec. 635.4 may, in 
accordance with State regulations, purchase, trade for, barter for, or 
receive a shark of that species group if the sharks were harvested, 
offloaded, and sold, traded, or bartered from a vessel that fishes only 
in State waters and that has not been issued a federal Atlantic 
commercial shark permit, HMS Angling permit, or HMS Charter/Headboat 
permit pursuant to Sec. 635.4. Additionally, under a closure for a 
shark species group and/or regional closure, an Atlantic shark dealer, 
issued a permit pursuant to Sec. 635.4, may first receive a shark of 
that species group if the sharks were harvested, offloaded, and sold, 
traded, or bartered from a vessel issued a valid shark research permit 
(per Sec. 635.32) that had a NMFS-approved observer on board during the 
trip sharks were collected.

Sec. 635.29  Transfer at sea.

    (a) Persons may not transfer an Atlantic tuna, blue marlin, white 
marlin, roundscale spearfish, or swordfish at sea in the Atlantic Ocean, 
regardless of where the fish was harvested. Notwithstanding the 
definition of ``harvest'' at Sec. 600.10, for the purposes of this 
part, transfer includes, but is not limited to, moving or attempting to 
move an Atlantic tuna that is on fishing or other gear in the water from 
one vessel to another vessel. However, an owner or operator of a vessel 
for which a Purse Seine category Atlantic Tunas category permit has been 
issued under Sec. 635.4 may transfer large medium and giant BFT at sea 
from the net of the catching vessel to another vessel for which a Purse 
Seine category Atlantic Tunas permit has been issued, provided the 
amount transferred does not cause the receiving vessel to exceed its 
currently authorized vessel allocation, including incidental catch 
limits.
    (b) Persons may not transfer a shark or a sailfish at sea shoreward 
of the outer boundary of the EEZ, regardless of where the shark was 
harvested, and persons may not transfer at sea a shark or a sailfish 
taken shoreward of the outer boundary of the EEZ, regardless of where 
the transfer takes place.

76 FR 39032, July 5, 2011]


<R05>
Sec. 635.30  Possession at sea and landing.

    (a) Atlantic tunas. Persons that own or operate a fishing vessel 
that possesses an Atlantic tuna in the Atlantic Ocean or that lands an 
Atlantic tuna in an Atlantic coastal port must maintain such Atlantic 
tuna through offloading either in round form or eviscerated with the 
head and fins removed, provided one pectoral fin and the tail remain 
attached. The upper and lower lobes of the tuna tail may be removed for 
storage purposes as long as the fork of the tail remains intact.
    (b) Billfish. Any person that possesses a blue marlin, white marlin, 
or roundscale spearfish taken from its management unit or a sailfish 
taken shoreward of the outer boundary of the EEZ or lands a blue marlin, 
white marlin, or roundscale spearfish in an Atlantic coastal port must 
maintain such billfish with its head, fins, and bill intact through 
offloading. Persons may eviscerate such billfish, but it must otherwise 
be maintained whole.
    (c) Shark. (1) In addition to the regulations issued at part 600, 
subpart N, of this chapter, a person who owns or operates a vessel 
issued a Federal Atlantic commercial shark permit under Sec. 635.4 must 
maintain all the shark fins including the tail naturally attached

[[Page 418]]

to the shark carcass until the shark has been offloaded from the vessel. 
While sharks are on board and when sharks are being offloaded, persons 
issued a Federal Atlantic commercial shark permit under Sec. 635.4 are 
subject to the regulations at part 600, subpart N, of this chapter.
    (2) A person who owns or operates a vessel that has a valid Federal 
Atlantic commercial shark permit may remove the head and viscera of the 
shark while on board the vessel. At any time when on the vessel, sharks 
must not have the backbone removed and must not be halved, quartered, 
filleted, or otherwise reduced. All fins, including the tail, must 
remain naturally attached to the shark through offloading. While on the 
vessel, fins may be sliced so that the fin can be folded along the 
carcass for storage purposes as long as the fin remains naturally 
attached to the carcass via at least a small portion of uncut skin. The 
fins and tail may only be removed from the carcass once the shark has 
been landed and offloaded.
    (3) A person who owns or operates a vessel that has been issued a 
Federal Atlantic commercial shark permit and who lands sharks in an 
Atlantic coastal port, including ports in the Gulf of Mexico and 
Caribbean Sea, must have all fins and carcasses weighed and recorded on 
the weighout slips specified in Sec. 635.5(a)(2) and in accordance with 
part 600, subpart N, of this chapter. Persons may not possess any shark 
fins not naturally attached to a shark carcass on board a fishing vessel 
at any time. Once landed and offloaded, sharks that have been halved, 
quartered, filleted, cut up, or reduced in any manner may not be brought 
back on board a vessel that has been or should have been issued a 
Federal Atlantic commercial shark permit.
    (4) Persons aboard a vessel that does not have a Federal Atlantic 
commercial shark permit must maintain a shark in or from the EEZ intact 
through landing with the head, tail, and all fins naturally attached. 
The shark may be bled and the viscera may be removed.
    (d) Swordfish. Persons that own or operate a fishing vessel that 
possesses a swordfish in the Atlantic Ocean or lands a swordfish in an

Sec. 635.31  Restrictions on sale and purchase.

    (a) Atlantic tunas. (1) A persons that owns or operates a vessel 
from which an Atlantic tuna is landed or offloaded may sell such 
Atlantic tuna only if that vessel has a valid HMS Charter/Headboat 
permit, or a valid General, Harpoon, Longline, Purse Seine, or Trap 
category permit for Atlantic tunas issued under this part. However, no 
person may sell a BFT smaller than the large medium size class. Also, no 
large medium or giant BFT taken by a person aboard a vessel with an 
Atlantic HMS Charter/Headboat permit fishing in the Gulf of Mexico at 
any time, or fishing outside the Gulf of Mexico when the fishery under 
the General category has been closed, may be sold (see Sec. 635.23(c)). 
A persons may sell Atlantic tunas only to a dealer that has a valid 
permit for purchasing Atlantic tunas issued under this part. A person 
may not sell or purchase Atlantic tunas harvested with speargun fishing 
gear.
    (2) Dealers may purchase Atlantic tunas only from a vessel that has 
a valid commercial permit for Atlantic tunas issued under this part in 
the appropriate category.
    (3) Dealers or seafood processors may not purchase or sell a BFT 
smaller than the large medium size class unless it is lawfully imported 
and is accompanied by a bluefin tuna statistical document, as specified 
in Sec. 300.185(a) of this title.
    (4) A BFT in the possession of a dealer or seafood processor is 
deemed to be from the Atlantic Ocean. However, a BFT will not be deemed 
to be from the Atlantic Ocean if--
    (i) It was landed in a Pacific state and remains in the state of 
landing, or
    (ii) It is accompanied by a bluefin tuna statistical document, as 
specified in Sec. 300.185(a) of this title.

[[Page 419]]

    (b) Billfish. (1) Persons may not sell or purchase a billfish taken 
from its management unit.
    (2) A billfish or a closely related species, namely, black marlin, 
Makaira indica, striped marlin, Tetrapturus audax, or shortbill 
spearfish, Tetrapturus angustirostris, or a part thereof, in the 
possession of a dealer or seafood processor is considered, for purposes 
of this part, to be a billfish from the Atlantic Ocean management unit. 
However, a billfish or a closely related species will not be considered 
to be from the Atlantic Ocean management unit if--
    (i) It was landed in a Pacific state and remains in the state of 
landing, or
    (ii) It is accompanied by a Billfish Certificate of Eligibility 
(COE) form, obtained from NMFS, or its equivalent that documents that 
the fish was harvested from other than the Atlantic Ocean management 
unit.
    (A) The Billfish COE required under this section must indicate, in 
English, the name and homeport of the harvesting vessel, and the date 
and port of offloading. Only the purchaser of the billfish from the 
harvesting vessel must complete this information.
    (B) The Billfish COE must be signed and dated by each dealer in 
possession of the product throughout the chain of custody up to but not 
including the consumer. This signature indicates a declaration that the 
billfish were not harvested from the management unit.
    (C) A Billfish COE may refer to billfish taken from only one 
harvesting vessel. If a shipment contains billfish taken from more than 
one vessel, a separate billfish COE must accompany the shipment for each 
harvesting vessel.
    (D) A model Billfish COE can be obtained by contacting the Division 
Chief. An equivalent form may be used provided it contains all of the 
information required under this section.
    (3) For the purposes of this paragraph, a dealer or seafood 
processor means any individual, other than a consumer, who engages in 
any activity, other than fishing, of industry, trade, or commerce, 
including but not limited to the buying or selling of a regulated 
species or parts thereof and activities conducted for the purpose of 
facilitating such buying and selling.
    (c) Shark. (1) Persons that own or operate a vessel that possesses a 
shark from the management unit may sell such shark only if the vessel 
has a valid commercial shark permit issued under this part. Persons may 
possess and sell a shark only when the fishery for that species group 
and/or region has not been closed, as specified in Sec. 635.28(b).
    (2) Persons that own or operate a vessel for which a valid 
commercial shark permit has been issued and on which a shark from the 
management unit is possessed, may sell such shark only to a dealer that 
has a valid permit for shark issued under this part.
    (3) Regulations governing the harvest, possession, landing, 
purchase, and sale of shark fins are found at part 600, subpart N, of 
this chapter and in Sec. 635.30(c).
    (4) Only dealers that have a valid shark dealer permit may purchase 
shark from the owner or operator of a fishing vessel. Dealers may 
purchase a shark only from an owner or operator of a vessel who has a 
valid commercial shark permit issued under this part, except that 
dealers may purchase a shark from an owner or operator of a vessel that 
does not have a commercial permit for shark if that vessel fishes 
exclusively in state waters. Dealers may purchase a sandbar shark only 
from an owner or operator of a vessel who has a valid shark research 
permit and who had a NMFS-approved observer onboard the vessel for the 
trip in which the sandbar shark was collected. Dealers may purchase a 
shark from an owner or operator of fishing vessel that has a permit 
issued under this part only when the fishery for that species group and/
or region has not been closed, as specified in Sec. 635.28(b).
    (5) A dealer issued a permit under this part may not purchase from 
an owner or operator of a fishing vessel shark fins that were not 
harvested in accordance with the regulations found at part 600, subpart 
N, of this chapter and in Sec. 635.30(c).
    (6) A dealer issued a permit under this part may not purchase 
oceanic whitetip sharks or scalloped, smooth, or great hammerhead sharks 
from an

owner or operator of a fishing vessel with pelagic longline gear on 
board, or from the owner of a fishing vessel issued both a HMS Charter/
Headboat permit and a commercial shark permit when tuna, swordfish or 
billfish are on board the vessel, offloaded from the vessel, or being 
offloaded from the vessel.
    (d) Swordfish. (1) Persons that own or operate a vessel on which a 
swordfish in or from the Atlantic Ocean is possessed may sell such 
swordfish only if the vessel has a valid commercial permit for swordfish 
issued under this part. Persons may sell such swordfish only to a dealer 
who has a valid permit for swordfish issued under this part.
    (2) Dealers may purchase a swordfish harvested from the Atlantic 
Ocean only from an owner or operator of a fishing vessel that has a 
valid commercial permit for swordfish issued under this part.

<R05>
Sec. 635.32  Specifically authorized activities.

    (a) General. (1) Consistent with the provisions of Sec. 600.745 of 
this chapter, except as indicated in this section, NMFS may authorize 
activities otherwise prohibited by the regulations contained in this 
part for the conduct of scientific research, the acquisition of 
information and data, the enhancement of safety at sea, the purpose of 
collecting animals for public education or display, the investigation of 
bycatch, economic discard and regulatory discard, or for chartering 
arrangements.
    (2) Activities subject to the provisions of this section include, 
but are not limited to: scientific research resulting in, or likely to 
result in, the take, harvest, or incidental mortality of Atlantic HMS; 
exempted fishing and educational activities; programs under which 
regulated species retained in contravention to otherwise applicable 
regulations may be donated through approved food bank networks; or 
chartering arrangements. Such activities must be authorized in writing 
and are subject to all conditions specified in any letter of 
acknowledgment, EFP, scientific research permit, display permit, 
chartering permit, or shark research permit issued in response to 
requests for authorization under this section.
    (3) For the purposes of all regulated species covered under this 
part, NMFS has the sole authority to issue permits, authorizations, and 
acknowledgments. If a regulated species landed or retained under the 
authority of this section is subject to a quota, the fish shall be 
counted against the quota category as specified in the written 
authorization.
    (4) Inspection requirements specified in Sec. 635.5(e) apply to the 
owner or operator of a fishing vessel that has been issued an exempted 
fishing permit, scientific research permit, display permit, or 
chartering permit.
    (b) Scientific research activities. For the purposes of all species 
covered

[[Page 422]]

under this part regulated under the authority of ATCA, the provisions 
for research plans under Sec. 600.745(a) and reports under Sec. 
600.745(c)(1) of this chapter are mandatory. In such cases of authorized 
scientific research activities, NMFS shall issue scientific research 
permits. For scientific research activities involving the capture of 
Atlantic sharks, research plans and reports are requested; letters of 
acknowledgment shall be issued by NMFS as indicated under Sec. 
600.745(a) of this chapter.
    (c) Exempted fishing permits. (1) For activities consistent with the 
purposes of this section and Sec. 600.745(b)(1) of this chapter, other 
than scientific research conducted from a scientific research vessel, 
NMFS may issue exempted fishing permits.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (d) Display permits. (1) For activities consistent with the purposes 
of this section and Sec. 600.745(b)(1) of this chapter, NMFS may issue 
display permits.
    (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 600.745 of this chapter 
and other provisions of this part, a valid display permit is required to 
fish for, take, retain, or possess an HMS in or from the Atlantic EEZ 
for the purposes of public display. A valid display permit must be on 
board the harvesting vessel, must be available when the fish is landed, 
must be available when the fish is transported to the display facility, 
and must be presented for inspection upon request of an authorized 
officer. A display permit is valid for the specific time, area, gear, 
and species specified on it. Species landed under a display permit shall 
be counted against the appropriate quota specified in Sec. 635.27 or as 
otherwise provided in the display permit.
    (3) To be eligible for a display permit, a person must provide all 
information concerning his or her identification, numbers by species of 
HMS to be collected, when and where they will be collected, vessel(s) 
and gear to be used, description of the facility where they will be 
displayed, and any other information that may be necessary for the 
issuance or administration of the permit, as requested by NMFS.
    (4) Collectors of HMS for public display must notify the local NMFS 
Office for Law Enforcement at least 24 hours, excluding weekends and 
holidays, prior to departing on a collection trip, regardless of whether 
the fishing activity will occur in or outside the EEZ, as to collection 
plans and location and the number of animals to be collected. In the 
event that a NMFS agent is not available, a message may be left.
    (5) All live HMS collected for public display are required to have 
either a conventional dart tag or a microchip Passive Integrated 
Transponder (PIT) tag applied by the collector at the time of the 
collection. Both types of tags will be supplied by NMFS. Conventional 
dart tags will be issued unless PIT tags are specifically requested in 
the permit application and their use approved by NMFS. Terms and 
conditions of the permit will address requirements associated with the 
use of the tags supplied on a case-by-case basis.
    (e) Chartering permits. (1) For activities consistent with the 
purposes of this section, Sec. 635.5(a), and Sec. 600.745(b)(1) of 
this chapter, NMFS may issue chartering permits for record keeping and 
reporting purposes. An application for a chartering permit must include 
all information required under Sec. 600.745(b)(2) of this chapter and, 
in addition, written notification of: the species of fish covered by the 
chartering arrangement and quota allocated to the Contracting Party of 
which the chartering foreign entity is a member; duration of the 
arrangement; measures adopted by the chartering Contracting Party of 
which the foreign entity is a member to implement ICCAT chartering 
provisions; copies of fishing licenses, permits, and/or other 
authorizations issued by the chartering Contracting Party of which the 
foreign entity is a member for the vessel to fish under the arrangement; 
a copy of the High Seas Fishing Compliance Act Permit pursuant to 50 CFR 
300.10; documentation regarding interactions with protected resources; 
and documentation regarding the legal establishment of the chartering 
company. To be considered complete, an application for a chartering 
permit for a vessel must include all information specified in Sec. 
600.745(b)(2) of this chapter and in Sec. 635.32(e) and (f).

[[Page 423]]

    (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 600.745 of this chapter 
and other provisions of this part, a valid chartering permit is required 
to fish for, take, retain, or possess ICCAT- regulated species under 
chartering arrangements as specified in Sec. 635.5(a)(6). A valid 
chartering permit must be on board the harvesting vessel, must be 
available when ICCAT-regulated species are landed, and must be presented 
for inspection upon request of an authorized officer. A chartering 
permit is valid for the duration of the chartering arrangement or until 
the expiration date specified on the permit, whichever comes first. 
Vessels issued a chartering permit shall not be authorized to fish under 
applicable Atlantic Highly Migratory Species quotas or entitlements of 
the United States until the chartering permit expires or is terminated.
    (3) Charter permit holders must submit logbooks and comply with 
reporting requirements as specified in Sec. 635.5. NMFS will provide 
specific conditions and requirements in the chartering permit, so as to 
ensure consistency, to the extent possible, with laws of foreign 
countries, the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP and its amendments, as well as 
ICCAT recommendations.
    (4) Observers may be placed on board vessels issued chartering 
permits as specified under Sec. 635.7.
    (5) NMFS will issue a chartering permit only if it determines that 
the chartering arrangement is in conformance with ICCAT's conservation 
and management programs.
    (6) A vessel shall be authorized to fish under only one chartering 
arrangement at a time.
    (7) All chartering permits are subject to sanctions and denials as 
indicated under Sec. 635.4(a)(6).
    (f) Shark research permits. (1) For activities consistent with the 
purposes of this section and Sec. 600.745(b)(1) of this chapter, NMFS 
may issue shark research permits.
    (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 600.745 of this chapter 
and other provisions of this part, a valid shark research permit is 
required to fish for, take, retain, or possess Atlantic sharks, 
including sandbar sharks, in excess of the retention limits described in 
Sec. 635.24(a). A valid shark research permit must be on board the 
harvesting vessel, must be available for inspection when the shark is 
landed, and must be presented for inspection upon request of an 
authorized officer. A shark research permit is only valid for the vessel 
and owner(s) combination specified and cannot be transferred to another 
vessel or owner(s). A shark research permit is only valid for the 
retention limits, time, area, gear specified, and other terms and 
conditions as listed on the permit and only when a NMFS-approved 
observer is onboard. Species landed under a shark research permit shall 
be counted against the appropriate quota specified in Sec. 635.27 or as 
otherwise provided in the shark research permit.
    (3) Regardless of the number of applicants, NMFS will issue only a 
limited number of shark research permits depending on available quotas 
as described in Sec. 635.27, research needs for stock assessments and 
other scientific purposes, and the number of sharks expected to be 
harvested by vessels issued LAPs for sharks.
    (4) In addition to the workshops required under Sec. 635.8, persons 
issued a shark research permit, and/or operators of vessels specified on 
the shark research permit, may be required to attend other workshops 
(e.g., shark identification workshops, captain's meeting, etc.) as 
deemed necessary by NMFS to ensure the collection of high quality data.
    (5) Issuance of a shark research permit does not guarantee the 
permit holder that a NMFS-approved observer will be deployed on any 
particular trip. Rather, permit issuance indicates that a vessel is 
eligible for a NMFS-approved observer to be deployed on the vessel for a 
particular trip and that, on such observed trips, the vessel may be 
allowed to harvest Atlantic sharks, including sandbar sharks, in excess 
of the retention limits described in Sec. 635.24(a).
    (6) The shark research permit may be revoked, limited, or modified 
at any time, does not confer any right to engage in activities beyond 
those authorized by the permit, and does not confer any right of 
compensation to the holder.

[[Page 424]]

    (g) Applications and renewals. (1) Application procedures shall be 
as indicated under Sec. 600.745(b)(2) of this chapter, except that NMFS 
may consolidate requests for the purpose of obtaining public comment. In 
such cases, NMFS may file with the Office of the Federal Register, on an 
annual or more frequent basis as necessary, notification of previously 
authorized exempted fishing, scientific research, public display, 
chartering, and shark research activities and to solicit public comment 
on anticipated EFP, scientific research permit, letter of 
acknowledgment, public display, chartering, or shark research permit 
activities. Applications for EFPs, scientific research permits, public 
display permits, chartering permits, or shark research permits are 
required to include all reports specified in the applicant's previous 
permit including, if applicable, the year-end report, all delinquent 
reports for permits issued in prior years, and all other specified 
information. In situations of delinquent reports, applications will be 
deemed incomplete and a permit will not be issued under this section.
    (2) For the shark research permit, NMFS will publish annually, in a 
Federal Register notice(s), a description for the following fishing year 
of the expected research objectives. This description may include 
information such as the number of vessels needed, regions and seasons 
for which vessels are needed, the specific criteria for selection, and 
the application deadline. Complete applications, including all 
information requested in the applicable Federal Register notice(s) and 
on the application form and any previous reports required pursuant to 
this section and Sec. 635.5, must be received by NMFS by the 
application deadline in order for the vessel to be considered. Requested 
information could include, but is not limited to, applicant name and 
address, permit information, vessel information, availability of the 
vessel, past involvement in the shark fishery, and compliance with HMS 
regulations including observer regulations. NMFS will only review 
complete applications received by the published deadline to determine 
eligibility for participation in the shark research fishery. Qualified 
vessels will be chosen based on the information provided on the 
applications and their ability to meet the selection criteria as 
published in the Federal Register notice. A commercial shark permit 
holder whose vessel was selected to carry an observer in the previous 
two years for any HMS fishery but failed to comply with the observer 
regulations specified in Sec. 635.7 will not be considered. A 
commercial shark permit holder that has been charged criminally or 
civilly (i.e., issued a Notice of Violation and Assessment (NOVA) or 
Notice of Permit Sanction) for any HMS related violation will not be 
considered for participation in the shark research fishery. Qualified 
vessels will be randomly selected to participate in the shark research 
fishery based on their availability and the temporal and spatial needs 
of the research objectives. If a vessel issued a shark research permit 
cannot conduct the shark research tasks, for whatever reason, that 
permit will be revoked and, depending on the status of the research and 
the fishing year, NMFS will randomly select another qualified vessel to 
be issued a shark research permit.
    (h) Terms and conditions. (1) For EFPs, scientific research permits, 
and public display permits: Written reports on fishing activities, and 
disposition of all fish captured under a permit issued under this 
section must be submitted to NMFS within 5 days of return to port. NMFS 
will provide specific conditions and requirements as needed, consistent 
with the Consolidated HMS Fishery Management Plan, in the permit. If an 
individual issued a Federal permit under this section captures no HMS in 
any given month, either in or outside the EEZ, a ``no-catch'' report 
must be submitted to NMFS within 5 days of the last day of that month.
    (2) For chartering permits, written reports of fishing activities 
must be submitted to NMFS by a date specified, and to an address 
designated, in the terms and conditions of each chartering permit.
    (3) An annual written summary report of all fishing activities, and 
disposition of all fish captured, under the permit must be submitted to 
NMFS for all EFPs, scientific research permits,

[[Page 425]]

display permits, and chartering permits issued under this section within 
30 days after the expiration date of the permit.
    (4) For shark research permits, all owners and/or operators must 
comply with the recordkeeping and reporting requirements specified in 
Sec. 635.5 per the requirement of holding a LAP for sharks.
    (5) As stated in Sec. 635.4(a)(6), failure to comply with the 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this section could result in 
the EFP, scientific research permit, display permit, chartering permit, 
or shark research permit being revoked, suspended, or modified, and in 
the denial of any future applications.

Sec. 635.33  Archival tags.

    (a) Implantation report. Any person affixing or implanting an 
archival tag into a regulated species must obtain written authorization 
from NMFS pursuant to Sec. 635.32. Persons so authorized to conduct 
archival tag implantation must provide a written report to NMFS at an 
address designated by NMFS, indicating the type and number of tags, the 
species and approximate size of the fish as well as any additional 
information requested in the authorization.
    (b) Landing. Notwithstanding other provisions of this part, persons 
may catch, possess, retain, and land an Atlantic HMS in which an 
archival tag has been implanted or affixed, provided such persons comply 
with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Landing report. Persons that retain an Atlantic HMS that has an 
archival tag must contact NMFS, prior to or at the time of landing; 
furnish all requested information regarding the location and method of 
capture; and, as instructed, remove the archival tag and return it to 
NMFS or make the fish available for inspection and recovery of the tag 
by a NMFS scientist, enforcement agent, or other person designated in 
writing by NMFS.
    (d) Quota monitoring. If an Atlantic HMS landed under the authority 
of paragraph (b) of this section is subject to a quota, the fish will be 
counted against the applicable quota for the species consistent with the 
fishing gear and activity which resulted in the catch. In the event such 
fishing gear or activity is otherwise prohibited under applicable 
provisions of this part, the fish shall be counted against the reserve 
quota established for that species.


<R05>
Sec. 635.34  Adjustment of management measures.

    (a) NMFS may adjust the catch limits for BFT, as specified in Sec. 
635.23; the quotas for BFT, shark and swordfish, as specified in Sec. 
635.27; the marlin landing limit, as specified in Sec. 635.27(d); and 
the minimum sizes for Atlantic blue marlin, white marlin, and roundscale 
spearfish as specified in Sec. 635.20.
    (b) In accordance with the framework procedures in the Highly 
Migratory Species Fishery Management Plan, NMFS may establish or modify 
for species or species groups of Atlantic HMS the following management 
measures: maximum sustainable yield or optimum yield based on the latest 
stock assessment or updates in the SAFE report; domestic quotas; 
recreational and commercial retention limits, including target catch 
requirements; size limits; fishing years or fishing seasons; shark 
fishing regions or regional quotas; species in the management unit and 
the specification of the species groups to which they belong; species in 
the prohibited shark species group; classification system within shark 
species groups; permitting and reporting requirements; workshop 
requirements; Atlantic tunas Purse Seine category cap on bluefin tuna 
quota; time/area restrictions; allocations among user groups; gear 
prohibitions, modifications, or use restriction; effort restrictions; 
essential fish habitat; and actions to implement ICCAT recommendations, 
as appropriate.
    (c) NMFS may add species to the prohibited shark species group 
specified in Table 1 of appendix A if, after considering the criteria in 
paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section, the species is determined 
to meet at least two of the criteria. Alternatively, NMFS may remove 
species from the prohibited shark species group and place them in

[[Page 426]]

the appropriate shark species group in Table 1 of appendix A if, after 
considering the criteria in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this 
section, NMFS determines the species only meets one criterion.
    (1) Biological information indicates that the stock warrants 
protection.
    (2) Information indicates that the species is rarely encountered or 
observed caught in HMS fisheries.
    (3) Information indicates that the species is not commonly 
encountered or observed caught as bycatch in fishing operations for 
species other than HMS.
    (4) The species is difficult to distinguish from other prohibited 
species.
    (d) When considering a framework adjustment to add, change, or 
modify time/area closures, NMFS will consider, consistent with the FMP, 
the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and other applicable law, but is not limited 
to, the following criteria: any Endangered Species Act related issues, 
concerns, or requirements, including applicable BiOps; bycatch rates of 
protected species, prohibited HMS, or non-target species both within the 
specified or potential closure area(s) and throughout the fishery; 
bycatch rates and post-release mortality rates of bycatch species 
associated with different gear types; new or updated landings, bycatch, 
and fishing effort data; evidence or research indicating that changes to 
fishing gear and/or fishing practices can significantly reduce bycatch; 
social and economic impacts; and the practicability of implementing new 
or modified closures compared to other bycatch reduction options. If the 
species is an ICCAT managed species, NMFS will also consider the overall 
effect of the U.S.'s catch on that species before implementing time/area 
closures.

                    Subpart D_Restrictions on Imports


<R05>
Sec. 635.40  Restrictions to enhance conservation.

    (a) Determinations. Upon a determination by NMFS that species of 
fish subject to regulation or under investigation by ICCAT are 
ineligible for entry into the United States under 16 U.S.C. 971d (c)(4) 
or (c)(5), NMFS, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, will 
file with the Office of the Federal Register for publication a finding 
to that effect. Effective upon the date of filing of such finding, all 
shipments of fish in any form of the species found to be ineligible will 
be denied entry unless, with respect to a particular shipment, it is 
established by satisfactory proof pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section that the particular shipment of fish is eligible for entry. 
Entry will not be denied and no such proof will be required for any such 
shipment that, on the date of filing was in transit to the United States 
on board a vessel operating as a common carrier.
    (b) Proof of admissibility. (1) For the purposes of paragraph (a) of 
this section and section 6(c) of ATCA, a shipment of fish in any form of 
the species under regulation or under investigation by ICCAT offered for 
entry, directly or indirectly, from a country named in a finding filed 
with the Office of the Federal Register for publication under paragraph 
(a) of this section is eligible for entry if the shipment is accompanied 
by a completed ATCA COE attached to the invoice certifying that the fish 
in the shipment:
    (i) Are not of the species specified in the finding;
    (ii) Are of the species named in the finding, but were not taken in 
the regulatory area; or
    (iii) Are of the species named in the finding, but are products of 
an American fishery and were lawfully taken in conformity with 
applicable conservation laws and regulations and landed in the country 
named in the finding solely for transshipment.
    (2) If the fish are offered for entry under paragraph (b)(1)(i) or 
(b)(1)(ii) of this section, the ATCA COE must be executed by a duly 
authorized official of the country named in the finding and the ATCA COE 
must be validated by a consular officer or consular agent of the United 
States. Such validation must be attached to the ATCA COE.
    (3) If the fish are offered for entry under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of 
this section, the ATCA COE must be executed by a consular officer or 
consular agent

[[Page 427]]

of the United States and be accompanied by the declaration(s) required 
by 19 CFR 10.79. The ``Declaration of Master and Two Members of Crew on 
Entry of Products of American Fisheries'' required by 19 CFR 10.79 must 
contain a further statement as follows: ``We further declare that the 
said fish were caught by us in full compliance with part 635, title 50, 
Code of Federal Regulations, and such other conservation laws and 
regulations as were applicable at the time the fishing operation was in 
progress.''
    (c) Removal of import restrictions. Upon a determination by NMFS 
that the conditions no longer exist that warranted the finding under 
paragraph (a) of this section, NMFS will remove the import restriction 
by filing with the Office of the Federal Register for publication 
notification of removal effective on the date of filing. However, for 1 
year from the date of filing every shipment of fish in any form that was 
subject to the finding under paragraph (a) of this section will continue 
to be denied entry, unless the shipment is accompanied by a 
certification executed by an authorized official of the country of 
export and authenticated by a consular officer or consular agent of the 
United States certifying that no portion of the shipment is composed of 
fish taken prior to or during the import restriction.


<R05>
Sec. 635.41  Products denied entry.

    (a) [Reserved]
    (b) All shipments of tuna or tuna-like species, or their products, 
in any form, harvested in the ICCAT convention area by a fishing vessel 
that is required to be listed, but not listed on the ICCAT record of 
authorized vessels will be denied entry into the United States.
    (c) All shipments of tuna or tuna-like species, or their products, 
in any form, harvested in the ICCAT convention area by a fishing vessel 
listed on the ICCAT record as engaged in illegal, unreported, and 
unregulated fishing will be denied entry into the United States.
    (d) All shipments of tuna or tuna-like species, placed in cages for 
farming and/or transshipment, harvested in the ICCAT convention area and 
caught by a fishing vessel included on the ICCAT list as engaged in 
illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing will be denied entry into 
the United States.
    (e) For the purposes of this section, it is a rebuttable presumption 
that any shipment containing swordfish, bluefin tuna, bigeye tuna, or 
their products offered for entry into the United States has been 
harvested by a vessel or vessels of the exporting nation.

                 Subpart E_International Port Inspection


<R05>
Sec. 635.50  Basis and purpose.

    The regulations in this subpart implement the ICCAT port inspection 
scheme. The text of the ICCAT port inspection scheme may be obtained 
from NMFS.


<R05>
Sec. 635.51  Authorized officer.

    For the purposes of this subpart, an authorized officer is a person 
appointed by an ICCAT contracting party to serve as an authorized 
inspector for ICCAT, and who possesses identification issued by the 
authorized officer's national government.


<R05>
Sec. 635.52  Vessels subject to inspection.

    (a) All U.S. fishing vessels or vessels carrying fish species 
subject to regulation pursuant to a recommendation of ICCAT, and their 
catch, gear, and relevant documents, including fishing logbooks and 
cargo manifests, are subject to inspection under this subpart to verify 
compliance with ICCAT measures by an authorized officer when landing or 
transshipping tuna or when making a port call at a port of any ICCAT 
contracting party.
    (b) A vessel, or a vessel carrying fish species subject to 
regulation pursuant to a recommendation of ICCAT, that is registered by 
any of the ICCAT contracting parties, and the vessel's catch, gear, and 
relevant documents, including fishing logbooks and cargo manifests, are 
subject to inspection under this subpart to verify compliance with ICCAT 
measures when landing or transshipping regulated species or when making 
a port call in the United States.

[[Page 428]]

    (c) The master of a vessel, or a vessel carrying fish species 
subject to regulation pursuant to a recommendation of ICCAT, must 
cooperate with an authorized officer during the conduct of an inspection 
in national and foreign ports. Inspections will be carried out so that 
the vessel suffers minimum interference and inconvenience, and so that 
degradation of the quality of catch is avoided.


<R05>
Sec. 635.53  Reports.

    (a) Apparent violations shall be reported by the authorized officer 
on a standardized ICCAT form or form produced by the national government 
which collects the same quality of information. The authorized officer 
must sign the form in the presence of the master of the vessel, who is 
entitled to add or have added to the report any observations, and to add 
his own signature. The authorized officer should note in the vessel's 
log that the inspection has been made.
    (b) Copies of the report form must be sent to the flag state of the 
vessel and to the ICCAT Secretariat within 10 days. Flag states will 
consider and act on reports of apparent violations by foreign inspectors 
on a similar basis as the reports of their national inspectors in 
accordance with their national legislation. The vessel's flag state will 
notify ICCAT of actions taken to address the violation.


<R04>
                          Subpart F_Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 635.69  Vessel monitoring systems.

    (a) Applicability. To facilitate enforcement of time/area and 
fishery closures, an owner or operator of a commercial vessel permitted, 
or required to be permitted, to fish for Atlantic HMS under Sec. 635.4 
and that fishes with pelagic or bottom longline or gillnet gear, is 
required to install a NMFS-approved enhanced mobile transmitting unit 
(E-MTU) vessel monitoring system (VMS) on board the vessel and operate 
the VMS unit under the circumstances listed in paragraphs (a)(1) thorugh 
(a)(4) of this section. For purposes of this section, a NMFS-approved E-
MTU VMS is one that has been approved by NMFS as satisfying its type 
approval listing for E-MTU VMS units. Those requirements are published 
in the Federal Register and may be updated periodically.
    (1) Whenever the vessel is away from port with pelagic longline gear 
on board;
    (2) Whenever a vessel issued a directed shark LAP, is away from port 
with bottom longline gear on board, is located between 33[deg]00[min] N. 
lat. and 36[deg]30[min] N. lat., and the mid-Atlantic shark closed area 
is closed as specified in Sec. 635.21(d)(1); or
    (3) Whenever a vessel, issued a directed shark LAP, is away from 
port with a gillnet on board from November 15-April 15.
    (4) A vessel is considered to have pelagic longline gear on board, 
for the purposes of this section, when gear as specified at Sec. 
635.21(c) is on board. A vessel is considered to have bottom longline 
gear on board, for the purposes of this section, when gear as specified 
at Sec. 635.21(d) is on board. A vessel is considered to have gillnet 
gear on board, for the purposes of this section, when gillnet, as 
defined in Sec. 600.10, is on board a vessel that has been issued a 
shark LAP.
    (b) Hardware specifications. The VMS hardware must be approved by 
NMFS and must be able to perform all NMFS required functions. NMFS will 
file with the Office of the Federal Register for publication 
notification listing the specifications for approved VMS units. As 
necessary, NMFS will make additions and/or amendments to the VMS 
hardware type approval list to account for changes in specifications or 
new products offered by manufacturers. NMFS will file with the Office of 
the Federal Register for publication notification listing such additions 
and/or amendments.
    (c) Communications specifications. The communications service 
provider must be approved by NMFS and must be able to provide all NMFS 
required functions. NMFS will file with the Office of the Federal 
Register for publication notification listing the specifications for 
approved VMS communications service providers. As necessary, NMFS will 
make additions and/or amendments to the VMS communications service 
providers type approval list to account for changes in specifications

[[Page 429]]

or new services offered by communications providers. NMFS will file with 
the Office of the Federal Register for publication notification listing 
such additions and/or amendments.
    (d) Installation and activation. As of March 1, 2012, only an E-MTU 
VMS that has been approved by NMFS for Atlantic HMS Fisheries may be 
used. As of January 1, 2012, any VMS unit must be installed by a 
qualified marine electrician. When any NMFS-approved E-MTU VMS is 
installed and activated or reinstalled and reactivated, the vessel owner 
or operator must--
    (1) Follow procedures indicated on a NMFS-approved installation and 
activation checklist for the applicable fishery, which is available from 
NMFS;
    (2) Submit to NMFS a statement certifying compliance with the 
checklist, as prescribed on the checklist; and,
    (3) Submit to NMFS the checklist, completed by a qualified marine 
electrician. Vessels fishing prior to NMFS' receipt of the completed 
checklist and compliance certification statement will be in violation of 
the VMS requirement.
    (e) Operation.--(1) Owners or operators of vessels subject to 
requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section, must activate 
the VMS unit to submit automatic position reports at least 2 hours prior 
to leaving port and continuing until the vessel returns to port. While 
at sea, the unit must always be on, operating and reporting without 
interruption, and NMFS enforcement must receive position reports without 
interruption. No person may interfere with, tamper with, alter, damage, 
disable, or impede the operation of a VMS, or attempt any of the same. 
Vessels fishing outside the geographic area of operation of the 
installed VMS will be in violation of the VMS requirement.
    (2) At least 2 hours prior to departure for each trip, a vessel 
owner or operator must initially report to NMFS any HMS the vessel will 
target on that trip and the specific type(s) of fishing gear, using 
NMFS-defined gear codes, that will be on board the vessel. If the vessel 
owner or operator participates in multiple HMS fisheries, or possesses 
multiple fishing gears on board the vessel, the vessel owner or operator 
must submit multiple electronic reports to NMFS. If, during the trip, 
the vessel switches to a gear type or species group not reported on the 
initial declaration, another declaration must be submitted before this 
fishing begins. This information must be reported to NMFS using an 
attached VMS terminal.
    (3) A vessel owner or operator must report advance notice of landing 
to NMFS. For the purposes of this paragraph, landing means to arrive at 
a dock, berth, beach, seawall, or ramp. The vessel owner or operator is 
responsible for ensuring that NMFS is contacted at least 3 hours in 
advance of landing regardless of trip duration. This information must be 
reported to NMFS using an attached VMS terminal.
    (f) Interruption. When the vessel operator is aware that 
transmission of automatic position reports has been interrupted, or when 
notified by NMFS that automatic position reports are not being received, 
the vessel operator must contact NMFS and follow the instructions given. 
Such instructions may include but are not limited to manually 
communicating to a location designated by NMFS the vessel's position or 
returning to port until the VMS is operable.
    (g) Repair and replacement. After a fishing trip during which 
interruption of automatic position reports has occurred, the vessel's 
owner or operator must have a qualified marine electrician replace or 
repair the VMS unit prior to the vessel's next trip. Repair or 
reinstallation of a VMS unit or installation of a replacement, including 
change of communications service provider, shall be in accordance with 
the installation and activation requirements specified at Sec. 
635.69(d) of this part.
    (h) Access. As a condition to obtaining a LAP for Atlantic 
swordfish, sharks, or tunas, all vessel owners or operators using 
pelagic or bottom longline or gillnet gear, subject to the VMS 
provisions of this section must allow NMFS, the USCG, and their 
authorized officers and designees access to the vessel's position data 
obtained from the VMS at the time of or after

[[Page 430]]

its transmission to the vendor or receiver, as the case may be.

Plan for the Spiny Lobster Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico and South 
Atlantic prepared by the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico Fishery 
Management Councils under the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (b) This part governs the conservation and management of Caribbean 
spiny lobster (spiny lobster) in the EEZ in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf 
of Mexico off the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico states from the Virginia/
North Carolina border south and through the Gulf of Mexico. This part

jurisdiction of the United States.
    (c) An owner or operator of a vessel that has legally harvested 
spiny lobsters in the waters of a foreign nation and possesses spiny 
lobster, or separated tails, in the EEZ incidental to such foreign 
harvesting is exempt from the requirements of this part 640, except for 
Sec. 640.27 with which such an owner or operator must comply, provided 
proof of lawful harvest in the waters of a foreign nation accompanies

usually held up by means of a cord which is released when the net is 
dropped over a lobster.
    Carapace length means the measurement of the carapace (head, body, 
or front section) of a spiny lobster from the anteriormost edge (front) 
of the groove between the horns directly above the eyes, along the

    (2) Does not include any activity described in paragraph (1) of this 
definition with respect to fish caught in the U.S. exclusive economic 
zone by a vessel of the United States.
    Live well means a shaded container used for holding live lobsters 
aboard a vessel in which aerated seawater is continuously circulated 
from the sea. Circulation of seawater at a rate that replaces the water 
at least every 8 minutes meets the requirement for aeration.

Florida boundary (25[deg]48.0[min]N. latitude).
    Off the southern Atlantic states, other than Florida means the area 
from the coast to the outer limit of the EEZ between the Virginia/North 
Carolina boundary (36[deg]34[min]55[sec] N. lat.) to the Georgia/Florida 
boundary (30[deg]42[min]45.6[sec] N. lat.).
    Recreational fishing means fishing or fishing activities which 
result in the harvest of fish, none of which (or parts thereof) is sold, 
traded, or bartered.
    Regional Administrator (RA), for the purposes of this part, means 
the Administrator, Southeast Region, NMFS, 263 13th Avenue South, St. 
Petersburg, FL 33701, or a designee.
    Tail length means the lengthwise measurement of the entire tail 
(segmented portion), not including any protruding muscle tissue, of a 
spiny lobster along the top middorsal line (middle of the back) to the 
rearmost extremity. The measurement is made with the tail in a flat, 
straight position with the tip of the tail closed.
    Trip means a fishing trip, regardless of number of days' duration, 
that begins with departure from a dock, berth, beach, seawall, or ramp 
and that terminates with return to a dock, berth, beach, seawall, or 
ramp.

Sec. 640.20  Seasons.

    (a) EEZ off the southern Atlantic states, other than Florida. In the 
EEZ off the southern Atlantic states, other than Florida, there are no 
seasonal restrictions on the harvest of spiny lobster or on the 
possession of traps.
    (b) EEZ off Florida and off the Gulf states, other than Florida--(1) 
Commercial and recreational fishing season. The commercial and 
recreational fishing season for spiny lobster in the EEZ off Florida and 
the EEZ off the Gulf states, other than Florida, begins on August 6 and 
ends on March 31.
    (2) Special recreational fishing seasons--(i) EEZ off Florida. There 
is a 2-day special recreational fishing season in the EEZ off Florida on 
the last Wednesday and successive Thursday of July each year during 
which fishing for spiny lobster is limited to diving or use of a bully 
net or hoop net. (See Sec. 640.22(a) for general prohibitions on gear 
and methods.) In the EEZ off Monroe County, Florida, no person may 
harvest spiny lobster by diving at night, that is, from 1 hour after 
official sunset to 1 hour before official sunrise, during this 2-day 
special recreational fishing season.
    (ii) EEZ off the Gulf states, other than Florida. There is a 2-day 
special recreational fishing season in the EEZ off the Gulf states, 
other than Florida, during the last Saturday and successive Sunday of 
July each year during which fishing for spiny lobster may be conducted 
by authorized gear and methods other than traps. (See Sec. 640.22(a) 
for general prohibitions on gear and methods.)
    (3) Possession of traps. (i) In the EEZ off Florida, the rules and 
regulations applicable to the possession of spiny lobster traps in 
Florida's waters in Rule 68B-24.005(3), (4), and (5), Florida 
Administrative Code, in effect as of June 1, 1994 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 640.29), apply in their entirety to the possession 
of spiny lobster traps in the EEZ off Florida. A spiny lobster trap, 
buoy, or rope in the EEZ off Florida, during periods not authorized in 
this paragraph will be considered derelict and may be disposed of in 
accordance with Rules 68B-55.002 and 68B-55.004 of the Florida 
Administrative Code, in effect as of October 15, 2007 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 640.29). An owner of such trap, buoy, or rope 
remains subject to appropriate civil penalties.
    (ii) In the EEZ off the Gulf states, other than Florida, a spiny 
lobster trap may be placed in the water prior to the commercial and 
recreational fishing season, which is specified in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section, beginning on August 1 and must be removed from the water 
after such season not later than April 5. A spiny lobster trap, buoy, or 
rope in the EEZ off the Gulf states, other than Florida, during periods 
not authorized in this paragraph will be considered unclaimed or 
abandoned property and may be disposed of in any manner considered 
appropriate by the Assistant Administrator or an authorized officer. An 
owner of such trap,

[[Page 446]]

buoy, or rope remains subject to appropriate civil penalties.
    (4) Possession of spiny lobsters. In the EEZ off Florida and the 
Gulf states, a whole or a part of a spiny lobster subject to these 
regulations may only be possessed during the commercial and recreational 
fishing season and the special recreational fishing season specified in 
Sec. 640.20, unless accompanied by proof of lawful harvest in the 
waters of a foreign nation. Consistent with the provisions of paragraphs 
(b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, a spiny lobster in a trap in this 
area will not be deemed to be possessed provided such spiny lobster is 
returned immediately to the water unharmed when a trap is removed from 
the water between March 31 and April 15.
    (c) Primacy of seasonal restrictions in the EEZ off Florida. The 
seasonal restrictions applicable in the EEZ off Florida apply to all 
spiny lobsters and traps in the EEZ off Florida, without regard to 
harvest or use elsewhere, unless accompanied by proof of lawful harvest 
elsewhere.

FR 75491, Dec. 2, 2011]


<R05>
Sec. 640.21  Harvest limitations.

    (a) Berried lobsters. A berried (egg-bearing) spiny lobster in or 
from the EEZ must be returned immediately to the water unharmed. If 
found in a trap in the EEZ, a berried spiny lobster may not be retained 
in the trap. A berried spiny lobster in or from the EEZ may not be 
stripped of its eggs or otherwise molested. The possession of a spiny 
lobster, or part thereof, in or from the EEZ from which eggs, 
swimmerettes, or pleopods have been removed or stripped is prohibited.
    (b) Minimum size limits. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of 
this section--
    (i) No person may possess a spiny lobster in or from the EEZ with a 
carapace length of 3.0 inches (7.62 cm) or less; and
    (ii) A spiny lobster, harvested in the EEZ by means other than 
diving, with a carapace length of 3.0 inches (7.62 cm) or less must be 
returned immediately to the water unharmed.
    (2) No person may harvest or attempt to harvest a spiny lobster by 
diving in the EEZ unless he or she possesses, while in the water, a 
measuring device capable of measuring the carapace length. A spiny 
lobster captured by a diver must be measured in the water using such 
measuring device and, if the spiny lobster has a carapace length of 3.0 
inches (7.62 cm) or less, it must be released unharmed immediately 
without removal from the water.
    (3) Aboard a vessel authorized under paragraph (d) of this section 
to possess a separated spiny lobster tail, no person may possess in or 
from the EEZ a separated spiny lobster tail with a tail length less than 
5.5 inches (13.97 cm).
    (c) Undersized attractants. A live spiny lobster under the minimum 
size limit specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section that is 
harvested in the EEZ by a trap may be retained aboard the harvesting 
vessel for future use as an attractant in a trap provided it is held in 
a live well aboard the vessel. No more than fifty undersized spiny 
lobsters, and one per trap aboard the vessel, whichever is greater, may 
be retained aboard for use as attractants. The live well must provide a 
minimum of \3/4\ gallons (1.7 liters) of seawater per spiny lobster. An 
undersized spiny lobster so retained must be released to the water alive 
and unharmed immediately upon leaving the trap lines and prior to one 
hour after official sunset each day. No more than fifty undersized spiny 
lobsters and one per trap aboard the vessel, may be retained aboard for 
use as attractants.
    (d) Tail separation. (1) The possession aboard a fishing vessel of a 
separated spiny lobster tail in or from the EEZ as defined in Sec. 
640.1(b), is authorized only when the possession is incidental to 
fishing exclusively in the EEZ on a trip of 48 hours or more and a valid 
Federal tail-separation permit, and either a valid Federal vessel permit 
for spiny lobster or a valid Florida Saltwater Products License with a 
valid Florida Restricted Species Endorsement and a valid Crawfish 
Endorsement, as specified in Sec. 640.4(a)(2), has been issued to and 
are on board the vessel.

[[Page 447]]

    (2) Spiny lobster must be landed either all whole or all tailed on a 
single fishing trip.

76 FR 75491, Dec. 2, 2011]


<R05>
Sec. 640.22  Gear and diving restrictions.

    (a) Prohibited gear and methods. (1) A spiny lobster may not be 
taken in the EEZ with a spear, hook, or similar device, or gear 
containing such devices. In the EEZ, the possession of a speared, 
pierced, or punctured spiny lobster is prima facie evidence that 
prohibited gear was used to take such lobster. Hook, as used in this 
paragraph (a)(1), does not include a hook in a hook-and-line fishery for 
species other than spiny lobster; and possession of a spiny lobster that 
has been speared, pierced, or punctured by such hook is not considered 
evidence that prohibited gear was used to take the spiny lobster, 
provided no prohibited gear is on board the vessel.
    (2) A spiny lobster may not be taken in a directed fishery by the 
use of a net or trawl. See Sec. 640.23(d) for the bycatch limits 
applicable to a vessel that uses or has on board a net or trawl.
    (3) Poisons and explosives may not be used to take a spiny lobster 
in the EEZ as defined in Sec. 640.1(b). For the purposes of this 
paragraph (a)(3), chlorine, bleach, and similar substances, which are 
used to flush a spiny lobster out of rocks or coral, are poisons. A 
vessel in the spiny lobster fishery may not possess on board in the EEZ 
any dynamite or similar explosive substance.
    (b) Traps. (1) In the EEZ, a spiny lobster trap may be no larger in 
dimension than 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet (91.4 cm by 61.0 cm by 61.0 
cm), or the volume equivalent. A trap constructed of material other than 
wood must have a panel constructed of wood, cotton, or other material 
that will degrade at the same rate as a wooden trap. Such panel must be 
located in the upper half of the sides or on top of the trap, so that, 
when removed, there will be an opening in the trap no smaller than the 
diameter found at the throat or entrance of the trap.
    (2) A spiny lobster trap in the EEZ may be pulled or tended during 
daylight hours only, that is, from 1 hour before official sunrise to 1 
hour after official sunset.
    (3) A spiny lobster trap in the EEZ may be pulled or tended only by 
the owner's vessel, or by a vessel for which permission to pull or work 
traps belonging to another person has been granted--
    (i) For traps in the EEZ off Florida, by the Division of Law 
Enforcement, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, in 
accordance with the procedures in Rule 68B-24.006(7), Florida 
Administrative Code, in effect as of July 1, 2008 (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 640.29).
    (ii) For traps in the EEZ, other than off Florida, by the Regional 
Administrator, as may be arranged upon written request.
    (4) Fishing with spiny lobster trap gear is prohibited year-round in 
the following areas bounded by rhumb lines connecting, in order, the 
points listed.

<R05>
Sec. 640.27  Spiny lobster import prohibitions.

    (a) Minimum size limits for imported spiny lobster. There are two 
minimum size limits that apply to importation of spiny lobster into the 
United States -one that applies any place subject to the jurisdiction of 
the United States other than Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands, and 
a more restrictive minimum size limit that applies to Puerto Rico and 
the U.S. Virgin Islands.

[[Page 454]]

    (1) No person may import a spiny lobster with less than a 5-ounce 
(142-gram) tail weight into any place subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States excluding Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. For the 
purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, a 5-ounce (142-gram) tail 
weight is defined as a tail that weighs 4.2-5.4 ounces (119-153 grams). 
If the documentation accompanying an imported spiny lobster (including 
but not limited to product packaging, customs entry forms, bills of 
lading, brokerage forms, or commercial invoices) indicates that the 
product does not satisfy the minimum tail-weight requirement, the person 
importing such spiny lobster has the burden to prove that such spiny 
lobster actually does satisfy the minimum tail-weight requirement or 
that such spiny lobster has a tail length of 5.5 inches (13.97 cm) or 
greater or that such spiny lobster has or had a carapace length of 
greater than 3.0 inches (7.62 cm). If the imported product itself does 
not satisfy the minimum tail-weight requirement, the person importing 
such spiny lobster has the burden to prove that such spiny lobster has a 
tail length of 5.5 inches (13.97 cm) or greater or that such spiny 
lobster has or had a carapace length of greater than 3.0 inches (7.62 
cm). If the burden is satisfied, such spiny lobster will be considered 
to be in compliance with the minimum 5-ounce (142-gram) tail-weight 
requirement.
    (2) See Sec. 622.50 of this chapter regarding a more restrictive 
minimum size limit that applies to spiny lobster imported into Puerto 
Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands.
    (b) Additional spiny lobster import prohibitions--(1) Prohibition 
related to tail meat. No person may import into any place subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States spiny lobster tail meat that is not in 
whole tail form with the exoskeleton attached.
    (2) Prohibitions related to egg-bearing spiny lobster. No person may 
import into any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States 
spiny lobster with eggs attached or spiny lobster from which eggs or 
pleopods (swimmerets) have been removed or stripped. Pleopods 
(swimmerets) are the first five pairs of abdominal appendages.

Sec. 648.2  Definitions.

    In addition to the definitions in the Magnuson Act and in Sec. 
600.10 of this chapter, the terms used in this part have the following 
meanings:
    Alewife means Alosa pseudoharengus.
    American lobster or lobster means Homarus americanus.
    American shad means Alosa sapidissima.
    Annual catch entitlement (ACE), with respect to the NE multispecies 
fishery, means the share of the annual catch limit (ACL) for each NE 
multispecies stock that is allocated to an individual sector or state-
operated permit bank based upon the cumulative fishing history attached 
to each permit participating in that sector or held by a state-operated 
permit bank in a given year. This share may be adjusted due to penalties 
for exceeding the sector's ACE for a particular stock in earlier years, 
or due to other violations of the FMP, including the yearly sector 
operations plan. When a sector's or state-operated permit bank's share 
of a NE multispecies stock, as determined by the fishing histories of 
vessels participating in that sector or permits held by a state-operated 
permit bank, is multiplied by the available catch, the result is the 
amount of ACE (live weight in pounds) that can be harvested (landings 
and discards) by participants in that sector or transferred by a state-
operated permit bank, during a particular fishing year.

<R05>
Sec. 648.3  Relation to other laws.

    (a) The relation of this part to other laws is set forth in Sec. 
600.705.
    (b) Nothing in these regulations supersedes more restrictive state 
management measures for any of the species referenced in Sec. 648.1 
and, for Atlantic salmon, more restrictive local management measures.


<R05>
Sec. 648.4  Vessel permits.

    (a) Fishery specific permit information--(1) NE multispecies 
vessels. Except for vessels that have been issued a valid High Seas 
Fishing Compliance permit, have declared their intent to fish, and fish 
exclusively in the NAFO Regulatory Area as provided in Sec. 648.17, any 
vessel of the United States, including a charter or party boat, must 
have been issued and have on board a valid multispecies permit to fish 
for, possess, or land multispecies finfish in or from the EEZ. 
Multispecies frames used as, or to be used as, bait on a vessel fishing 
exclusively with pot gear are deemed not to be multispecies finfish for 
purposes of this part provided that there is a receipt for the purchase 
of those frames on board the vessel.
    (i) Limited access multispecies permits--(A) Eligibility. To be 
eligible to apply for a limited access NE multispecies permit, as 
specified in Sec. 648.82, a vessel must have been issued a limited 
access NE multispecies permit for the preceding year, be replacing a 
vessel that was issued a limited access NE multispecies permit for the 
preceding year, or be replacing a vessel that was issued a confirmation 
of permit history; unless otherwise specified in this paragraph 
(a)(1)(i)(A). For the fishing year beginning May 1, 2004, a vessel may 
apply for a limited access Handgear A permit described in Sec. 
648.82(b)(6), if it meets the criteria described under paragraphs 
(a)(1)(i)(A)(1) and (2) of this section.
    (1) The vessel must have been previously issued a valid NE 
multispecies open access Handgear permit during at least 1 fishing year 
during the fishing years 1997 through 2002; and
    (2) The vessel must have landed and reported to NMFS at least 500 lb 
(226.8 kg) of cod, haddock, or pollock, when fishing under the open 
access Handgear permit in at least 1 of the fishing years

[[Page 471]]

from 1997 through 2002, as indicated by NMFS dealer records (live 
weight), submitted to NMFS prior to January 29, 2004.
    (3) Application/renewal restrictions. The vessel owner must submit a 
complete application for an initial limited access handgear permit 
before May 1, 2005. For fishing years beyond the 2004 fishing year, the 
provisions of paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section apply.
    (B) Application/renewal restrictions. All limited access or 
moratorium permits established under this section must be issued on an 
annual basis by the last day of the permit year for which the permit is 
required, unless a confirmation of permit history (CPH) has been issued 
as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(J) of this section. If a vessel is 
issued more than one limited access or moratorium permit under this 
section, these permits will be regarded as a permit suite. Permit 
renewal or relinquishment must be made at the time the first permit 
application is submitted for a new permit year. Application for limited 
access or moratorium permits must be received no later than 30 days 
before the last day of the permit year of the earliest expiration date 
for any permit in the suite of such permits issued to the vessel. 
Failure to renew a limited access or moratorium permit in any permit 
year bars the renewal of the permit in subsequent years. Open access 
permits may not be issued to a vessel eligible to renew a limited access 
or moratorium permit until such time that the vessel's limited access or 
moratorium permit(s) are renewed or voluntarily relinquished pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(1)(i)(K) of this section, or otherwise transferred from 
the vessel.
    (C) Qualification restriction. Unless the Regional Administrator 
determines otherwise, no more than one vessel may qualify, at any one 
time, for a limited access permit or CPH based on that or another 
vessel's fishing and permit history. If more than one vessel owner 
claims eligibility for a limited access permit or CPH, based on one 
vessel's fishing and permit history, the Regional Administrator will 
determine who is entitled to qualify for the permit or CPH and any DAS 
allocation according to paragraph (a)(1)(i)(D) of this section.
    (D) Change in ownership. The fishing and permit history of a vessel 
is presumed to transfer with the vessel whenever it is bought, sold, or 
otherwise transferred, unless there is a written agreement, signed by 
the transferor/seller and transferee/buyer, or other credible written 
evidence, verifying that the transferor/seller is retaining the vessel's 
fishing and permit history for purposes of replacing the vessel.
    (E) Replacement vessels. An owner of a vessel that has been issued 
any limited access or moratorium permit under this section is limited to 
one vessel replacement permit year, using the earliest permit year start 
date of the limited access or moratorium permits for which the vessel is 
eligible, unless the vessel has been rendered inoperable and non-
repairable. With the exception of vessels that have obtained a limited 
access Handgear A permit described in Sec. 648.82(b)(6), to be eligible 
for a limited access or moratorium permit under this section, the 
replacement vessel must meet the following criteria and any other 
applicable criteria under paragraph (a)(1)(i)(F) of this section:
    (1) The replacement vessel's horsepower may not exceed by more than 
20 percent the horsepower of the vessel's baseline specifications, as 
applicable.
    (2) The replacement vessel's length, GRT, and NT may not exceed by 
more than 10 percent the length, GRT, and NT of the vessel's baseline 
specifications, as applicable.
    (F) Upgraded vessel. A vessel may be upgraded, whether through 
refitting or replacement, and be eligible to retain or renew a limited 
access permit, only if the upgrade complies with the following:
    (1) The vessels's horsepower may be increased only once, whether 
through refitting or replacement. Such an increase may not exceed 20 
percent of the horsepower of the vessel's baseline specifications, as 
applicable.
    (2) The vessel's length, GRT, and NT may be increased only once, 
whether through refitting or replacement. Any increase in any of these 
three specifications of vessel size may not exceed 10

[[Page 472]]

percent of the vessel's baseline specifications, as applicable. If any 
of these three specifications is increased, any increase in the other 
two must be performed at the same time. This type of upgrade may be done 
separately from an engine horsepower upgrade.
    (G) Consolidation restriction. Except as provided for in the NE 
Multispecies DAS Leasing Program, as specified in Sec. 648.82(k), and 
the NE Multispecies DAS Transfer Program as specified in Sec. 
648.82(l), limited access permits and DAS allocations may not be 
combined or consolidated.
    (H) Vessel baseline specifications. The vessel baseline 
specifications in this section are the respective specifications 
(length, GRT, NT, horsepower) of the vessel that was initially issued a 
limited access permit as of the date the initial vessel applied for such 
permit.
    (I) Limited access permit restrictions. (1) A vessel may be issued a 
limited access NE multispecies permit in only one category during a 
fishing year. Vessels may not change limited access NE multispecies 
permit categories during the fishing year, except as provided in 
paragraph (a)(1)(i)(I)(2) of this section. A vessel issued a limited 
access NE multispecies Hook-gear permit or a limited access Handgear A 
permit may not change its limited access permit category at any time.
    (2) The owner of a vessel issued a limited access multispecies 
permit may request a change in permit category, unless otherwise 
restricted by paragraph (a)(1)(i)(I)(1) of this section. The owner of a 
limited access multispecies vessel eligible to request a change in 
permit category must elect a category upon the vessel's permit 
application and will have one opportunity to request a change in permit 
category by submitting an application to the Regional Administrator 
within 45 days of the effective date of the vessel's permit. If such a 
request is not received within 45 days, the vessel owner may not request 
a change in permit category and the vessel permit category will remain 
unchanged for the duration of the fishing year. A vessel may not fish in 
more than one multispecies permit category during a fishing year.
    (J) Confirmation of permit history. Notwithstanding any other 
provisions of this part, a person who does not currently own a fishing 
vessel, but who has owned a qualifying vessel that has sunk, been 
destroyed, or transferred to another person, must apply for and receive 
a CPH if the fishing and permit history of such vessel has been retained 
lawfully by the applicant. To be eligible to obtain a CPH, the applicant 
must show that the qualifying vessel meets the eligibility requirements, 
as applicable, in this part. Issuance of a valid CPH preserves the 
eligibility of the applicant to apply for a limited access permit for a 
replacement vessel based on the qualifying vessel's fishing and permit 
history at a subsequent time, subject to the replacement provisions 
specified in this section. If fishing privileges have been assigned or 
allocated previously under this part, based on the qualifying vessel's 
fishing and permit history, the CPH also preserves such fishing 
privileges. A CPH must be applied for in order for the applicant to 
preserve the fishing rights and limited access eligibility of the 
qualifying vessel. An application for a CPH must be received by the 
Regional Administrator no later than 30 days prior to the end of the 
first full fishing year in which a vessel permit cannot be issued. 
Failure to do so is considered abandonment of the permit as described in 
paragraph (a)(1)(i)(K) of this section. A CPH issued under this part 
will remain valid until the fishing and permit history preserved by the 
CPH is used to qualify a replacement vessel for a limited access permit. 
Any decision regarding the issuance of a CPH for a qualifying vessel 
that has applied for or been issued previously a limited access permit 
is a final agency action subject to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 704. 
Information requirements for the CPH application are the same as those 
for a limited access permit. Any request for information about the 
vessel on the CPH application form refers to the qualifying vessel that 
has been sunk, destroyed, or transferred. Vessel permit applicants who 
have been issued a CPH and who wish to obtain a vessel permit for a 
replacement vessel based upon the previous vessel history may do so 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i)(E) of this section.

[[Page 473]]

    (K) Abandonment or voluntary relinquishment of a limited access or 
moratorium permit. If a vessel's limited access or moratorium permit for 
a particular fishery is voluntarily relinquished to the Regional 
Administrator or abandoned through failure to renew or otherwise, no 
limited access or moratorium permit for that fishery may be reissued or 
renewed based on that vessel's limited access or moratorium permit 
history or to any other vessel relying on that vessel's limited access 
or moratorium permit history.
    (L) Restriction on permit splitting. A limited access permit issued 
pursuant to this section may not be issued to a vessel or its 
replacement or remain valid, if the vessel's permit or fishing history 
has been used to qualify another vessel for another Federal fishery.
    (M) Appeal of denial of permit--(1) Eligibility. Any applicant 
eligible to apply for a limited access multispecies Handgear A permit 
who is denied such permit may appeal the denial to the Regional 
Administrator within 30 days of the notice of denial. Any such appeal 
must be based on the grounds that the information used by the Regional 
Administrator was based on incorrect data, must be in writing, and must 
state the grounds for the appeal.
    (2) Appeal review. The Regional Administrator will appoint a 
designee who will make the initial decision on the appeal. The appellant 
may request a review of the initial decision by the Regional 
Administrator by so requesting in writing within 30 days of the notice 
of the initial decision. If the appellant does not request a review of 
the initial decision within 30 days, the initial decision is the final 
administrative action of the Department of Commerce. Such review will be 
conducted by a hearing officer appointed by the Regional Administrator. 
The hearing officer shall make findings and a recommendation to the 
Regional Administrator, which shall be advisory only. Upon receiving the 
findings and the recommendation, the Regional Administrator will issue a 
final decision on the appeal. The Regional Administrator's decision is 
the final administrative action of the Department of Commerce.
    (3) Status of vessels pending appeal. A vessel denied a limited 
access Handgear A multispecies permit may fish under the limited access 
multispecies Handgear A category, provided that the denial has been 
appealed, the appeal is pending, and the vessel has on board a letter 
from the Regional Administrator authorizing the vessel to fish under the 
limited access category. The Regional Administrator will issue such a 
letter for the pendency of any appeal. Any such decision is the final 
administrative action of the Department of Commerce on allowable fishing 
activity, pending a final decision on the appeal. The letter of 
authorization must be carried on board the vessel. If the appeal is 
finally denied, the Regional Administrator shall send a notice of final 
denial to the vessel owner; the authorizing letter becomes invalid 5 
days after receipt of the notice of denial.
    (ii) Open access permits. A vessel of the United States that has not 
been issued and is not eligible to be issued a limited access 
multispecies permit is eligible for and may be issued an ``open access 
multispecies'', ``handgear'', or ``charter/party'' permit, and may fish 
for, possess on board, and land multispecies finfish subject to the 
restrictions in Sec. 648.88. A vessel that has been issued a valid 
limited access scallop permit, but that has not been issued a limited 
access mulitspecies permit, is eligible for and may be issued an open 
access scallop multispecies possession limit permit and may fish for, 
possess on board, and land multispecies finfish subject to the 
restrictions in Sec. 648.88. The owner of a vessel issued an open 
access permit may request a different open access permit category by 
submitting an application to the Regional Administrator at any time.
    (2) Atlantic sea scallop vessels--Any vessel of the United States 
that fishes for, possesses, or lands Atlantic sea scallops, except 
vessels that fish exclusively in state waters for scallops, must have 
been issued and carry on board a valid scallop vessel permit pursuant to 
this section.
    (i) Limited access scallop permits. Any vessel of the United States 
that possesses or lands more than 600 lb (272.2 kg) of shucked scallops, 
or 50 bu (17.6

[[Page 474]]

hL) of in-shell scallops per trip South of 42[deg]20[min] N. Lat., or 75 
bu (26.4 hL) of in-shell scallops per trip North of 42[deg]20[min] N. 
Lat, or possesses more than 100 bu (35.2 hL) of in-shell scallops 
seaward of the VMS Demarcation Line, except vessels that fish 
exclusively in state waters for scallops, must have been issued and 
carry on board a valid limited access scallop permit.
    (A) Eligibility. To be eligible to apply for a limited access 
scallop permit, a vessel must have been issued a limited access scallop 
permit for the preceding year, be replacing a vessel that was issued a 
limited access scallop permit for the preceding year, or be replacing a 
vessel that was issued a confirmation of permit history.
    (B) Application/renewal restrictions. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of 
this section.
    (C) Qualification restriction. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(C) of this 
section.
    (D) Change in ownership. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(D) of this section.
    (E) Replacement vessels. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(E) of this section.
    (F) Upgraded vessel. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(F) of this section.
    (G) Consolidation restriction. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(G) of this 
section.
    (H) Vessel baseline specifications. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(H) of 
this section.
    (I) Limited access permit restrictions. A vessel may be issued a 
limited access scallop permit in only one category during a fishing 
year. The owner of a vessel issued a limited access scallop permit must 
elect a permit category upon the vessels permit application and will 
have one opportunity to request a change in permit category by 
submitting an application to the Regional Administrator within 45 days 
of the effective date of the vessel's permit. After this date, the 
vessel must remain in that permit category for the duration of the 
fishing year. Any DAS that a vessel uses prior to a change in permit 
category will be counted against its allocation received under any 
subsequent permit category.
    (J) Confirmation of permit history. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(J) of 
this section.
    (K) Abandonment or voluntary relinquishment of permits. See 
paragraph (a)(1)(i)(K) of this section.
    (L) Restriction on permit splitting. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(L) of 
this section.
    (M) Percentage ownership restrictions. (1) For any vessel acquired 
after March 1, 1994, a vessel owner is not eligible to be issued a 
limited access scallop permit for the vessel, and/or a confirmation of 
permit history, if, as a result of the issuance of the permit and/or 
confirmation of permit history, the vessel owner, or any other person 
who is a shareholder or partner of the vessel owner, will have an 
ownership interest in a total number of limited access scallop vessels 
and limited access scallop confirmations of permit history in excess of 
5 percent of the number of all limited access scallop vessels and 
confirmations of permit history at the time of permit application.
    (2) Vessel owners who were initially issued a 1994 limited access 
scallop permit or confirmation of permit history, or who were issued or 
renewed a limited access scallop permit or confirmation of permit 
history for a vessel in 1995 and thereafter, in compliance with the 
ownership restrictions in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(M)(1) of this section, are 
eligible to renew such permits(s) and/or confirmation(s) of permit 
history, regardless of whether the renewal of the permits or 
confirmations of permit history will result in the 5-percent ownership 
restriction being exceeded.
    (3) Having an ownership interest includes, but is not limited to, 
persons who are shareholders in a vessel owned by a corporation, who are 
partners (general or limited) to a vessel owner, or who, in any way, 
partly own a vessel.
    (N) [Reserved]
    (O) Replacement vessels. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(E) of this section.
    (P) VMS requirement. A vessel issued a limited access scallop 
permit, as specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, except a 
vessel issued an occasional scallop permit that is not fishing in a sea 
scallop access area, must have an operational VMS installed. Prior to 
issuance of a limited access scallop permit, NMFS must receive a signed 
VMS certification from the vessel owner and be notified by the VMS 
vendor that the unit has been installed and is operational.

[[Page 475]]

    (ii) LAGC scallop permits. Any vessel of the United States that has 
not been issued a limited access scallop permit pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section, and any vessel issued a limited access 
scallop permit that fishes for scallops outside of the scallop DAS 
program described in Sec. 648.53(b) or the Area Access program 
described in Sec. 648.60, that possesses, retains, or lands scallops in 
or from Federal waters, must be issued an LAGC scallop permit and must 
comply with the permit requirements described in paragraphs 
(a)(2)(ii)(A), (B), or (C) of this section. To be issued an LAGC scallop 
permit, a vessel owner must meet the qualification criteria specified in 
paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(D) or (F) of this section and must comply with the 
application procedures specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(H) of this 
section.
    (A) Individual fishing quota LAGC permit. To possess or land up to 
600 lb (272.2 kg) of shucked meats, or land up to 75 bu (26.4 hL) of in-
shell scallops per trip, or possess up to 100 bu (35.2 hL) of in-shell 
scallops seaward of the VMS demarcation line, a vessel must have been 
issued an individual fishing quota LAGC scallop permit (IFQ scallop 
permit). Issuance of an initial IFQ scallop permit is contingent upon 
the vessel owner submitting the required application and other 
information that demonstrates that the vessel meets the eligibility 
criteria specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(D) of this section.
    (B) Northern Gulf of Maine LAGC permit. To possess or land up to 200 
lb (90.7 kg) of shucked or 25 bu (8.81 hL) in-shell scallops per trip, 
or to possess up to 50 bu (17.6 hL) seaward of the VMS demarcation line 
in the NGOM Scallop Management Area, a vessel must have been issued a 
Northern Gulf of Maine LAGC scallop permit (NGOM scallop permit). A 
vessel issued a NGOM scallop permit may not fish for scallops outside of 
the NGOM Scallop Management Area as defined in Sec. 648.62, and may not 
possess or land more than 200 lb (90.7 kg) of shucked or 25 bu (8.81 hL) 
of in-shell scallops at any time, except the vessel may possess up to 50 
bu (17.6 hL) of in-shell scallops seaward of the VMS demarcation line. 
Issuance of an initial NGOM scallop permit is contingent upon the vessel 
owner submitting the required application and other information that 
demonstrates that the vessel meets the eligibility criteria specified in 
paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(F) of this section.
    (C) Incidental catch LAGC permit. To possess or land up to 40 lb 
(18.1 kg) of shucked or 5 bu (1.76 hL) in-shell scallops per trip, or 
possess up to 10 bu (3.52 hL) in-shell scallops per trip seaward of the 
VMS demarcation line, but not more than these amounts per trip, a vessel 
must have been issued an incidental catch general category scallop 
permit (Incidental scallop permit). A vessel issued an incidental catch 
general scallop permit may not possess or land more than 40 lb (18.1 kg) 
of shucked or 5 bu (1.76 hL) of in-shell scallops at any time, except 
the vessel may possess up to 10 bu (3.52 hL) of in-shell scallops 
seaward of the VMS demarcation line. Issuance of an initial incidental 
catch category scallop permit is contingent upon the vessel owner 
submitting the required application and other information that 
demonstrates that the vessel meets the eligibility criteria specified in 
paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(G) of this section.
    (D) Eligibility for an IFQ scallop permit. A vessel is eligible for 
and may be issued an IFQ scallop permit if it meets both eligibility 
criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(D)(1) and (2) of this 
section, or is replacing a vessel that meets both the eligibility 
criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(D)(1) and (2) of this 
section. A vessel owner may appeal NMFS's determination that a vessel 
does not meet the requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(D)(1) 
and (2) of this section by complying with the appeal process, as 
specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(O) of this section.
    (1) Permit criterion. A vessel must have been issued a general 
category scallop permit in at least one scallop fishing year, as defined 
in Sec. 648.2, between March 1, 2000, and November 1, 2004.
    (2) Landings criterion. A vessel must have landed at least 1,000 lb 
(454 kg) of shucked scallops in any one year when the vessel also held a 
general category scallop permit as specified in paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii)(D)(1) of this section. To qualify, scallop landings in the 
2004 fishing year must have occurred on or

[[Page 476]]

before November 1, 2004. NMFS dealer data shall be used to make the 
initial determination of vessel eligibility. If a dealer reported more 
than 400 lb (181.4 kg) of scallops on a trip, only 400 lb (181.4 kg) 
will be credited toward the landings criteria. For dealer reports that 
indicate that the landings were bushels of in-shell scallops, a 
conversion of 8 lb (3.63 kg) of scallop meats per bushel will be used to 
calculate meat-weight, up to the maximum of 400 lb (181.4 kg) per trip. 
For dealer reports that indicate that the landings were reported in 
pounds of in-shell scallops, the weight shall be converted to meat-
weight using the formula of one pound (0.45 kg) of scallop meats for 
8.33 lb (3.78 kg) of in-shell scallops, up to the maximum of 400 lb 
(181.4 kg) per trip, for qualification purposes.
    (E) Contribution factor for determining a vessel's IFQ. An eligible 
IFQ scallop vessel's best year of scallop landings during the 
qualification period of March 1, 2000, through November 1, 2004, as 
specified in Sec. 648.53(h)(2)(ii)(A), and the vessel's number of years 
active, as specified in Sec. 648.53(h)(2)(ii)(B), shall be used to 
calculate a vessel's contribution factor, as specified in Sec. 
648.53(h)(2)(ii)(C). A vessel owner that has applied for an IFQ scallop 
permit will be notified of the vessel's contribution factor at the time 
of issuance of the IFQ scallop permit, consistent with confidentiality 
restrictions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act specified at 16 U.S.C. 1881a. A 
vessel owner may appeal NMFS's determination of the IFQ scallop vessel's 
contribution factor by complying with the appeal process as specified in 
paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(O) of this section.
    (F) Eligibility for NGOM or Incidental scallop permit. A vessel that 
is not eligible for, or for which the vessel's owner chooses not to 
apply for, an IFQ scallop permit, may be issued either a NGOM scallop 
permit or an Incidental scallop permit if the vessel was issued a 
general category scallop permit as of November 1, 2004, or if the vessel 
is replacing a vessel that was issued a general category scallop permit 
as of November 1, 2004. A vessel owner may appeal NMFS's determination 
that a vessel does not meet this criterion by complying with the appeal 
process as specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(O) of this section. A 
vessel that qualifies for an IFQ scallop permit automatically qualifies 
for an NGOM or Incidental scallop permit if the vessel's owner chooses 
to be issued an NGOM or Incidental scallop permit instead of the IFQ 
scallop permit.
    (G) LAGC permit restrictions--(1) Change of permit category--(i) IFQ 
scallop permit. A vessel issued an IFQ scallop permit may not change its 
general category scallop permit category at any time without voluntarily 
relinquishing its IFQ scallop permit eligibility as specified in 
paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(M) of this section. If the vessel owner has elected 
to relinquish the vessel's IFQ permit and instead be issued an NGOM or 
Incidental scallop permit, the IFQ permit shall be permanently 
relinquished.
    (ii) NGOM and Incidental scallop permit. A vessel may be issued 
either an NGOM or Incidental scallop permit for each fishing year, and a 
vessel owner may not change his/her LAGC scallop permit category during 
the fishing year, except as specified in this paragraph, 
(a)(2)(ii)(G)(1)(ii). The owners of a vessel issued an NOGM or 
Incidental scallop permit must elect a permit category in the vessel's 
permit application and shall have one opportunity each fishing year to 
request a change in its permit category by submitting an application to 
the Regional Administrator within 45 days of the effective date of the 
vessel's permit. After that date, the vessel must remain in that permit 
category for the duration of the fishing year.
    (2) VMS requirement. A vessel issued a LAGC permit must have an 
operational VMS installed. Issuance of an Atlantic sea scallop permit 
requires the vessel owner to submit a copy of the vendor's installation 
receipt or provide verification of vendor activation from a NMFS-
approved VMS vendor as described in Sec. 648.9.
    (H) Application/renewal restrictions. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of 
this section. Applications for a LAGC permit described in paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii) of this section must be postmarked no later than August 30, 
2008. Applications for LAGC permits that are not postmarked

[[Page 477]]

on or before August 30, 2008, may be denied and returned to the sender 
with a letter explaining the denial. Such denials may not be appealed 
and shall be the final decision of the Department of Commerce. If NMFS 
determines that the vessel owner has failed to pay a cost recovery fee 
in accordance with the cost recovery requirements specified at Sec. 
648.53(h)(4)(ii), the IFQ permit shall not be renewed.
    (I) Qualification restriction. (1) See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(C) of 
this section for restrictions applicable to limited access scallop 
permits.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1)(i)(L) of this section, scallop 
landings history generated by separate owners of a single vessel at 
different times during the qualification period for LAGC scallop permits 
may be used to qualify more than one vessel, provided that each owner 
applying for an LAGC scallop permit demonstrates that he/she created 
distinct fishing histories, that such histories have been retained, and 
if the vessel was sold, that each applicant's eligibility and fishing 
history is distinct.
    (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1)(i)(L) of this section, a vessel 
owner applying for a LAGC permit who sold or transferred a vessel with 
non-scallop limited access permits, as specified in paragraph 
(a)(1)(i)(D) of this section, and retained only the general category 
scallop history of such vessel as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(D) of 
this section, before July 1, 2008, may use the general category scallop 
history to qualify a different vessel for the initial IFQ scallop 
permit, regardless of whether the history from the sold or transferred 
vessel was used to qualify another vessel for another limited access 
permit.
    (J) Change in ownership. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(D) of this section.
    (K) Replacement vessels. A vessel owner may apply to replace a 
qualified LAGC vessel with another vessel that he/she owns. There are no 
size or horsepower restrictions on replacing general LAGC vessels, 
unless the qualified vessel that will be replaced is subject to such 
restriction because of other limited access permits issued pursuant to 
Sec. 648.4. In order for a LAGC that also has other limited access 
permits issued pursuant to Sec. 648.4 to be replaced by a vessel that 
does not meet the replacement and upgrade restrictions specified for 
those other limited access permits, the other limited access permits 
must be permanently relinquished, as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(K) 
of this section.
    (L) Confirmation of Permit History. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(J) of 
this section.
    (M) Abandonment or voluntary relinquishment of permits. See 
paragraph (a)(1)(i)(K) of this section.
    (N) Restriction on permit splitting. Except as provided in 
paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(I)(2) and (3) of this section, paragraph 
(a)(1)(i)(L) of this section applies.
    (O) Appeal of denial of permit--(1) Eligibility. Any applicant 
eligible to apply for an LAGC scallop permit who is denied such permit 
may appeal the denial to the Regional Administrator within 30 days of 
the notice of denial. Any such appeal may only be based on the grounds 
that the information used by the Regional Administrator was incorrect. 
The appeal must be in writing, must state the specific grounds for the 
appeal, and must include information to support the appeal.
    (2) Contribution factor appeals. Any applicant eligible to apply for 
a IFQ scallop permit who disputes NMFS's determination of the vessel's 
contribution factor specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(E) of this section 
may appeal NMFS's determination to the Regional Administrator within 30 
days of the notification of the vessel's best year and years active. Any 
such appeal may only be based on the grounds that the information used 
by the Regional Administrator was incorrect. The appeal must be in 
writing, must state the specific grounds for the appeal, and must 
include information to support the appeal. A vessel owner may appeal 
both the eligibility criteria and the contribution factor and must 
submit the appeal for both at the same time. An appeal of contribution 
factor determinations shall be reviewed concurrently with an eligibility 
appeal, if applicable.
    (3) Appeal review. The Regional Administrator shall appoint a 
designee who shall make the initial decision on the appeal. The 
appellant may request

[[Page 478]]

a review of the initial decision by the Regional Administrator by so 
requesting in writing within 30 days of the notice of the initial 
decision. If the appellant does not request a review of the initial 
decision within 30 days, the initial decision is the final 
administrative action of the Department of Commerce. Such review will be 
conducted by a hearing officer appointed by the Regional Administrator. 
The hearing officer shall make findings and a recommendation to the 
Regional Administrator, which shall be advisory only. Upon receiving the 
findings and the recommendation, the Regional Administrator shall issue 
a final decision on the appeal. The Regional Administrator's decision is 
the final administrative action of the Department of Commerce.
    (4) Status of vessels pending appeal. A vessel denied an LAGC 
scallop permit may fish while under appeal, provided that the denial has 
been appealed, the appeal is pending, and the vessel has on board a 
letter from the Regional Administrator temporarily authorizing the 
vessel to fish under the limited access general category permit. The 
Regional Administrator shall issue such a letter that shall be effective 
only during the pendency of any appeal. The temporary letter of 
authorization must be carried on board the vessel and all requirements 
of the permit category for which the appeal has been made shall apply. 
If the appeal is finally denied, the Regional Administrator shall send a 
notice of final denial to the vessel owner; the temporary authorizing 
letter becomes invalid 5 days after receipt of the notice of denial, but 
no later than 10 days from the date of the letter of denial, regardless 
of the date of the owner's receipt of the denial.
    (3) Summer flounder vessels. Any vessel of the United States that 
fishes for or retains summer flounder in the EEZ must have been issued 
and carry on board a valid summer flounder permit, except for vessels 
other than party or charter vessels that observe the possession limit 
set forth in Sec. 648.106.
    (i) Moratorium permits--(A) Eligibility. To be eligible to apply for 
a moratorium permit to fish for and retain summer flounder in excess of 
the possession limit in Sec. 648.106 in the EEZ, a vessel must have 
been issued a summer flounder moratorium permit for the preceding year, 
be replacing a vessel that was issued a moratorium permit for the 
preceding year, or be replacing a vessel that was issued a confirmation 
of permit history.
    (B) Application/renewal restriction. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of 
this section.
    (C) Qualification restriction. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(C) of this 
section.
    (D) Change in ownership. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(D) of this section.

    (F) Upgraded vessel. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(F) of this section.
    (G) Consolidation restriction. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(G) of this 
section.
    (H) Vessel baseline specifications. The vessel baseline 
specifications in this section are the respective specifications 
(length, GRT, NT, horsepower) of the vessel as of March 22, 1999, unless 
the vessel is in the process of construction or rerigging or under 
agreement or written contract for construction or rerigging, as of the 
effective baseline specification date in which case the baseline 
specifications will be established no later than February 19, 2000.
    (I) [Reserved]
    (J) Confirmation of permit history. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(J) of 
this section.
    (K) Abandonment or voluntary relinquishment of permits. See 
paragraph (a)(1)(i)(K) of this section.
    (L) Restriction on permit splitting. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(L) of 
this section.
    (ii) Party and charter boat permits. Any party or charter boat is 
eligible for a permit to fish for summer flounder, other than a summer 
flounder moratorium permit, if it is carrying passengers for hire. Such 
vessel must observe the possession limits specified in Sec. 648.106.
    (iii) Exemption permits. Owners of summer flounder vessels seeking 
an exemption from the minimum mesh requirement under the provisions of 
Sec. 648.108(b)(1) must request a letter of authorization (LOA) from 
the Regional Administrator. Vessels must be enrolled in the exemption 
program for a minimum of 7 days. The Regional Administrator may impose 
temporary additional procedural requirements by

[[Page 479]]

publishing a notification in the Federal Register. If a summer flounder 
charter or party requirement of this part differs from a summer flounder 
charter or party management measure required by a state, any vessel 
owners or operators fishing under the terms of a summer flounder 
charter/party vessel permit in the EEZ for summer flounder must comply 
with the more restrictive requirement while fishing in state waters, 
unless otherwise authorized under Sec. 648.107.
    (4) Surfclam and ocean quahog vessels. Any vessel of the United 
States that fishes for surfclams or ocean quahogs, except vessels taking 
surfclams and ocean quahogs for personal use or fishing exclusively 
within state waters, must have been issued and carry on board a valid 
surfclam or ocean quahog permit, respectively.
    (i) Maine mahogany quahog permit. (A) A vessel is eligible for a 
Maine mahogany quahog permit to fish for ocean quahogs in the Maine 
mahogany quahog zone if it meets the following eligibility criteria in 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, and an application for a 
Maine mahogany quahog permit is submitted by May 19, 1999. After May 19, 
1999, to be eligible to apply for a Maine mahogany quahog permit, a 
vessel must have been issued a Maine mahogany quahog permit for the 
preceding year, be replacing a vessel that was issued a Maine mahogany 
quahog permit for the preceding year, or be replacing a vessel that was 
issued a confirmation of permit history.
    (1) The vessel was issued a Federal Maine Mahogany Quahog 
Experimental Permit during one of the experimental fisheries authorized 
by the Regional Administrator between September 30, 1990, and September 
30, 1997; and,
    (2) The vessel landed at least one Maine bushel of ocean quahogs 
from the Maine mahogany quahog zone as documented by fishing or 
shellfish logs submitted to the Regional Administrator prior to January 
1, 1998.
    (B) Application/renewal restriction. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of 
this section.
    (C) Qualification restriction. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(C) of this 
section.
    (D) Change in ownership. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(D) of this section.

paragraph (a)(1)(i)(K) of this section.
    (L) Restriction on permit splitting. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(L) of 
this section.
    (M) Appeal of denial of a permit. (1) Any applicant denied a Maine 
mahogany quahog permit may appeal to the Regional Administrator within 
30 days of the notice of denial. Any such appeal shall be in writing. 
The only ground for appeal is that the Regional Administrator's designee 
erred in concluding that the vessel did not meet the criteria in 
paragraph (a)(4)(i)(A) of this section. The appeal must set forth the 
basis for the applicant's belief that the decision of the Regional 
Administrator's designee was made in error.
    (2) The appeal may be presented, at the option of the applicant, at 
a hearing before an officer appointed by the Regional Administrator.
    (3) The hearing officer shall make a recommendation to the Regional 
Administrator.
    (4) The Regional Administrator will make a final decision based on 
the criteria in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(A) of this section and on the 
available record, including any relevant documentation submitted by the 
applicant and, if a hearing is held, the recommendation of the hearing 
officer. The decision on the appeal by the Regional Administrator is the 
final decision of the Department of Commerce.
    (ii) VMS Requirement. (A) Surfclam and ocean quahog open access 
permits. In order to be eligible for issuance of an open access surfclam 
or ocean quahog permit, the vessel owner must have installed on the 
vessel an operational VMS unit that meets the criteria set forth in 
Sec. 648.9. The vessel owner/operator must activate the VMS unit and

[[Page 480]]

provide verification of vendor activation from a NMFS-approved VMS 
vendor as described in Sec. 648.9. Verification is done by completing, 
signing, and mailing or faxing a VMS certification form to the NMFS 
Northeast Region Office of Law Enforcement.
    (B) Maine mahogany quahog limited access permit. In order to be 
eligible for issuance of a Maine mahogany quahog permit, the vessel 
owner must have installed on the vessel an operational VMS unit that 
meets the criteria set forth in Sec. 648.9. By January 1, 2009, unless 
otherwise exempted under paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(B)(1) of this section. The 
vessel owner/operator must activate the VMS unit and provide 
verification of vendor activation from a NMFS-approved VMS vendor as 
described in Sec. 648.9. Verification is done by completing, signing, 
and mailing or faxing a VMS certification form to the NMFS Northeast 
Region Office of Law Enforcement.
    (1) Special VMS exemption for Maine mahogany quahog vessels. Vessel 
owners eligible to renew a limited access Maine mahogany quahog permit 
may do so without proof of installation of a VMS, provided the vessel 
does not fish for, catch, or possess; or attempt to fish for, catch, or 
posses; Maine mahogany quahogs. Proof of VMS installation must be 
provided to the NMFS Northeast Region Office of Law Enforcement prior to 
departure on any fishing trip on which ocean quahogs may be caught or 
landed. Once a vessel issued a Maine mahogany quahog permit has elected 
to participate in the Maine mahogany quahog fishery, the vessel must 
keep the VMS unit turned on and functioning as specified under Sec. 
648.9. Once a limited access Maine mahogany quahog permitted vessel has 
participated in the Maine mahogany quahog fishery, this exemption no 
longer applies.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (5) Mackerel, squid, and butterfish vessels. Any vessel of the 
United States, including party and charter vessels, must have been 
issued and carry on board a valid vessel permit to fish for, possess, or 
land Atlantic mackerel, squid, or butterfish in or from the EEZ.
    (i) Longfin squid/butterfish and Illex squid moratorium permits.
    (A) Eligibility. To be eligible to apply for a moratorium permit to 
fish for and retain longfin squid, butterfish, or Illex squid in excess 
of the incidental catch allowance in paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this 
section in the EEZ, a vessel must have been issued a longfin squid and 
butterfish moratorium permit or Illex squid moratorium permit, as 
applicable, for the preceding year, be replacing a vessel that was 
issued a moratorium permit for the preceding year, or be replacing a 
vessel that was issued a confirmation of permit history.
    (B) Application/renewal restriction. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of 
this section.
    (C) Qualification restriction. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(C) of this 
section.
    (D) Change in ownership. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(D) of this section.
    (E) Replacement vessels. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(E) of this section.
    (F) Upgraded vessel. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(F) of this section.
    (G) Consolidation restriction. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(G) of this 
section.
    (H) Vessel baseline specifications. See paragraph (a)(3)(i)(H) of 
this section.
    (I) [Reserved]
    (J) Confirmation of permit history. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(J) of 
this section.
    (K) Abandonment or voluntary relinquishment of permits. See 
paragraph (a)(1)(i)(K) of this section.
    (L) Restriction on permit splitting. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(L) of 
this section.
    (ii) Squid/butterfish incidental catch permit. Any vessel of the 
United States may obtain a permit to fish for or retain up to 2,500 lb 
(1.13 mt) of longfin squid or butterfish, or up to 10,000 lb (4.54 mt) 
of Illex squid, as an incidental catch in another directed fishery. The 
incidental catch allowance may be revised by the Regional Administrator 
based upon a recommendation by the Council following the procedure set 
forth in Sec. 648.22.
    (iii) Limited access Atlantic mackerel permits. (A) Vessel size 
restriction. A vessel of the United States is eligible for and may be 
issued an Atlantic mackerel permit to fish for, possess, or land 
Atlantic mackerel in or from the EEZ, except for any vessel that is 
greater than or equal to 165 ft (50.3 m) in length overall (LOA), or 
greater than 750 gross registered tons (680.4 mt), or the vessel's total 
main propulsion machinery

[[Page 481]]

is greater than 3,000 horsepower. Vessels that exceed the size or 
horsepower restrictions may seek to obtain an at-sea processing permit 
specified in Sec. 648.6(a)(2)(i).
    (B) Limited access mackerel permits. A vessel of the United States 
that fishes for, possesses, or lands more than 20,000 lb (7.46 mt) of 
mackerel per trip, except vessels that fish exclusively in state waters 
for mackerel, must have been issued and carry on board one of the 
limited access mackerel permits described in paragraphs 
(a)(5)(iii)(B)(1) through (3) of this section, including both vessels 
engaged in pair trawl operations.
    (1) Tier 1 Limited Access Mackerel Permit. A vessel may fish for, 
possess, and land mackerel not subject to a trip limit, provided the 
vessel qualifies for and has been issued this permit, subject to all 
other regulations of this part.
    (2) Tier 2 Limited Access Mackerel Permit. A vessel may fish for, 
possess, and land up to 135,000 lb (50 mt) of mackerel per trip, 
provided the vessel qualifies for and has been issued this permit, 
subject to all other regulations of this part.
    (3) Tier 3 Limited Access Mackerel Permit. A vessel may fish for, 
possess, and land up to 100,000 lb (37.3 mt) of mackerel per trip, 
provided the vessel qualifies for and has been issued this permit, 
subject to all other regulations of this part.
    (C) Eligibility criteria for mackerel permits. A vessel is eligible 
for and may be issued a Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3 Limited Access 
Mackerel Permit if it meets the permit history criteria in paragraph 
(a)(5)(iii)(C)(1) of this section and the relevant landings requirements 
specified in paragraphs (a)(5)(iii)(C)(2) through (4) of this section. 
The permit criteria and landings requirement must either be derived from 
the same vessel, or joined on a vessel through replacement prior to 
March 21, 2007.
    (1) Permit history criteria for Limited Access Mackerel Permits. (i) 
The vessel must have been issued a Federal mackerel permit that was 
valid as of March 21, 2007. The term ``as of'' means that the vessel 
must have had a valid mackerel permit on March 21, 2007.
    (ii) The vessel is replacing a vessel that was issued a Federal 
mackerel permit that was valid as of March 21, 2007. To qualify as a 
replacement vessel, the replacement vessel and the vessel being replaced 
must both be owned by the same vessel owner; or if the vessel being 
replaced was sunk or destroyed, the vessel owner must have owned the 
vessel being replaced at the time it sunk or was destroyed; or, if the 
vessel being replaced was sold to another person, the vessel owner must 
provide a copy of a written agreement between the buyer of the vessel 
being replaced and the owner/seller of the vessel, documenting that the 
vessel owner/seller retained the mackerel permit and all mackerel 
landings history.
    (iii) If the vessel sank, was destroyed, or was transferred before 
March 21, 2007, and a mackerel permit was not issued to a replacement 
vessel as of March 21, 2007, the permit issuance criteria may be 
satisfied if the vessel was issued a valid Federal mackerel permit at 
any time between March 21, 2006, and March 21, 2007.
    (2) Landings criteria for Limited Access Mackerel Permits. (i) Tier 
1. The vessel must have landed at least 400,000 lb (149.3 mt) of 
mackerel in any one calendar year between January 1, 1997, and December 
31, 2005, as verified by dealer reports submitted to NMFS or documented 
through valid dealer receipts, if dealer reports were not required by 
NMFS. The owners of vessels that fished in pair trawl operations may 
provide landings information as specified in paragraph 
(a)(5)(iii)(C)(2)(iv) of this section. Landings made by a vessel that is 
being replaced may be used to qualify a replacement vessel consistent 
with the requirements specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii)(C)(1)(ii) of 
this section.
    (ii) Tier 2. The vessel must have landed at least 100,000 lb (37.3 
mt) of mackerel in any one calendar year between March 1, 1994, and 
December 31, 2005, as verified by dealer reports submitted to NMFS or 
documented through valid dealer receipts, if dealer reports were not 
required by NMFS. The owners of vessels that fished in pair trawl 
operations may provide landings information as specified in paragraph

[[Page 482]]

(a)(5)(iii)(C)(2)(iv) of this section. Landings made by a vessel that is 
being replaced may be used to qualify a replacement vessel consistent 
with the requirements specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii)(C)(1)(ii) of 
this section.
    (iii) Tier 3. The vessel must have landed at least 1,000 lb (0.4 mt) 
of mackerel in any one calendar year between March 1, 1994, and December 
31, 2005, as verified by dealer reports submitted to NMFS or documented 
through valid dealer receipts, if dealer reports were not required by 
NMFS. The owners of vessels that fished in pair trawl operations may 
provide landings information as specified in paragraph 
(a)(5)(iii)(C)(2)(iv) of this section. Landings made by a vessel that is 
being replaced may be used to qualify a replacement vessel consistent 
with the requirements specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii)(C)(1)(ii) of 
this section.
    (iv) Landings criteria for vessels using landings from pair trawl 
operations. To qualify for a limited access permit using landings from 
pair trawl operations, the owners of the vessels engaged in that 
operation must agree on how to divide such landings between the two 
vessels and apply for the permit jointly, as supported by the required 
NMFS dealer reports or signed dealer receipts.
    (3) CPH. A person who does not currently own a fishing vessel, but 
owned a vessel that satisfies the permit eligibility requirement in 
paragraphs (a)(5)(iii)(B)(1) and (2) of this section that has sunk, been 
destroyed, or transferred to another person without its fishing and 
permit history, and that has not been replaced, may apply for and 
receive a CPH. A CPH allows for a replacement vessel to obtain the 
relevant limited access mackerel permit if the fishing and permit 
history of such vessel has been retained lawfully by the applicant as 
specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii)(C)(1)(ii) of this section. If the 
vessel sank, was destroyed, or was transferred before March 21, 2007, 
the permit issuance criteria may be satisfied if the vessel was issued a 
valid Federal mackerel permit at any time between March 21, 2006, and 
March 21, 2007.
    (D) Application/renewal restrictions. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of 
this section. Applications for a limited access mackerel permit 
described in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section must be postmarked no 
later than February 28, 2013. Applications for limited access mackerel 
permits that are not postmarked before February 28, 2013, will not be 
processed because of this regulatory restriction, and returned to the 
sender with a letter explaining the reason for its return.
    (E) Qualification restrictions. (1) See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(C) of 
this section. The following restrictions in paragraphs (a)(5)(iii)(E)(2) 
and (3) of this section are applicable to limited access mackerel 
permits.
    (2) Mackerel landings history generated by separate owners of a 
single vessel at different times during the qualification period for 
limited access mackerel permits may be used to qualify more than one 
vessel, provided that each owner applying for a limited access mackerel 
permit demonstrates that he/she created distinct fishing histories, that 
such histories have been retained, and if the vessel was sold, that each 
applicant's eligibility and fishing history is distinct. In such a case, 
each applicant would still need to have been issued a valid mackerel 
permit as of March 21, 2007, in order to create a full eligibility, as 
detailed in paragraph (a)(5)(iii)(C) of this section.
    (3) A vessel owner applying for a limited access mackerel permit who 
sold or transferred a vessel with non-mackerel limited access permits, 
as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(D) of this section, and retained 
only the mackerel permit and landings history of such vessel as 
specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(D) of this section, before April 3, 
2009, may use the mackerel history to qualify a different vessel for the 
initial limited access mackerel permit, regardless of whether the 
history from the sold or transferred vessel was used to qualify for any 
other limited access permit. Such eligibility may be used if the vessel 
for which the initial limited access mackerel permit has been submitted 
meets the upgrade restrictions described at paragraph (a)(5)(iii)(H) of 
this section. Applicants must be able to provide baseline documentation 
for both vessels in order to be eligible to use this provision.

[[Page 483]]

    (F) Change of ownership. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(D) of this section.
    (G) Replacement vessels. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(E) of this section.
    (H) Vessel baseline specification. (1) In addition to the baseline 
specifications specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(H) of this section, the 
volumetric fish hold capacity of a vessel at the time it was initially 
issued a Tier 1 or Tier 2 limited access mackerel permit will be 
considered a baseline specification. The fish hold capacity measurement 
must be certified by an individual credentialed as a Certified Marine 
Surveyor with a fishing specialty by the National Association of Marine 
Surveyors (NAMS) or from an individual credentialed as an Accredited 
Marine Surveyor with a fishing specialty by the Society of Accredited 
Marine Surveyors (SAMS). Vessels that are sealed by the Maine State 
Sealer of Weights and Measures will also be deemed to meet this 
requirement. Owners whose vessels qualify for a Tier 1 or Tier 2 
mackerel permit must submit a certified fish hold capacity measurement 
to NMFS by December 31, 2012, or with the first vessel replacement 
application after a vessel qualifies for a Tier 1 or Tier 2 mackerel 
permit, whichever is sooner.
    (2) If a mackerel CPH is initially issued, the vessel that provided 
the CPH eligibility establishes the size baseline against which future 
vessel size limitations shall be evaluated, unless the applicant has a 
vessel under contract prior to the submission of the mackerel limited 
access application. The replacement application to move permits onto the 
contracted vessel must be received by December 31, 2013. If the vessel 
that established the CPH is less than 20 ft (6.09 m) in length overall, 
then the baseline specifications associated with other limited access 
permits in the CPH suite will be used to establish the mackerel baseline 
specifications. If the vessel that established the CPH is less than 20 
ft (6.09 m) in length overall, the limited access mackerel eligibility 
was established on another vessel, and there are no other limited access 
permits in the CPH suite, then the applicant must submit valid 
documentation of the baseline specifications of the vessel that 
established the eligibility. The hold capacity baseline for such vessels 
will be the hold capacity of the first replacement vessel after the 
permits are removed from CPH. Hold capacity for the replacement vessel 
must be measured pursuant to paragraph (a)(5)(iii)(H)(1) of this 
section.
    (I) Upgraded vessel. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(F) of this section. In 
addition, for Tier 1 and Tier 2 limited access mackerel permits, the 
replacement vessel's volumetric fish hold capacity may not exceed by 
more than 10 percent the volumetric fish hold capacity of the vessel's 
baseline specifications. The modified fish hold, or the fish hold of the 
replacement vessel, must be resurveyed by a surveyor (accredited as in 
paragraph (a)(5)(iii)(H) of this section) unless the replacement vessel 
already had an appropriate certification.
    (J) Consolidation restriction. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(G) of this 
section.
    (K) Confirmation of permit history. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(J) of 
this section.
    (L) Abandonment or voluntary relinquishment of permits. See 
paragraph (a)(1)(i)(K) of this section.
    (M) Appeal of permit denial. (1) Eligibility. Any applicant eligible 
to apply for a limited access mackerel permit who is denied such permit 
may appeal the denial to the Regional Administrator within 30 days of 
the notice of denial.
    (2) Appeal review. Applicants have two opportunities to appeal the 
denial of a limited access mackerel permit. The review of initial 
appeals will be conducted under the authority of the Regional 
Administrator at NMFS's Northeast Regional Office. The Regional 
Administrator shall appoint a hearing officer for review of second 
denial appeals.
    (i) An appeal of the denial of an initial permit application (first 
level of appeal) must be made in writing to NMFS Northeast Regional 
Administrator. Appeals must be based on the grounds that the information 
used by the Regional Administrator in denying the permit was incorrect. 
The only items subject to appeal are the accuracy of the amount of 
landings, and the correct assignment of landings to a vessel and/or 
permit holder. Appeals

[[Page 484]]

must be submitted to the Regional Administrator, postmarked no later 
than 30 days after the denial of an initial limited access mackerel 
permit application. The appeal shall set forth the basis for the 
applicant's belief that the Regional Administrator's decision was made 
in error. The appeal must be in writing, must state the specific grounds 
for the appeal, and include information to support the appeal. The 
appellant may also request a letter of authorization (LOA), as described 
in paragraph (a)(5)(iii)(M)(3) of this section. If the appeal of the 
denial of the permit application is not made within 30 days, the denial 
of the permit application shall constitute the final decision of the 
Department of Commerce. The appeal will not be reviewed without 
submission of information in support of the appeal. The Regional 
Administrator will appoint a designee to make the initial decision on 
the appeal.
    (ii) Should the appeal of the denial of the permit application be 
denied, the applicant may request a hearing to review the Regional 
Administrator's initial decision denying the first level appeal (second 
level of appeal). Such a request must be in writing, postmarked no later 
than 30 days after the appeal decision, must state the specific grounds 
for the hearing request, and must include information to support the 
hearing request. If the request for a hearing to review of the decision 
denying the first level of appeal is not made within 30 days, the 
initial decision will constitute the final decision of the Department of 
Commerce. If the hearing request is submitted without information in 
support of the request, the appeal will not be reviewed in a hearing, 
and the initial decision will constitute the final decision of the 
Department of Commerce. The Regional Administrator will appoint a 
hearing officer or the hearing process may take place within the 
National Appeals program. The hearing officer shall make findings and a 
recommendation to the Regional Administrator, which shall be advisory 
only. The Regional Administrator's decision is the final decision of the 
Department of Commerce.
    (3) A vessel denied a limited access mackerel permit may fish for 
mackerel while the decision on the appeal is pending within NMFS, 
provided that the denial has been appealed, the appeal is pending, and 
the vessel has on board a letter from the Regional Administrator 
authorizing the vessel to fish under the limited access category for 
which the applicant has submitted an appeal. A request for an LOA must 
be made when submitting an appeal of the denial of the permit 
application. The Regional Administrator will issue such a letter for the 
pending period of any appeal. The LOA must be carried on board the 
vessel. If the appeal is finally denied, the Regional Administrator 
shall send a notice of final denial to the vessel owner; the authorizing 
letter becomes invalid 5 days after the receipt of the notice of denial, 
but no later than 10 days from the date of the letter of denial.
    (iv) Atlantic mackerel incidental catch permits. Any vessel of the 
United States may obtain a permit to fish for or retain up to 20,000 lb 
(7.46 mt) of Atlantic mackerel as an incidental catch in another 
directed fishery, provided that the vessel does not exceed the size 
restrictions specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii)(A) of this section. The 
incidental catch allowance may be revised by the Regional Administrator 
based upon a recommendation by the Council following the procedure set 
forth in Sec. 648.21.
    (v) Party and charter boat permits. The owner of any party or 
charter boat must obtain a permit to fish for, possess, or retain in or 
from the EEZ mackerel, squid, or butterfish while carrying passengers 
for hire.
    (6) Scup vessels. Beginning on January 1, 1997, and subject to the 
eligibility requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(6)(i) and 
(a)(6)(ii) of this section, the owner of a vessel of the United States, 
including a party or charter vessel, must obtain a permit issued under 
this part to fish for or retain scup for sale, barter or trade, in or 
from the EEZ north of 35[deg]15.3[min] N. lat. Any vessel, other than a 
party or charter boat, that observes the possession limit restrictions 
established pursuant to, and the prohibition on sale specified in, Sec. 
648.128 is exempt from the permit requirement.

[[Page 485]]

    (i) Moratorium permit--(A) Eligibility. To be eligible to apply for 
a moratorium permit to fish for and retain scup, a vessel must have been

    (10) Atlantic herring vessels--(i) Except as provided herein, any 
vessel of the United States must have been issued and have on board a 
valid Atlantic herring permit to fish for, possess, or land Atlantic 
herring in or from the EEZ. This requirement does not apply to the 
following:
    (A) A vessel that possesses herring solely for its use as bait, 
providing the vessel does not use or have on board purse seine, mid-
water trawl, pelagic gillnet, sink gillnet, or bottom trawl gear on any 
trip in which herring is fished for, possessed, or landed, and does not 
transfer, sell, trade, or barter such herring;
    (B) A skiff or other similar craft used exclusively to deploy the 
net in a purse seine operation during a fishing trip of a vessel that is

[[Page 488]]

vessel. The letter of authorization exempts such a vessel from the VMS 
and IVR vessel reporting requirements as specified in Sec. 648.7 and 
subpart K of this part, except as otherwise required by this part. An 
Atlantic herring carrier vessel must request and obtain a letter of 
authorization from the Regional Administrator, and must report all 
herring carried from each vessel on a given trip in its Fishing Vessel 
Trip Report. The Fishing Vessel Trip Report must include the vessel 
name. Carrier vessels under a letter of authorization may not conduct 
fishing activities except for purposes of transport or possess any 
fishing gear on board the vessel; must be used exclusively as an 
Atlantic herring carrier vessel; and must carry observers if required by 
NMFS. There is a minimum enrollment period of 7 calendar days. While 
operating under a valid LOA, such vessels are exempt from any herring 
possession limits associated with the herring vessel permit categories. 
Herring carrier vessels under an LOA may not possess, transfer, or land 
any species except for Atlantic herring, except that they may possess 
Northeast multispecies transferred by vessels issued either an All Areas 
Limited Access Herring Permit and/or an Areas 2 and 3 Limited Access 
Herring Permit, consistent with the applicable possession limits for 
such vessels.

<ls-thn-eq> 750 GRT (680.4 mt), or the vessel's total main propulsion 
machinery is <ls-thn-eq> 3,000 horsepower. Vessels that exceed the size 
or horsepower restrictions are eligible to be issued an at-sea 
processing permit specified under Sec. 648.6(a)(2)(ii).
    (iv) Limited access herring permits. (A) A vessel of the United 
States that fishes for, possesses, or lands more than 6,600 lb (3 mt) of 
herring, except vessels that fish exclusively in state waters for 
herring, must have been issued and carry on board one of the limited 
access herring permits described in paragraphs (a)(10)(iv)(A)(1)-(3) of 
this section, including both vessels engaged in pair trawl operations.
    (1) All Areas Limited Access Herring Permit. A vessel may fish for, 
possess, and land unlimited amounts of herring from all herring areas, 
provided the vessel qualifies for and has been issued this permit, 
subject to all other regulations of this part.
    (2) Areas 2 and 3 Limited Access Herring Permit. A vessel may fish 
for, possess, and land unlimited amounts of herring from herring Areas 2 
and 3, provided the vessel qualifies for and has been issued this 
permit, subject to all other regulations of this part.
    (3) Limited Access Incidental Catch Herring Permit. (i) A vessel 
that does not qualify for either of the permits specified in paragraphs 
(a)(10)(iv)(A)(1) and (2) of this section may fish for, possess, and 
land up to 55,000 lb (25 mt) of herring from any herring area, provided 
the vessel qualifies for and has been issued this permit, subject to all 
other regulations of this part.
    (ii) A vessel that does not qualify for an All Areas Limited Access 
Herring Permit specified in paragraph (a)(10)(iv)(A)(1) of this section, 
but qualifies for the Areas 2 and 3 Limited Access Herring Permit 
specified in paragraph (a)(10)(iv)(A)(2) of this section, may fish for, 
possess, and land up to 55,000 lb (25 mt) of herring from Area 1, 
provided the vessel qualifies for and has been issued this permit, 
subject to all other regulations of this part.
    (B) Eligibility for All Areas and Areas 2 and 3 Limited Access 
Herring Permits, and Confirmation of Permit History (CPH). A vessel is 
eligible for and may be issued either an All Areas or Areas 2 and 3 
Limited Access Herring Permit if it meets the permit history criteria in 
paragraph (a)(10)(iv)(B)(1) of this section and the relevant landing 
requirements in paragraphs (a)(10)(iv)(B)(2) and (3) of this section.
    (1) Permit history criteria for All Areas and Areas 2 and 3 Permits. 
(i) The vessel must have been issued a Federal herring permit (Category 
1 or 2) that was valid as of November 10, 2005; or
    (ii) The vessel is replacing a vessel that was issued a Federal 
herring permit (Category 1 or 2) between November 10, 2003, and November 
9, 2005. To

[[Page 489]]

qualify as a replacement vessel, the replacement vessel and the vessel 
being replaced must both be owned by the same vessel owner; or, if the 
vessel being replaced was sunk or destroyed, the vessel owner must have 
owned the vessel being replaced at the time it sunk or was destroyed; 
or, if the vessel being replaced was sold to another person, the vessel 
owner must provide a copy of a written agreement between the buyer of 
the vessel being replaced and the owner/seller of the vessel, 
documenting that the vessel owner/seller retained the herring permit and 
all herring landings history.
    (2) Landings criteria for the All Areas Limited Access Herring 
Permit-(i) The vessel must have landed at least 500 mt of herring in any 
one calendar year between January 1, 1993, and December 31, 2003, as 
verified by dealer reports submitted to NMFS or documented through valid 
dealer receipts, if dealer reports were not required by NMFS. In those 
cases where a vessel has sold herring but there are no required dealer 
receipts, e.g., transfers of bait at sea and border transfers, the 
vessel owner can submit other documentation that documents such 
transactions and proves that the herring thus transferred should be 
added to their landings history. The owners of vessels that fished in 
pair trawl operations may provide landings information as specified in 
paragraph (a)(10)(iv)(B)(2)(iii) of this section. Landings made by a 
vessel that is being replaced may be used to qualify a replacement 
vessel consistent with the requirements specified in paragraph 
(a)(10)(iv)(B)(1)(ii) of this section and the permit splitting 
prohibitions in paragraph (a)(10)(iv)(N) of this section.
    (ii) Extension of eligibility period for landings criteria for 
vessels under construction, reconstruction, or purchase contract. An 
applicant who submits written evidence that a vessel was under 
construction, reconstruction, or was under written contract for purchase 
as of December 31, 2003, may extend the period for determining landings 
specified in paragraph (a)(10)(iv)(B)(2)(i) of this section through 
December 31, 2004.
    (iii) Landings criteria for vessels using landings from pair trawl 
operations. To qualify for a limited access permit using landings from 
pair trawl operations, the owners of the vessels engaged in that 
operation must agree on how to divide such landings between the two 
vessels and apply for the permit jointly, as verified by dealer reports 
submitted to NMFS or valid dealer receipts, if dealer reports were not 
required by NMFS.
    (3) Landings criteria for the Areas 2 and 3 Limited Access Herring 
Permit. (i) The vessel must have landed at least 250 mt of herring in 
any one calendar year between January 1, 1993, and December 31, 2003, as 
verified by dealer reports submitted to NMFS or documented through valid 
dealer receipts, if dealer reports were not required by NMFS. In those 
cases where a vessel has sold herring but there are no required dealer 
receipts, e.g., transfers of bait at sea and border transfers, the 
vessel owner can submit other documentation that documents such 
transactions and proves that the herring thus transferred should be 
added to their landings history. The owners of vessels that fished in 
pair trawl operations may provide landings information as specified in 
paragraph (a)(10)(iv)(B)(2)(iii) of this section. Landings made by a 
vessel that is being replaced may be used to qualify a replacement 
vessel consistent with the requirements specified in paragraph 
(a)(10)(iv)(B)(1)(ii) of this section and the permit splitting 
prohibitions in paragraph (a)(10)(iv)(N) of this section.
    (ii) Extension of eligibility period for landings criteria for 
vessels under construction, reconstruction or purchase contract. An 
applicant who submits written evidence that a vessel was under 
construction, reconstruction, or was under written contract for purchase 
as of December 31, 2003, may extend the period for determining landings 
specified in paragraph (a)(10)(iv)(B)(3)(i) of this section through 
December 31, 2004.
    (iii) Landings criteria for vessels using landings from pair trawl 
operations. See paragraph (a)(10)(iv)(B)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (4) CPH. A person who does not currently own a fishing vessel, but 
owned a vessel that satisfies the permit eligibility requirements in 
paragraph (a)(10)(iv)(B) of this section that has

[[Page 490]]

sunk, been destroyed, or transferred to another person, but that has not 
been replaced, may apply for and receive a CPH that allows for a 
replacement vessel to obtain the relevant limited access herring permit 
if the fishing and permit history of such vessel has been retained 
lawfully by the applicant as specified in paragraph 
(a)(10)(iv)(B)(1)(ii) of this section and consistent with (a)(10)(iv)(N) 
of this section.
    (C) Eligibility for Incidental Catch Limited Access Herring Permit, 
and CPH. A vessel is eligible for and may be issued an Incidental 
Limited Access Herring Permit if it meets the permit history criteria 
specified in paragraph (a)(10)(iv)(C)(1) of this section and the 
landings criteria in paragraph (a)(10)(iv)(C)(2) of this section.
    (1) Permit history criteria. (i) The vessel must have been issued a 
Federal permit for Northeast multispecies, Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic 
herring, longfin or Illex squid, or butterfish that was valid as of 
November 10, 2005; or
    (ii) The vessel is replacing a vessel that was issued a Federal 
permit for Northeast multispecies, Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic herring, 
longfin or Illex squid, or butterfish that was issued between November 
10, 2003, and November 9, 2005. To qualify as a replacement vessel, the 
replacement vessel and the vessel being replaced must both be owned by 
the same vessel owner; or, if the vessel being replaced was sunk or 
destroyed, the vessel owner must have owned the vessel being replaced at 
the time it sunk or was destroyed; or, if the vessel being replaced was 
sold to another person, the vessel owner must provide a copy of a 
written agreement between the buyer of the vessel being replaced and the 
owner/seller of the vessel, documenting that the vessel owner/seller 
retained the herring permit and all herring landings history.
    (2) Landings criteria for Incidental Catch Limited Access Herring 
Permit. (i) The vessel must have landed at least 15 mt of herring in any 
calendar year between January 1, 1988, and December 31, 2003, as 
verified by dealer reports submitted to NMFS or documented through valid 
dealer receipts, if dealer reports were not required by NMFS. In those 
cases where a vessel has sold herring but there are no required dealer 
receipts, e.g., transfers of bait at sea and border transfers, the 
vessel owner can submit other documentation that documents such 
transactions and proves that the herring thus transferred should be 
added to the vessel's landings history. The owners of vessels that 
fished in pair trawl operations may provide landings information as 
specified in paragraph (a)(10)(iv)(B)(2)(iii) of this section. Landings 
made by a vessel that is being replaced may be used to qualify a 
replacement vessel consistent with the requirements specified in 
paragraph (a)(10)(iv)(B)(1)(ii) of this section and the permit splitting 
prohibitions in paragraph (a)(10)(iv)(N) of this section.
    (ii) Extension of eligibility period for landings criteria for 
vessels under construction, reconstruction or purchase contract. An 
applicant who submits written evidence that a vessel was under 
construction, reconstruction, or was under written contract for purchase 
as of December 31, 2003, may extend the period for determining landings 
specified in paragraph (a)(10)(iv)(C)(2)(i) of this section through 
December 31, 2004.
    (3) CPH. A person who does not currently own a fishing vessel, but 
owned a vessel that satisfies the permit eligibility requirements in 
paragraph (a)(10)(iv)(C) of this section that has sunk, been destroyed, 
or transferred to another person, but that has not been replaced, may 
apply for and receive a CPH that allows for a replacement vessel to 
obtain the relevant limited access herring permit if the fishing and 
permit history of such vessel has been retained lawfully by the 
applicant as specified in paragraph (a)(10)(iv)(B)(1)(ii) of this 
section and consistent with (a)(10)(iv)(N) of this section.
    (D) Application/renewal restrictions. (1) No one may apply for an 
initial limited access Atlantic herring permit or a CPH under paragraph 
(a)(10)(iv)(L) of this section after May 31, 2008, or after the 
abandonment or voluntary relinquishment of permit history as specified 
in paragraph (a)(10)(iv)(M) of this section.
    (2) An applicant who submits written proof that an eligible vessel 
was sold,

[[Page 491]]

with the seller retaining the herring history through a written 
agreement signed by both parties to the sale or transfer, may not 
utilize such history if the vessel's history was used to qualify another 
vessel for another limited access permit.
    (3) All limited access permits established under this section must 
be issued on an annual basis by April 30, the last day of the year for 
which the permit is issued, unless a CPH has been issued as specified in 
paragraph (a)(10)(iv)(L) of this section. Application for such permits 
must be received no later than March 31, which is 30 days before the 
last day of the permit year. Failure to renew a limited access permit in 
any fishing year bars the renewal of the permit in subsequent years.
    (E) Qualification restriction. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(C) of this 
section.
    (F) Change in ownership. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(D) of this section.
    (G) Replacement vessels. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(E) of this section.
    (H) Upgraded vessel. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(F) of this section.
    (I) Consolidation restriction. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(G) of this 
section.
    (J) Vessel baseline specifications. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(H) of 
this section. If a herring CPH is initially issued, the vessel that 
provided the CPH eligibility establishes the size baseline against which 
future vessel size limitations shall be evaluated.
    (K) Limited access permit restrictions. [Reserved]
    (L) Confirmation of Permit History. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(J) of 
this section.
    (M) Abandonment or voluntary relinquishment of permits. See 
paragraph (a)(1)(i)(K) of this section.
    (N) Restriction on permit splitting. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(L) of 
this section. Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1)(i)(L), vessel owners 
applying for a limited access herring permit who sold vessels with 
limited access permits and retained the herring history before applying 
for the initial limited access herring permit may not use the herring 
history to qualify a vessel for the initial limited access herring 
permit, if the issuance of such permit would violate the restrictions on 
permit splitting. Furthermore, notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1)(i)(L), 
for the purposes of the Atlantic herring fishery, herrings landings 
history generated by separate owners of a single vessel at different 
times may be used the qualify more than one vessel, provided that each 
owner applying for a limited access permit, demonstrates that he/she 
created distinct fishing histories, and that such histories have been 
retained.
    (O) Appeal of denial of permit-(1) Eligibility. Any applicant 
eligible to apply for a limited access herring permit who is denied such 
permit may appeal the denial to the Regional Administrator within 30 
days of the notice of denial. Any such appeal may only be based on the 
grounds that the information used by the Regional Administrator was 
based on incorrect data. The appeal must be in writing, and must state 
the specific grounds for the appeal.
    (2) Appeal review. The Regional Administrator shall appoint a 
designee who shall make the initial decision on the appeal. The 
appellant may request a review of the initial decision by the Regional 
Administrator by so requesting in writing within 30 days of the notice 
of the initial decision. If the appellant does not request a review of 
the initial decision within 30 days, the initial decision is the final 
administrative action of the Department of Commerce. Such review will be 
conducted by a hearing officer appointed by the Regional Administrator. 
The hearing officer shall make findings and a recommendation to the 
Regional Administrator, which shall be advisory only. Upon receiving the 
findings and the recommendation, the Regional Administrator shall issue 
a final decision on the appeal. The Regional Administrator's decision is 
the final administrative action of the Department of Commerce.
    (3) Status of vessels pending appeal. A vessel denied a limited 
access herring permit may fish under the limited access herring permit, 
provided that the denial has been appealed, the appeal is pending, and 
the vessel has on board a letter from the Regional Administrator 
authorizing the vessel to fish under the limited access category. The 
Regional Administrator shall issue such a letter for the pendency of any 
appeal. The letter of authorization must be carried

[[Page 492]]

on board the vessel. If the appeal is finally denied, the Regional 
Administrator shall send a notice of final denial to the vessel owner; 
the authorizing letter becomes invalid 5 days after receipt of the 
notice of denial, but no later than 10 days from the date of the letter 
of denial.
    (v) Open access herring permit. A vessel that has not been issued a 
limited access Atlantic herring permit may obtain an open access 
incidental Atlantic herring permit to possess up to 6,600 lb (3 mt) of 
herring per trip, and is limited to one landing per calendar day.
    (11) Spiny dogfish vessels. Any vessel of the United States that 
commercially fishes for, possesses, or lands spiny dogfish in or from 
the EEZ must have been issued and carry on board a valid commercial 
spiny dogfish vessel permit.
    (12) Tilefish vessels. Any vessel of the United States must have 
been issued, under this part, and carry on board, a valid vessel permit 
to fish for, possess, or land tilefish, in or from the Tilefish 
Management Unit, and must fish under the authorization of a tilefish IFQ 
Allocation permit, issued pursuant to Sec. 648.294, to possess, or land 
tilefish in excess of the trip limit as specified under Sec. 648.295.
    (i) Party and charter vessel permits. Any party or charter vessel 
must have been issued, under this part, a Federal Charter/Party vessel 
permit to fish for tilefish in the Tilefish Management Unit, if it 
carries passengers for hire. Recreational fisherman fishing onboard such 
a vessel must observe the recreational possession limits as specified at 
Sec. 648.296 and the prohibition on sale.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (13) Red Crab vessels. Any vessel of the United States must have 
been issued and have on board a valid red crab vessel permit to fish 
for, catch, possess, transport, land, sell, trade, or barter, any red 
crab or red crab part in or from the EEZ portion of the Red Crab 
Management Unit.
    (i) Limited access red crab permit--(A) Eligibility. Any vessel of 
the United States that possesses or lands more than the incidental 
amount of red crab, as specified in Sec. 648.263(b), per red crab trip 
must have been issued and carry on board a valid limited access red crab 
permit.
    (B) Application/renewal restrictions. The provisions of paragraph 
(a)(1)(i)(B) of this section apply.
    (C) Qualification restrictions. The provisions of paragraph 
(a)(1)(i)(C) of this section apply.
    (D) Change in ownership. The provisions of paragraph (a)(1)(i)(D) of 
this section apply.
    (E) Replacement vessels. (1) To be eligible for a limited access 
permit under this section, the replacement vessel's length, GRT, and NT 
may not exceed by greater than 10 percent the length, GRT, and NT of the 
vessel's baseline specifications. The replacement vessel must also meet 
any other applicable criteria under paragraph (a)(13)(i)(F) of this 
section.
    (2) A vessel that lawfully replaced a vessel that meets the 
qualification criteria set forth in paragraph (a)(13)(i)(A) of this 
section may qualify for and fish under the permit category for which the 
replaced vessel qualified.
    (F) Upgraded vessel. A vessel may be upgraded, whether through 
refitting or replacement, and be eligible to retain or renew a limited 
access permit, provided that the vessel's length, GRT, and NT is 
increased no more than once. Any increase in any of the aforementioned 
specifications of vessel size may not exceed 10 percent of the vessel's 
baseline specifications, as applicable. If any increase in any of the 
aforementioned specifications of vessel size occurs, any increase in the 
other specifications must be performed at the same time.
    (G) Consolidation restriction. The provisions of paragraph 
(a)(1)(i)(G) of this section apply.
    (H) Vessel baseline specifications. The vessel baseline 
specifications in this section are the respective specifications 
(length, GRT, and NT) of the vessel indicated on the vessel's initial 
limited access permit as of the date the initial vessel applies for such 
permit.
    (I) Limited access permit restrictions. A vessel issued a limited 
access red crab permit may not be issued a red crab incidental catch 
permit during the same fishing year.

[[Page 493]]

    (J) Confirmation of permit history (CPH). Notwithstanding any other 
provisions of this part, a person who does not currently own a fishing 
vessel, but who has owned a qualifying vessel that has sunk, been 
destroyed, or transferred to another person and has not been replaced, 
must apply for and receive a CPH that confirms the fishing and permit 
history of such vessel has been retained lawfully by the applicant. To 
be eligible to obtain a CPH, the applicant must show that the qualifying 
vessel met the eligibility requirements, as applicable, in this part. 
Issuance of a valid CPH preserves the eligibility of the applicant to 
apply for a limited access permit for a replacement vessel based on the 
qualifying vessel's fishing and permit history at a subsequent time, 
subject to the replacement provisions specified in this section. If 
fishing privileges have been assigned or allocated previously under this 
part, based on the qualifying vessel's fishing and permit history, the 
CPH preserves such fishing privileges. A CPH must be applied for in 
order for the applicant to preserve the fishing rights and limited 
access eligibility of the qualifying vessel. An application for a CPH 
must be received by the Regional Administrator no later than 30 days 
prior to the end of the first full fishing year in which a vessel permit 
cannot be issued. Failure to do so is considered abandonment of the 
permit as described in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(K) of this section. A CPH 
issued under this part will remain valid until the fishing and permit 
history preserved by the CPH is used to qualify a replacement vessel for 
a limited access permit. Any decision regarding the issuance of a CPH 
for a qualifying vessel that has applied for or been issued previously a 
limited access permit is a final agency action subject to judicial 
review under 5 U.S.C. 704. Information requirements for the CPH 
application are the same as those for a limited access permit. Any 
request for information about the vessel on the CPH application form 
refers to the qualifying vessel that has been sunk, destroyed, or 
transferred. Vessel permit applicants who have been issued a CPH and who 
wish to obtain a vessel permit for a replacement vessel based upon the 
previous vessel history may do so pursuant to paragraph (a)(13)(i)(E) of 
this section.
    (K) Abandonment or voluntary relinquishment of permits. The 
provisions of paragraph (a)(1)(i)(K) of this section apply.
    (L) Restriction on permit splitting. The provisions of paragraph 
(a)(1)(i)(L) of this section apply.
    (ii) Red crab incidental catch permit. A vessel of the United States 
that is subject to these regulations and that has not been issued a red 
crab limited access permit is eligible for and may be issued a red crab 
incidental catch permit to catch, possess, transport, land, sell, trade, 
barter, up to 500 lb (226.8 kg) of red crab, or its equivalent as 
specified at Sec. 648.263(a)(2)(i) and (ii), per fishing trip in or 
from the Red Crab Management Unit. Such vessel is subject to the 
restrictions in Sec. 648.263(b).
    (14) Skate vessels. Any vessel of the United States must have been 
issued and have on board a valid skate vessel permit to fish for, 
possess, transport, sell, or land skates in or from the EEZ portion of 
the Skate Management Unit.
    (b) Permit conditions. (1)(i) Any person who applies for and is 
issued or renews a fishing permit under this section agrees, as a 
condition of the permit, that the vessel and the vessel's fishing 
activity, catch, and pertinent gear (without regard to whether such 
fishing occurs in the EEZ or landward of the EEZ; and without regard to 
where such fish or gear are possessed, taken, or landed); are subject to 
all requirements of this part, unless exempted from such requirements 
under this part. All such fishing activities, catch, and gear will 
remain subject to all applicable state requirements. Except as otherwise 
provided in this part, if a requirement of this part and a management 
measure required by a state or local law differ, any vessel owner 
permitted to fish in the EEZ for any species managed under this part, 
except tilefish, must comply with the more restrictive requirement. 
Except as otherwise provided in this part, if a requirement of this part 
and a management measure required by a state or local law differ, any 
vessel owner permitted to fish in the tilefish management unit for 
tilefish managed under this part must comply with the more restrictive

[[Page 494]]

requirement. Owners and operators of vessels fishing under the terms of 
a summer flounder moratorium, scup moratorium, or black sea bass 
moratorium; or a spiny dogfish or bluefish commercial vessel permit, 
must also agree not to land summer flounder, scup, black sea bass, spiny 
dogfish, or bluefish, respectively, in any state after NMFS has 
published a notification in the Federal Register stating that the 
commercial quota for that state or period has been harvested and that no 
commercial quota is available for the respective species. A state not 
receiving an allocation of summer flounder, scup, black sea bass, or 
bluefish, either directly or through a coast-wide allocation, is deemed 
to have no commercial quota available. Owners and operators of vessels 
fishing under the terms of the tilefish limited access permit must agree 
not to land tilefish after NMFS has published a notification in the 
Federal Register stating that the quota for the tilefish limited access 
category under which a vessel is fishing has been harvested. Owners or 
operators fishing for surfclams and ocean quahogs within waters under 
the jurisdiction of any state that requires cage tags are not subject to 
any conflicting Federal minimum size or tagging requirements. If a 
surfclam and ocean quahog requirement of this part differs from a 
surfclam and ocean quahog management measure required by a state that 
does not require cage tagging, any vessel owners or operators permitted 
to fish in the EEZ for surfclams and ocean quahogs must comply with the 
more restrictive requirement while fishing in state waters. However, 
surrender of a surfclam and ocean quahog vessel permit by the owner by 
certified mail addressed to the Regional Administrator allows an 
individual to comply with the less restrictive state minimum size 
requirement, as long as fishing is conducted exclusively within state 
waters.
    (ii) Any person who applies for or has been issued a limited access 
or moratorium permit on or after September 4, 2007 agrees, as a 
condition of the permit, that the vessel may not fish for, catch, 
possess, or land, in or from Federal or state waters, any species of 
fish authorized by the permit, unless and until the permit has been 
issued or renewed in any subsequent permit year, or the permit either 
has been voluntarily relinquished pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i)(K) of 
this section or otherwise forfeited, revoked, or transferred from the 
vessel.
    (2) A vessel that is issued or renewed a limited access or 
moratorium permit on or after September 4, 2007 for any fishery governed 
under this section is prohibited from fishing for, catching, possessing, 
and/or landing any fish for which the vessel would be authorized under 
the respective limited access or moratorium permit in or from state and/
or Federal waters in any subsequent permit year, unless and until the 
limited access or moratorium permit has been issued or renewed pursuant 
to paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section and the valid permit is on 
board the vessel. This prohibition does not apply to a vessel for which 
the limited access or moratorium permit has been voluntarily 
relinquished pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i)(K) of this section or 
otherwise forfeited, revoked, or transferred from the vessel.
    (c) Permit applications--(1) General. Applicants for a permit under 
this section must submit a completed application on an appropriate form 
obtained from the Regional Administrator. The application must be signed 
and submitted to the Regional Administrator at least 30 days before the 
date on which the applicant desires to have the permit made effective. 
The Regional Administrator will notify the applicant of any deficiency 
in the application pursuant to this section. Vessel owners who are 
eligible to apply for limited access or moratorium permits under this 
part shall provide information with the application sufficient for the 
Regional Administrator to determine whether the vessel meets the 
applicable eligibility requirements specified in this section.
    (2) Vessel permit information requirements. (i) An application for a 
permit issued under this section, in addition to the information 
specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, also must contain at 
least the following information, and any other information required by 
the Regional Administrator: Vessel name, owner name or name of

[[Page 495]]

the owner's authorized representative, mailing address, and telephone 
number; USCG documentation number and a copy of the vessel's current 
USCG documentation or, for a vessel not required to be documented under 
title 46 U.S.C., the vessel's state registration number and a copy of 
the current state registration; a copy of the vessel's current party/
charter boat license (if applicable), home port and principal port of 
landing, length overall, GRT, NT, engine horsepower, year the vessel was 
built, type of construction, type of propulsion, approximate fish hold 
capacity, type of fishing gear used by the vessel, number of crew, 
number of party or charter passengers licensed to be carried (if 
applicable), permit category, if the owner is a corporation, a copy of 
the current Certificate of Incorporation or other corporate papers 
showing the date of incorporation and the names of the current officers 
of the corporation, and the names and addresses of all shareholders 
owning 25 percent or more of the corporation's shares; if the owner is a 
partnership, a copy of the current Partnership Agreement and the names 
and addresses of all partners; if there is more than one owner, the 
names of all owners having a 25-percent interest or more; and permit 
number of any current or, if expired, previous Federal fishery permit 
issued to the vessel.
    (ii) An application for an initial limited access multispecies hook-
gear permit must also contain the following information:
    (A) If the engine horsepower was changed or a contract to change the 
engine horsepower had been entered into prior to July 1, 1996, such that 
it is different from that stated in the vessel's most recent application 
for a Federal fisheries permit before July 1, 1996, sufficient 
documentation to ascertain the different engine horsepower. However, the 
engine replacement must be completed within 1 year of the date on which 
the contract was signed.
    (B) If the length, GRT, or NT was changed or a contract to change 
the length, GRT, or NT had been entered into prior to July 1, 1996, such 
that it is different from that stated in the vessel's most recent 
application for a Federal fisheries permit, sufficient documentation to 
ascertain the different length, GRT, or NT. However, the upgrade must be 
completed within 1 year from the date on which the contract was signed.
    (iii) An application for a limited access NE multispecies permit 
must also contain the following information:
    (A) For vessels fishing for NE multispecies with gillnet gear, with 
the exception of vessels fishing under the Small Vessel permit category, 
an annual declaration as either a Day or Trip gillnet vessel designation 
as described in Sec. 648.82(j). A vessel owner electing a Day gillnet 
designation must indicate the number of gillnet tags that he/she is 
requesting, and must include a check for the cost of the tags, unless 
the vessel already possesses valid gillnet tags, as identified by the 
Regional Administrator. A permit holder letter will be sent to the owner 
of each eligible gillnet vessel, informing him/her of the costs 
associated with this tagging requirement and providing directions for 
obtaining valid tags. Once a vessel owner has elected this designation, 
he/she may not change the designation or fish under the other gillnet 
category for the remainder of the fishing year. Incomplete applications, 
as described in paragraph (e) of this section, will be considered 
incomplete only for the purposes of obtaining authorization to fish in 
the NE multispecies gillnet fishery and otherwise will be processed or 
issued without a gillnet authorization.
    (B) [Reserved]
    (iv) An application for a scallop permit must also contain the 
following information:
    (A) For every person named by applicants for limited access scallop 
permits pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the names of 
all other vessels in which that person has an ownership interest and for 
which a limited access scallop permit has been issued or applied for.
    (B) If applying for a VMS general scallop permit, or full-time or 
part-time limited access scallop permit, or if opting to use a VMS unit, 
a copy of the vendor installation receipt or proof of vendor activation 
of the VMS from a NMFS-approved VMS vendor. NMFS-

[[Page 496]]

approved vendors are described in Sec. 648.9.
    (C) If applying to fish under the small dredge program set forth 
under Sec. 648.51(e), an annual declaration into the program.
    (v) An application for a surf clam and ocean quahog permit must also 
contain the pump horsepower.
    (vi) Prior to issuance of a limited access Atlantic herring permit, 
a VMS unit provided by a NMFS-approved vendor must be installed and NMFS 
must receive a notice from the vendor that the VMS is activated.
    (vii) The owner of a vessel that has been issued a Tier 1 or Tier 2 
limited access mackerel must submit a volumetric fish hold certification 
measurement, as described in paragraph (a)(5)(iii)(H) of this section, 
with the permit renewal application for the 2013 fishing year.
    (d) Fees. The Regional Administrator may charge a fee to recover 
administrative expenses of issuing a permit required under this section. 
The amount of the fee is calculated in accordance with the procedures of 
the NOAA Finance Handbook, available from the Regional Administrator, 
for determining administrative costs of each special product or service. 
The fee may not exceed such costs and is specified with each application 
form. The appropriate fee must accompany each application; if it does 
not, the application will be considered incomplete for purposes of 
paragraph (e) of this section. Any fee paid by an insufficiently funded 
commercial instrument shall render any permit issued on the basis 
thereof null and void.
    (e) Issuance. (1) Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 
904, the Regional Administrator shall issue a permit within 30 days of 
receipt of the application, unless the application is deemed incomplete 
for the following reasons:
    (i) The applicant has failed to submit a complete application. An 
application is complete when all requested forms, information, 
documentation, and fees, if applicable, have been received and the 
applicant has submitted all applicable reports specified in Sec. 648.7;
    (ii) The application was not received by the Regional Administrator 
by the applicable deadline set forth in this section;
    (iii) The applicant and applicant's vessel failed to meet all 
applicable eligibility requirements set forth in this section;
    (iv) An applicant for a limited access multispecies combination 
vessel or individual DAS permit, a limited access scallop permit (except 
an occasional scallop permit), an LAGC scallop permit, or electing to 
use a VMS, has failed to meet all of the VMS requirements specified in 
Sec. Sec. 648.9 and 648.10; or
    (v) The applicant has failed to meet any other application 
requirements stated in this part.
    (2) Incomplete applications. Upon receipt of an incomplete or 
improperly executed application for any permit under this part, the 
Regional Administrator shall notify the applicant of the deficiency in 
the application. If the applicant fails to correct the deficiency within 
30 days following the date of notification, the application will be 
considered abandoned.
    (f) Change in permit information. Any change in the information 
specified in paragraphs (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section must be 
submitted by the applicant in writing to the Regional Administrator 
within 15 days of the change, or the permit is void.
    (g) Expiration. A permit expires upon the renewal date specified in 
the permit.
    (h) Duration. A permit will continue in effect unless it is revoked, 
suspended, or modified under 15 CFR part 904, or otherwise expires, or 
ownership changes, or the applicant has failed to report any change in 
the information on the permit application to the Regional Administrator 
as specified in paragraph (f) of this section. However, the Regional 
Administrator may authorize the continuation of a permit if the new 
owner so requests. Applications for permit continuations must be 
addressed to the Regional Administrator.
    (i) Alteration. Any permit that has been altered, erased, or 
mutilated is invalid.
    (j) Reissuance. A permit may be reissued by the Regional 
Administrator when requested in writing, stating the need for 
reissuance, the name of the

[[Page 497]]

vessel (if applicable), and the fishing permit number assigned. An 
application for the reissuance of a permit will not be considered a new 
application. The fee for a reissued permit shall be the same as for an 
initial permit.
    (k) Transfer. A permit issued under this part is not transferable or 
assignable. A permit will be valid only for the fishing vessel, owner 
and/or person for which it is issued.
    (l) Display. A vessel permit must be carried, at all times, on board 
the vessel for which it is issued and shall be subject to inspection 
upon request by any authorized officer. A person issued a permit under 
this section must be able to present the permit for inspection when 
requested by an authorized officer. Permits must be maintained in 
legible condition.
    (m) Sanctions. The Assistant Administrator may suspend, revoke, or 
modify, any permit issued or sought under this section. Procedures 
governing enforcement-related permit sanctions or denials are found at 
subpart D of 15 CFR part 904.
    (n) Federal grant awards. The Regional Administrator may suspend, 
cancel, fail to renew, modify, or otherwise rescind any Federal fishing 
vessel permit, issued pursuant to this section, including the rights 
thereto, held by a person, corporation, non-profit organization, or 
government entity if the terms and conditions of any Federal grant award 
used to obtain said permit, or an associated memorandum of understanding 
or agreement, are violated by the grant recipient.

<R05>
Sec. 648.5  Operator permits.

    (a) General. Any operator of a vessel fishing for or possessing: 
Atlantic sea scallops, NE multispecies, spiny dogfish, monkfish, 
Atlantic herring, Atlantic surfclam, ocean quahog, Atlantic mackerel, 
squid, butterfish, scup, black sea bass, or Atlantic bluefish, harvested 
in or from the EEZ; tilefish harvested in or from the EEZ portion of the 
Tilefish Management Unit; skates harvested in or from the EEZ portion of 
the Skate Management Unit; or Atlantic deep-sea red crab harvested in or 
from the EEZ portion of the Red Crab Management Unit, issued a permit, 
including carrier and processing permits, for these species under this 
part, must have been issued under this section, and carry on board, a 
valid operator permit. An operator's permit issued pursuant to part 622 
or part 697 of this chapter satisfies the permitting requirement of this 
section. This requirement does not apply to operators of recreational 
vessels.
    (b) Operator permit application. Applicants for a permit under this 
section must submit a completed application on an appropriate form 
provided by the Regional Administrator. The application must be signed 
by the applicant and submitted to the Regional Administrator at least 30 
days before the date upon which the applicant desires to have the permit 
made effective. The Regional Administrator will notify the applicant of 
any deficiency in the application, pursuant to this section.
    (c) Condition. Vessel operators who apply for an operator's permit 
under this section must agree as a condition of this permit that the 
operator and vessel's fishing, catch, crew size, and pertinent gear 
(without regard to whether such fishing occurs in the EEZ or landward of 
the EEZ, and without regard to where such fish or gear are possessed, 
taken, or landed) are subject to all requirements of this part while 
fishing in the EEZ or on board a vessel for which a permit is issued 
under Sec. 648.4, unless exempted from such requirements under Sec. 
648.12. The vessel and all such fishing, catch, and gear will remain 
subject to all applicable state or local requirements. Further, such 
operators must agree, as a condition of this permit, that, if the permit 
is suspended or revoked pursuant to 15 CFR part 904, the operator cannot 
be aboard any fishing vessel issued a Federal fisheries permit or any 
vessel subject to Federal fishing regulations while the vessel is at sea 
or engaged in offloading. If a requirement of this part and a management 
measure required by state or local law differ, any operator issued a 
permit under this part

[[Page 498]]

must comply with the more restrictive requirement.
    (d) Information requirements. An applicant must provide at least all 
the following information and any other information required by the 
Regional Administrator: Name, mailing address, and telephone number; 
date of birth; hair color; eye color; height; weight; and signature of 
the applicant. The applicant must also provide two recent (no more than 
1 year old), color, passport-size photographs.
    (e) Fees. Same as Sec. 648.4(d).
    (f) Issuance. Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 904, 
the Regional Administrator shall issue an operator's permit within 30 
days of receipt of a completed application, if the criteria specified 
herein are met. Upon receipt of an incomplete or improperly executed 
application, the Regional Administrator will notify the applicant of the 
deficiency in the application. If the applicant fails to correct the 
deficiency within 30 days following the date of notification, the 
application will be considered abandoned.
    (g) Expiration. Same as Sec. 648.4(g).
    (h) Duration. A permit is valid until it is revoked, suspended or 
modified under 15 CFR part 904, or otherwise expires, or the applicant 
has failed to report a change in the information on the permit 
application to the Regional Administrator as specified in paragraph (k) 
of this section.
    (i) Reissuance. Reissued permits, for otherwise valid permits, may 
be issued by the Regional Administrator when requested in writing by the 
applicant, stating the need for reissuance and the Federal operator 
permit number assigned. An applicant for a reissued permit must also 
provide two recent, color, passport-size photos of the applicant. An 
application for a reissued permit will not be considered a new 
application. An appropriate fee may be charged.
    (j) Transfer. Permits issued under this part are not transferable or 
assignable. A permit is valid only for the person to whom it is issued.
    (k) Change in permit application information. Notice of a change in 
the permit holder's name, address, or telephone number must be submitted 
in writing to, and received by, the Regional Administrator within 15 
days of the change in information. If written notice of the change in 
information is not received by the Regional Administrator within 15 
days, the permit is void.
    (l) Alteration. Same as Sec. 648.4(i).
    (m) Display. Any permit issued under this part must be maintained in 
legible condition and displayed for inspection upon request by any 
authorized officer or NMFS official.
    (n) Sanctions. Vessel operators with suspended or revoked permits 
may not be aboard a federally permitted fishing vessel in any capacity 
while the vessel is at sea or engaged in offloading. Procedures 
governing enforcement related permit sanctions and denials are found at 
subpart D of 15 CFR part 904.

Sec. 648.7  Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.

    (a) Dealers--(1) Detailed report. Federally permitted dealers, and 
any individual acting in the capacity of a dealer, must submit to the 
Regional Administrator or to the official designee a detailed report of 
all fish purchased or received for a commercial purpose, other than 
solely for transport on land, within the time period specified in 
paragraph (f) of this section, by one of the available electronic 
reporting mechanisms approved by NMFS, unless otherwise directed by the 
Regional Administrator. The following information, and any other 
information required by the Regional Administrator, must be provided in 
each report:
    (i) Required information. All dealers issued a dealer permit under 
this part must provide: Dealer name; dealer permit number; name and 
permit number or name and hull number (USCG documentation number or 
state registration number, whichever is applicable) of vessel(s) from 
which fish are purchased or received; trip identifier for each trip from 
which fish are purchased or received from a commercial fishing vessel 
permitted under this part; date(s) of purchases and receipts; units of 
measure and amount by species (by market category, if applicable); price 
per unit by species (by market category, if applicable) or total value 
by species (by market category, if applicable); port landed; cage tag 
numbers for surfclams and ocean quahogs, if applicable; disposition of 
the seafood product; and any other information deemed necessary by the 
Regional Administrator. If no fish are purchased or received during a 
reporting week, a report so stating must be submitted.
    (ii) Exceptions. The following exceptions apply to reporting 
requirements for dealers permitted under this part:
    (A) Inshore Exempted Species, as defined in Sec. 648.2, are not 
required to be reported under this part;
    (B) When purchasing or receiving fish from a vessel landing in a 
port located outside of the Northeast Region (Maine, New Hampshire, 
Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, 
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia and North Carolina), only 
purchases or receipts of species managed by the Northeast Region under 
this part, and American lobster, managed under part 697 of this chapter, 
must be reported. Other reporting requirements may apply to those 
species not managed by the Northeast Region, which are not affected by 
this provision; and
    (C) Dealers issued a permit for Atlantic bluefin tuna under part 635 
of this chapter are not required to report their purchases or receipts 
of Atlantic bluefin tuna under this part. Other reporting requirements, 
as specified in Sec. 635.5 of this chapter, apply to the receipt of 
Atlantic bluefin tuna.
    (iii) Dealer reporting requirements for skates. In addition to the 
requirements under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, dealers shall 
report the species of skates received. Species of skates shall be 
identified according to the following categories: Winter skate, little 
skate, little/winter skate, barndoor skate, smooth skate, thorny skate, 
clearnose skate, rosette skate, and unclassified skate. NMFS will 
provide dealers with a skate species identification guide.
    (2) System requirements. All persons required to submit reports 
under paragraph (a)(1) of this section are required to have the 
capability to transmit data via the Internet. To ensure compatibility 
with the reporting system and database, dealers are required to utilize 
a personal computer, in working condition, that meets the minimum 
specifications identified by NMFS. The affected public will be notified 
of the minimum specifications via a letter to all Federal dealer permit 
holders.
    (3) Annual report. All persons issued a permit under this part are 
required to submit the following information on an annual basis, on 
forms supplied by the Regional Administrator:
    (i) All dealers and processors issued a permit under this part must 
complete all sections of the Annual Processed Products Report for all 
species that were processed during the previous year. Reports must be 
submitted to the address supplied by the Regional Administrator.
    (ii) Surfclam and ocean quahog processors and dealers whose plant 
processing capacities change more than 10 percent during any year shall 
notify

[[Page 501]]

the Regional Administrator in writing within 10 days after the change.
    (iii) Atlantic herring processors, including processing vessels, 
must complete and submit all sections of the Annual Processed Products 
Report.
    (iv) Atlantic hagfish processors must complete and submit all 
sections of the Annual Processed Products Report.
    (4) Facilitation of a dockside/roving monitor report. Any federally 
permitted dealer, or any individual acting in the capacity of a dealer, 
that purchases or receives fish from a vessel operating under the 
provisions of an approved sector operations plan, as specified in Sec. 
648.87(c), or from a common pool vessel starting in fishing year 2012 
must provide a copy of any weigh-out documents or dealer receipts for 
that particular offloading event to the dockside/roving monitor and 
vessel and allow the dockside/roving monitor to sign a copy of the 
official weigh-out document or dealer receipt retained by the dealer, or 
sign a dockside monitoring report provided by a dockside/roving monitor 
that verifies the amount of each species offloaded, as instructed by the 
Regional Administrator.
    (b) Vessel owners or operators--(1) Fishing Vessel Trip Reports--(i) 
The owner or operator of any vessel issued a valid permit or eligible to 
renew a limited access permit under this part must maintain on board the 
vessel, and submit, an accurate fishing log report for each fishing 
trip, regardless of species fished for or taken, on forms supplied by or 
approved by the Regional Administrator. As stated in paragraph (f)(2)(i) 
of this section, if no fishing trip is made during a week or month, a 
report stating so must be submitted for each week or month, as 
applicable, based upon whether any fishing activity occurred during a 
particular reporting week or month (i.e., starting a trip, landing, or 
offloading catch will constitute fishing during a reporting week or 
month). If authorized in writing by the Regional Administrator, a vessel 
owner or operator may submit reports electronically, for example by 
using a VMS or other media. With the exception of those vessel owners or 
operators fishing under a surfclam or ocean quahog permit, at least the 
following information and any other information required by the Regional 
Administrator must be provided: Vessel name; USCG documentation number 
(or state registration number, if undocumented); permit number; date/
time sailed; date/time landed; trip type; number of crew; number of 
anglers (if a charter or party boat); gear fished; quantity and size of 
gear; mesh/ring size; chart area fished; average depth; latitude/
longitude (or loran station and bearings); total hauls per area fished; 
average tow time duration; hail weight, in pounds (or count of 
individual fish, if a party or charter vessel), by species, of all 
species, or parts of species, such as monkfish livers, landed or 
discarded; and, in the case of skate discards, ``small'' (i.e., less 
than 23 inches (58.42 cm), total length) or ``large'' (i.e., 23 inches 
(58.42 cm) or greater, total length) skates; dealer permit number; 
dealer name; date sold, port and state landed; and vessel operator's 
name, signature, and operator's permit number (if applicable).
    (ii) Surfclam and ocean quahog vessel owners and operators. The 
owner or operator of any vessel conducting any surfclam and ocean quahog 
fishing operations, except those conducted exclusively in waters of a 
state that requires cage tags or when he/she has surrendered the 
surfclam and ocean quahog fishing vessel permit, shall maintain, on 
board the vessel, an accurate daily fishing log for each fishing trip, 
on forms supplied by the Regional Administrator, showing at least: Name 
and permit number of the vessel, total amount in bushels of each species 
taken, date(s) caught, time at sea, duration of fishing time, locality 
fished, crew size, crew share by percentage, landing port, date sold, 
price per bushel, buyer, tag numbers from cages used, quantity of 
surfclams and ocean quahogs discarded, and allocation permit number.
    (iii) Vessel reporting requirements for skates. In addition to the 
requirements under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the owner or 
operator of any vessel issued a skate permit shall report the species of 
all skates landed. Species of skates shall be identified according to 
the following categories: Winter skate, little skate, little/winter 
skate,

[[Page 502]]

barndoor skate, smooth skate, thorny skate, clearnose skate, rosette 
skate, and unclassified skate. Discards of skates shall be reported 
according to two size classes, large skates (greater than or equal to 23 
inches (58.42 cm) in total length) and small skates (less than 23 inches 
(58.42 cm) in total length). All other vessel reporting requirements 
remain unchanged. NOAA Fisheries will provide vessel owners or operators 
that intend to land skates with a skate identification guide to assist 
in this data collection program.
    (2) IVR system reports--(i) Atlantic herring owners or operators 
issued an open access permit. The owner or operator of a vessel issued 
an open access permit to fish for herring must report catch (retained 
and discarded) of herring to an IVR system for each week herring was 
caught, unless exempted by the Regional Administrator. IVR reports are 
not required for weeks when no herring was caught. The report shall 
include at least the following information, and any other information 
required by the Regional Administrator: Vessel identification; week in 
which herring are caught; management areas fished; and pounds retained 
and pounds discarded of herring caught in each management area. The IVR 
reporting week begins on Sunday at 0001 hr (12:01 a.m.) local time and 
ends Saturday at 2400 hr (12 midnight). Weekly Atlantic herring catch 
reports must be submitted via the IVR system by midnight each Tuesday, 
eastern time, for the previous week. Reports are required even if 
herring caught during the week has not yet been landed. This report does 
not exempt the owner or operator from other applicable reporting 
requirements of this section.
    (A) Atlantic herring IVR reports are not required from Atlantic 
herring carrier vessels.
    (B) Reporting requirements for vessels transferring herring at sea. 
A vessel that transfers herring at sea must comply with these 
requirements in addition to those specified at Sec. 648.13(f).
    (1) A vessel that transfers herring at sea to a vessel that receives 
it for personal use as bait must report all transfers on the Fishing 
Vessel Trip Report.
    (2) A vessel that transfers herring at sea to an authorized carrier 
vessel must report all transfers weekly via the IVR system and must 
report all transfers on the Fishing Vessel Trip Report. Each time the 
vessel offloads to the carrier vessel is defined as a trip for the 
purposes of reporting requirements and possession allowances.
    (3) A vessel that transfers herring at sea to an at-sea processor 
must report all transfers weekly via the IVR system and must report all 
transfers on the Fishing Vessel Trip Report. Each time the vessel 
offloads to the at-sea processing vessel is defined as a trip for the 
purposes of the reporting requirements and possession allowances. For 
each trip, the vessel must submit a Fishing Vessel Trip Report and the 
at-sea processing vessel must submit the detailed dealer report 
specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (4) A transfer between two vessels issued open access permits 
requires each vessel to submit a Fishing Vessel Trip Report, filled out 
as required by the LOA to transfer herring at sea, and a weekly IVR 
report for the amount of herring each vessel lands.
    (ii) Tilefish vessel owners or operators. The owner or operator of 
any vessel fishing under a tilefish IFQ Allocation permit, issued under 
this part, as described in Sec. 648.294(a), must submit a tilefish 
catch report by using the IVR system within 48 hr after returning to 
port and offloading. The report shall include at least the following 
information, and any other information required by the Regional 
Administrator: Vessel identification, trip during which tilefish are 
caught, pounds landed, VTR pre-printed serial number, and the Federal 
dealer number for the dealer who purchases the tilefish. IVR reporting 
does not exempt the owner or operator from other applicable reporting 
requirements of this section.
    (3) VMS Catch Reports. (i) Atlantic herring owners or operators 
issued a limited access permit. The owner or operator of a vessel issued 
a limited access permit to fish for herring must report catches 
(retained and discarded) of herring daily via VMS, unless exempted by 
the Regional Administrator. The report shall include at least the 
following information, and any other information

[[Page 503]]

required by the Regional Administrator: Fishing Vessel Trip Report 
serial number; month and day herring was caught; pounds retained for 
each herring management area; and pounds discarded for each herring 
management area. Daily Atlantic herring VMS catch reports must be 
submitted in 24-hr intervals for each day and must be submitted by 0900 
hr of the following day. Reports are required even if herring caught 
that day has not yet been landed. This report does not exempt the owner 
or operator from other applicable reporting requirements of this 
section.
    (A) The owner or operator of any vessel issued a limited access 
herring permit must submit an Atlantic herring catch report via VMS each 
day, regardless of how much herring is caught (including days when no 
herring is caught), unless exempted from this requirement by the 
Regional Administrator.
    (B) Atlantic herring VMS reports are not required from Atlantic 
herring carrier vessels.
    (C) Reporting requirements for vessels transferring herring at sea. 
The owner or operator of a vessel issued a limited access permit to fish 
for herring that transfers herring at sea must comply with these 
requirements in addition to those specified at Sec. 648.13(f).
    (1) A vessel that transfers herring at sea to a vessel that receives 
it for personal use as bait must report all transfers on the Fishing 
Vessel Trip Report.
    (2) A vessel that transfers herring at sea to an authorized carrier 
vessel must report all catch daily via VMS and must report all transfers 
on the Fishing Vessel Trip Report. Each time the vessel offloads to the 
carrier vessel is defined as a trip for the purposes of reporting 
requirements and possession allowances.
    (3) A vessel that transfers herring at sea to an at-sea processor 
must report all catch daily via VMS and must report all transfers on the 
Fishing Vessel Trip Report. Each time the vessel offloads to the at-sea 
processing vessel is defined as a trip for the purposes of the reporting 
requirements and possession allowances. For each trip, the vessel must 
submit a Fishing Vessel Trip Report and the at-sea processing vessel 
must submit the detailed dealer report specified in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section.
    (4) A transfer between two vessels issued limited access permits 
requires each vessel to submit a Fishing Vessel Trip Report, filled out 
as required by the LOA to transfer herring at sea, and a daily VMS catch 
report for the amount of herring each vessel catches.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (c) When to fill out a log report. Log reports required by paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section must be filled out with all required 
information, except for information not yet ascertainable, prior to 
entering port. Information that may be considered unascertainable prior 
to entering port includes dealer name, dealer permit number, and date 
sold. Log reports must be completed as soon as the information becomes 
available. Log reports required by paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section 
must be filled out before landing any surfclams or ocean quahogs.
    (d) Inspection. Upon the request of an authorized officer or an 
employee of NMFS designated by the Regional Administrator to make such 
inspections, all persons required to submit reports under this part must 
make immediately available for inspection copies of reports, and all 
records upon which those reports are or will be based, that are required 
to be submitted or kept under this part.
    (e) Record retention--(1) Dealer records. Any record, as defined in 
Sec. 648.2, related to fish possessed, received, or purchased by a 
dealer that is required to be reported, must be retained and made 
available for immediate review for a total of 3 years after the date the 
fish were first possessed, received, or purchased. Dealers must retain 
the required records and reports at their principal place of business.
    (2) VTRs. Copies of fishing log reports must be kept on board the 
vessel and available for review for at least 1 year, and must be 
retained for a total of 3 years after the date the fish were last 
possessed, landed, and sold.
    (3) Dockside/roving and at-sea monitor reports. Any record, as 
defined in Sec. 648.2, related to fish offloaded and observed by a 
dockside/roving or at-sea monitor, including any reports provided to

[[Page 504]]

NMFS, sector managers, or another third-party service provider specified 
in paragraph (h) of this section, must be retained and made available 
for immediate review for a total of 3 years after the date the fish were 
first offloaded. Dockside/roving and at-sea monitor providers must 
retain the required records and reports at their principal place of 
business.
    (f) Submitting reports--(1) Dealer or processor reports. (i) 
Detailed reports required by paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section must be 
received by midnight of the first Tuesday following the end of the 
reporting week. If no fish are purchased or received during a reporting 
week, the report so stating required under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this 
section must be received by midnight of the first Tuesday following the 
end of the reporting week.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (iii) Dealers who want to make corrections to their trip-level 
reports via the electronic editing features may do so for up to 3 
business days following submission of the initial report. If a 
correction is needed more than 3 business days following the submission 
of the initial trip-level report, the dealer must contact NMFS directly 
to request an extension of time to make the correction.
    (iv) Through April 30, 2005, to accommodate the potential lag in 
availability of some required data, the trip identifier, price and 
disposition information required under paragraph (a)(1) may be submitted 
after the detailed weekly report, but must be received within 16 days of 
the end of the reporting week or the end of the calendar month, 
whichever is later. Dealers will be able to access and update previously 
submitted trip identifier, price, and disposition data.
    (v) Effective May 1, 2005, the trip identifier required under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be submitted with the detailed 
report, as required under paragraphs (f)(1)(i) of this section. Price 
and disposition information may be submitted after the initial detailed 
report, but must be received within 16 days of the end of the reporting 
week.
    (vi) Annual reports for a calendar year must be postmarked or 
received by February 10 of the following year. Contact the Regional 
Administrator (see Table 1 to Sec. 600.502) for the address of NMFS 
Statistics.
    (2) Fishing vessel log reports. (i) For any vessel not issued a NE 
multispecies, Atlantic herring permit, or Tier 3 Limited Access mackerel 
permit, fishing vessel log reports, required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of 
this section, must be postmarked or received by NMFS within 15 days 
after the end of the reporting month. If no fishing trip is made during 
a particular month for such a vessel, a report stating so must be 
submitted, as instructed by the Regional Administrator. For any vessel 
issued a NE multispecies permit, Atlantic herring permit, or a Tier 3 
Limited Access mackerel permit, fishing vessel log reports must be 
postmarked or received by midnight of the first Tuesday following the 
end of the reporting week. If no fishing trip is made during a reporting 
week for such a vessel, a report stating so must be submitted and 
received by NMFS by midnight of the first Tuesday following the end of 
the reporting week, as instructed by the Regional Administrator. For the 
purposes of this paragraph (f)(2)(i), the date when fish are offloaded 
will establish the reporting week or month that the VTR must be 
submitted to NMFS, as appropriate. Any fishing activity during a 
particular reporting week (i.e., starting a trip, landing, or offloading 
catch) will constitute fishing during that reporting week and will 
eliminate the need to submit a negative fishing report to NMFS for that 
reporting week. For example, if a vessel issued a NE multispecies 
permit, Atlantic herring permit, or Tier 3 Limited Access Mackerel 
Vessel begins a fishing trip on Wednesday, but returns to port and 
offloads its catch on the following Thursday (i.e., after a trip lasting 
8 days), the VTR for the fishing trip would need to be submitted by 
midnight Tuesday of the third week, but a negative report (i.e., a ``did 
not fish'' report) would not be required for either earlier week.
    (ii) Surfclam and ocean quahog log reports, required by paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii) of this section, must be postmarked or received within 3 days 
after the end of each reporting week.

[[Page 505]]

    (3) At-sea purchasers and processors. With the exception of the 
owner or operator of an Atlantic herring carrier vessel, the owner or 
operator of an at-sea purchaser or processor that purchases or processes 
any Atlantic herring, Atlantic mackerel, squid, butterfish, scup, or 
black sea bass at sea must submit information identical to that required 
by paragraph (a)(1) of this section and provide those reports to the 
Regional Administrator or designee by the same mechanism and on the same 
frequency basis.
    (g) Additional data and sampling. Federally permitted dealers must 
allow access to their premises and make available to an official 
designee of the Regional Administrator any fish purchased from vessels 
for the collection of biological data. Such data include, but are not 
limited to, length measurements of fish and the collection of age 
structures such as otoliths or scales.
    (h) Dockside/roving monitor reports. Any dockside/roving monitor 
assigned to observe the offload of a vessel on a sector trip must record 
the amounts of all species offloaded and report such amounts to that 
particular vessel's sector manager and a third-party service provider, 
if specified in the operations plan or the private contract between the 
dockside/roving monitor service provider and an individual sector. Such 
reports must be made available to dealers for signature, as instructed 
by the Regional Administrator.
    (i) At-sea monitor/electronic monitoring reports. Any at-sea monitor 
assigned to observe a sector trip and any third-party service provider 
analyzing data from electronic monitoring equipment deployed on a sector 
trip must submit reports on catch, discard, and other data elements 
specified by the Regional Administrator to NMFS, the sector manager, and 
monitoring contractor, as instructed by the Regional Administrator.

Sec. 648.8  Vessel identification.

    (a) Vessel name and official number. Each fishing vessel subject to 
this part and over 25 ft (7.6 m) in registered length must:
    (1) Affix permanently its name on the port and starboard sides of 
the bow and, if possible, on its stern.
    (2) Display its official number on the port and starboard sides of 
the deckhouse or hull, and on an appropriate weather deck so as to be 
clearly visible from enforcement vessels and aircraft. The official 
number is the USCG documentation number or the vessel's state 
registration number for vessels not required to be documented under 
title 46 U.S.C.
    (b) Numerals. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, 
the official number must be displayed in block arabic numerals in 
contrasting color at least 18 inches (45.7 cm) in height for fishing 
vessels over 65 ft (19.8 m) in registered length, and at least 10 inches 
(25.4 cm) in height for all other vessels over 25 ft (7.6 m) in 
registered length. The registered length of a vessel, for purposes of 
this section, is that registered length set forth in USCG or state 
records.
    (c) Duties of owner. The owner of each vessel subject to this part 
shall ensure that--
    (1) The vessel's name and official number are kept clearly legible 
and in good repair.
    (2) No part of the vessel, its rigging, its fishing gear, or any 
other object obstructs the view of the official number from any 
enforcement vessel or aircraft.
    (d) Non-permanent marking. Vessels carrying recreational fishing 
parties on a per capita basis or by charter must use markings that meet 
the above requirements, except for the requirement that they be affixed 
permanently to the vessel. The non-permanent markings must be displayed 
in conformity with the above requirements.
    (e) New Jersey surfclam or ocean quahog vessels. Instead of 
complying with paragraph (a) of this section, surfclam or ocean quahog 
vessels licensed under

[[Page 506]]

New Jersey law may use the appropriate vessel identification markings 
established by that state.

Sec. 648.9  VMS vendor and unit requirements.

    (a) Approval. The type approval requirements for VMS MTUs and MCSPs 
for the Northeast Region are those as published by the NMFS Office of 
Law Enforcement in the Federal Register, and are available upon request. 
Both the minimum national standards and any established regional 
standards must be met in order to receive approval for use in the 
Northeast Region. The Regional Administrator shall approve all MTUs and 
MCSPs operating in the Northeast Region.
    (b) Maintenance. Once approved, VMS units must maintain the minimum 
standards for which they were approved in the type approval 
requirements. Any changes made to the original submission for approval 
of an MTU or MCSP by NMFS must follow the procedures outlined in the 
type approval requirements.
    (c) Notification. A list of approved VMS vendors will be published 
on the Northeast Regional Office Web site and in each proposed and final 
rule for implementing or modifying VMS requirements for specific 
fisheries.
    (d) Revocations. In the event that a VMS vendor is deleted from the 
list of approved vendors, vessel owners that purchased a VMS unit from 
that vendor to meet Northeast requirements will be considered authorized 
to use that unit for the remainder of the unit's service life.

or Combination permit, whose owner elects to provide the notifications 
required by this paragraph (b), unless otherwise authorized or required 
by the Regional Administrator under paragraph (d) of this section;
    (4) A vessel issued a limited access NE multispecies permit that 
fishes or intends to fish under a NE multispecies Category A or B DAS, 
or catches regulated species or ocean pout while on a sector trip; or a 
vessel issued a limited access NE multispecies small vessel category or 
Handgear A permit that fishes in multiple stock areas pursuant to 
paragraph (k)(2) of this section;
    (5) A vessel issued a surfclam (SF 1) or an ocean quahog (OQ 6) open 
access permit;
    (6) Effective January 1, 2009, a vessel issued a Maine mahogany 
quahog (OQ 7) limited access permit, unless otherwise exempted under 
paragraph Sec. 648.4(a)(4)(ii)(B)(1);
    (7) A limited access monkfish vessel electing to fish in the 
Offshore Fishery Program in the SFMA, as provided in Sec. 648.95; and
    (8) A vessel issued a limited access herring permit (i.e., All Areas 
Limited Access Permit, Areas 2 and 3 Limited Access Permit, Incidental 
Catch Limited Access Permit).
    (c) Operating requirements for all vessels. (1) Except as provided 
in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, or unless otherwise required by 
paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, all vessels required to use VMS 
units, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, must transmit a 
signal indicating the vessel's accurate position, as specified under 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section:
    (i) At least every hour, 24 hr a day, throughout the year; or
    (ii) At least twice per hour, 24 hr a day, throughout the year, for 
vessels issued a scallop permit.
    (2) Power-down exemption. (i) Any vessel required to transmit the 
vessel's location at all times, as required in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, is exempt from this requirement if it meets one or more of the 
following conditions and requirements:
    (A) The vessel will be continuously out of the water for more than 
72 consecutive hours, the vessel signs out of the VMS program by 
obtaining a valid letter of exemption pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) 
of this section, and the vessel complies with all conditions and 
requirements of said letter;
    (B) For vessels fishing with a valid NE multispecies limited access 
permit,

[[Page 508]]

a valid surfclam and ocean quahog permit specified at Sec. 648.4(a)(4), 
or an Atlantic sea scallop limited access permit, the vessel owner signs 
out of the VMS program for a minimum period of 30 consecutive days by 
obtaining a valid letter of exemption pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) 
of this section, the vessel does not engage in any fisheries until the 
VMS unit is turned back on, and the vessel complies with all conditions 
and requirements of said letter;
    (C) The vessel has been issued a limited access herring permit, and 
is in port, unless required by other permit requirements for other 
fisheries to transmit the vessel's location at all times. Such a vessel 
must re-power the VMS and submit a valid VMS activity declaration prior 
to leaving port; or
    (D) The vessel has been issued an LAGC permit, is not in possession 
of any scallops onboard the vessel, is tied to a permanent dock or 
mooring, the vessel operator has notified NMFS through VMS by 
transmitting the appropriate VMS power-down code that the VMS will be 
powered down, and the vessel is not required by other permit 
requirements for other fisheries to transmit the vessel's location at 
all times. Such a vessel must re-power the VMS and submit a valid VMS 
activity declaration prior to moving from the fixed dock or mooring. VMS 
codes and instructions are available from the Regional Administrator.
    (ii) Letter of exemption--(A) Application. A vessel owner may apply 
for a letter of exemption from the VMS transmitting requirements 
specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for his/her vessel by 
sending a written request to the Regional Administrator and providing 
the following: The location of the vessel during the time an exemption 
is sought; the exact time period for which an exemption is needed (i.e., 
the time the VMS signal will be turned off and turned on again); and, in 
the case of a vessel meeting the conditions of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of 
this section, sufficient information to determine that the vessel will 
be out of the water for more than 72 consecutive hours. The letter of 
exemption must be on board the vessel at all times, and the vessel may 
not turn off the VMS signal until the letter of exemption has been 
received.
    (B) Issuance. Upon receipt of an application, the Regional 
Administrator may issue a letter of exemption to the vessel if it is 
determined that the vessel owner provided sufficient information as 
required under this paragraph (c)(2), and that the issuance of the 
letter of exemption will not jeopardize accurate monitoring of the 
vessel's DAS. Upon written request, the Regional Administrator may 
change the time period for which the exemption is granted.
    (d) Presumption. If a VMS unit fails to transmit an hourly signal of 
a vessel's position, the vessel shall be deemed to have incurred a DAS, 
or fraction thereof, for as long as the unit fails to transmit a signal, 
unless a preponderance of evidence shows that the failure to transmit 
was due to an unavoidable malfunction or disruption of the transmission 
that occurred while the vessel was properly declared out of the scallop 
fishery, NE multispecies fishery, or monkfish fishery, as applicable, or 
while the vessel was not at sea.
    (e) VMS notifications--(1) VMS installation notification. (i) The 
owner of such a vessel specified in paragraph (b) of this section, with 
the exception of a vessel issued a limited access NE multispecies permit 
as specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, must provide 
documentation to the Regional Administrator at the time of application 
for a limited access permit that the vessel has an operational VMS unit 
installed on board that meets the minimum performance criteria, unless 
otherwise allowed under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (ii) Vessel owners must confirm the VMS unit's operation and 
communications service to NMFS by calling the Office of Law Enforcement 
(OLE) to ensure that position reports are automatically sent to and 
received by NMFS OLE.
    (iii) NMFS does not regard the fishing vessel as meeting the VMS 
requirements until automatic position reports and a manual declaration 
are received.
    (iv) If a vessel has already been issued a limited access permit 
without the owner providing such documentation, the Regional 
Administrator shall

[[Page 509]]

allow at least 30 days for the vessel to install an operational VMS unit 
that meets the minimum performance criteria, and for the owner to 
provide documentation of such installation to the Regional 
Administrator.
    (v) The owner of a vessel issued a limited access NE multispecies 
permit that fishes or intends to fish under a NE multispecies Category A 
or B DAS, or that catches regulated species or ocean pout while on a 
sector trip, as specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, must 
provide documentation to the Regional Administrator that the vessel has 
an operational VMS unit installed on board, meeting all requirements of 
this part, prior to fishing under a NE multispecies DAS or under the 
provisions of an approved sector operations plan.
    (vi) NMFS shall provide notification to all affected permit holders 
providing detailed information on procedures pertaining to VMS purchase, 
installation, and use.
    (2) Replacement VMS installations. Should a VMS unit require 
replacement, a vessel owner must submit documentation to the Regional 
Administrator, within 3 days of installation and prior to the vessel's 
next trip, verifying, as described in this paragraph (e), that the new 
VMS unit is an operational approved system as described under Sec. 
648.9(a).
    (3) Access. As a condition to obtaining a limited access scallop, 
multispecies, an Atlantic herring, a surfclam, ocean quahog, or Maine 
mahogany quahog permit; or as a condition of using a VMS unit; all 
vessel owners must allow NMFS, the USCG, and their authorized officers 
or designees access to the vessel's DAS data, if applicable, and to 
location data obtained from its VMS unit, if required, at the time of or 
after its transmission to the vendor or receiver, as the case may be.
    (4) Tampering. Tampering with a VMS, a VMS unit, or a VMS signal, is 
prohibited. Tampering includes any activity that may affect the unit's 
ability to operate or signal properly, or to accurately compute or 
report the vessel's position.
    (5) Fishery participation notification. (i) A vessel subject to the 
VMS requirements of Sec. 648.9 and paragraphs (b) through (d) of this 
section that has crossed the VMS Demarcation Line under paragraph (a) of 
this section is deemed to be fishing under the DAS program, the Access 
Area Program, the LAGC IFQ or NGOM scallop fishery, or other fishery 
requiring the operation of VMS as applicable, unless prior to leaving 
port, the vessel's owner or authorized representative declares the 
vessel out of the scallop, NE multispecies, or monkfish fishery, as 
applicable, for a specific time period. NMFS must be notified by 
transmitting the appropriate VMS code through the VMS, or unless the 
vessel's owner or authorized representative declares the vessel will be 
fishing in the Eastern U.S./Canada Area, as described in Sec. 
648.85(a)(3)(ii), under the provisions of that program.
    (ii) Notification that the vessel is not under the DAS program, the 
Access Area Program, the LAGC IFQ or NGOM scallop fishery, or any other 
fishery requiring the operation of VMS, must be received by NMFS prior 
to the vessel leaving port. A vessel may not change its status after the 
vessel leaves port or before it returns to port on any fishing trip, 
unless the vessel is a scallop vessel and is exempted, as specified in 
paragraph (f) of this section.
    (iii) DAS counting for a vessel that is under the VMS notification 
requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, with the exception of 
vessels that have elected to fish exclusively in the Eastern U.S./Canada 
Area on a particular trip, as described in paragraph (e)(5) of this 
section, begins with the first location signal received showing that the 
vessel crossed the VMS Demarcation Line after leaving port. DAS counting 
ends with the first location signal received showing that the vessel 
crossed the VMS Demarcation Line upon its return to port.
    (iv) For those vessels that have elected to fish exclusively in the 
Eastern U.S./Canada Area pursuant to Sec. 648.85(a)(3)(ii), the 
requirements of this paragraph (b) begin with the first location signal 
received showing that the vessel crossed into the Eastern U.S./Canada 
Area and end with the first location signal received showing that the 
vessel crossed out of the Eastern U.S./Canada Area upon beginning its 
return trip to port, unless the vessel

[[Page 510]]

elects to also fish outside the Eastern U.S./Canada Area on the same 
trip, in accordance with Sec. 648.85(a)(3)(ii)(A).
    (v) The Regional Administrator may authorize or require the use of 
the call-in system instead of the use of VMS, as described under 
paragraph (h) of this section. Furthermore, the Regional Administrator 
may authorize or require the use of letters of authorization as an 
alternative means of enforcing possession limits, if VMS cannot be used 
for such purposes.
    (f) Atlantic sea scallop vessel VMS notification requirements. Less 
than 1 hr prior to leaving port, the owner or authorized representative 
of a scallop vessel that is required to use VMS as specified in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section must notify the Regional Administrator 
by transmitting the appropriate VMS code that the vessel will be 
participating in the scallop DAS program, Area Access Program, LAGC 
scallop fishery, or will be fishing outside of the scallop fishery under 
the requirements of its other Federal permits, or that the vessel will 
be steaming to another location prior to commencing its fishing trip by 
transmitting a ``declared out of fishery'' VMS code. If the owner or 
authorized representative of a scallop vessel declares out of the 
fishery for the steaming portion of the trip, the vessel cannot possess, 
retain, or land scallops, or fish for any other fish. Prior to 
commencing the fishing trip following a ``declared out of fishery'' 
trip, the owner or authorized representative must notify the Regional 
Administrator by transmitting the appropriate VMS code, before first 
crossing the VMS Demarcation Line, that the vessel will be participating 
in the scallop DAS program, Area Access Program, or LAGC scallop 
fishery. VMS codes and instructions are available from the Regional 
Administrator upon request.
    (1) IFQ scallop vessels. An IFQ scallop vessel that has crossed the 
VMS Demarcation Line specified under paragraph (a) of this section is 
deemed to be fishing under the IFQ program, unless prior to the vessel 
leaving port, the vessel's owner or authorized representative declares 
the vessel out of the scallop fishery (i.e., agrees that the vessel will 
not possess, retain, or land scallops while declared out of the fishery) 
by notifying the Regional Administrator through the VMS. If the vessel 
has not fished for any other fish (i.e., steaming only), after declaring 
out of the fishery, leaving port, and steaming to another location, the 
owner or authorized representative of an IFQ scallop vessel may declare 
into the IFQ fishery without entering another port by making a 
declaration before first crossing the VMS Demarcation Line. An IFQ 
scallop vessel that is fishing north of 42[deg]20[min] N. lat. is deemed 
to be fishing under the NGOM scallop fishery unless prior to the vessel 
leaving port, the vessel's owner or authorized representative declares 
the vessel out of the scallop fishery, as specified in paragraphs 
(e)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section, and the vessel does not possess, 
retain, or land scallops while under such a declaration. After declaring 
out of the fishery, leaving port, and steaming to another location, if 
the IFQ scallop vessel has not fished for any other fish (i.e., steaming 
only), the vessel may declare into the NGOM fishery without entering 
another port by making a declaration before first crossing the VMS 
Demarcation Line.
    (2) NGOM scallop fishery. A NGOM scallop vessel is deemed to be 
fishing in Federal waters of the NGOM management area and will have its 
landings applied against the NGOM management area TAC, specified in 
Sec. 648.62(b)(1), unless:
    (i) Prior to the vessel leaving port, the vessel's owner or 
authorized representative declares the vessel out of the scallop 
fishery, as specified in paragraphs (e)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section, 
and the vessel does not possess, retain, or land scallops while under 
such a declaration. After declaring out of the fishery, leaving port, 
and steaming to another location, if the NGOM scallop vessel has not 
fished for any other fish (i.e., steaming only), the vessel may declare 
into the NGOM fishery without entering another port by making a 
declaration before first crossing the VMS Demarcation Line.
    (ii) The vessel has specifically declared into the state-only NGOM 
fishery, thus is fishing exclusively in the state waters portion of the 
NGOM management area.

[[Page 511]]

    (3) Incidental scallop fishery. An Incidental scallop vessel that 
has crossed the VMS Demarcation Line on any declared fishing trip for 
any species is deemed to be fishing under the Incidental scallop 
fishery.
    (4) Catch reports. (i) The owner or operator of a limited access or 
LAGC IFQ vessel that fishes for, possesses, or retains scallops, and is 
not fishing under a NE Multispecies DAS or sector allocation, must 
submit reports through the VMS, in accordance with instructions to be 
provided by the Regional Administrator, for each day fished, including 
open area trips, access area trips as described in Sec. 648.60(a)(9), 
and trips accompanied by a NMFS-approved observer. The reports must be 
submitted for each day (beginning at 0000 hr and ending at 2400 hr) and 
not later than 0900 hours of the following day. Such reports must 
include the following information:
    (A) FVTR serial number;
    (B) Date fish were caught;
    (C) Total pounds of scallop meats kept;
    (D) Total pounds of yellowtail flounder kept;
    (E) Total pounds of yellowtail flounder discarded; and
    (F) Total pounds of all other fish kept.
    (ii) Scallop Pre-Landing Notification Form for IFQ and NGOM vessels. 
Using the Scallop Pre-Landing Notification Form, a vessel issued an IFQ 
or NGOM scallop permit must report through VMS the amount of any 
scallops kept on each trip declared as a scallop trip, including 
declared scallop trips where no scallops were landed. In addition, 
vessels with an IFQ or NGOM permit must submit a Scallop Pre-Landing 
Notification Form on trips that are not declared as scallop trips, but 
on which scallops are kept incidentally. A limited access vessel that 
also holds an IFQ or NGOM permit must submit the Scallop Pre-Landing 
Notification Form only when fishing under the provisions of the vessel's 
IFQ or NGOM permit. VMS Scallop Pre-Landing Notification forms must be 
submitted no less than 6 hr prior to crossing the VMS Demarcation Line 
on the way back to port, and, if scallops will be landed, must include 
the vessel's captain/operator name, the amount of scallop meats and/or 
bushels to be landed, the estimated time of arrival in port, the port at 
which the scallops will be landed, the VTR serial number recorded from 
that trip's VTR, and whether any scallops were caught in the NGOM. If 
the scallop harvest ends less than 6 hr prior to landing, then the 
Scallop Pre-Landing Notification form must be submitted immediately upon 
leaving the fishing grounds. If no scallops will be landed, the form 
only requires the vessel's captain/operator name, the VTR serial number 
recorded from that trip's VTR, and indication that no scallops will be 
landed. If the report is being submitted as a correction of a prior 
report, the information entered into the notification form will replace 
the data previously submitted in the prior report.
    (5) Scallop vessels fishing under exemptions. Vessels fishing under 
the exemptions provided by Sec. 648.54 (a) and/or (b)(1) must comply 
with the exemption requirements and notify the Regional Administrator by 
VMS notification or by call-in notification as follows:
    (i) VMS notification for scallop vessels fishing under exemptions. 
(A) Notify the Regional Administrator, via their VMS, prior to each trip 
of the vessel under the state waters exemption program, that the vessel 
will be fishing exclusively in state waters; and
    (B) Notify the Regional Administrator, via their VMS, prior to the 
vessel's first planned trip in the EEZ, that the vessel is to resume 
fishing under the vessel's DAS allocation.
    (ii) Call-in notification for scallop vessels fishing under 
exemptions. (A) Notify the Regional Administrator by using the call-in 
system and providing the following information at least 7 days prior to 
fishing under the exemption:
    (1) Owner and caller name and address;
    (2) Vessel name and permit number; and
    (3) Beginning and ending dates of the exemption period.
    (B) Remain under the exemption for a minimum of 7 days.
    (C) If, under the exemption for a minimum of 7 days and wishing to 
withdraw earlier than the designated end of

[[Page 512]]

the exemption period, notify the Regional Administrator of early 
withdrawal from the program by calling the call-in system, providing the 
vessel's name and permit number and the name and phone number of the 
caller, and stating that the vessel is withdrawing from the exemption. 
The vessel may not leave port to fish in the EEZ until 48 hr after 
notification of early withdrawal is received by the Regional 
Administrator.
    (D) The Regional Administrator will furnish a phone number for call-
ins upon request.
    (E) Such vessels must comply with the VMS notification requirements 
specified in paragraph (e) of this section by notifying the Regional 
Administrator by entering the appropriate VMS code that the vessel is 
fishing outside of the scallop fishery. VMS codes and instructions are 
available from the Regional Administrator upon request.
    (g) VMS notification requirements for other fisheries. (1) Unless 
otherwise specified in this part, or via letters sent to affected permit 
holders under paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section, the owner or 
authorized representative of a vessel that is required to use VMS, as 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section, unless exempted under 
paragraph (f) of this section, must notify the Regional Administrator of 
the vessel's intended fishing activity by entering the appropriate VMS 
code prior to leaving port at the start of each fishing trip.
    (2) Notification of a vessel's intended fishing activity includes, 
but is not limited to, gear and DAS type to be used; area to be fished; 
and whether the vessel will be declared out of the DAS fishery, or will 
participate in the NE multispecies and monkfish DAS fisheries, including 
approved special management programs.
    (3) A vessel cannot change any aspect of its VMS activity code 
outside of port, except as follows:
    (i) NE multispecies vessels are authorized to change the category of 
DAS used (i.e., flip its DAS), as provided at Sec. 648.85(b), or change 
the area declared to be fished so that the vessel may fish both inside 
and outside of the Eastern U.S./Canada Area on the same trip, as 
provided at Sec. 648.85(a)(3)(ii)(A).
    (ii) Vessels issued both a NE multispecies permit and a monkfish 
permit are authorized to change their DAS declaration from a NE 
multispecies Category A DAS to a monkfish DAS, while remaining subject 
to the to the NE multispecies DAS usage requirements under Sec. 
648.92(b)(1)(i), during the course of a trip, as provided at Sec. 
648.92(b)(1)(iii)(A).
    (iii) The vessel carries onboard a valid limited access or LAGC 
scallop permit, has declared out of the fishery in port, and is steaming 
to another location, pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section.
    (4) VMS activity codes and declaration instructions are available 
from the Regional Administrator upon request.
    (h) Call-in notification. The owner of a vessel issued a limited 
access monkfish permit who is participating in a DAS program and who is 
not required to provide notification using a VMS, and a scallop vessel 
qualifying for a DAS allocation under the occasional category that has 
not elected to fish under the VMS notification requirements of paragraph 
(e) of this section and is not participating in the Sea Scallop Area 
Access program as specified in Sec. 648.60, and any vessel that may be 
required by the Regional Administrator to use the call-in program under 
paragraph (i) of this section, are subject to the following 
requirements:
    (1) Less than 1 hr prior to leaving port, for vessels issued a 
limited access NE multispecies DAS permit or, for vessels issued a

    (3) Vessels issued a limited access monkfish Category C, D, F, G, or 
H permit that are allowed to fish as a monkfish Category A or B vessel 
in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 648.92(b)(2)(i) are subject 
to the call-in notification requirements for limited access monkfish 
Category A or B vessels specified under this paragraph (h) for those 
monkfish DAS when there is not a concurrent NE multispecies DAS.
    (4) The vessel's confirmation numbers for the current and 
immediately prior NE multispecies or monkfish fishing trip must be 
maintained on board the vessel and provided to an authorized officer 
immediately upon request.
    (5) At the end of a vessel's trip, upon its return to port, the 
vessel owner or owner's representative must call the Regional 
Administrator and notify him/her that the trip has ended by providing 
the following information:
    (i) Owner and caller name and phone number;
    (ii) Vessel name and permit number;
    (iii) Port of landing; and
    (iv) That the vessel has ended its trip.
    (6) A DAS ends when the call has been received and confirmation has

at the end of a fishing trip, whichever occurs later, unless otherwise 
specified in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (7) The Regional Administrator will furnish a phone number for DAS 
notification call-ins upon request.
    (8) Regardless of whether a vessel's owner or authorized 
representative provides correct notification as required by paragraphs 
(e) through (h) of this section, a vessel meeting any of the following 
descriptions shall be deemed to be in its respective fishery's DAS or 
Scallop Access Area Program for the purpose of counting DAS or scallop 
access area trips/pounds, and, shall be charged DAS from the time of 
sailing to landing:
    (i) Any vessel issued a limited access scallop permit and not issued 
an LAGC scallop permit that possesses or lands scallops;
    (ii) A vessel issued a limited access scallop and LAGC IFQ scallop 
permit that possesses or lands more than 600 lb (272.2 kg) of scallops, 
unless otherwise specified in Sec. 648.60(d)(2);

Administrator at the time of application for a limited access

[[Page 514]]

permit that the vessel has installed on board an operational VMS as 
provided under Sec. 648.9(a). A vessel that is authorized to use the 
VMS in lieu of the call-in requirement for DAS notification shall be 
subject to the requirements and presumptions described under paragraphs 
(e)(2)(i) through (v) of this section. This paragraph (h) does not apply 
to vessels electing to use the VMS.
    (i) Temporary authorization for use of the call-in system. The 
Regional Administrator may authorize or require, on a temporary basis, 
the use of the call-in system of notification specified in paragraph (h) 
of this section, instead of using the VMS. If use of the call-in system 
is authorized or required, the Regional Administrator shall notify 
affected permit holders through a letter, notification in the Federal 
Register, e-mail, or other appropriate means.
    (j) Additional NE multispecies call-in requirements--(1) Spawning 
season call-in. With the exception of a vessel issued a valid Small 
Vessel category permit or the Handgear A permit category, vessels 
subject to the spawning season restriction described in Sec. 648.82

(or through VMS, if required by the Regional Administrator) and provide 
the following information:
    (i) Vessel name and permit number;
    (ii) Owner and caller name and phone number; and
    (iii) Commencement date of the 20-day period.
    (2) Gillnet call-in. A vessel subject to the gillnet restriction 
described in Sec. 648.82 must notify the Regional Administrator of the 
commencement of its time out of the NE multispecies gillnet fishery 
using the procedure described in paragraph (k)(1) of this section.
    (k) Area-specific reporting requirements for NE multispecies 
vessels.--(1) Reporting requirements for all limited access NE 
multispecies vessel owners or operators. In addition to any other 
reporting requirements specified in this part, the owner or operator of 
any vessel issued a limited access NE multispecies permit on either a 
common pool or sector trip must declare the following information via 
VMS or IVR, as instructed by the Regional Administrator:
    (i) Broad stock area(s) to be fished. To fish in any of the broad 
stock areas, the vessel owner or operator must declare his/her intent to 
fish within one or more of the NE multispecies broad stock areas, as 
defined in paragraph (k)(3) of this section, prior to leaving port at 
the start of a fishing trip;
    (ii) VTR serial number. On its return to port, prior to crossing the 
VMS demarcation line, as defined at Sec. 648.10, the vessel owner or 
operator must provide the VTR serial number for the first page of the 
VTR for that particular trip, or other applicable trip ID specified by 
NMFS; and
    (iii) Trip-end hail report. Unless otherwise required to comply with 
both the dockside/roving monitoring trip-start and trip-end hail reports 
pursuant to Sec. 648.87(b)(5), beginning in fishing year 2011 (May 1, 
2011), upon its return to port and prior to crossing the VMS demarcation 
line as defined in Sec. 648.10, the owner or operator of any vessel 
issued a limited access NE multispecies permit that is subject to the 
VMS requirements specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section must 
submit a trip-end hail report to NMFS via VMS, as instructed by the 
Regional Administrator. The trip-end hail report must include at least 
the following information, as instructed by the Regional Administrator: 
The vessel permit number; VTR serial number, or other applicable trip ID 
specified by NMFS; intended offloading location(s), including the dealer 
name/offload location, port/harbor, and state for the first dealer/
facility where the vessel intends to offload catch and the port/harbor, 
and state for the second dealer/facility where the vessel intends to 
offload catch; estimated date/time of arrival; estimated date/time of 
offload; and the estimated total amount of all species retained, 
including species managed by other FMPs (in pounds, landed weight), on 
board at the time the vessel first offloads its catch from a particular 
trip. The trip-end hail report must be submitted at least 6 hr in 
advance of landing for all trips of at least 6 hr in duration or 
occurring more than 6 hr from port. For shorter trips, the trip-

[[Page 515]]

end hail reports must be submitted upon the completion of the last tow 
or hauling of gear, as instructed by the Regional Administrator.
    (2) Reporting requirements for NE multispecies vessel owners or 
operators fishing in more than one broad stock area per trip. Unless 
otherwise provided in this paragraph (k)(2), the owner or operator of 
any vessel issued a NE multispecies limited access permit that has 
declared its intent to fish within multiple NE multispecies broad stock 
areas, as defined in paragraph (k)(3) of this section, on the same trip 
must submit a trip-level hail report via VMS detailing the amount of 
each regulated species retained (in pounds, landed weight) and the total 
amount of all species retained (in pounds, landed weight), including NE 
multispecies and species managed by other FMPs, from each broad stock 
area prior to crossing the VMS demarcation line, as defined in Sec. 
648.10, upon its return to port following each fishing trip on which 
regulated species were caught, as instructed by the Regional 
Administrator. This reporting requirement is in addition to the 
reporting requirements specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section and 
any other reporting requirements specified in this part. A vessel is 
exempt from the reporting requirements specified in this paragraph 
(k)(2) if it is fishing in a special management program, as specified in 
Sec. 648.85, and is required to submit daily VMS catch reports 
consistent with the requirements of that program. The Regional 
Administrator may adjust the reporting frequency specified in this 
paragraph and may exempt vessels on a sector trip from the reporting 
requirements specified in this paragraph (k)(2) if it is determined that 
such reporting requirements would duplicate those specified in Sec. 
648.87(b).
    (3) NE multispecies broad stock areas. For the purposes of the area-
specific reporting requirements listed in paragraphs (k)(1) and (2) of 
this section, the NE multispecies broad stock areas are defined in 
paragraphs (k)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section. Copies of a map 
depicting these areas are available from the Regional Administrator upon

Sec. 648.11  At-sea sea sampler/observer coverage.

    (a) The Regional Administrator may request any vessel holding a 
permit for Atlantic sea scallops, NE multispecies, monkfish, skates, 
Atlantic mackerel, squid, butterfish, scup, black sea bass, bluefish, 
spiny dogfish, Atlantic herring, tilefish, or Atlantic deep-sea red 
crab; or a moratorium permit for summer flounder; to carry a NMFS-
certified fisheries observer. A vessel holding a permit for Atlantic sea 
scallops is subject to the additional requirements specific in paragraph 
(g) of this section. Also, any vessel or vessel owner/operator that 
fishes for, catches or lands hagfish, or intends to fish for, catch, or 
land hagfish in or from the exclusive

[[Page 517]]

economic zone must carry a NMFS-certified fisheries observer when 
requested by the Regional Administrator in accordance with the 
requirements of this section.
    (b) If requested by the Regional Administrator to carry an observer 
or sea sampler, it is the responsibility of the vessel owner to arrange 
for and facilitate observer or sea sampler placement. Owners of vessels 
selected for sea sampler/observer coverage must notify the appropriate 
Regional or Science and Research Director, as specified by the Regional 
Administrator, before commencing any fishing trip that may result in the 
harvest of resources of the respective fishery. Notification procedures 
will be specified in selection letters to vessel owners.
    (c) The Regional Administrator may waive the requirement to carry a 
sea sampler or observer if the facilities on a vessel for housing the 
observer or sea sampler, or for carrying out observer or sea sampler 
functions, are so inadequate or unsafe that the health or safety of the 
observer or sea sampler, or the safe operation of the vessel, would be 
jeopardized.
    (d) An owner or operator of a vessel on which a NMFS-approved sea 
sampler/observer is embarked must:
    (1) Provide accommodations and food that are equivalent to those 
provided to the crew.
    (2) Allow the sea sampler/observer access to and use of the vessel's 
communications equipment and personnel upon request for the transmission 
and receipt of messages related to the sea sampler's/observer's duties.
    (3) Provide true vessel locations, by latitude and longitude or 
loran coordinates, as requested by the observer/sea sampler, and allow 
the sea sampler/observer access to and use of the vessel's navigation 
equipment and personnel upon request to determine the vessel's position.
    (4) Notify the sea sampler/observer in a timely fashion of when 
fishing operations are to begin and end.
    (5) Allow for the embarking and debarking of the sea sampler/
observer, as specified by the Regional Administrator, ensuring that 
transfers of observers/sea samplers at sea are accomplished in a safe 
manner, via small boat or raft, during daylight hours as weather and sea 
conditions allow, and with the agreement of the sea samplers/ observers 
involved.
    (6) Allow the sea sampler/observer free and unobstructed access to 
the vessel's bridge, working decks, holding bins, weight scales, holds, 
and any other space used to hold, process, weigh, or store fish.
    (7) Allow the sea sampler/observer to inspect and copy any the 
vessel's log, communications log, and records associated with the catch 
and distribution of fish for that trip.
    (e) The owner or operator of a vessel issued a summer flounder 
moratorium permit, a scup moratorium permit, a black sea bass moratorium 
permit, a bluefish permit, a spiny dogfish permit, an Atlantic herring 
permit, an Atlantic deep-sea red crab permit, a skate permit, or a 
tilefish permit, if requested by the sea sampler/observer, also must:
    (1) Notify the sea sampler/observer of any sea turtles, marine 
mammals, summer flounder, scup, black sea bass, bluefish, spiny dogfish, 
Atlantic herring, Atlantic deep-sea red crab, tilefish, skates 
(including discards) or other specimens taken by the vessel.
    (2) Provide the sea sampler/observer with sea turtles, marine 
mammals, summer flounder, scup, black sea bass, bluefish, spiny dogfish, 
Atlantic herring, Atlantic deep-sea red crab, skates, tilefish, or other 
specimens taken by the vessel.
    (f) NMFS may accept observer coverage funded by outside sources if:
    (1) All coverage conducted by such observers is determined by NMFS 
to be in compliance with NMFS' observer guidelines and procedures.
    (2) The owner or operator of the vessel complies with all other 
provisions of this part.
    (3) The observer is approved by the Regional Administrator.
    (g) Atlantic sea scallop observer program--(1) General. Unless 
otherwise specified, owners, operators, and/or managers of vessels 
issued a Federal scallop permit under Sec. 648.4(a)(2), and specified 
in paragraph (a) of this section, must comply with this section and are 
jointly and severally responsible for their vessel's compliance with

[[Page 518]]

this section. To facilitate the deployment of at-sea observers, all sea 
scallop vessels issued limited access permits fishing in open areas or 
Sea Scallop Access Areas, and LAGC IFQ vessels fishing under the Sea 
Scallop Access Area program specified in Sec. 648.60, are required to 
comply with the additional notification requirements specified in 
paragraph (g)(2) of this section. When NMFS notifies the vessel owner, 
operator, and/or manager of any requirement to carry an observer on a 
specified trip in either an Access Area or Open Area as specified in 
paragraph (g)(3) of this section, the vessel may not fish for, take, 
retain, possess, or land any scallops without carrying an observer. 
Vessels may only embark on a scallop trip in open areas or Access Areas 
without an observer if the vessel owner, operator, and/or manager has 
been notified that the vessel has received a waiver of the observer 
requirement for that trip pursuant to paragraphs (g)(3) and (g)(4)(ii) 
of this section.
    (2) Vessel notification procedures--(i) Limited access vessels. 
Limited access vessel owners, operators, or managers shall notify NMFS/
NEFOP by telephone not more than 10 days prior to the beginning of any 
scallop trip of the time, port of departure, open area or specific Sea 
Scallop Access Area to be fished, and whether fishing as a scallop 
dredge, scallop trawl, or general category vessel.
    (ii) LAGC IFQ vessels. LAGC IFQ vessel owners, operators, or 
managers must notify the NMFS/NEFOP by telephone by 0001 hr of the 
Thursday preceding the week (Sunday through Saturday) that they intend 
to start a scallop trip in an access area. If selected, up to two Sea 
Scallop Access Area trips that start during the specified week (Sunday 
through Saturday) can be selected to be covered by an observer. NMFS/
NEFOP must be notified by the owner, operator, or vessel manager of any 
trip plan changes at least 48 hr prior to vessel departure.
    (3) Selection of scallop trips for observer coverage. Based on 
predetermined coverage levels for various permit categories and areas of 
the scallop fishery that are provided by NMFS in writing to all observer 
service providers approved pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section, 
NMFS shall notify the vessel owner, operator, or vessel manager whether 
the vessel must carry an observer, or if a waiver has been granted, for 
the specified scallop trip, within 24 hr of the vessel owner's, 
operator's, or vessel manager's notification of the prospective scallop 
trip, as specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. Any request to 
carry an observer may be waived by NMFS. All waivers for observer 
coverage shall be issued to the vessel by VMS so as to have on-board 
verification of the waiver. A vessel may not fish in an area with an 
observer waiver confirmation number that does not match the scallop trip 
plan that was called in to NMFS. Confirmation numbers for trip 
notification calls are only valid for 48 hr from the intended sail date; 
and
    (4) Procurement of observer services by scallop vessels. (i) An 
owner of a scallop vessel required to carry an observer under paragraph 
(g)(3) of this section must arrange for carrying an observer certified 
through the observer training class operated by the NMFS/NEFOP from an 
observer service provider approved by NMFS under paragraph (h) of this 
section. The owner, operator, or vessel manager of a vessel selected to 
carry an observer must contact the observer service provider and must 
provide at least 48-hr notice in advance of the fishing trip for the 
provider to arrange for observer deployment for the specified trip. The 
observer service provider will notify the vessel owner, operator, or 
manager within 18 hr whether they have an available observer. A list of 
approved observer service providers shall be posted on the NMFS/NEFOP 
Web site at http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/femad/fsb/. The observer service 
provider may take up to 48 hr to arrange for observer deployment for the 
specified scallop trip.
    (ii) An owner, operator, or vessel manager of a vessel that cannot 
procure a certified observer within 48 hr of the advance notification to 
the provider due to the unavailability of an observer may request a 
waiver from NMFS/NEFOP from the requirement for observer coverage for 
that trip, but only if the owner, operator, or vessel

[[Page 519]]

manager has contacted all of the available observer service providers to 
secure observer coverage and no observer is available. NMFS/NEFOP shall 
issue such a waiver within 24 hr, if the conditions of this paragraph 
(g)(4)(ii) are met. A vessel may not begin the trip without being issued 
a waiver.
    (5) Owners of scallop vessels shall be responsible for paying the 
cost of the observer for all scallop trips on which an observer is 
carried onboard the vessel, regardless of whether the vessel lands or 
sells sea scallops on that trip, and regardless of the availability of 
set-aside for an increased possession limit or reduced DAS accrual rate. 
The owners of vessels that carry an observer may be compensated with a 
reduced DAS accrual rate for open area scallop trips or additional 
scallop catch per day in Sea Scallop Access Areas in order to help 
defray the cost of the observer, under the program specified in 
Sec. Sec. 648.53 and 648.60.
    (i) Observer service providers shall establish the daily rate for 
observer coverage on a scallop vessel on an Access Area trip or open 
area DAS scallop trip consistent with paragraphs (g)(5)(i)(A) and (B), 
respectively, of this section.
    (A) Access Area trips. (1) For purposes of determining the daily 
rate for an observed scallop trip on a limited access vessel in a Sea 
Scallop Access Area when that specific Access Area's observer set-aside 
specified in Sec. 648.60(d)(1) has not been fully utilized, a service 
provider may charge a vessel owner for no more than the time an observer 
boards a vessel until the vessel disembarks (dock to dock), where 
``day'' is defined as a 24-hr period, or any portion of a 24-hr period, 
regardless of the calendar day. For example, if a vessel with an 
observer departs on July 1 at 10 p.m. and lands on July 3 at 1 a.m., the 
time at sea equals 27 hr, which would equate to 2 full ``days.''
    (2) For purposes of determining the daily rate in a specific Sea 
Scallop Access Area for an observed scallop trip on a limited access 
vessel taken after NMFS has announced the industry-funded observer set-
aside in that specific Access Area has been fully utilized, a service 
provider may charge a vessel owner for no more than the time an observer 
boards a vessel until the vessel disembarks (dock to dock), where 
``day'' is defined as a 24-hr period, and portions of the other days 
would be pro-rated at an hourly charge (taking the daily rate divided by 
24). For example, if a vessel with an observer departs on July 1 at 10 
p.m. and lands on July 3 at 1 a.m., the time spent at sea equals 27 hr, 
which would equate to 1 day and 3 hr.
    (3) For purposes of determining the daily rate in a specific Sea 
Scallop Access Area for observed scallop trips on an LAGC vessel, 
regardless of the status of the industry-funded observer set-aside, a 
service provider may charge a vessel owner for no more than the time an 
observer boards a vessel until the vessel disembarks (dock to dock), 
where ``day'' is defined as a 24-hr period, and portions of the other 
days would be pro-rated at an hourly charge (taking the daily rate 
divided by 24). For example, if a vessel with an observer departs on 
July 1 at 10 p.m. and lands on July 3 at 1 a.m., the time spent at sea 
equals 27 hr, which would equate to 1 day and 3 hr.
    (B) Open area scallop trips. For purposes of determining the daily 
rate for an observed scallop trip for open area DAS trips, a service 
provider shall charge dock to dock where ``day'' is defined as a 24-hour 
period, and portions of the other days would be pro-rated at an hourly 
charge (taking the daily rate divided by 24). For example, if a vessel 
with an observer departs on the July 1st at 10 pm and lands on July 3rd 
at 1 am, the time at sea equals 27 hours, so the provider would charge 1 
day and 3 hours.
    (ii) NMFS shall determine any reduced DAS accrual rate and the 
amount of additional pounds of scallops per day fished in a Sea Scallop 
Access Area for the applicable fishing year based on the economic 
conditions of the scallop fishery, as determined by best available 
information. Vessel owners and observer service providers shall be 
notified through the Small Entity Compliance Guide of any DAS accrual 
rate changes and any changes in additional pounds of scallops determined 
by

[[Page 520]]

the Regional Administrator to be necessary. Vessel owners and observer 
providers shall be notified by NMFS of any adjustments.
    (6) When the available DAS or TAC set-aside for observer coverage is 
exhausted, vessels shall still be required to carry an observer as 
specified in this section, and shall be responsible for paying for the 
cost of the observer, but shall not be authorized to harvest additional 
pounds or fish at a reduced DAS accrual rate.
    (h) Observer service provider approval and responsibilities--(1) 
General. An entity seeking to provide observer services to the Atlantic 
sea scallop fishery must apply for and obtain approval from NMFS 
following submission of a complete application to The Observer Program 
Branch Chief, 25 Bernard St. Jean Drive, East Falmouth, MA 02536. A list 
of approved observer service providers shall be distributed to scallop 
vessel owners and shall be posted on NMFS' Web page, as specified in

a denial, an observer provider is required to resubmit an application 
containing all of the information required under the application process 
specified in paragraph (h)(3) of this section to be re-considered for 
being added to the list of approved observer service providers.
    (5) Responsibilities of observer service providers. (i) An observer 
service provider must provide observers certified by NMFS/NEFOP pursuant 
to paragraph (i) of this section for deployment in the sea scallop 
fishery when contacted and contracted by the owner, operator, or vessel 
manager of a vessel fishing in the scallop fishery, unless the observer 
service provider does not have an available observer within 48 hr of 
receiving a request for an observer from a vessel owner, operator, and/
or manager, or refuses to deploy an observer on a requesting vessel for 
any of the reasons specified at paragraph (h)(5)(viii) of this section. 
An observer's first three deployments and the resulting data shall be 
immediately edited and approved after each trip, by NMFS/NEFOP, prior to 
any further deployments by that observer. If data quality is considered 
acceptable, the observer will be certified.
    (ii) An observer service provider must provide to each of its 
observers:
    (A) All necessary transportation, including arrangements and 
logistics, of observers to the initial location of deployment, to all 
subsequent vessel assignments, and to any debriefing locations, if 
necessary;
    (B) Lodging, per diem, and any other services necessary for 
observers assigned to a scallop vessel or to attend a NMFS/NEFOP Sea 
Scallop Observer Training class;
    (C) The required observer equipment, in accordance with equipment 
requirements listed on NMFS' Web site specified in paragraph (g)(4) of 
this section under the Sea Scallop Program, prior to any deployment and/
or prior to NMFS observer certification training; and
    (D) Individually assigned communication equipment, in working order, 
such as a cell phone or pager, for all necessary communication. An 
observer service provider may alternatively compensate observers for the 
use of the observer's personal cell phone or pager

[[Page 522]]

for communications made in support of, or necessary for, the observer's 
duties.
    (iii) Observer deployment logistics. Each approved observer service 
provider must assign an available certified observer to a vessel upon 
request. Each approved observer service provider must provide for access 
by industry 24 hr per day, 7 days per week, to enable an owner, 
operator, or manager of a vessel to secure observer coverage when 
requested. The telephone system must be monitored a minimum of four 
times daily to ensure rapid response to industry requests. Observer 
service providers approved under paragraph (h) of this section are 
required to report observer deployments to NMFS daily for the purpose of 
determining whether the predetermined coverage levels are being achieved 
in the scallop fishery.
    (iv) Observer deployment limitations. Unless alternative 
arrangements are approved by NMFS, an observer provider must not deploy 
any observer on the same vessel for more than two consecutive multi-day 
trips, and not more than twice in any given month for multi-day 
deployments.
    (v) Communications with observers. An observer service provider must 
have an employee responsible for observer activities on call 24 hr a day 
to handle emergencies involving observers or problems concerning 
observer logistics, whenever observers are at sea, stationed shoreside, 
in transit, or in port awaiting vessel assignment.
    (vi) Observer training requirements. The following information must 
be submitted to NMFS/NEFOP at least 7 days prior to the beginning of the 
proposed training class: A list of observer candidates; observer 
candidate resumes; and a statement signed by the candidate, under 
penalty of perjury, that discloses the candidate's criminal convictions, 
if any. All observer trainees must complete a basic cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation/first aid course prior to the end of a NMFS/NEFOP Sea 
Scallop Observer Training class. NMFS may reject a candidate for 
training if the candidate does not meet the minimum qualification 
requirements as outlined by NMFS/NEFOP Minimum Eligibility Standards for 
observers as described on the NMFS/NEFOP Web site.
    (vii) Reports --(A) Observer deployment reports. The observer 
service provider must report to NMFS/NEFOP when, where, to whom, and to 
what fishery (open or closed area) an observer has been deployed, within 
24 hr of the observer's departure. The observer service provider must 
ensure that the observer reports back to NMFS its Observer Contract 
(OBSCON) data, as described in the certified observer training, within 
24 hr of landing. OBSCON data are to be submitted electronically or by 
other means as specified by NMFS. The observer service provider shall 
provide the raw (unedited) data collected by the observer to NMFS within 
72 hr, which should be within 4 business days of the trip landing.
    (B) Safety refusals. The observer service provider must report to 
NMFS any trip that has been refused due to safety issues, e.g., failure 
to hold a valid USCG Commercial Fishing Vessel Safety Examination Decal 
or to meet the safety requirements of the observer's pre-trip vessel 
safety checklist, within 24 hr of the refusal.
    (C) Biological samples. The observer service provider must ensure 
that biological samples, including whole marine mammals, sea turtles, 
and sea birds, are stored/handled properly and transported to NMFS 
within 7 days of landing.
    (D) Observer debriefing. The observer service provider must ensure 
that the observer remains available to NMFS, either in-person or via 
phone, at NMFS' discretion, including NMFS Office for Law Enforcement, 
for debriefing for at least 2 weeks following any observed trip. If 
requested by NMFS, an observer that is at sea during the 2-week period 
must contact NMFS upon his or her return.
    (E) Observer availability report. The observer service provider must 
report to NMFS any occurrence of inability to respond to an industry 
request for observer coverage due to the lack of available observers by 
5 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, of any day on which the provider is 
unable to respond to an industry request for observer coverage.
    (F) Other reports. The observer provider must report possible 
observer

[[Page 523]]

harassment, discrimination, concerns about vessel safety or marine 
casualty, or observer illness or injury; and any information, 
allegations, or reports regarding observer conflict of interest or 
breach of the standards of behavior, to NMFS/NEFOP within 24 hr of the 
event or within 24 hr of learning of the event.
    (G) Observer status report. Providers must provide NMFS/NEFOP with 
an updated list of contact information for all observers that includes 
the observer identification number, observer's name, mailing address, 
email address, phone numbers, homeports or fisheries/trip types 
assigned, and must include whether or not the observer is ``in 
service,'' indicating when the observer has requested leave and/or is 
not currently working for the industry funded program.
    (H) Providers must submit to NMFS/NEFOP, if requested, a copy of 
each type of signed and valid contract (including all attachments, 
appendices, addendums, and exhibits incorporated into the contract) 
between the observer provider and those entities requiring observer 
services.
    (I) Providers must submit to NMFS/NEFOP, if requested, a copy of 
each type of signed and valid contract (including all attachments, 
appendices, addendums, and exhibits incorporated into the contract) 
between the observer provider and specific observers.
    (J) Providers must submit to NMFS/NEFOP, if requested, copies of any 
information developed and used by the observer providers distributed to 
vessels, such as informational pamphlets, payment notification, 
description of observer duties, etc.
    (viii) Refusal to deploy an observer. (A) An observer service 
provider may refuse to deploy an observer on a requesting scallop vessel 
if the observer service provider does not have an available observer 
within 72 hr of receiving a request for an observer from a vessel.
    (B) An observer service provider may refuse to deploy an observer on 
a requesting scallop vessel if the observer service provider has 
determined that the requesting vessel is inadequate or unsafe pursuant 
to the reasons described at Sec. 600.746.
    (C) The observer service provider may refuse to deploy an observer 
on a scallop vessel that is otherwise eligible to carry an observer for 
any other reason, including failure to pay for previous observer 
deployments, provided the observer service provider has received prior 
written confirmation from NMFS authorizing such refusal.
    (6) Limitations on conflict of interest. An observer service 
provider:
    (i) Must not have a direct or indirect interest in a fishery managed 
under Federal regulations, including, but not limited to, a fishing 
vessel, fish dealer, fishery advocacy group, and/or fishery research;
    (ii) Must assign observers without regard to any preference by 
representatives of vessels other than when an observer will be deployed; 
and
    (iii) Must not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any 
gratuity, gift, favor, entertainment, loan, or anything of monetary 
value from anyone who conducts fishing or fishing related activities 
that are regulated by NMFS, or who has interests that may be 
substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the 
official duties of observer providers.
    (7) Removal of observer service provider from the list of approved 
observer service providers. An observer provider that fails to meet the 
requirements, conditions, and responsibilities specified in paragraphs 
(h)(5) and (h)(6) of this section shall be notified by NMFS, in writing, 
that it is subject to removal from the list of approved observer service 
providers. Such notification shall specify the reasons for the pending 
removal. An observer service provider that has received notification 
that it is subject to removal from the list of approved observer service 
providers may submit written information to rebut the reasons for 
removal from the list. Such rebuttal must be submitted within 30 days of 
notification received by the observer service provider that the observer 
service provider is subject to removal and must be accompanied by 
written evidence rebutting the basis for removal. NMFS shall review 
information rebutting the pending removal and shall notify the observer 
service provider within 15 days of receipt of the rebuttal whether or 
not the removal is warranted. If no response to a pending removal is 
received by NMFS

[[Page 524]]

within 30 days of the notification of removal, the observer service 
provider shall be automatically removed from the list of approved 
observer service providers. The decision to remove the observer service 
provider from the list, either after reviewing a rebuttal, or 
automatically if no timely rebuttal is submitted, shall be the final 
decision of the Department of Commerce. Removal from the list of 
approved observer service providers does not necessarily prevent such 
observer service provider from obtaining an approval in the future if a 
new application is submitted that demonstrates that the reasons for 
removal are remedied. Certified observers under contract with an 
observer service provider that has been removed from the list of 
approved service providers must complete their assigned duties for any 
scallop trips on which the observers are deployed at the time the 
observer service provider is removed from the list of approved observer 
service providers. An observer service provider removed from the list of 
approved observer service providers is responsible for providing NMFS 
with the information required in paragraph (h)(5)(vii) of this section 
following completion of the trip. NMFS may consider, but is not limited 
to, the following in determining if an observer service provider may 
remain on the list of approved observer service providers:
    (i) Failure to meet the requirements, conditions, and 
responsibilities of observer service providers specified in paragraphs 
(h)(5) and (h)(6) of this section;
    (ii) Evidence of conflict of interest as defined under paragraph 
(h)(6) of this section;
    (iii) Evidence of criminal convictions related to:
    (A) Embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or 
destruction of records, making false statements, or receiving stolen 
property; or
    (B) The commission of any other crimes of dishonesty, as defined by 
state law or Federal law, that would seriously and directly affect the 
fitness of an applicant in providing observer services under this 
section;
    (iv) Unsatisfactory performance ratings on any Federal contracts 
held by the applicant; and
    (v) Evidence of any history of decertification as either an observer 
or observer provider.
    (i) Observer certification. (1) To be certified, employees or sub-
contractors operating as observers for observer service providers 
approved under paragraph (h) of this section must meet NMFS National 
Minimum Eligibility Standards for observers. NMFS National Minimum 
Eligibility Standards are available at the National Observer Program Web 
site: http://www.st.nmfs.gov/st4/nop/.
    (2) Observer training. In order to be deployed on any scallop 
vessel, a candidate observer must have passed a NMFS/NEFOP Sea Scallop 
Fisheries Observer Training course. If a candidate fails training, the 
candidate shall be notified in writing on or before the last day of 
training. The notification will indicate the reasons the candidate 
failed the training. A candidate that fails training shall not be able 
to enroll in a subsequent class. Observer training shall include an 
observer training trip, as part of the observer's training, aboard a 
scallop vessel with a trainer. A certified observer's first deployment 
and the resulting data shall be immediately edited, and approved, by 
NMFS prior to any further deployments of that observer.
    (3) Observer requirements. All observers must:
    (i) Have a valid NMFS/NEFOP fisheries observer certification 
pursuant to paragraph (i)(1) of this section;
    (ii) Be physically and mentally capable of carrying out the 
responsibilities of an observer on board scallop vessels, pursuant to 
standards established by NMFS. Such standards are available from NMFS/
NEFOP Web site specified in paragraph (g)(4) of this section and shall 
be provided to each approved observer service provider;
    (iii) Have successfully completed all NMFS-required training and 
briefings for observers before deployment, pursuant to paragraph (i)(2) 
of this section; and
    (iv) Hold a current Red Cross (or equivalence) CPR/first aid 
certification.

[[Page 525]]

    (v) Observers must accurately record their sampling data, write 
complete reports, and report accurately any observations relevant to 
conservation of marine resources or their environment.
    (4) Probation and decertification. NMFS has the authority to review 
observer certifications and issue observer certification probation and/
or decertification as described in NMFS policy found on the Web site at: 
http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/femad/fsb/.
    (5) Issuance of decertification. Upon determination that 
decertification is warranted under paragraphs (i)(1) through (3) of this 
section, NMFS shall issue a written decision to decertify the observer 
to the observer and approved observer service provider via certified 
mail at the observer's most current address provided to NMFS. The 
decision shall identify whether a certification is revoked and shall 
identify the specific reasons for the action taken. Decertification is 
effective immediately as of the date of issuance, unless the 
decertification official notes a compelling reason for maintaining 
certification for a specified period and under specified conditions. 
Decertification is the final decision of the Department of Commerce.
    (j) In the event that a vessel is requested by the Regional 
Administrator to carry a NMFS-certified fisheries observer pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section and is also selected to carry an at-sea 
monitor as part of an approved sector at-sea monitoring program 
specified in Sec. 648.87(b)(1)(v) for the same trip, only the NMFS-
certified fisheries observer is required to go on that particular trip.
    (k) NE multispecies observer coverage--(1) Pre-trip notification. 
Unless otherwise specified in this paragraph (k), or notified by the 
Regional Administrator, the owner, operator, or manager of a vessel 
(i.e., vessel manager or sector manager) issued a limited access NE 
multispecies permit that is fishing under a NE multispecies DAS or on a 
sector trip, as defined in this part, must provide advanced notice to 
NMFS of the vessel name, permit number, and sector to which the vessel 
belongs, if applicable; contact name and telephone number for 
coordination of observer deployment; date, time, and port of departure; 
area to be fished; and gear type to be used at least 48 hr prior to 
departing port on any trip declared into the NE multispecies fishery 
pursuant to Sec. 648.10 or Sec. 648.85, as instructed by the Regional 
Administrator, for the purposes of selecting vessels for observer 
deployment. For trips lasting 48 hr or less in duration from the time 
the vessel leaves port to begin a fishing trip until the time the vessel 
returns to port upon the completion of the fishing trip, the vessel 
owner, operator, or manager may make a weekly notification rather than 
trip-by-trip calls. For weekly notifications, a vessel must notify NMFS 
by 0001 hr of the Friday preceding the week (Sunday through Saturday) 
that they intend to complete at least one NE multispecies DAS or sector 
trip during the following week and provide the date, time, port of 
departure, area to be fished, and gear type to be used for each trip 
during that week. Trip notification calls must be made no more than 10 
days in advance of each fishing trip. The vessel owner, operator, or 
manager must notify NMFS of any trip plan changes at least 24 hr prior 
to vessel departure from port. A vessel may not begin the trip without 
being issued an observer notification or a waiver by NMFS.
    (2) Vessel selection for observer coverage. NMFS shall notify the 
vessel owner, operator, or manager whether the vessel must carry an 
observer, or if a waiver has been granted, for the specified trip within 
24 hr of the vessel owner's, operator's or manager's notification of the 
prospective trip, as specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section. All 
trip notifications shall be issued a unique confirmation number. A 
vessel may not fish in an area with an observer waiver confirmation 
number that does not match the trip plan that was called in to NMFS. 
Confirmation numbers for trip notification calls are valid for 48 hr 
from the intended sail date. If a trip is interrupted and returns to 
port due to bad weather or other circumstance beyond the operator's 
control, and goes back out within 48 hr, the same confirmation number 
and observer status remains. If the layover time is greater than 48 hr, 
a new trip notification must be made by the

[[Page 526]]

operator, owner, or manager of the vessel.

Sec. 648.12  Experimental fishing.

    The Regional Administrator may exempt any person or vessel from the 
requirements of subparts A (General provisions), B (Atlantic mackerel, 
squid, and butterfish), D (Atlantic sea scallop), E (Atlantic surfclam 
and ocean quahog), F (NE multispecies and monkfish), G (summer 
flounder), H (scup), I (black sea bass), J (Atlantic bluefish), K 
(Atlantic herring), L (spiny dogfish), M (Atlantic deep-sea red crab), N 
(tilefish), and O (skates) of this part for the conduct of experimental 
fishing beneficial to the management of the resources or fishery managed 
under that subpart. The Regional Administrator shall consult with the 
Executive Director of the MAFMC regarding such exemptions for the 
Atlantic mackerel, squid, butterfish, summer flounder, scup, black sea 
bass, spiny dogfish, bluefish, and tilefish fisheries.
    (a) The Regional Administrator may not grant such an exemption 
unless he/she determines that the purpose, design, and administration of 
the exemption is consistent with the management objectives of the 
respective FMP, the provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and other 
applicable law, and that granting the exemption will not:
    (1) Have a detrimental effect on the respective resources and 
fishery;
    (2) Cause any quota to be exceeded; or
    (3) Create significant enforcement problems.
    (b) Each vessel participating in any exempted experimental fishing 
activity is subject to all provisions of the respective FMP, except 
those necessarily relating to the purpose and nature of the exemption. 
The exemption will be specified in a letter issued by the Regional 
Administrator to each vessel participating in the exempted activity. 
This letter must be carried on board the vessel seeking the benefit of 
such exemption.
    (c) Experimental fishing for surfclams or ocean quahogs will not 
require an allocation permit.
    (d) Temporary possession letter of authorization (LOA): The Regional 
Administrator (RA), or the RA's designee, may issue an LOA to eligible 
researchers on board federally permitted fishing vessels on which 
species of fish that otherwise could not be legally retained would be 
possessed temporarily for the purpose of collecting catch data. Under 
this authorization, such species of fish could be retained temporarily 
for data collection purposes, but shall be discarded as soon as 
practicable following data collection.
    (1) Eligible activities. An LOA may be issued by the RA, or the RA's 
designee, to temporarily exempt a vessel, on which a qualified fishery 
research technician is collecting catch data, from the following types 
of fishery regulations: Minimum fish size restrictions; fish possession 
limits; species quota closures; prohibited fish species, not including 
species protected under the Endangered Species Act; and gear-specific 
fish possession restrictions.
    (2) Eligibility criteria. Only personnel from the following bodies 
are eligible for a temporary possession LOA: Foreign government agency; 
U.S. Government agency; U.S. state or territorial agency; university (or 
other educational institution accredited by a recognized national or 
international accreditation body); international treaty organization; or 
scientific institution.
    (3) Application requirements. To obtain a temporary possession LOA, 
an eligible applicant, as defined under paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section, is required to submit a complete application, which must 
contain the following information: The date of the application; the 
applicant's name, mailing address, and telephone number; a statement of 
the purposes and goals for which the LOA is needed; the name(s) and 
affiliation of the fishery research technicians will collect the data; a 
statement demonstrating the qualifications of the research technician 
that will collect the data; the species (target and incidental) expected 
to be harvested under

[[Page 527]]

the LOA; the proposed disposition of all regulated species harvested 
under the LOA; the approximate time(s) and place(s) fishing will take 
place; the type, size, and amount of gear to be used; and the signature 
of the applicant. In addition, for each vessel to be covered by the LOA, 
as soon as the information is available and before operations begin, the 
applicant is required to supply to NMFS the vessel operator name, the 
vessel's Federal fishing permit number, and the vessel registration or 
documentation number.

Sec. 648.13  Transfers at sea.

    (a) Only vessels issued a longfin squid and butterfish moratorium or 
Illex moratorium permit under Sec. 648.4(a)(5) and vessels issued a 
squid/butterfish incidental catch permit and authorized in writing by 
the Regional Administrator to do so, may transfer or attempt to transfer 
or receive longfin squid, Illex, or butterfish.
    (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
vessels issued a multispecies permit under Sec. 648.4(a)(1) or a 
scallop permit under Sec. 648.4(a)(2) are prohibited from transferring 
or attempting to transfer any fish from one vessel to another vessel, 
except that vessels issued a Federal multispecies permit under Sec. 
648.4(a)(1) and specifically authorized in writing by the Regional 
Administrator to do so, may transfer species other than regulated 
species from one vessel to another vessel.
    (2) Vessels issued a Federal multispecies permit under Sec. 
648.4(a)(1) may transfer from one vessel to another, for use as bait, up 
to 500 lb (226.8 kg) of silver hake and unlimited amounts of red hake, 
per trip, provided:
    (i) The transferring vessel possesses a Federal multispecies permit 
as specified under Sec. 648.4(a)(1);
    (ii) The transferring vessel has a letter of authorization issued by 
the Regional Administrator on board; and
    (iii) The receiving vessel possesses a written receipt for any 
small-mesh multispecies purchased at sea.
    (c) All persons are prohibited from transferring or attempting to 
transfer NE multispecies or scallops from one vessel to another vessel, 
except in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) All persons are prohibited from transferring or attempting to 
transfer at sea summer flounder from one vessel to another vessel, 
except for vessels that have not been issued a Federal permit and fish 
exclusively in state waters.
    (e) Vessels issued a letter of authorization from the Regional 
Administrator to transfer small-mesh multispecies at sea for use as bait 
will automatically have 500 lb (226.8 kg) deducted from the vessel's 
combined silver hake and offshore hake possession limit, as specified 
under Sec. 648.86(c), for every trip during the participation period 
specified on the letter of authorization, regardless of whether a 
transfer of small-mesh multispecies at sea occurred or whether the 
actual amount that was transferred was less than 500 lb (226.8 kg). This 
deduction shall be noted on the transferring vessel's letter of 
authorization from the Regional Administrator.
    (f) Atlantic herring. With the exception of transfers made to an at-
sea processing vessel issued the required permit under Sec. 
648.6(a)(2)(ii), any person or vessel, including any vessel issued an 
Atlantic herring permit, is prohibited from transferring, receiving, or 
attempting to transfer or receive any Atlantic herring taken from the 
EEZ, except as authorized in this paragraph (f), and in compliance with 
reporting requirements at Sec. 648.7 (b)(2)(i)(D).
    (1) Personal use as bait. (i) The operator of a vessel that is not 
issued an Atlantic herring permit may purchase and/or receive Atlantic 
herring at sea for personal use as bait, provided the vessel receiving 
the transfer does not have purse seine, midwater trawl, pelagic gillnet, 
sink gillnet, or bottom trawl gear on board;

or any authorized officer upon request; and
    (B) Provided that the transfer of herring at sea to another vessel 
for personal use as bait does not exceed the possession limit specified 
for the transferring vessel in Sec. 648.204, except that no more than 
2,000 lb (907.2 kg) of herring may be caught or transferred per trip or 
per calendar day if the vessel is in, or the fish were harvested from, a 
management area closed to fishing as specified in Sec. 648.201.
    (2) Atlantic herring carrier vessels. (i) A vessel issued an 
Atlantic herring permit may operate as a herring carrier vessel and 
receive herring provided it is issued a carrier vessel letter of 
authorization and complies with the terms of that authorization, as 
specified in Sec. 648.4(a)(10)(ii).
    (ii) A vessel issued an Atlantic herring permit may transfer herring 
at sea to an Atlantic herring carrier up to the applicable possession 
limits specified in Sec. 648.204, provided it is issued a letter of

an area closed to directed fishing as specified in Sec. 648.201.
    (3) If a herring management area has been closed to fishing as 
specified in Sec. 648.201, a vessel may not transfer Atlantic herring 
harvested from or in the area to an IWP or Joint Venture vessel.
    (4) If the amount of herring transshipped to a Canadian 
transshipment vessel would cause the amount of the border transfer 
specified pursuant to Sec. 648.200 to be exceeded, a vessel may not 
transfer Atlantic herring to a Canadian transshipment vessel permitted 
in accordance with Public Law 104-297.
    (5) Transfer to at-sea processors. A vessel issued an Atlantic 
herring permit may transfer herring to a vessel issued an at-sea 
processing permit specified in Sec. 648.6(a)(2)(ii), up to the 
applicable possession limit specified in Sec. 648.204, except that no 
more than 2,000 lb (907.2 kg) of herring may be caught or transferred at 
sea per trip or per calendar day if the vessel is in, or the fish were 
harvested from, a management area closed to directed fishing as 
specified in Sec. 648.201.
    (6) Transfers between herring vessels. A vessel issued a valid 
Atlantic herring permit may transfer and receive herring at sea, 
provided such vessel has been issued a letter of authorization from the 
Regional Administrator to transfer or receive herring at sea. Such 
vessel may not transfer, receive, or possess at sea, or land per trip 
herring in excess of the applicable possession limits specified in Sec. 
648.204, except that no more than 2,000 lb (907.2 kg) of herring may be 
caught, transferred, received, or possessed at sea, or landed per trip 
or per calendar day if the vessel is in, or the fish were harvested 
from, a management area closed to directed fishing as specified in Sec. 
648.201.
    (g) All persons are prohibited from transferring at sea, either 
directly or indirectly, or attempting to transfer at sea to any vessel, 
any red crab or red crab parts, taken in or from the EEZ portion of the 
Red Crab Management Unit.
    (h) Skates. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this 
section, all persons or vessels issued a Federal skate permit are 
prohibited from transferring, or attempting to transfer, at sea any 
skates to any vessel, and all persons or vessels not issued a Federal 
skate permit are prohibited from transferring, or attempting to 
transfer, at sea to any vessel any skates while in the EEZ, or skates

quahog zone must return to port and offload any surfclams or ocean 
quahogs prior to commencing fishing operations in the waters under the 
jurisdiction of any state.
    (4) Inspection by authorized officer. The vessel permits, the 
vessel, its gear, and catch shall be subject to inspection upon request 
by an authorized officer.
    (5) Authorization for use of fishing trip notification via 
telephone. The Regional Administrator may authorize or require the 
notification of surfclam or ocean quahog fishing trip information via a 
telephone call to the NMFS Office of Law Enforcement nearest to the 
point of offloading, instead of the use of VMS. If authorized, the 
vessel owner or operator must accurately provide the following 
information prior to departure of his/her vessel from the dock to fish 
for surfclams or ocean quahogs in the EEZ: Name of the vessel; NMFS

Federally permitted herring dealers and processors, including at-sea 
processors, that cull or separate out from the herring catch all fish 
other than herring in the course of normal operations, must separate out 
and retain all haddock offloaded from a vessel issued an All Areas 
Limited Access Herring Permit and/or an Areas 2 and 3 Limited Access 
Herring Permit that fished on a declared herring trip regardless of gear 
or area fished, or by a vessel issued a Limited Access Incidental Catch 
Herring Permit and/or an Open Access Herring Permit that fished with 
midwater trawl gear pursuant to Sec. 648.80(d). Such haddock may not be 
sold, purchased, received, traded, bartered, or transferred, and must be 
retained, after they have been separated, for at least 12 hr for dealers 
and processors on land, and for 12 hr after landing by at-sea 
processors. The dealer or processor, including at-sea processors, must 
clearly indicate the vessel that landed the retained haddock or 
transferred the retained haddock to an at-sea processor. Authorized 
officers must be given access to inspect the haddock.
    (2) All haddock separated out and retained is subject to reporting 
requirements specified at Sec. 648.7.
    (e) Retention of haddock by herring vessels using midwater trawl 
gear. A vessel issued an All Areas Limited Access Herring Permit and/or 
an Areas 2 and 3 Limited Access Herring Permit fishing on a declared 
herring trip regardless of gear or area fished, or a vessel issued a 
Limited Access Incidental Catch Herring Permit and/or an Open Access 
Herring Permit and fishing with midwater trawl gear pursuant to Sec. 
648.80(d), may not discard any haddock that has been brought on the deck 
or pumped into the hold.

Sec. 648.20  Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council ABC control rules.

    The SSC shall review the following criteria, and any additional 
relevant information, to assign managed stocks to a specific control 
rule level when developing ABC recommendations. The SSC shall review the 
ABC control rule level assignment for stocks each time an ABC is 
recommended. The ABC may be recommended for up to 3 years for all 
stocks, with the exception of 5 years for spiny dogfish. The SSC may 
deviate from the control rule methods or level criteria and recommend an 
ABC that differs from the result of the ABC control rule calculation; 
however, any such deviation must include the following: A description of 
why the deviation is warranted, description of the methods used to 
derive the alternative ABC, and an explanation of how the deviation is 
consistent with National Standard 2.
    (a) Level 1 criteria. (1) Assignment of a stock to Level 1 requires 
the SSC to determine the following:
    (i) All important sources of scientific uncertainty are captured in 
the stock assessment model;
    (ii) The probability distribution of the OFL is calculated within 
the stock assessment and provides an adequate description of the OFL 
uncertainty;
    (iii) The stock assessment model structure and treatment of the data 
prior to use in the model includes relevant details of the biology of 
the stock, fisheries that exploit the stock, and data collection 
methods;
    (iv) The stock assessment provides the following estimates: Fishing 
mortality rate (F) at MSY or an alternate maximum fishing mortality 
threshold (MFMT) to define OFL, biomass, biological reference points, 
stock status, OFL, and the respective uncertainties associated with each 
value; and
    (v) No substantial retrospective patterns exist in the stock 
assessment estimates of fishing mortality, biomass, and recruitment.
    (2) Level 1 ABC determination. Stocks assigned to Level 1 by the SSC 
will have the ABC derived by applying acceptable probability of 
overfishing from the MAFMC's risk policy found in Sec. 648.21(a) 
through (d) to the probability distribution of the OFL.
    (b) Level 2 criteria. (1) Assignment of a stock to Level 2 requires 
the SSC to determine the following:
    (i) Key features of the stock biology, the fisheries that exploit 
it, and/or the data collection methods for stock information are missing 
from the stock assessment;
    (ii) The stock assessment provides reference points (which may be 
proxies), stock status, and uncertainties associated with each; however, 
the uncertainty is not fully promulgated through the stock assessment 
model and/or some important sources of uncertainty may be lacking;

[[Page 566]]

    (iii) The stock assessment provides estimates of the precision of 
biomass, fishing mortality, and reference points; and
    (iv) The accuracy of the minimum fishing mortality threshold and 
projected future biomass is estimated in the stock assessment using ad 
hoc methods.
    (2) Level 2 ABC determination. Stocks assigned to Level 2 by the SSC 
will have the ABC derived by applying acceptable probability of 
overfishing from the MAFMC's risk policy found in Sec. 648.21(a) 
through (d) to the probability distribution of the OFL.
    (c) Level 3 criteria. (1) Assignment of a stock to Level 3 requires 
the SSC to determine that the stock assessment attributes are the same 
as those for a Level 2 assessment listed in Sec. 648.20(d)(1) through 
(4), except that the stock assessment does not contain an estimated 
probability distribution of OFL or the stock assessment provided OFL 
probability distribution is judged by the SSC to not adequately reflect 
uncertainty in the OFL estimate.
    (2) Level 3 ABC determination. Stocks assigned to Level 3 will have 
ABC derived by one of the following two methods:
    (i) The SSC will derive the ABC by applying the acceptable 
probability of overfishing from the MAFMC's risk policy found in Sec. 
648.21(a) through (d) to an SSC-adjusted OFL probability distribution. 
The SSC will use default levels of uncertainty in the adjusted OFL 
probability distribution based on literature review and evaluation of 
control rule performance; or,
    (ii) If the SSC cannot develop an OFL distribution, a default 
control rule of 75 percent of the F<INF>MSY</INF> value will be applied 
to derive ABC.
    (d) Level 4 criteria. (1) Assignment of a stock to Level 4 requires 
the SSC to determine that none of the criteria for Levels 1-3 found in 
Sec. 648.20(a) through (c) were met.
    (2) Level 4 ABC determination. Stocks assigned to Level 4 will have 
ABC derived using control rules developed on a case-by-case basis by the 
SSC based on biomass and catch history and application of the MAFMC's 
risk policy found in Sec. 648.21(a) through (d).

<R05>
Sec. 648.21  Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council risk policy.

    The risk policy shall be used by the SSC in conjunction with the ABC 
control rules in Sec. 648.20(a) through (d) to ensure the MAFMC's 
preferred tolerance for the risk of overfishing is addressed in the ABC 
development and recommendation process.
    (a) Stocks under a rebuilding plan. The probability of not exceeding 
the F necessary to rebuild the stock within the specified time frame 
(rebuilding F or F<INF>REBUILD</INF>) must be at least 50 percent, 
unless the default level is modified to a higher probability for not 
exceeding the rebuilding F through the formal stock rebuilding plan. A 
higher probability of not exceeding the rebuilding F would be expressed 
as a value greater than 50 percent (e.g., 75-percent probability of not 
exceeding rebuilding F, which corresponds to a 25-percent probability of 
exceeding rebuilding F).
    (b) Stocks not subject to a rebuilding plan. (1) For stocks 
determined by the SSC to have an atypical life history, the maximum 
probability of overfishing as informed by the OFL distribution will be 
35 percent for stocks with a ratio of biomass (B) to biomass at MSY 
(B<INF>MSY</INF>) of 1.0 or higher (i.e., the stock is at 
B<INF>MSY</INF> or higher). The maximum probability of overfishing shall 
decrease linearly from the maximum value of 35 percent as the B/
B<INF>MSY</INF> ratio becomes less than 1.0 (i.e., the stock biomass 
less than B<INF>MSY</INF>) until the probability of overfishing becomes 
zero at a B/B<INF>MSY</INF> ratio of 0.10. An atypical life history is 
generally defined as one that has greater vulnerability to exploitation 
and whose characteristics have not been fully addressed through the 
stock assessment and biological reference point development process.
    (2) For stocks determined by the SSC to have a typical life history, 
the maximum probability of overfishing as informed by the OFL 
distribution will be 40 percent for stocks with a ratio of B to 
B<INF>MSY</INF> of 1.0 or higher (i.e., the stock is at B<INF>MSY</INF> 
or higher). The maximum probability of overfishing shall decrease 
linearly from the maximum

[[Page 567]]

value of 40 percent as the B/B<INF>MSY</INF> ratio becomes less 1.0 
(stock biomass less than B<INF>MSY</INF>) until the probability of 
overfishing becomes zero at a B/B<INF>MSY</INF> ratio of 0.10. Stocks 
with typical life history are those not meeting the criteria in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (c) For instances in which the application of the risk policy 
approaches in either paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section using OFL 
distribution, as applicable given life history determination, results in 
a more restrictive ABC recommendation than the calculation of ABC 
derived from the use of F<INF>REBUILD</INF> at the MAFMC-specified 
overfishing risk level as outlined in paragraph (a) of this section, the 
SSC shall recommend to the MAFMC the lower of the ABC values.
    (d) Stock without an OFL or OFL proxy. (1) If an OFL cannot be 
determined from the stock assessment, or if a proxy is not provided by 
the SSC during the ABC recommendation process, ABC levels may not be 
increased until such time that an OFL has been identified.
    (2) The SSC may deviate from paragraph (d)(1) of this section, 
provided that the following two criteria are met: Biomass-based 
reference points indicate that the stock is greater than B<INF>MSY</INF> 
and stock biomass is stable or increasing, or if biomass based reference 
points are not available, best available science indicates that stock 
biomass is stable or increasing; and the SSC provides a determination 
that, based on best available science, the recommended increase to the 
ABC is not expected to result in overfishing. Any such deviation must 
include a description of why the increase is warranted, description of 
the methods used to derive the alternative ABC, and a certification that 
the ABC is not likely to result in overfishing on the stock.

Sec. 648.22  Atlantic mackerel, squid, and butterfish specifications.

    (a) Initial recommended annual specifications. The Atlantic 
Mackerel, Squid, and Butterfish Monitoring Committee (Monitoring 
Committee) shall meet annually to develop and recommend the following 
specifications for consideration by the Squid, Mackerel, and Butterfish 
Committee of the MAFMC:
    (1) Initial OY (IOY), including Research Set-Aside (RSA), DAH, and 
DAP for Illex squid, which, subject to annual review, may be specified 
for a period of up to 3 years;
    (2) ACL; ACT including RSA, DAH, DAP; bycatch level of the TALFF, if 
any; and butterfish mortality cap for the longfin squid fishery for 
butterfish; which, subject to annual review, may be specified for a 
period of up to 3 years;
    (3) ACL; commercial ACT, including RSA, DAH, Tier 3 allocation (up 
to 7 percent of the DAH), DAP; JVP if any; TALFF, if any; and 
recreational ACT, including RSA for mackerel; which, subject to annual 
review, may be specified for a period of up to 3 years. The Monitoring 
Committee may also recommend that certain ratios of TALFF, if any, for 
mackerel to purchases of domestic harvested fish and/or domestic 
processed fish be established in relation to the initial annual amounts.
    (4) IOY, including RSA, DAH, and DAP for longfin squid, which, 
subject to annual review, may be specified for a period of up to 3 
years; and
    (5) Inseason adjustment, upward or downward, to the specifications 
for longfin squid, as specified in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (b) Guidelines. As the basis for its recommendations under paragraph 
(a) of this section, the Monitoring Committee shall review the best 
available data to recommend specifications consistent with the 
following:
    (1) Longfin and/or Illex squid. (i) The ABC for any fishing year 
must be either the maximum OY, or a lower amount, if stock assessments 
indicate that the potential yield is less than the maximum OY. The OYs 
specified during a fishing year may not exceed the following amounts:
    (A) Longfin squid--The catch associated with a fishing mortality 
rate of F<INF>Threshold.</INF>
    (B) Illex--Catch associated with a fishing mortality rate of 
F<INF>MSY.</INF>
    (ii) IOY is a modification of ABC based on social and economic 
factors. The IOY is composed of RSA and DAH.

[[Page 568]]

RSA will be based on requests for research quota as described in 
paragraph (g) of this section. DAH will be set after deduction for RSA, 
if applicable.
    (2) Mackerel--(i) ABC. The MAFMC's SSC shall recommend an ABC to the 
MAFMC, as described in Sec. 648.20. The mackerel ABC is reduced from 
the OFL based on an adjustment for scientific uncertainty; the ABC must 
be less than or equal to the OFL.
    (ii) ACL. The ACL or Domestic ABC is calculated using the formula 
ACL = ABC - C, where C is the estimated catch of mackerel in Canadian 
waters for the upcoming fishing year.
    (iii) OY. OY may not exceed the ACL, and must take into account the 
need to prevent overfishing while allowing the fishery to achieve OY on 
a continuing basis. OY is prescribed on the basis of MSY, as reduced by 
social, economic, and ecological factors.
    (iv) ACT. The Monitoring Committee shall identify and review 
relevant sources of management uncertainty to recommend ACTs for the 
commercial and recreational fishing sectors as part of the 
specifications process.
    (A) Commercial sector ACT. Commercial ACT is composed of RSA, DAH, 
Tier 3 allocation (up to 7 percent of DAH), dead discards, and TALFF, if 
any. RSA will be based on requests for research quota as described in 
paragraph (g) of this section. DAH, Tier 3 allocation (up to 7 of the 
DAH), DAP, and JVP will be set after deduction for RSA, if applicable, 
and must be projected by reviewing data from sources specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section and other relevant data, including past 
domestic landings, projected amounts of mackerel necessary for domestic 
processing and for joint ventures during the fishing year, projected 
recreational landings, and other data pertinent for such a projection. 
The JVP component of DAH is the portion of DAH that domestic processors 
either cannot or will not use. Economic considerations for the 
establishment of JVP and TALFF include:
    (1) Total world export potential of mackerel producing countries.
    (2) Total world import demand of mackerel consuming countries.
    (3) U.S. export potential based on expected U.S. harvests, expected 
U.S. consumption, relative prices, exchange rates, and foreign trade 
barriers.
    (4) Increased/decreased revenues to the U.S. from foreign fees.
    (5) Increased/decreased revenues to U.S. harvesters (with/without 
joint ventures).
    (6) Increased/decreased revenues to U.S. processors and exporters.
    (7) Increases/decreases in U.S. harvesting productivity due to 
decreases/increases in foreign harvest.
    (8) Increases/decreases in U.S. processing productivity.
    (9) Potential impact of increased/decreased TALFF on foreign 
purchases of U.S. products and services and U.S.-caught fish, changes in 
trade barriers, technology transfer, and other considerations.
    (B) Recreational sector ACT. Recreational ACT is composed of RSA, 
dead discards, and the Recreational Harvest Limit (RHL).
    (v) Performance review. The Squid, Mackerel, and Butterfish 
Committee shall conduct a detailed review of fishery performance 
relative to the mackerel ACL at least every 5 years.
    (A) If the ACL is exceeded with a frequency greater than 25 percent 
(i.e., more than once in 4 years or any two consecutive years), the 
Squid, Mackerel, and Butterfish Monitoring Committee will review fishery 
performance information and make recommendations to the MAFMC for 
changes in measures intended to ensure ACLs are not exceeded as 
frequently.
    (B) The MAFMC may specify more frequent or more specific ACL 
performance review criteria as part of a stock rebuilding plan following 
a determination that a stock has become overfished.
    (C) Performance reviews shall not substitute for annual reviews that 
occur to ascertain if prior year ACLs have been exceeded, but may be 
conducted in conjunction with such reviews.
    (3) Butterfish--(i) ABC. The MAFMC's SSC shall recommend an ABC to 
the MAFMC, as described in Sec. 648.20. The butterfish ABC is reduced 
from the OFL based on an adjustment for scientific uncertainty; the ABC 
must be less than or equal to the OFL.

[[Page 569]]

    (ii) ACL. The butterfish ACL will be set equal to the butterfish 
ABC.
    (iii) OY. OY may not exceed the ACL, and must take into account the 
need to prevent overfishing while allowing the fishery to achieve OY on 
a continuing basis. OY is prescribed on the basis of MSY, as reduced by 
social, economic, and ecological factors.
    (iv) ACT. The Monitoring Committee shall identify and review 
relevant sources of management uncertainty to recommend the butterfish 
ACT as part of the specifications process. The ACT is composed of RSA, 
DAH, dead discards, and bycatch TALFF that is equal to 0.08 percent of 
the allocated portion of the mackerel TALFF. RSA will be based on 
requests for research quota as described in paragraph (g) of this 
section. DAH and bycatch TALFF will be set after deduction for RSA, if 
applicable.
    (v) The butterfish mortality cap will be based on the ACT and 
allocated to the longfin squid fishery as follows: Trimester I--65 
percent; Trimester II--3.3 percent; and Trimester III--31.7 percent.
    (vi) Any underages of the butterfish mortality cap for Trimesters I 
or II will be applied to Trimester III of the same year, and any 
overages of the butterfish mortality cap for Trimesters I and II will be 
applied to Trimester III of the same year.
    (vii) Performance review. The Squid, Mackerel, and Butterfish 
Committee shall conduct a detailed review of fishery performance 
relative to the butterfish ACL in conjunction with review for the 
mackerel fishery, as outlined in this section.
    (c) Recommended measures. Based on the review of the data described 
in paragraph (b) of this section and requests for research quota as 
described in paragraph (g) of this section, the Monitoring Committee 
will recommend to the Squid, Mackerel, and Butterfish Committee the 
measures from the following list that it determines are necessary to 
ensure that the specifications are not exceeded:
    (1) RSA set from a range of 0 to 3 percent of:
    (i) The IOY for longfin squid and/or Illex.
    (ii) The commercial and/or recreational ACT for mackerel.
    (iii) The ACT for butterfish.
    (2) Commercial quotas, set after reductions for research quotas.
    (3) The amount of longfin squid, Illex, and butterfish that may be 
retained and landed by vessels issued the incidental catch permit 
specified in Sec. 648.4(1)(5)(ii), and the amount of mackerel that may 
be retained, possessed and landed by any of the limited access mackerel 
permits described at Sec. 648.4(1)(5)(iii) and the incidental mackerel 
permit at Sec. 648.4(1)(5)(iv).
    (4) Commercial minimum fish sizes.
    (5) Commercial trip limits.
    (6) Commercial seasonal quotas/closures for longfin squid and Illex, 
and allocation for the Limited Access Mackerel Tier 3.
    (7) Minimum mesh sizes.
    (8) Commercial gear restrictions.
    (9) Recreational allocation for mackerel.
    (10) Recreational minimum fish size.
    (11) Recreational possession limits.
    (12) Recreational season.
    (13) [Reserved]
    (14) Modification of existing accountability measures (AMs) utilized 
by the Monitoring Committee.
    (d) Annual fishing measures. (1) The Squid, Mackerel, and Butterfish 
Committee will review the recommendations of the Monitoring Committee. 
Based on these recommendations and any public comment received thereon, 
the Squid, Mackerel, and Butterfish Committee must recommend to the 
MAFMC appropriate specifications and any measures necessary to assure 
that the specifications will not be exceeded. The MAFMC will review 
these recommendations and, based on the recommendations and any public 
comment received thereon, must recommend to the Regional Administrator 
appropriate specifications and any measures necessary to assure that the 
ACL will not be exceeded. The MAFMC's recommendations must include 
supporting documentation, as appropriate, concerning the environmental, 
economic, and social impacts of the recommendations. The Regional 
Administrator will review the recommendations and will publish a 
proposed rule in the Federal Register

[[Page 570]]

proposing specifications and any measures necessary to assure that the 
specifications will not be exceeded and providing a 30-day public 
comment period. If the proposed specifications differ from those 
recommended by the MAFMC, the reasons for any differences must be 
clearly stated and the revised specifications must satisfy the criteria 
set forth in this section. The MAFMC's recommendations will be available 
for inspection at the office of the Regional Administrator during the 
public comment period. If the annual specifications for squid, mackerel, 
and butterfish are not published in the Federal Register prior to the 
start of the fishing year, the previous year's annual specifications, 
excluding specifications of TALFF, will remain in effect. The previous 
year's specifications will be superceded as of the effective date of the 
final rule implementing the current year's annual specifications.
    (2) The Regional Administrator will make a final determination 
concerning the specifications for each species and any measures 
necessary to assure that the specifications will not be exceeded. After 
the Regional Administrator considers all relevant data and any public 
comments, notification of the final specifications and any measures 
necessary to assure that the specifications will not be exceeded and 
responses to the public comments will be published in the Federal 
Register. If the final specification amounts differ from those 
recommended by the MAFMC, the reason(s) for the difference(s) must be 
clearly stated and the revised specifications must be consistent with 
the criteria set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (e) Inseason adjustments. The specifications established pursuant to 
this section may be adjusted by the Regional Administrator, in 
consultation with the MAFMC, during the fishing year by publishing 
notification in the Federal Register.
    (f) Distribution of annual longfin squid commercial quota. (1) A 
commercial quota for longfin squid will be allocated annually into 
trimester periods, based on the following percentages: Trimester I 
(January-April)--43.0 percent; Trimester II (May-August)--17.0 percent; 
and Trimester III (September-December)--40.0 percent.
    (2) Any underages of commercial period quota for Trimester I that 
are greater than 25 percent of the Trimester I quota will be reallocated 
to Trimesters II and III of the same year. The reallocation of quota 
from Trimester I to Trimester II is limited, such that the Trimester II 
quota may only be increased by 50 percent; the remaining portion of the 
underage will be reallocated to Trimester III. Any underages of 
commercial period quota for Trimester I that are less than 25 percent of 
the Trimester I quota will be applied to Trimester III of the same year. 
Any overages of commercial quota for Trimesters I and II will be 
subtracted from Trimester III of the same year.
    (g) Research set-aside (RSA) quota. Prior to the MAFMC's quota-
setting meetings:
    (1) NMFS will publish a Request for Proposals (RFP) in the Federal 
Register, consistent with procedures and requirements established by the 
NOAA Grants Office, to solicit proposals from industry for the upcoming 
fishing year, based on research priorities identified by the MAFMC.
    (2) NMFS will convene a review panel, including the MAFMC's 
Comprehensive Management Committee and technical experts, to review 
proposals submitted in response to the RFP.
    (i) Each panel member will recommend which research proposals should 
be authorized to utilize research quota, based on the selection criteria 
described in the RFP.
    (ii) The NEFSC Director and the NOAA Grants Office will consider 
each panel member's recommendation, and provide final approval of the 
projects. The Regional Administrator may, when appropriate, exempt 
selected vessel(s) from regulations specified in each of the respective 
FMPs through written notification to the project proponent.
    (3) The grant awards approved under the RFPs will be for the 
upcoming fishing year. Proposals to fund research that would start prior 
to, or that would end after the fishing year, will not be eligible for 
consideration. All research

[[Page 571]]

and/or compensation trips must be completed within the fishing year for 
which the research grant was awarded.
    (4) Research projects will be conducted in accordance with 
provisions approved and provided in an Exempted Fishing Permit (EFP) 
issued by the Regional Administrator.
    (5) If a proposal is disapproved by the NEFSC Director or the NOAA 
Grants Office, or if the Regional Administrator determines that the 
allocated research quota cannot be utilized by a project, the Regional 
Administrator shall reallocate the unallocated or unused amount of 
research quota to the respective commercial and recreational fisheries 
by publication of a notice in the Federal Register in compliance with 
the Administrative Procedure Act, provided:
    (i) The reallocation of the unallocated or unused amount of research 
quota is in accord with National Standard 1, and can be available for 
harvest before the end of the fishing year for which the research quota 
is specified; and
    (ii) Any reallocation of unallocated or unused research quota shall 
be consistent with the proportional division of quota between the 
commercial and recreational fisheries in the relevant FMP and allocated 
to the remaining quota periods for the fishing year proportionally.
    (6) Vessels participating in approved research projects may be 
exempted from certain management measures by the Regional Administrator, 
provided that one of the following analyses of the impacts associated 
with the exemptions is provided:
    (i) The analysis of the impacts of the requested exemptions is 
included as part of the annual quota specification packages submitted by 
the MAFMC; or
    (ii) For proposals that require exemptions that extend beyond the 
scope of the analysis provided by the MAFMC, applicants may be required 
to provide additional analysis of impacts of the exemptions before 
issuance of an EFP will be considered, as specified in the EFP 
regulations at Sec. 648.12(b).

Sec. 648.23  Mackerel, squid, and butterfish gear restrictions.

    (a) Mesh restrictions and exemptions. Vessels subject to the mesh 
restrictions in this paragraph (a) may not have available for immediate 
use any net, or any piece of net, with a mesh size smaller than that 
specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.
    (1) Butterfish fishery. Owners or operators of otter trawl vessels 
possessing 2,000 lb (0.9 mt) or more of butterfish harvested in or from 
the EEZ may only fish with nets having a minimum codend mesh of 3 inches 
(76 mm) diamond mesh, inside stretch measure, applied throughout the 
codend for at least 100 continuous meshes forward of the terminus of the 
net, or for codends with less than 100 meshes, the minimum mesh size 
codend shall be a minimum of one-third of the net, measured from the 
terminus of the codend to the headrope.
    (2) Longfin squid fishery. Owners or operators of otter trawl 
vessels possessing longfin squid harvested in or from the EEZ may only 
fish with nets having a minimum mesh size of 2\1/8\ inches (54 mm) 
during Trimesters I (Jan-Apr) and III (Sept-Dec), or 1\7/8\ inches (48 
mm) during Trimester II (May-Aug), diamond mesh, inside stretch measure, 
applied throughout the codend for at least 150 continuous meshes forward 
of the terminus of the net, or, for codends with less than 150 meshes, 
the minimum mesh size codend shall be a minimum of one-third of the net 
measured from the terminus of the codend to the headrope, unless they 
are fishing consistent with exceptions specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (i) Net obstruction or constriction. Owners or operators of otter 
trawl vessels fishing for and/or possessing longfin squid shall not use 
any device, gear, or material, including, but not limited to, nets, net 
strengtheners, ropes, lines, or chafing gear, on the top of the 
regulated portion of a trawl net that results in an effective mesh 
opening of less than 2\1/8\ inches (54 mm) during Trimesters I (Jan-Apr) 
and III (Sept-Dec), or 1\7/8\ inches (48 mm) during Trimester II (May-
Aug), diamond mesh, inside stretch measure. ``Top of the regulated

[[Page 572]]

portion of the net'' means the 50 percent of the entire regulated 
portion of the net that would not be in contact with the ocean bottom 
if, during a tow, the regulated portion of the net were laid flat on the 
ocean floor. However, owners or operators of otter trawl vessels fishing 
for and/or possessing longfin squid may use net strengtheners (covers), 
splitting straps, and/or bull ropes or wire around the entire 
circumference of the codend, provided they do not have a mesh opening of 
less than 5 inches (12.7 cm) diamond mesh, inside stretch measure. For 
the purposes of this requirement, head ropes are not to be considered 
part of the top of the regulated portion of a trawl net.
    (ii) Jigging exemption. During closures of the longfin squid fishery 
resulting from the butterfish mortality cap, described in Sec. 
648.26(c)(3), vessels fishing for longfin squid using jigging gear are 
exempt from the closure possession limit specified in Sec. 648.26(b), 
provided that all otter trawl gear is stowed as specified in paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (3) Illex fishery. Seaward of the following coordinates, otter trawl 
vessels possessing longfin squid harvested in or from the EEZ and 
fishing for Illex during the months of June, July, August, in Trimester 
II, and September in Trimester III are exempt from the longfin squid 
gear requirements specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, 
provided that landward of the specified coordinates they do not have 
available for immediate use, as defined in paragraph (b) of this 
section, any net, or any piece of net, with a mesh size less than 1\7/8\ 
inches (48 mm) diamond mesh in Trimester II, and 2\1/8\ inches (54 mm) 
diamond mesh in Trimester III, or any piece of net, with mesh that is 
rigged in a manner that is prohibited by paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section.

Sec. 648.24  Fishery closures and accountability measures.

    (a) Fishery closure procedures--(1) Longfin squid. NMFS shall close 
the directed fishery in the EEZ for longfin squid when the Regional 
Administrator projects that 90 percent of the longfin squid quota is 
harvested in Trimesters I and II, and when 95 percent of the longfin 
squid DAH has been harvested in Trimester III. The closure of the 
directed fishery shall be in effect for the remainder of that fishing 
period, with incidental catches allowed as specified at Sec. 648.26.
    (i) If the Regional Administrator determines that the Trimester I 
closure threshold has been under-harvested by 25 percent or more, then 
the amount of the underharvest shall be reallocated to Trimester II and 
Trimester III, as specified at Sec. 648.22(f)(2), through notice in the 
Federal Register.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (2) Illex. NMFS shall close the directed Illex fishery in the EEZ 
when the Regional Administrator projects that 95 percent of the Illex 
DAH is harvested. The closure of the directed fishery shall be in effect 
for the remainder of that fishing period, with incidental catches 
allowed as specified at Sec. 648.26.
    (b) Mackerel AMs--(1) Mackerel commercial sector EEZ closure. NMFS 
shall close the commercial mackerel fishery in the EEZ when the Regional 
Administrator projects that 95 percent of the mackerel DAH is harvested, 
if such a closure is necessary to prevent the DAH from being exceeded. 
The closure of the commercial fishery shall be in effect for the 
remainder of that fishing year, with incidental catches allowed as 
specified in Sec. 648.26. When the Regional Administrator projects that 
the DAH for mackerel will be landed, NMFS shall close the commercial 
mackerel fishery in the EEZ, and the incidental catches specified for 
mackerel in Sec. 648.26 will be prohibited.
    (2) Mackerel commercial landings overage repayment. If the mackerel 
ACL is exceeded, and commercial fishery landings are responsible for the 
overage, then landings in excess of the DAH will be deducted from the 
DAH the following year, as a single-year adjustment to the DAH.

[[Page 574]]

    (3) Mackerel recreational sector EEZ closure. NMFS shall close the 
recreational mackerel fishery in the EEZ when the Regional Administrator 
determines that recreational landings have exceeded the RHL. This 
determination shall be based on observed landings and will not utilize 
projections of future data.
    (4) Mackerel recreational landings overage repayment. If the 
mackerel ACL is exceeded, and the recreational fishery landings are 
responsible for the overage, then landings in excess of the RHL will be 
deducted from the RHL for the following year, as a single-year 
adjustment.
    (5) Non-landing AMs, by sector. In the event that the ACL is 
exceeded, and that the overage has not been accommodated through other 
landing-based AMs, but is attributable to either the commercial or 
recreational sector (such as research quota overages, dead discards in 
excess of those otherwise accounted for in management uncertainty, or 
other non-landing overages), then the exact amount, in pounds, by which 
the sector ACT was exceeded will be deducted from the following year, as 
a single-year adjustment.
    (6) Mackerel ACL overage evaluation. The ACL will be evaluated based 
on a single-year examination of total catch (landings and discards). 
Both landings and dead discards will be evaluated in determining if the 
ACL has been exceeded. NMFS shall make determinations about overages and 
implement any changes to the ACL, in accordance with the Administrative 
Procedure Act, through notification in the Federal Register, by March 31 
of the fishing year in which the deductions will be made.
    (c) Butterfish AMs--(1) Butterfish EEZ closure. NMFS shall close the 
directed butterfish fishery in the EEZ when the Regional Administrator 
projects that 80 percent of the butterfish DAH has been harvested. The 
closure of the directed fishery shall be in effect for the remainder of 
that fishing year, with incidental catches allowed as specified at Sec. 
648.26.
    (2) Butterfish ACL overage repayment. If the butterfish ACL is 
exceeded, then catch in excess of the ACL will be deducted from the ACL 
the following year, as a single-year adjustment.
    (3) Butterfish mortality cap on the longfin squid fishery. NMFS 
shall close the directed fishery in the EEZ for longfin squid when the 
Regional Administrator projects that 80 percent of the butterfish 
mortality cap has been harvested in Trimester I, and/or when 90 percent 
of the butterfish mortality cap has been harvested in Trimester III.
    (4) Butterfish ACL overage evaluation. The ACL will be evaluated 
based on a single-year examination of total catch (landings and 
discards). Both landings and dead discards will be evaluated in 
determining if the ACL has been exceeded. NMFS shall make determinations 
about overages and implement any changes to the ACL, in accordance with 
the Administrative Procedure Act, through notification in the Federal 
Register, by March 31 of the fishing year in which the deductions will 
be made.
    (d) Notification. Upon determining that a closure is necessary, the 
Regional Administrator will notify, in advance of the closure, the 
Executive Directors of the MAFMC, NEFMC, and SAFMC; mail notification of 
the closure to all holders of mackerel, squid, and butterfish fishery 
permits at least 72 hours before the effective date of the closure; 
provide adequate notice of the closure to recreational participants in 
the fishery; and publish notification of closure in the Federal 
Register.

<R05>
Sec. 648.25  Atlantic Mackerel, squid, and butterfish framework 
adjustments to management measures.

    (a) Within season management action. The MAFMC may, at any time, 
initiate action to add or adjust management measures within the Atlantic 
Mackerel, Squid, and Butterfish FMP if it finds that action is necessary 
to meet or be consistent with the goals and objectives of the FMP.
    (1) Adjustment process. The MAFMC shall develop and analyze 
appropriate management actions over the span of at least two MAFMC 
meetings. The MAFMC must provide the public with

[[Page 575]]

advance notice of the availability of the recommendation(s), appropriate 
justification(s) and economic and biological analyses, and the 
opportunity to comment on the proposed adjustment(s) at the first 
meeting and prior to and at the second MAFMC meeting. The MAFMC's 
recommendations on adjustments or additions to management measures must 
come from one or more of the following categories: Adjustments within 
existing ABC control rule levels; adjustments to the existing MAFMC risk 
policy; introduction of new AMs, including sub-ACTs; minimum fish size; 
maximum fish size; gear restrictions; gear requirements or prohibitions; 
permitting restrictions, recreational possession limit; recreational 
seasons; closed areas; commercial seasons; commercial trip limits; 
commercial quota system, including commercial quota allocation procedure 
and possible quota set-asides to mitigate bycatch; recreational harvest 
limit; annual specification quota setting process; FMP Monitoring 
Committee composition and process; description and identification of EFH 
(and fishing gear management measures that impact EFH); description and 
identification of habitat areas of particular concern; overfishing 
definition and related thresholds and targets; regional gear 
restrictions; regional season restrictions (including option to split 
seasons); restrictions on vessel size (LOA and GRT) or shaft horsepower; 
any other management measures currently included in the FMP, set aside 
quota for scientific research, regional management, and process for 
inseason adjustment to the annual specification. Measures contained 
within this list that require significant departures from previously 
contemplated measures or that are otherwise introducing new concepts may 
require amendment of the FMP instead of a framework adjustment.
    (2) MAFMC recommendation. After developing management actions and 
receiving public testimony, the MAFMC shall make a recommendation to the 
Regional Administrator. The MAFMC's recommendation must include 
supporting rationale, if management measures are recommended, an 
analysis of impacts, and a recommendation to the Regional Administrator 
on whether to issue the management measures as a final rule. If the 
MAFMC recommends that the management measures should be issued as a 
final rule, the MAFMC must consider at least the following factors, and 
provide support and analysis for each factor considered:
    (i) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended 
management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a 
proposed rule, and whether the regulations would have to be in place for 
an entire harvest/fishing season.
    (ii) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for 
participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the 
development of the recommended management measures.
    (iii) Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource.
    (iv) Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management 
measures following their implementation as a final rule.
    (3) NMFS action. If the MAFMC's recommendation includes adjustments 
or additions to management measures and, after reviewing the MAFMC's 
recommendation and supporting information:
    (i) If NMFS concurs with the MAFMC's recommended management measures 
and determines that the recommended management measures should be issued 
as a final rule based on the factors specified in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section, the measures will be issued as a final rule in the Federal 
Register.
    (ii) If NMFS concurs with the MAFMC's recommended management 
measures and determines that the recommended management measures should 
be published first as a proposed rule, the measures will be published as 
a proposed rule in the Federal Register. After additional public 
comment, if NMFS concurs with the MAFMC recommendation, the measures 
will be issued as a final rule in the Federal Register.
    (iii) If NMFS does not concur, the MAFMC will be notified in writing 
of the reasons for the non-concurrence.

[[Page 576]]

    (4) Emergency actions. Nothing in this section is meant to derogate 
from the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under 
section 305(e) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.

Sec. 648.27  Observer requirements for the longfin squid fishery.

    (a) A vessel issued a longfin squid and butterfish moratorium 
permit, as specified at Sec. 648.4(a)(5)(i), must, for the purposes of 
observer deployment, have a representative provide notice to NMFS of the 
vessel name, vessel permit number, contact name for coordination of 
observer deployment, telephone number or e-mail address for contact; and 
the date, time, port of departure, and approximate trip duration, at 
least 72 hr, but no more than 10 days, prior to beginning any fishing 
trip, unless it complies with the possession restrictions in paragraph 
(c) of this section.
    (b) A vessel that has a representative provide notification to NMFS 
as described in paragraph (a) of this section may only embark on a 
longfin squid trip without an observer if a vessel representative has 
been notified by NMFS that the vessel has received a waiver of the 
observer requirement for that trip. NMFS shall notify a vessel 
representative whether the vessel must carry an observer, or if a waiver 
has been granted, for the specified longfin squid trip, within 24 hr of 
the vessel representative's notification of the prospective longfin 
squid trip, as specified in paragraph (a) of this section. Any request 
to carry an observer may be waived by NMFS. A vessel that fishes with an 
observer waiver confirmation number that does not match the longfin 
squid trip plan that was called in to NMFS is prohibited from fishing 
for, possessing, harvesting, or landing longfin squid except as 
specified in paragraph (c) of this section. Confirmation numbers for 
trip notification calls are only valid for 48 hr from the intended sail 
date.
    (c) A vessel issued a longfin squid and butterfish moratorium 
permit, as specified in Sec. 648.4(a)(5)(i), that does not have a 
representative provide the trip notification required in paragraph (a) 
of this section is prohibited from fishing for, possessing, harvesting, 
or landing 2,500 lb (1.13 mt) or more of longfin squid per trip at any 
time, and may only land longfin squid once on any calendar day, which is 
defined as the 24-hr period beginning at 0001 hours and ending at 2400 
hours.
    (d) If a vessel issued a longfin squid and butterfish moratorium 
permit, as specified in Sec. 648.4(a)(5)(i), intends to possess, 
harvest, or land 2,500 lb (1.13 mt) or more of longfin squid per trip or 
per calendar day, has a representative notify NMFS of an upcoming trip, 
is selected by NMFS to carry an observer, and then cancels that trip, 
the representative is required to provide notice to NMFS of the vessel 
name, vessel permit number, contact name for coordination of observer 
deployment, and telephone number or e-mail address for contact, and the 
intended date, time,

[[Page 578]]

and port of departure for the cancelled trip prior to the planned 
departure time. In addition, if a trip selected for observer coverage is 
cancelled, then that vessel is required to carry an observer, provided 
an observer is available, on its next trip.

            Subpart C_Management Measures for Atlantic Salmon


<R05>
Sec. 648.40  Prohibition on possession.

    (a) Incidental catch. All Atlantic salmon caught incidental to a 
directed fishery for other species in the EEZ must be released in such a 
manner as to insure maximum probability of survival.
    (b) Presumption. The possession of Atlantic salmon is prima facie 
evidence that such Atlantic salmon were taken in violation of this 
regulation. Evidence that such fish were harvested in state waters, or 
from foreign waters, or from aquaculture enterprises, will be sufficient 
to rebut the presumption. This presumption does not apply to fish being 
sorted on deck.


<R05>
Sec. 648.41  Framework specifications.

    (a) Within season management action. The New England Fishery 
Management Council (NEFMC) may, at any time, initiate action to 
implement, add to or adjust Atlantic salmon management measures to allow 
for Atlantic salmon aquaculture projects in the EEZ, provided such an 
action is consistent with the goals and objectives of the Atlantic 
Salmon FMP.
    (b) Framework process. After initiation of an action to implement, 
add to or adjust an Atlantic salmon management measure to allow for an 
Atlantic salmon aquaculture project in the EEZ, the NEFMC shall develop 
and analyze Atlantic salmon management measures to allow for Atlantic 
salmon aquaculture projects in the EEZ over the span of at least two 
NEFMC meetings. The NEFMC shall provide the public with advance notice 
of the availability of both the proposals and the analysis and 
opportunity to comment on them prior to and at the second NEFMC meeting. 
The NEFMC's recommendation on aquaculture management measures must come 
from one or more of the following categories: minimum fish sizes, gear 
restrictions, minimum mesh sizes, possession limits, tagging 
requirements, monitoring requirements, reporting requirements, permit 
restrictions, area closures, establishment of special management areas 
or zones and any other management measures currently included in the 
FMP.
    (c) NEFMC recommendation. After developing Atlantic salmon 
management measures and receiving public testimony, the NEFMC shall make 
a recommendation to NMFS. The NEFMC's recommendation must include 
supporting rationale and, if management measures are recommended, an 
analysis of impacts and a recommendation to NMFS on whether to issue the 
management measures as a final rule. If NMFS concurs with the NEFMC's 
recommendation to issue the management measures as a final rule, the 
NEFMC must consider at least the following factors and provide support 
and analysis for each factor considered:
    (1) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended 
management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a 
proposed rule, and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire 
harvest/fishing season.
    (2) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for 
participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the 
development of the NEFMC's recommended management measures.
    (3) Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource.
    (4) Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of measures 
adopted following their implementation as a final rule.
    (d) NMFS action. If the NEFMC's recommendation includes 
implementation of management measures and, after reviewing the NEFMC's 
recommendation and supporting information:
    (1) NMFS concurs with the NEFMC's recommended management measures 
and determines that the recommended measures should be issued as a final 
rule based on the factors specified in

[[Page 579]]

paragraph (c)(1) through (4) of this section, the measures will be 
issued as a final rule in the Federal Register.
    (2) NMFS concurs with the NEFMC's recommendation and determines that 
the recommended management measures should be published first as a 
proposed rule, the measures will be published as a proposed rule in the 
Federal Register. After additional public comment, if NMFS concurs with 
the NEFMC recommendation, the measures will be issued as a final rule in 
the Federal Register.
    (3) NMFS does not concur, the NEFMC will be notified in writing of 
the reasons for the non-concurrence.
    (e) Emergency action. Nothing in this section is meant to derogate 
from the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under 
section 305(e) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.

   Subpart D_Management Measures for the Atlantic Sea Scallop Fishery

    Source: 69 FR 35215, June 23, 2004, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 648.50  Shell-height standard.

    (a) Minimum shell height. The minimum shell height for in-shell 
scallops that may be landed, or possessed at or after landing, is 3.5 
inches (8.9 cm). Shell height is a straight line measurement from the 
hinge to the part of the shell that is farthest away from the hinge.
    (b) Compliance and sampling. Any time at landing or after, including 
when the scallops are received or possessed by a dealer or person acting 
in the capacity of a dealer, compliance with the minimum shell-height 
standard shall be determined as follows: Samples of 40 scallops each 
shall be taken at random from the total amount of scallops in 
possession. The person in possession of the scallops may request that as 
many as 10 sample groups (400 scallops) be examined. A sample group 
fails to comply with the standard if more than 10 percent of all 
scallops sampled are shorter than the shell height specified. The total 
amount of scallops in possession shall be deemed in violation of this 
subpart and subject to forfeiture, if the sample group fails to comply 
with the minimum standard.


<R05>
Sec. 648.51  Gear and crew restrictions.

    (a) Trawl vessel gear restrictions. Trawl vessels issued a limited 
access scallop permit under Sec. 648.4(a)(2) while fishing under or 
subject to the DAS allocation program for scallops and authorized to 
fish with or possess on board trawl nets pursuant to Sec. 648.51(f), 
any trawl vessels in possession of more than 40 lb (18.14 kg) of 
shucked, or 5 bu (176.2 L) of in-shell scallops in or from the EEZ, and 
any trawl vessels fishing for scallops in the EEZ, must comply with the 
following:
    (1) Maximum sweep. The trawl sweep of nets shall not exceed 144 ft 
(43.9 m), as measured by the total length of the footrope that is 
directly attached to the webbing, unless the net is stowed and not 
available for immediate use, as specified in Sec. 648.23, or unless the 
vessel is fishing under the Northeast multispecies or monkfish DAS 
programs.
    (2) Net requirements--(i) Minimum mesh size. Subject to applicable 
minimum mesh size restrictions for other fisheries as specified under 
this part, the mesh size for any scallop trawl net in all areas shall 
not be smaller than 5.5 inches (13.97 cm).
    (ii) Measurement of mesh size. Mesh size is measured by using a 
wedge-shaped gauge having a taper of 2 cm (0.79 inches) in 8 cm (3.15 
inches) and a thickness of 2.3 mm (0.09 inches), inserted into the 
meshes under a pressure or pull of 5 kg (11.02 lb) for mesh size less 
than 120 mm (4.72 inches) and under a pressure or pull of 8 kg (17.64 
lb) for mesh size at, or greater than, 120 mm (4.72 inches). The mesh 
size is the average of the measurements of any series of 20 consecutive 
meshes for nets having 75 or more meshes, and 10 consecutive meshes for 
nets having fewer than 75 meshes. The mesh in the regulated portion of 
the net is measured at least five meshes away from the lacings running 
parallel to the long axis of the net.
    (3) Chafing gear and other gear obstructions--(i) Net obstruction or 
constriction. A fishing vessel may not use any device or material, 
including, but not limited

[[Page 580]]

to, nets, net strengtheners, ropes, lines, or chafing gear, on the top 
of a trawl net, except that one splitting strap and one bull rope (if 
present), consisting of line and rope no more than 3 inches (7.62 cm) in 
diameter, may be used if such splitting strap and/or bull rope does not 
constrict in any manner the top of the trawl net. ``The top of the trawl 
net'' means the 50 percent of the net that (in a hypothetical situation) 
would not be in contact with the ocean bottom during a tow if the net 
were laid flat on the ocean floor. For the purpose of this paragraph 
(a)(3), head ropes shall not be considered part of the top of the trawl 
net.
    (ii) Mesh obstruction or constriction. A fishing vessel may not use 
any mesh configuration, mesh construction, or other means on or in the 
top of the net, as defined in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, if it 
obstructs the meshes of the net in any manner.
    (iii) A fishing vessel may not use or possess a net capable of 
catching scallops in which the bars entering or exiting the knots twist 
around each other.
    (b) Dredge vessel gear restrictions. All vessels issued limited 
access and General Category scallop permits and fishing with scallop 
dredges, with the exception of hydraulic clam dredges and mahogany 
quahog dredges in possession of 400 lb (181.44 kg), or less, of 
scallops, must comply with the following restrictions, unless otherwise 
specified:
    (1) Maximum dredge width. The combined dredge width in use by or in 
possession on board such vessels shall not exceed 31 ft (9.4 m) measured 
at the widest point in the bail of the dredge, except as provided under 
paragraph (e) of this section and in Sec. 648.60(g)(2). However, 
component parts may be on board the vessel such that they do not conform 
with the definition of ``dredge or dredge gear'' in Sec. 648.2, i.e., 
the metal ring bag and the mouth frame, or bail, of the dredge are not 
attached, and such that no more than one complete spare dredge could be 
made from these component's parts.
    (2) Minimum mesh size. The mesh size of a net, net material, or any 
other material on the top of a scallop dredge (twine top) possessed or 
used by vessels fishing with scallop dredge gear shall not be smaller 
than 10-inch (25.4-cm) square or diamond mesh.
    (3) Minimum ring size. (i) Unless otherwise required under the Sea 
Scallop Area Access program specified in Sec. 648.60(a)(6), the ring 
size used in a scallop dredge possessed or used by scallop vessels shall 
not be smaller than 4 inches (10.2 cm).
    (ii) Ring size is determined by measuring the shortest straight line 
passing through the center of the ring from one inside edge to the 
opposite inside edge of the ring. The measurement shall not include 
normal welds from ring manufacturing or links. The rings to be measured 
will be at least five rings away from the mouth, and at least two rings 
away from other rigid portions of the dredge.
    (iii) Ring size is determined by measuring the shortest straight 
line passing through the center of the ring from one inside edge to the 
opposite inside edge of the ring. The measurement shall not include 
normal welds from ring manufacturing or links. The rings to be measured 
will be at least five rings away from the mouth, and at least two rings 
away from other rigid portions of the dredge.
    (4) Chafing gear and other gear obstructions--(i) Chafing gear 
restrictions. No chafing gear or cookies shall be used on the top of a 
scallop dredge.
    (ii) Link restrictions. No more than double links between rings 
shall be used in or on all parts of the dredge bag, except the dredge 
bottom. No more than triple linking shall be used in or on the dredge 
bottom portion and the diamonds. Damaged links that are connected to 
only one ring, i.e., ``hangers,'' are allowed, unless they occur between 
two links that both couple the same two rings. Dredge rings may not be 
attached via links to more than four adjacent rings. Thus, dredge rings 
must be rigged in a configuration such that, when a series of adjacent 
rings are held horizontally, the neighboring rings form a pattern of 
horizontal rows and vertical columns. A copy of a diagram showing a 
schematic of a legal dredge ring pattern is available from the Regional 
Administrator upon request.
    (iii) Dredge or net obstructions. No material, device, net, dredge, 
ring, or link configuration or design shall be used if

[[Page 581]]

it results in obstructing the release of scallops that would have passed 
through a legal sized and configured net and dredge, as described in 
this part, that did not have in use any such material, device, net, 
dredge, ring link configuration or design.
    (iv) Twine top restrictions. In addition to the minimum twine top 
mesh size specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, vessels issued 
limited access scallop permits that are fishing for scallops under the 
DAS Program are also subject to the following restrictions:
    (A) If a vessel is rigged with more than one dredge, or if a vessel 
is rigged with only one dredge and such dredge is greater than 8 ft (2.4 
m) in width, there must be at least seven rows of non-overlapping steel 
rings unobstructed by netting or any other material between the terminus 
of the dredge (club stick) and the net material on the top of the dredge 
(twine top).
    (B) If a vessel is rigged with only one dredge, and such dredge is 
less than 8 ft (2.4 m) in width, there must be at least four rows of 
non-overlapping steel rings unobstructed by netting or any other 
material between the club stick and the twine top of the dredge. (A copy 
of a diagram showing a schematic of a legal dredge with twine top is 
available from the Regional Administrator upon request).
    (v) Measurement of twine top mesh size. Twine top mesh size is 
measured by using a wedge-shaped gauge having a taper of 2 cm (0.79 
inches) in 8 cm (3.15 inches) and a thickness of 2.3 mm (0.09 inches), 
inserted into the meshes under a pressure or pull of 8 kg (17.64 lb). 
The mesh size is the average of the measurements of any series of 20 
consecutive meshes for twine tops having 75 or more meshes, and 10 
consecutive meshes for twine tops having fewer than 75 meshes. The mesh 
in the twine top must be measured at least five meshes away from where 
the twine top mesh meets the rings, running parallel to the long axis of 
the twine top.
    (5) Restrictions applicable to sea scallop dredges in the mid-
Atlantic--(i) Requirement to use chain mats. See Sec. 223.206(d)(11) of 
this chapter for chain mat requirements for scallop dredges.
    (ii) Requirement to use a turtle deflector dredge (TDD) frame--(A) 
Beginning May 1, 2013, and from May 1 through October 31 every year, any 
limited access scallop vessel using a dredge, regardless of dredge size 
or vessel permit category, or any LAGC IFQ scallop vessel fishing with a 
dredge with a width of 10.5 ft (3.2 m) or greater, that is fishing for 
scallops in waters west of 71[deg] W long., from the shoreline to the 
outer boundary of the Exclusive Economic Zone, must use a TDD. The TDD 
requires five modifications to the rigid dredge frame, as specified in 
paragraphs (b)(5)(ii)(A)(1) through (b)(5)(ii)(A)(5) of this section. 
See paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(E) of this section for more specific 
descriptions of the dredge elements mentioned below.
    (1) The cutting bar must be located in front of the depressor plate.
    (2) The angle between the front edge of the cutting bar and the top 
of the dredge frame must be less than or equal to 45 degrees.
    (3) All bale bars must be removed, except the outer bale (single or 
double) bars and the center support beam, leaving an otherwise 
unobstructed space between the cutting bar and forward bale wheels, if 
present. The center support beam must be less than 6 in (15.24 cm) wide. 
For the purpose of flaring and safe handling of the dredge, a minor 
appendage not to exceed 12 in (30.5 cm) in length may be attached to the 
outer bale bar;
    (4) Struts must be spaced 12 in (30.5 cm) apart or less from each 
other.
    (5) Unless exempted, as specified in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B) of this 
section, the TDD must include a straight extension (``bump out'') 
connecting the outer bale bars to the dredge frame. This ``bump out'' 
must exceed 12 in (30.5 cm) in length.
    (B) A limited access scallop vessel that uses a dredge with a width 
less than 10.5 ft (3.2 m) is required to use a TDD except that such a 
vessel is exempt from the ``bump out'' requirement specified in 
paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A)(5) of this section. This exemption does not 
apply to LAGC vessels that use dredges with a width of less than 10.5 ft 
(3.2 m) because such vessels are exempted from the requirement to use a 
TDD, as specified in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section.

[[Page 582]]

    (C) Vessels subject to the requirements in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of 
this section transiting waters west of 71[deg] W long., from the 
shoreline to the outer boundary of the Exclusive Economic Zone, are 
exempted from the requirement to only possess and use TDDs, provided the 
dredge gear is stowed in accordance with Sec. 648.23(b) and not 
available for immediate use.
    (D) TDD-related definitions. (1) The cutting bar refers to the 
lowermost horizontal bar connecting the outer bails at the dredge frame.
    (2) The depressor plate, also known as the pressure plate, is the 
angled piece of steel welded along the length of the top of the dredge 
frame.
    (3) The top of the dredge frame refers to the posterior point of the 
depressor plate.
    (4) The struts are the metal bars connecting the cutting bar and the 
depressor plate.
    (c) Crew restrictions. Limited access vessels participating in or 
subject to the scallop DAS allocation program may have no more than 
seven people aboard, including the operator, when not docked or moored 
in port, except as follows:
    (1) There is no restriction on the number of people on board for 
vessels participating in the Sea Scallop Area Access Program as 
specified in Sec. 648.60;
    (2) Vessels participating in the small dredge program are restricted 
as specified in paragraph (e) of this section;
    (3) The Regional Administrator may authorize additional people to be 
on board through issuance of a letter of authorization.
    (4) A certified at-sea observer is on board, as required by Sec. 
648.11(g).
    (d) Sorting and shucking machines. (1) Shucking machines are 
prohibited on all limited access vessels fishing under the scallop DAS 
program, or any vessel in possession of more than 600 lb (272.2 kg) of 
scallops, unless the vessel has not been issued a limited access scallop 
permit and fishes exclusively in state waters.
    (2) Sorting machines are prohibited on limited access vessels 
fishing under the scallop DAS program.
    (e) Small dredge program restrictions. Any vessel owner whose vessel 
is assigned to either the part-time or Occasional category may request, 
in the application for the vessel's annual permit, to be placed in one 
category higher. Vessel owners making such request may be placed in the 
appropriate higher category for the entire year, if they agree to comply 
with the following restrictions, in addition to, and notwithstanding 
other restrictions of this part, when fishing under the DAS program 
described in Sec. 648.53:
    (1) The vessel must fish exclusively with one dredge no more than 
10.5 ft (3.2 m) in width.
    (2) The vessel may not use or have more than one dredge on board.
    (3) The vessel may have no more than five people, including the 
operator, on board, except as follows:
    (i) There is no restriction on the number of people on board for 
vessels participating in the Sea Scallop Area Access Program as 
specified in Sec. 648.60;
    (ii) The Regional Administrator may authorize additional people to 
be on board through issuance of a letter of authorization.
    (iii) A certified at-sea observer is on board, as required by Sec. 
648.11(g).
    (f) Restrictions on the use of trawl nets. (1) A vessel issued a 
limited access scallop permit fishing for scallops under the scallop DAS 
allocation program may not fish with, possess on board, or land scallops 
while in possession of a trawl net, unless such vessel has been issued a 
limited access trawl vessel permit that endorses the vessel to fish for 
scallops with a trawl net. A limited access scallop vessel issued a 
trawl vessel permit that endorses the vessel to fish for scallops with a 
trawl net and general category scallop vessels enrolled in the Area 
Access Program as specified in Sec. 648.60, may not fish with a trawl 
net in the Access Areas specified in Sec. 648.59(b) through (d).
    (2) Replacement vessels. A vessel that is replacing a vessel 
authorized to use trawl nets to fish for scallops under scallop DAS may 
also be authorized to use trawl nets to fish for scallops under scallop 
DAS if it meets the following criteria:
    (i) Has not fished for scallops with a scallop dredge after December 
31, 1987; or

[[Page 583]]

    (ii) Has fished for scallops with a scallop dredge on no more than 
10 trips from January 1, 1988, through December 31, 1994, has an engine 
horsepower no greater than 450.

Sec. 648.52  Possession and landing limits.

    (a) A vessel issued an IFQ scallop permit that is declared into the 
IFQ scallop fishery as specified in Sec. 648.10(b), or on a properly 
declared NE multispecies, surfclam, or ocean quahog trip and not fishing 
in a scallop access area, unless as specified in paragraph (g) of this 
section or exempted under the state waters exemption program described 
in Sec. 648.54, may not possess or land, per trip, more than 600 lb 
(272.2 kg) of shucked scallops, or possess more than 75 bu (26.4 hL) of 
in-shell scallops shoreward of the VMS Demarcation Line. Such a vessel 
may land scallops only once in any calendar day. Such a vessel may 
possess up to 100 bu (35.2 hL) of in-shell scallops seaward of the VMS 
demarcation line on a properly declared IFQ scallop trip, or on a 
properly declared NE multispecies, surfclam, or ocean quahog trip and 
not fishing in a scallop access area.
    (b) A vessel issued an NGOM scallop permit, or an IFQ scallop permit 
that is declared into the NGOM scallop fishery as described in Sec. 
648.62, unless exempted under the state waters exemption program 
described under Sec. 648.54, may not possess or land, per trip, more 
than 200 lb (90.7 kg) of shucked, or 25 bu (8.81 hL) of in-shell 
scallops. Such a vessel may land scallops only once in any calendar day. 
Such a vessel may possess up to 50 bu (17.6 hL) of in-shell scallops 
seaward of the VMS demarcation line on a properly declared NGOM scallop 
fishery trip.
    (c) A vessel issued an Incidental scallop permit, or an IFQ or NGOM 
scallop permit that is not declared into the IFQ or NGOM scallop fishery 
as required under Sec. 648.10(f), unless exempted under the state 
waters exemption program described under Sec. 648.54, may not possess 
or land, per trip, more than 40 lb (18.1 kg) of shucked, or 5 bu (1.76 
hL) of in-shell scallops. Such a vessel may land scallops only once in 
any calendar day. Such a vessel may possess up to 10 bu (3.52 hL) of in-
shell scallops seaward of the VMS Demarcation Line.
    (d) Owners or operators of vessels with a limited access scallop 
permit that have properly declared into the Sea Scallop Area Access 
Program as described in Sec. 648.60 are prohibited from fishing for or 
landing per trip, or possessing at any time, scallops in excess of any 
sea scallop possession and landing limit set by the Regional 
Administrator in accordance with Sec. 648.60(a)(5).
    (e) Owners or operators of vessels issued limited access permits 
fishing in or transiting the area south of 42[deg]20[min]N. lat. at any 
time during a trip are prohibited from fishing for, possessing, or 
landing per trip more than 50 bu (17.6 hl) of in-shell scallops 
shoreward of the VMS Demarcation Line, unless when fishing under the 
state waters exemption specified under Sec. 648.54.
    (f) A vessel that is declared into the Sea Scallop Area Access 
Program as described in Sec. 648.60, may not possess more than 50 bu 
(17.6 hL) of in-shell scallops outside of the Access Areas described in 
Sec. 648.59(a) through (e).
    (g) Possession limit to defray the cost of observers in Access Areas 
for LAGC IFQ vessels. An LAGC IFQ vessel with an observer on board may 
retain, per observed trip, up to 1 day's allowance of the possession 
limit allocated to limited access vessels, as established by the 
Regional Administrator in accordance with Sec. 648.60(d), provided the 
observer set-aside specified in Sec. 648.60(d)(1) has not been fully 
utilized. For example, if the limited access vessel daily possession 
limit to defray the cost of an observer is 180 lb (82 kg), the LAGC IFQ 
possession limit to defray the cost of an observer would be 180 lb (82 
kg) per trip, regardless of trip length.

Sec. 648.53  Acceptable biological catch (ABC), annual catch limits 
(ACL), annual catch targets (ACT), DAS allocations, and individual 

fishing quotas (IFQ).

    (a) Scallop fishery ABC. The ABC for the scallop fishery shall be 
established through the framework adjustment process specified in Sec. 
648.55 and is equal to the overall scallop fishery ACL. The ABC/ACL 
shall be divided as sub-ACLs between limited access vessels, limited 
access vessels that are fishing under a limited access general category 
permit, and limited access general category vessels as specified in 
paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section, after deducting the 
scallop incidental catch target TAC specified in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section, observer set-aside specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section, and research set-aside specified in Section 648.56(d). The ABC/
ACL for the 2013 fishing year is subject to change through a future 
framework adjustment.
    (1) ABC/ACL for fishing years 2011 through 2013 shall be:
    (i) 2011: 27,269 mt.
    (ii) 2012: 28,961 mt.
    (iii) 2013: 28,700 mt.
    (2) Scallop incidental catch target TAC. The incidental catch target 
TAC for vessels with incidental catch scallop permits is 50,000 lb (22.7 
mt) for fishing years 2011, 2012, and 2013.
    (3) Limited access fleet sub-ACL and ACT. The limited access scallop 
fishery shall be allocated 94.5 percent of the ACL specified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, after deducting incidental catch, 
observer set-aside, and research set-aside, as specified in this 
paragraph (a). ACT for the limited access scallop fishery shall be 
established through the framework adjustment process described in Sec. 
648.55. DAS specified in paragraph (b) of this section shall be based on 
the ACTs specified in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section. The limited 
access fleet sub-ACL and ACT for the 2013 fishing year are subject to 
change through a future framework adjustment.
    (i) The limited access fishery sub-ACLs for fishing years 2011 
through 2013 are:
    (A) 2011: 24,954 mt.
    (B) 2012: 26,537 mt.
    (C) 2013: 26,293 mt.
    (ii) The limited access fishery ACTs for fishing years 2011 through 
2013 are:
    (A) 2011: 21,431 mt.
    (B) 2012: 23,546 mt.
    (C) 2013: 19,688 mt.
    (4) LAGC fleet sub-ACL. The sub-ACL for the LAGC IFQ fishery shall 
be equal to 5.5 percent of the ACL specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, after deducting incidental catch, observer set-aside, and 
research set-aside, as specified in this paragraph (a). The LAGC IFQ 
fishery ACT shall be equal to the LAGC IFQ fishery's ACL. The ACL for 
the LAGC IFQ fishery for vessels issued only a LAGC IFQ scallop permit 
shall be equal to 5 percent of the ACL specified in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section, after deducting incidental catch, observer set-aside, and 
research set-aside, as specified in this paragraph (a). The ACL for the 
LAGC IFQ fishery for vessels issued only both a LAGC IFQ scallop permit 
and a limited access scallop permit shall be 0.5 percent of the ACL 
specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, after deducting 
incidental catch, observer set-aside, and research set-aside, as 
specified in this paragraph (a). The LAGC ACLs for the 2013 fishing year 
are default allocations and are subject to change through a future 
framework adjustment.
    (i) The ACLs for fishing years 2011 through 2013 for LAGC IFQ 
vessels without a limited access scallop permit are:
    (A) 2011: 1,320 mt.
    (B) 2012: 1,404 mt.

    (B) 2012: 140 mt.
    (C) 2013: 139 mt.
    (b) DAS allocations. DAS allocations for limited access scallop 
trips in all areas other than those specified in Sec. 648.59 shall be 
specified through the framework adjustment process, as specified in 
Sec. 648.55, using the ACT specified in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this 
section. A vessel's DAS shall be determined and specified in paragraph 
(b)(4) of this section by dividing the total

[[Page 585]]

DAS specified in the framework adjustment by the landings per unit 
effort (LPUE) specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, then 
dividing by the total number of vessels in the fleet.
    (1) Landings per unit effort (LPUE). LPUE is an estimate of the 
average amount of scallops, in pounds, that the limited access scallop 
fleet lands per DAS fished. The estimated LPUE is the average LPUE for 
all limited access scallop vessels fishing under DAS, and shall be used 
to calculate DAS specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the DAS 
reduction for the AM specified in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, 
and the observer set-aside DAS allocation specified in paragraph (g)(1) 
of this section. LPUE shall be:
    (i) 2011 fishing year: 2,441 lb/DAS.
    (ii) 2012 fishing year: 2,662 lb/DAS.
    (iii) 2013 fishing year: 2,676 lb/DAS.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (3) Assignment to DAS categories. Subject to the vessel permit 
application requirements specified in Sec. 648.4, for each fishing 
year, each vessel issued a limited access scallop permit shall be 
assigned to the DAS category (full-time, part-time, or occasional) it 
was assigned to in the preceding year, except as provided under the 
small dredge program specified in Sec. 648.51(e).
    (4) Each vessel qualifying for one of the three DAS categories 
specified in the table in this paragraph (b)(4) (full-time, part-time, 
or occasional) shall be allocated the maximum number of DAS for each 
fishing year it may participate in the open area limited access scallop 
fishery, according to its category, excluding carryover DAS in 
accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. DAS allocations shall be 
determined by distributing the portion of ACT specified in paragraph 
(a)(3)(ii), as reduced by access area allocations specified in Sec. 
648.59, and dividing that amount among vessels in the form of DAS 
calculated by applying estimates of open area LPUE specified in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Allocation for part-time and 
occasional scallop vessels shall be equal to 40 percent and 8.33 percent 
of the full-time DAS allocations, respectively. DAS allocations for the 
2013 fishing year are default allocations and are subject to change 
through a future framework adjustment. The annual open area DAS 
allocations for each category of vessel for the fishing years indicated 
are as follows:

                    Scallop Open Area DAS Allocations
------------------------------------------------------------------------
              Permit category                 2011      2012      2013
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full-Time.................................        32        34        26
Part-Time.................................        13        14        11
Occasional................................         3         3         3
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) If, prior to the implementation of Framework 22, a limited 
access vessel uses more open area DAS in the 2011 fishing year than 
specified in this section, such vessel shall have the DAS used in excess 
of the 2012 fishing year allocation specified in this paragraph (b)(4) 
deducted from its fishing year 2012 open area DAS allocation.
    (ii) Accountability measures (AM). Unless the limited access AM 
exception is implemented in accordance with the provision specified in 
paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section, if the ACL specified in paragraph 
(a)(3)(i) of this section is exceeded for the applicable fishing year, 
the DAS specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section for each limited 
access vessel shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of 
landings in excess of the ACL divided by the applicable LPUE for the 
fishing year in which the AM will apply as specified in paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, then divided by the number of scallop vessels eligible 
to be issued a full-time limited access scallop permit. For example, 
assuming a 300,000-lb (136-mt) overage of the ACL in 2011, an open area 
LPUE of 2,500 lb (1.13 mt) per DAS in 2012, and 313 full-time vessels, 
each full-time vessel's DAS would be reduced by 0.38 DAS (300,000 lb 
(136 mt)/2,500 lb (1.13 mt) per DAS = 120 lb (0.05 mt) per DAS/313 
vessels = 0.38 DAS per vessel). Deductions in DAS for part-time and 
occasional scallop vessels shall be equal to 40 percent and 8.33 percent 
of the full-time DAS deduction, respectively, as calculated pursuant to 
this paragraph (b)(4)(ii). The AM shall take effect in the fishing year 
following the fishing year in which the overage occurred. For example, 
landings in excess of the ACL in fishing year 2011 would result in the 
DAS reduction AM in fishing year 2012. If the

[[Page 586]]

AM takes effect, and a limited access vessel uses more open area DAS in 
the fishing year in which the AM is applied, the vessel shall have the 
DAS used in excess of the allocation after applying the AM deducted from 
its open area DAS allocation in the subsequent fishing year. For 
example, a vessel initially allocated 32 DAS in 2011 uses all 32 DAS 
prior to application of the AM. If, after application of the AM, the 
vessel's DAS allocation is reduced to 31 DAS, the vessel's DAS in 2012 
would be reduced by 1 DAS.
    (iii) Limited access AM exception--If NMFS determines, in accordance 
with paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, that the fishing mortality 
rate associated with the limited access fleet's landings in a fishing 
year is less than 0.28, the AM specified in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this 
section shall not take effect. The fishing mortality rate of 0.28 is the 
fishing mortality that is one standard deviation below the fishing 
mortality rate for the scallop fishery ACL, currently estimated at 0.32.
    (iv) Limited access fleet AM and exception provision timing. The 
Regional Administrator shall determine whether the limited access fleet 
exceeded its ACL specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section by 
July of the fishing year following the year for which landings are being 
evaluated. On or about July 1, the Regional Administrator shall notify 
the New England Fishery Management Council (Council) of the 
determination of whether or not the ACL for the limited access fleet was 
exceeded, and the amount of landings in excess of the ACL. Upon this 
notification, the Scallop Plan Development Team (PDT) shall evaluate the 
overage and determine if the fishing mortality rate associated with 
total landings by the limited access scallop fleet is less than 0.28. On 
or about September 1 of each year, the Scallop PDT shall notify the 
Council of its determination, and the Council, on or about September 30, 
shall make a recommendation, based on the Scallop PDT findings, 
concerning whether to invoke the limited access AM exception. If NMFS 
concurs with the Scallop PDT's recommendation to invoke the limited 
access AM exception, in accordance with the APA, the limited access AM 
shall not be implemented. If NMFS does not concur, in accordance with 
the APA, the limited access AM shall be implemented as soon as possible 
after September 30 each year.
    (v) The Elephant Trunk Access Area shall change to an open area 
starting in fishing year 2011. For reference, the Elephant Trunk Access 
Area was defined by straight lines connecting the following points in 
the order stated (copies of a chart depicting the area previously known 
as the Elephant Trunk Access Area are available from the Regional 
Administrator upon request):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
               Point                     Latitude          Longitude
------------------------------------------------------------------------
ETAA1.............................  38[deg]50[min] N   74[deg]20[min] W
ETAA2.............................  38[deg]10[min] N   74[deg]20[min] W
ETAA3.............................  38[deg]10[min] N   73[deg]30[min] W
ETAA4.............................  38[deg]50[min] N   73[deg]30[min] W
ETAA1.............................  38[deg]50[min] N   74[deg]20[min] W
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (vi) If, prior to the implementation of Framework 22, a vessel lands 
all or part of an Elephant Trunk Access Area trip that was allocated at 
the start of the 2011 fishing year, any pounds landed from that declared 
Elephant Trunk Access Area trip would be converted to DAS and deducted 
from the vessel's open area DAS allocations in fishing year 2012. This 
DAS deduction would be equal to the scallop fishing mortality resulting 
from the open area DAS allocation. For example, if a full-time vessel 
lands the full 18,000-lb (8,165-kg) possession limit from an Elephant 
Trunk Access Area trip allocated at the start of the 2011 fishing year, 
the pounds landed would be converted to DAS and deducted from the 
vessel's 2012 fishing year DAS allocation as follows: The 18,000 lb 
(8,165-kg) would first be multiplied by the estimated average meat count 
in the Elephant Trunk Access Area (18.4 meats/lb) and then divided by 
the estimated open area average meat count (also 18.4 meats/lb) and by 
the estimated open area LPUE for fishing year 2011 (2,441 lb/DAS), 
resulting in a DAS deduction of 7.4 DAS ((18,000 lb x 18.4 meats/lb)/
(18.4 meats/lb x 2,441 lb/DAS) = 7.4 DAS). This amount would be deducted 
from that vessel's 2012 fishing year (i.e., 34 DAS minus 7.4 DAS), 
resulting in a total 2012 fishing year DAS allocation of 26.6 DAS. 
Similarly, Part-time and occasional vessels

[[Page 587]]

shall receive deductions of 5.9 DAS and 2.5 DAS, respectively, based on 
their respective possession limits, for landing their full trip 
possession limits from the area formerly known as the Elephant Trunk 
Access Area. If a vessel only lands a portion of its full possession 
limit, the applicable DAS reduction shall be proportional to those 
landings. For example, if a full-time vessel lands 9,000 lb (4,082 kg) 
during a declared Elephant Trunk Access Area trip, that vessel's fishing 
year 2012 DAS allocation would be reduced by 3.7 DAS (i.e., half of the 
DAS that would be deducted for a full trip).
    (vii) If, prior to the implementation of Framework 22, a vessel 
owner exchanges an Elephant Trunk Access Area trip for another access 
area trip as specified in Sec. 648.60(a)(3)(ii) in fishing year 2011, 
the vessel that receives an additional Elephant Trunk Access Area trip 
will receive a DAS credit of 7.4 DAS in FY 2011, resulting in a total 
fishing year 2011 DAS allocation of 39.4 DAS (32 DAS plus 7.4 DAS). This 
DAS credit from unused Elephant Trunk Access Area trip gained through a 
trip exchange is based on a full-time vessel's 18,000-lb (8,165-kg) 
possession limit and is calculated by using the formula specified in 
paragraph (b)(4)(vi) of this section, but the DAS conversion is applied 
as a DAS credit in the 2011 fishing year, rather than as a DAS deduction 
in fishing year 2012. Similarly, using the same calculation with a 
14,400-lb (6,532-kg) possession limit, part-time vessels will receive a 
credit of 5.9 DAS if the vessel owner received an additional Elephant 
Trunk Access Area trip through a trip exchange in the interim between 
the start of the 2011 fishing year and the implementation of Framework 
22 and did not use it. If a vessel fishes any part of an Elephant Trunk 
Access Area trip gained through a trip exchange, those landings would be 
deducted from any DAS credit applied to the 2011 fishing year. For 
example, if a full-time vessel lands 10,000 lb (4,536 kg) from an 
Elephant Trunk Access Area trip gained through a trip exchange, the 
pounds landed would be converted to DAS and deducted from the trip-
exchange credit as follows: The 10,000 lb (4,536 kg) is first be 
multiplied by the estimated average meat count in the Elephant Trunk 
Access Area (18.4 meats/lb) and then divided by the estimated open area 
average meat count (also 18.4 meats/lb) and by the estimated open area 
LPUE for fishing year 2011 (2,441 lb/DAS), resulting in a DAS deduction 
of 4.1 DAS ((10,000 lb x 18.4 meats/lb)/(18.4 meats/lb x 2,441 lb/DAS) = 
4.1 DAS). Thus, this vessel would receive a reduced DAS credit in FY 
2011 to account for the Elephant Trunk Access Area trip exchange of 3.3 
DAS (7.4 DAS - 4.1 DAS = 3.7 DAS).
    (5) Additional open area DAS. (i) When Closed Area I, Closed Area 
II, and/or the Nantucket Lightship Access Areas close due to the 
yellowtail flounder TAC, for each remaining complete trip in each of 
these Access Areas, a full-time, part-time, or occasional vessel may 
fish an additional DAS in open areas during the same fishing year. Part-
time and occasional vessel shall only receive additional DAS if there 
are no other access areas available in which to take an access area 
trip. A complete trip is deemed to be a trip that is not subject to a 
reduced possession limit under the broken trip provision in Sec. 
648.60(c). The Access Area DAS trip conversion for fishing years 2011 
and 2013 are specified in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Access Area Trip Conversion to Open Area DAS.

    (iii) If a vessel has unused broken trip compensation trip(s), as 
specified in Sec. 648.60(c), when Closed Area I, Closed Area II, and/or 
Nantucket Lightship Access Areas close due to the yellowtail flounder 
TAC, it will be issued additional open area DAS in proportion to the 
unharvested possession limit. For example, if a full-time vessel had an 
unused 9,000-lb (4,082-kg) Nantucket Lightship Access Area compensation 
trip (half of the possession limit) at the time of a Nantucket Lightship 
Access Area yellowtail flounder TAC closure in FY 2012, the vessel will 
be allocated 2.15 DAS (half of 4.3 DAS).
    (6) DAS allocations and other management measures are specified for 
each scallop fishing year, which begins on March 1 and ends on February 
28 (or February 29), unless otherwise noted.
    (c) Adjustments in annual DAS allocations. Annual DAS allocations 
shall be established for 3 fishing years through biennial framework 
adjustments as specified in Sec. 648.55. If a biennial framework action 
is not undertaken by the Council and implemented by NMFS before the 
beginning of the third year of each biennial adjustment, the third-year 
measures specified in the biennial framework adjustment shall remain in 
effect for the next fishing year. If a new biennial or other framework 
adjustment is not implemented by NMFS by the conclusion of the third 
year, the management measures from that third year would remain in place 
until a new action is implemented. The Council may also recommend 
adjustments to DAS allocations or other measures through a framework 
adjustment at any time.
    (d) End-of-year carry-over for open area DAS. With the exception of 
vessels that held a Confirmation of Permit History as described in Sec. 
648.4(a)(2)(i)(J) for the entire fishing year preceding the carry-over 
year, limited access vessels that have unused open area DAS on the last 
day of February of any year may carry over a maximum of 10 DAS, not to 
exceed the total open area DAS allocation by permit category, into the 
next year. DAS carried over into the next fishing year may only be used 
in open areas. Carry-over DAS are accounted for in setting the ACT for 
the limited access fleet, as specified in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this 
section. Therefore, if carry-over DAS result or contribute to an overage 
of the ACL, the limited access fleet AM specified in paragraph 
(b)(4)(ii) of this section would still apply, provided the AM exception 
specified in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section is not invoked.
    (e) Accrual of DAS. All DAS fished shall be charged to the nearest 
minute. A vessel carrying an observer and authorized to be charged fewer 
DAS in Open Areas based on the total available DAS set aside under 
paragraph (g)(1) of this section shall be charged at a reduced rate as 
specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
    (f) DAS credits--(1) Good Samaritan credit. A limited access vessel 
operating under the DAS program and that spends time at sea assisting in 
a USCG search and rescue operation or assisting the USCG in towing a 
disabled vessel, and that can document the occurrence through the USCG, 
will not accrue DAS for the time documented.
    (2) Canceled trip DAS credit. A limited access vessel operating 
under the DAS program and that ends a fishing trip prior to setting and/
or hauling fishing gear for any reason may request a cancelled trip DAS 
credit for the trip based on the following conditions and requirements:
    (i) There is no fish onboard the vessel and no fishing operations on 
the vessel were initiated, including setting and/or hauling fishing 
gear; and
    (ii) The owner or operator of the vessel fishing under a DAS program 
and required to use a VMS as specified under Sec. 648.10(b) makes an 
initial trip cancelation notification from sea, at the time the trip was 
canceled, or at the earliest opportunity prior to crossing the 
demarcation line as defined at Sec. 648.10(a). These reports are in the 
form of an email to NMFS Office of Law Enforcement and include at least 
the following information: Operator name; vessel name; vessel permit 
number; port where vessel will return; date trip started; estimated 
date/time of return to port; and a statement by the operator that no 
fish were onboard and no fishing activity occurred; and
    (iii) The owner or operator of the vessel operating under the DAS 
program

[[Page 589]]

required to use the IVR call in as specified under Sec. 648.10(h) makes 
an initial trip cancelation notification to NMFS by calling the IVR back 
at the time the trip was canceled, or at the earliest opportunity prior 
to returning to port. This request must include at least the following 
information: Operator name; vessel name; vessel permit number; port 
where vessel will return; date trip started; estimated date/time of 
return to port; and a statement from the operator that no fish were 
onboard and no fishing activity occurred; and
    (iv) The owner or operator of the vessel requesting a canceled trip 
DAS credit, in addition to the requirements in paragraphs (f)(2)(ii) and 
(iii) of this section, submits a written DAS credit request form to NMFS 
within 30 days of the vessel's return to port from the canceled trip. 
This application must include at least the following information: Date 
and time when the vessel canceled the fishing trip; date and time of 
trip departure and landing; operator name; owner/corporation name; 
permit number; hull identification number; vessel name; date and time 
notification requirements specified under paragraphs (f)(2)(ii) and 
(iii) of this section were made; reason for canceling the trip; and 
owner/operator signature and date; and
    (v) The vessel trip report for the canceled trip as required under 
Sec. 648.7(b) is submitted along with the DAS credit request form; and
    (vi) For DAS credits that are requested near the end of the fishing 
year as defined at Sec. 648.2, and approved by the Regional 
Administrator, the credited DAS apply to the fishing year in which the 
canceled trip occurred. Credited DAS that remain unused at the end of 
the fishing year or that are not credited until the following fishing 
year may be carried over into the next fishing year, not to exceed the 
maximum number of carryover DAS as specified under paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (g) Set-asides for observer coverage. (1) To help defray the cost of 
carrying an observer, 1 percent of the ABC/ACL specified in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section shall be set aside to be used by vessels that are 
assigned to take an at-sea observer on a trip. The total TAC for 
observer set aside is 273 mt in fishing year 2011, 290 mt in fishing 
year 2012, and 287 mt in fishing year 2013. This 1 percent is divided 
proportionally into access areas and open areas, as specified in Sec. 
648.60(d)(1) and paragraph (g)(2) of this section, respectively. The 
total observer set-aside TAC specified for fishing year 2013 is a 
default allocation and is subject to change through a future framework 
adjustment
    (2) DAS set-aside for observer coverage. For vessels assigned to 
take an at-sea observer on a trip other than an Access Area Program 
trip, the open-area observer set-aside TACs are 139 mt, 161 mt, and 136 
mt for fishing years 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively. The DAS set-
aside shall be determined by dividing these amounts by the LPUE 
specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section for each specific 
fishing year. The DAS set-aside for observer coverage is 137 DAS for the 
2011 fishing year, 133 DAS for the 2012 fishing year, and 112 DAS for 
the 2013 fishing year. A vessel carrying an observer shall be 
compensated with reduced DAS accrual rates for each trip on which the 
vessel carries an observer. For each DAS that a vessel fishes for 
scallops with an observer on board, the DAS shall be charged at a 
reduced rate, based on an adjustment factor determined by the Regional 
Administrator on an annual basis, dependent on the cost of observers, 
catch rates, and amount of available DAS set-aside. The Regional 
Administrator shall notify vessel owners of the cost of observers and 
the DAS adjustment factor through a permit holder letter issued prior to 
the start of each fishing year. This DAS adjustment factor may also be 
changed during the fishing year if fishery conditions warrant such a 
change. The number of DAS that are deducted from each trip based on the 
adjustment factor shall be deducted from the observer DAS set-aside 
amount in the applicable fishing year. Utilization of the DAS set-aside 
shall be on a first-come, first-served basis. When the DAS set-aside for 
observer coverage has been utilized, vessel owners shall be notified 
that no additional DAS remain available to offset the cost of carrying 
observers. The

[[Page 590]]

obligation to carry and pay for an observer shall not be waived if set-
aside is not available.
    (h) Annual Individual fishing quotas--(1) IFQ restriction. For each 
fishing year of the IFQ program, a vessel issued an IFQ scallop permit 
may only harvest and land the total amount of scallop meats allocated in 
accordance with this subpart. Unless otherwise specified in this part, a 
vessel allocated scallop IFQ may not exceed the possession limits 
specified in Sec. 648.52 on any trip.
    (2) Calculation of IFQ. The ACL allocated to IFQ scallop vessels, 
and the ACL allocated to limited access scallop vessels issued IFQ 
scallop permits, as specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (ii) of this 
section, shall be used to determine the IFQ of each vessel issued an IFQ 
scallop permit. Each fishing year, the Regional Administrator shall 
provide the owner of a vessel issued an IFQ scallop permit issued 
pursuant to Sec. 648.4(a)(2)(ii) with the scallop IFQ for the vessel 
for the upcoming fishing year.
    (i) Individual fishing quota. The IFQ for an IFQ scallop vessel 
shall be the vessel's contribution percentage as specified in paragraph 
(h)(2)(iii) of this section and determined using the steps specified in 
paragraphs (h)(2)(ii) of this section, multiplied by the ACL allocated 
to the IFQ scallop fishery, or limited access vessels issued an IFQ 
scallop permit, as specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (ii) of this 
section.
    (ii) Contribution factor. An IFQ scallop vessel's contribution 
factor is calculated using the best year, years active, and index factor 
as specified in paragraphs (h)(2)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section. A 
vessel's contribution factor shall be provided to the owner of a 
qualified limited access general category vessel following initial 
application for an IFQ scallop permit as specified in Sec. 
648.4(a)(2)(ii)(E), consistent with confidentiality restrictions of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act specified at 16 U.S.C. 1881a.
    (A) Best year determination. An eligible IFQ scallop vessel's 
highest scallop landings in any scallop fishing year that the vessel was 
issued a general category scallop permit between March 1, 2000, and 
November 1, 2004, shall be determined using NMFS dealer reports. Scallop 
landings in the 2004 fishing year must have occurred on or before 
November 1, 2004. If a dealer reported more than 400 lb (181.4 kg) of 
scallops landed on a trip, only 400 lb (181.4 kg) will be credited for 
that trip toward the best year calculation. For dealer reports that 
indicate clearly that the landings were bushels of in-shell scallops, a 
conversion of 8.33 lb (3.78 kg) of scallop meats per bushel shall be 
used to calculate meat-weight, up to a maximum of 400 lb (181.4 kg) per 
trip.
    (B) Years active. For each eligible IFQ scallop vessel, the total 
number of scallop fishing years during the period March 1, 2000, through 
November 1, 2004, in which the vessel had a general category scallop 
permit and landed at least 1 lb (0.45 kg) of scallop meats, or in-shell 
scallops, shall be counted as active years based on NMFS dealer reports. 
Scallop landings in the 2004 fishing year must have occurred on or 
before November 1, 2004.
    (C) Index to determine contribution factor. For each eligible IFQ 
scallop vessel, the best year as determined pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii)(E)(1) of this section shall be multiplied by the appropriate 
index factor specified in the following table, based on years active as 
specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(E)(2) of this section. The resulting 
contribution factor shall determine its IFQ for each fishing year based 
on the allocation to general category scallop vessels as specified in 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section and the method of calculating the IFQ 
provided in paragraph (h) of this section.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Years active                         Index factor
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.......................................................           0.75
2.......................................................           0.875
3.......................................................           1.0
4.......................................................           1.125
5.......................................................           1.25
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (D) Contribution factor example. If a vessel landed 48,550 lb 
(22,022 kg) of scallops in its best year, and was active in the general 
category scallop fishery for 5 years, the vessel's contribution factor 
is equal to 60,687 lb (27,527 kg) (48,550 lb (22,022 kg * 1.25).
    (iii) Contribution percentage. A vessel's contribution percentage 
shall be determined by dividing its contribution factor by the sum of 
the contribution

[[Page 591]]

factors of all vessels issued an IFQ scallop permit. Continuing the 
example in paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(D) of this section, the sum of the 
contribution factors for 380 IFQ scallop vessels is estimated for the 
purpose of this example to be 4.18 million lb (1,896 mt). The 
contribution percentage of the above vessel is 1.45 percent (60,687 lb 
(27,527 kg)/4.18 million lb (1,896 mt) = 1.45 percent). The contribution 
percentage for a vessel that is issued an IFQ scallop permit and whose 
owner has permanently transferred all of its IFQ to another IFQ vessel, 
as specified in paragraph (h)(5)(ii) of this section, shall be equal to 
0 percent.
    (iv) Vessel IFQ Example. Continuing the example in paragraphs 
(h)(1)(ii)(D) and (h)(1)(iii) of this section, with an ACL allocated to 
IFQ scallop vessels estimated for this example to be equal to 2.5 
million lb (1,134 mt), the vessel's IFQ would be 36,250 lb (16,443 kg) 
(1.45 percent * 2.5 million lb (1,134 mt)).
    (v) End-of-year carry-over for IFQ. (A) With the exception of 
vessels that held a confirmation of permit history as described in Sec. 
648.4(a)(2)(ii)(L) for the entire fishing year preceding the carry-over 
year, LAGC IFQ vessels that have unused IFQ on the last day of February 
of any year may carry over up to 15 percent of the vessel's original IFQ 
and transferred (either temporary or permanent) IFQ into the next 
fishing year. For example, a vessel with a 10,000-lb (4,536-kg) IFQ and 
5,000-lb (2,268-kg) of leased IFQ may carry over 2,250 lb (1,020 kg) of 
IFQ (i.e., 15 percent of 15,000 lb (6,804 kg)) into the next fishing 
year if it landed 12,750 lb (5,783 kg) (i.e., 85 percent of 15,000 lb 
(6,804 kg)) of scallops or less in the preceding fishing year. Using the 
same IFQ values from the example, if the vessel landed 14,000 lb (6,350 
kg) of scallops, it could carry over 1,000 lb (454 kg) of scallops into 
the next fishing year.
    (B) For accounting purposes, the combined total of all vessels' IFQ 
carry-over shall be added to the LAGC IFQ fleet's applicable ACL for the 
carry-over year. Any IFQ carried over that is landed in the carry-over 
fishing year shall be counted against the ACL specified in paragraph 
(a)(4)(i) of this section, as increased by the total carry-over for all 
LAGC IFQ vessels, as specified in this paragraph (h)(2)(v)(B). IFQ 
carry-over shall not be applicable to the calculation of the IFQ cap 
specified in paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section and the ownership cap 
specified in paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (vi) AM for the IFQ fleet. If a vessel exceeds its IFQ, including 
all temporarily and permanently transferred IFQ, in a fishing year, the 
amount of landings in excess of the vessel's IFQ, including all 
temporarily and permanently transferred IFQ, shall be deducted from the 
vessel's IFQ as soon as possible in the fishing year following the 
fishing year in which the vessel exceeded its IFQ. If the AM takes 
effect, and an IFQ vessel lands more scallops than allocated after the 
AM is applied, the vessel shall have the IFQ landed in excess of its IFQ 
after applying the AM deducted from its IFQ in the subsequent fishing 
year. For example, a vessel with an initial IFQ of 1,000 lb (453.6 kg) 
in 2010 that lands 1,200 lb (544.3 kg) of scallops in 2010, and is 
initially allocated 1,300 lb (589.7 kg) of scallops in 2011 would be 
subject to an IFQ reduction equal to 200 lb (90.7 kg) to account for the 
200 lb (90.7 kg) overage in 2010. If that vessel lands 1,300 lb (589.7 
kg) of scallops in 2011 prior to application of the 200 lb (90.7 kg) 
deduction, the vessel would be subject to a deduction of 200 lb (90.7 
kg) in 2012. For vessels involved in a temporary IFQ transfer, the 
entire deduction shall apply to the vessel that acquired IFQ, not the 
transferring vessel. A vessel that has an overage that exceeds its IFQ 
in the subsequent fishing year shall be subject to an IFQ reduction in 
subsequent years until the overage is paid back. For example, a vessel 
with an IFQ of 1,000 lb (454 kg) in each year over a 3-year period that 
harvests 2,500 lb (1,134 kg) of scallops the first year would have a 
1,500-lb (680-kg) IFQ deduction, so that it would have zero pounds to 
harvest in year 2, and 500 lb (227 kg) to harvest in year 3. A vessel 
that has a ``negative'' IFQ balance, as described in the example, could 
lease or transfer IFQ to balance the IFQ, provided there are no 
sanctions or other enforcement penalties that would prohibit the vessel 
from acquiring IFQ.

    (3) IFQ ownership restrictions--(i) IFQ scallop vessel IFQ cap. (A) 
Unless otherwise specified in paragraphs (h)(3)(i)(B) and (C) of this 
section, a vessel issued an IFQ scallop permit or confirmation of permit 
history shall not be issued more than 2.5 percent of the ACL allocated 
to the IFQ scallop vessels as described in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this 
section.
    (B) A vessel may be initially issued more than 2.5 percent of the 
ACL allocated to the IFQ scallop vessels as described in paragraph 
(a)(4)(i) of this section, if the initial determination of its 
contribution factor specified in accordance with Sec. 
648.4(a)(2)(ii)(E) and paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section, results in 
an IFQ that exceeds 2.5 percent of the ACL allocated to the IFQ scallop 
vessels as described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section. A vessel 
that is allocated an IFQ that exceeds 2.5 percent of the ACL allocated 
to the IFQ scallop vessels as described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this 
section, in accordance with this paragraph (h)(3)(i)(B), may not receive 
IFQ through an IFQ transfer, as specified in paragraph (h)(5) of this 
section.
    (C) A vessel initially issued a 2008 IFQ scallop permit or 
confirmation of permit history, or that was issued or renewed a limited 
access scallop permit or confirmation of permit history for a vessel in 
2009 and thereafter, in compliance with the ownership restrictions in 
paragraph (h)(3)(i)(A) of this section, is eligible to renew such 
permits(s) and/or confirmation(s) of permit history, regardless of 
whether the renewal of the permit or confirmations of permit history 
will result in the 2.5-percent IFQ cap restriction being exceeded.
    (ii) IFQ ownership cap. (A) For any vessel acquired after June 1, 
2008, a vessel owner is not eligible to be issued an IFQ scallop permit 
for the vessel, and/or a confirmation of permit history, and is not 
eligible to transfer IFQ to the vessel, if, as a result of the issuance 
of the permit and/or confirmation of permit history, or IFQ transfer, 
the vessel owner, or any other person who is a shareholder or partner of 
the vessel owner, will have an ownership interest in more than 5 percent 
of the ACL allocated to the IFQ scallop vessels as described in 
paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section.
    (B) Vessel owners who were initially issued a 2008 IFQ scallop 
permit or confirmation of permit history, or who were issued or renewed 
a limited access scallop permit or confirmation of permit history for a 
vessel in 2009 and thereafter, in compliance with the ownership 
restrictions in paragraph (h)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, are eligible to 
renew such permits(s) and/or confirmation(s) of permit history, 
regardless of whether the renewal of the permits or confirmations of 
permit history will result in the 5-percent ownership restriction being 
exceeded.
    (C) Having an ownership interest includes, but is not limited to, 
persons who are shareholders in a vessel owned by a corporation, who are 
partners (general or limited) to a vessel owner, or who, in any way, 
partly own a vessel.
    (iii) Limited access scallop vessels that have been issued an IFQ 
scallop permit. The IFQ scallop vessel IFQ cap and IFQ ownership cap 
specified in this paragraph (h)(3) do not apply to limited access 
scallop vessels that are also issued a limited access general category 
scallop permit because such vessels are already subject to an ownership 
limitation, as specified in Sec. 648.4(a)(2)(i)(M).
    (4) IFQ cost recovery. A fee, not to exceed 3 percent of the ex-
vessel value of IFQ scallops harvested, shall be collected to recover 
the costs associated with management, data collection, and enforcement 
of the IFQ program. The owner of a vessel issued an IFQ scallop permit 
and subject to the IFQ program specified in this paragraph (h)(4), shall 
be responsible for paying the fee as specified by NMFS in this paragraph 
(h)(4). An IFQ scallop vessel shall incur a cost recovery fee liability 
for every landing of IFQ scallops. The IFQ scallop permit holder shall 
be responsible for collecting the fee for all of its vessels' IFQ 
scallop landings, and shall be responsible for submitting this payment 
to NMFS once per year. The cost recovery fee for all landings, 
regardless of ownership changes throughout the fishing year, shall be 
the responsibility of the official owner of the vessel, as

[[Page 593]]

recorded in the vessel permit or confirmation of permit history file, at 
the time the bill is sent.
    (i) Cost recovery fee determination. The ex-vessel value of scallops 
shall be determined as an average of the ex-vessel value, as determined 
by Northeast Federal dealer reports, of all IFQ scallops landed between 
March 1 and September 30 of the initial year of the IFQ scallop program, 
and from October 1 through September 30 of each year thereafter.
    (ii) Fee payment procedure. On or about October 31 of each year, 
NMFS shall mail a cost recovery bill to each IFQ scallop permit holder 
for the previous cost recovery period. An IFQ scallop permit holder who 
has incurred a fee must pay the fee to NMFS by January 1 of each year. 
Cost recovery payments shall be made electronically via the Federal web 
portal, www.pay.gov, or other Internet sites as designated by the 
Regional Administrator. Instructions for electronic payment shall be 
available on both the payment Web site and the paper bill. Payment 
options shall include payment via a credit card, as specified in the 
cost recovery bill, or via direct automated clearing house (ACH) 
withdrawal from a designated checking account. Payment by check may be 
authorized by NMFS if it has determined that electronic payment is not 
possible (for example, if the geographical area of an individual(s) is 
affected by catastrophic conditions).
    (iii) Payment compliance. An IFQ scallop permit holder that has 
incurred an IFQ cost recovery fee must pay the fee to NMFS by January 1 
of each year. If the cost recovery payment, as determined by NMFS, is 
not made by January 1, NMFS may deny the renewal of the IFQ scallop 
permit until full payment is received. If, upon preliminary review of 
the accuracy and completeness of a fee payment, NMFS determines the IFQ 
scallop permit holder has not paid the full amount due, NMFS shall 
notify the IFQ scallop permit holder by letter. NMFS shall explain the 
discrepancy and provide the IFQ scallop permit holder 30 days to either 
pay the amount specified by NMFS or to provide evidence that the amount 
paid was correct. If the IFQ scallop permit holder submits evidence in 
support of his/her payment, NMFS shall determine if there is any 
remaining disagreement as to the appropriate IFQ fee, and prepare a 
Final Administrative Determination (FAD). The FAD shall set out the 
facts, discuss those facts within the context of the relevant agency 
policies and regulations, and make a determination as to the appropriate 
disposition of the matter. A FAD shall be the final agency action, and, 
if the FAD determines that the IFQ scallop permit holder is out of 
compliance, the FAD shall require payment within 30 days. If a FAD is 
not issued until after the start of the fishing year, the IFQ scallop 
permit holder may be authorized to fish temporarily by the Regional 
Administrator until the FAD is issued, at which point the permit holder 
shall have 30 days to comply with the terms of the FAD or the IFQ 
scallop permit shall not be issued until such terms are met. If NMFS 
determines that the IFQ scallop permit holder owes additional fees for 
the previous cost recovery period, and the IFQ scallop permit has 
already been renewed, NMFS shall issue a FAD, at which point the permit 
holder shall have 30 days to comply with the terms of the FAD or NMFS 
may withdraw the issuance of the IFQ scallop permit until such terms are 
met. If such payment is not received within 30 days of issuance of the 
FAD, NMFS shall refer the matter to the appropriate authorities within 
the U.S. Department of the Treasury for purposes of collection, and no 
IFQ permit held by the permit holder may be renewed until the terms of 
the FAD are met. If NMFS determines that the conditions of the FAD have 
been met, the IFQ permit holder may renew the IFQ scallop permit(s). If 
NMFS does not receive full payment prior to the end of the fishing year, 
the IFQ scallop permit shall be considered voluntarily abandoned, 
pursuant to Sec. 648.4(a)(2)(ii)(K), unless otherwise determined by the 
Regional Administrator.
    (5) Transferring IFQ--(i) Temporary IFQ transfers. Subject to the 
restrictions in paragraph (h)(5)(iii) of this section, the owner of an 
IFQ scallop vessel not issued a limited access scallop permit may 
temporarily transfer its entire IFQ allocation, or a portion of its

[[Page 594]]

IFQ allocation, to another IFQ scallop vessel. Temporary IFQ transfers 
shall be effective only for the fishing year in which the temporary 
transfer is requested and processed. IFQ can be transferred only once 
during a given fishing year. Temporary IFQ transfers must be in the 
amount of at least 100 lb (45 kg), or the entire allocation may be 
transferred to another vessel. If a vessel has previously transferred a 
portion of its IFQ and the remaining allocation is less than 100 lb (45 
kg), the remaining IFQ may be transferred in full to another vessel. The 
Regional Administrator has final approval authority for all temporary 
IFQ transfer requests.
    (ii) Permanent IFQ transfers. Subject to the restrictions in 
paragraph (h)(5)(iii) of this section, the owner of an IFQ scallop 
vessel not issued a limited access scallop permit may transfer IFQ 
permanently to or from another IFQ scallop vessel. Any such transfer 
cannot be limited in duration and is permanent, unless the IFQ is 
subsequently transferred to another IFQ scallop vessel, other than the 
originating IFQ scallop vessel, in a subsequent fishing year. If a 
vessel owner permanently transfers the vessel's entire IFQ to another 
IFQ vessel, the LAGC IFQ scallop permit shall remain valid on the 
transferring vessel, unless the owner of the transferring vessel cancels 
the IFQ scallop permit. Such cancellation shall be considered voluntary 
relinquishment of the IFQ permit, and the vessel shall be ineligible for 
an IFQ scallop permit unless it replaces another vessel that was issued 
an IFQ scallop permit. The Regional Administrator has final approval 
authority for all IFQ transfer requests.
    (iii) IFQ transfer restrictions. The owner of an IFQ scallop vessel 
not issued a limited access scallop permit that has fished under its IFQ 
in a fishing year may not transfer that vessel's IFQ to another IFQ 
scallop vessel in the same fishing year. Requests for IFQ transfers 
cannot be less than 100 lb (46.4 kg), unless that value reflects the 
total IFQ amount remaining on the transferor's vessel, or the entire IFQ 
allocation. A vessel's total IFQ allocation can be transferred only once 
during a given fishing year. For example, a vessel owner can complete 
several transfers of portions of his/her vessel's IFQ during the fishing 
year, but cannot complete a temporary transfer of a portion of its IFQ 
then request to either temporarily or permanently transfer the entire 
IFQ in the same fishing year. A transfer of an IFQ may not result in the 
sum of the IFQs on the receiving vessel exceeding 2.5 percent of the ACL 
allocated to IFQ scallop vessels. A transfer of an IFQ, whether 
temporary or permanent, may not result in the transferee having a total 
ownership of, or interest in, general category scallop allocation that 
exceeds 5 percent of the ACL allocated to IFQ scallop vessels. Limited 
access scallop vessels that are also issued an IFQ scallop permit may 
not transfer to or receive IFQ from another IFQ scallop vessel.
    (iv) Application for an IFQ transfer. The owners of vessels applying 
for a transfer of IFQ must submit a completed application form obtained 
from the Regional Administrator. The application must be signed by both 
parties (transferor and transferee) involved in the transfer of the IFQ, 
and must be submitted to the NMFS Northeast Regional Office at least 30 
days before the date on which the applicants desire to have the IFQ 
effective on the receiving vessel. The Regional Administrator shall 
notify the applicants of any deficiency in the application pursuant to 
this section. Applications may be submitted at any time during the 
scallop fishing year, provided the vessel transferring the IFQ to 
another vessel has not utilized any of its own IFQ in that fishing year. 
Applications for temporary transfers received less than 45 days prior to 
the end of the fishing year may not be processed in time for a vessel to 
utilize the transferred IFQ, if approved, prior to the expiration of the 
fishing year.
    (A) Application information requirements. An application to transfer 
IFQ must contain at least the following information: Transferor's name, 
vessel name, permit number, and official number or state registration 
number; transferee's name, vessel name, permit number, and official 
number or state registration number; total price paid for purchased IFQ; 
signatures of transferor and transferee; and date the form

[[Page 595]]

was completed. In addition, applications to transfer IFQ must indicate 
the amount, in pounds, of the IFQ allocation transfer, which may not be 
less than 100 lb (45 kg) unless that value reflects the total IFQ amount 
remaining on the transferor's vessel, or the entire IFQ allocation. 
Information obtained from the transfer application will be held 
confidential, and will be used only in summarized form for management of 
the fishery.
    (B) Approval of IFQ transfer applications. Unless an application to 
transfer IFQ is denied according to paragraph (h)(5)(iii)(C) of this 
section, the Regional Administrator shall issue confirmation of 
application approval to both parties involved in the transfer within 30 
days of receipt of an application.
    (C) Denial of transfer application. The Regional Administrator may 
reject an application to transfer IFQ for any of the following reasons: 
The application is incomplete; the transferor or transferee does not 
possess a valid limited access general category permit; the transferor's 
vessel has fished under its IFQ prior to the completion of the transfer 
request; the transferor's or transferee's vessel or IFQ scallop permit 
has been sanctioned, pursuant to a final administrative decision or 
settlement of an enforcement proceeding; the transfer will result in the 
transferee's vessel having an allocation that exceeds 2.5 percent of the 
ACL allocated to IFQ scallop vessels; the transfer will result in the 
transferee having a total ownership of, or interest in, a general 
category scallop allocation that exceeds 5 percent of the ACL allocated 
to IFQ scallop vessels; or any other failure to meet the requirements of 
the regulations in 50 CFR part 648. Upon denial of an application to 
transfer IFQ, the Regional Administrator shall send a letter to the 
applicants describing the reason(s) for the rejection. The decision by 
the Regional Administrator is the final agency decision, and there is no 
opportunity to appeal the Regional Administrator's decision. An 
application that was denied can be resubmitted if the discrepancy(ies) 
that resulted in denial are resolved.

Sec. 648.54  State waters exemption.

    (a) State eligibility for exemption. (1) A state may be eligible for 
a state waters exemption if it has a scallop fishery and a scallop 
conservation program that does not jeopardize the biomass and fishing 
mortality/effort limit objectives of the Scallop FMP.
    (2) The Regional Administrator shall determine which states have a 
scallop fishery and which of those states have a scallop conservation 
program that does not jeopardize the biomass and fishing mortality/
effort limit objectives of the Scallop FMP. In such case, the Regional 
Administrator shall publish a rule in the Federal Register, in 
accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, to provide the 
exemption for such states.
    (3) A state that has been issued a state waters exemption under 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section must immediately notify the Regional 
Administrator of any changes in its scallop conservation program. The 
Regional Administrator shall review these changes and, if a 
determination is made that the state's conservation program jeopardizes 
the biomass and fishing mortality/effort limit objectives of the FMP, or 
that the state no longer has a scallop fishery, the Regional 
Administrator shall publish a rule in the Federal Register, in 
accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, to eliminate the 
exemption for that state.
    (4) The Regional Administrator has determined that the State of 
Maine has a scallop fishery conservation program for its scallop fishery 
that does not jeopardize the biomass and fishing mortality/effort limit 
objectives of the Scallop FMP. A vessel fishing in State of Maine waters 
may fish under the State of Maine state waters exemption, subject to the 
exemptions specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, provided 
the vessel is in compliance with paragraphs (d) through (g) of this 
section.

[[Page 596]]

    (b) Limited access scallop vessel exemption. Any vessel issued a 
limited access scallop permit is exempt from the DAS requirements 
specified in Sec. 648.53(b) while fishing exclusively landward of the 
outer boundary of the waters of a state that has been issued a state 
waters exemption under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, provided the 
vessel complies with paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section.
    (c) Gear and possession limit restrictions. Any vessel issued a 
limited access scallop permit, an LAGC NGOM, or an LAGC IFQ scallop 
permit is exempt from the minimum twine top mesh size for scallop dredge 
gear specified in Sec. 648.51(b)(4)(iv) while fishing exclusively 
landward of the outer boundary of the waters of the State of Maine under 
the state waters exemption specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section, provided the vessel is in compliance with paragraphs (d) 
through (g) of this section.
    (d) Notification requirements. Vessels fishing under the exemptions 
specified in paragraph (b) and/or (c) of this section must notify the 
Regional Administrator in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 
648.10(e).
    (e) Restriction on fishing in the EEZ. A vessel fishing under a 
state waters exemption may not fish in the EEZ during the time in which 
it is fishing under the state waters exemption, as declared under the 
notification requirements of this section.
    (f) Duration of exemption. An exemption expires upon a change in the 
vessel's name or ownership, or upon notification through VMS by the 
participating vessel's owner.
    (g) Applicability of other provisions of this part. A vessel fishing 
under the exemptions provided by paragraphs (b) and/or (c) of this 
section remains subject to all other requirements of this part.

[69 FR 35215, June 23, 2004, as amended at 71 FR 33227, June 8, 2006; 73 
FR 20128, Apr. 14, 2008; 74 FR 20555, May 4, 2009; 74 FR 37593, July 30,

<R05>
Sec. 648.55  Framework adjustments to management measures.

    (a) At least biennially, the Council shall assess the status of the 
scallop resource, determine the adequacy of the management measures to 
achieve scallop resource conservation objectives, and initiate a 
framework adjustment to establish scallop fishery management measures 
for the 2-year period beginning with the scallop fishing year 
immediately following the year in which the action is initiated. The PDT 
shall prepare a Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) Report 
that provides the information and analysis needed to evaluate potential 
management adjustments. The framework adjustment shall establish OFL, 
ABC, ACL, ACT, DAS allocations, rotational area management programs, 
percentage allocations for limited access general category vessels in 
Sea Scallop Access Areas, scallop possession limits, AMs, and other 
measures to achieve FMP objectives and limit fishing mortality. The 
Council's development of rotational area management adjustments shall 
take into account at least the following factors: General rotation 
policy; boundaries and distribution of rotational closures; number of 
closures; minimum closure size; maximum closure extent; enforceability 
of rotational closed and re-opened areas; monitoring through resource 
surveys; and re-opening criteria. Rotational closures should be 
considered where projected annual change in scallop biomass is greater 
than 30 percent. Areas should be considered for Sea Scallop Access Areas 
where the projected annual change in scallop biomass is less than 15 
percent.
    (b) The preparation of the SAFE Report shall begin on or about June 
1 of the year preceding the fishing year in which measures will be 
adjusted.
    (c) OFL, ABC, ACL, ACT, and AMs. The Council shall specify OFL, ABC, 
ACL, ACT, and AMs, as applicable, for each year covered under the 
biennial or other framework adjustment.
    (1) OFL. OFL shall be based on an updated scallop resource and 
fishery assessment provided by either the Scallop PDT or a formal stock 
assessment. OFL shall include all sources of scallop mortality and shall 
include an upward adjustment to account for catch of scallops in state 
waters by vessels not issued Federal scallop permits. The fishing 
mortality rate (F) associated with OFL shall be the threshold F,

[[Page 597]]

above which overfishing is occurring in the scallop fishery. The F 
associated with OFL shall be used to derive specifications for ABC, ACL, 
and ACT, as specified in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(5) of this 
section.
    (2) The specification of ABC, ACL, and ACT shall be based upon the 
following overfishing definition: The F shall be set so that in access 
areas, averaged for all years combined over the period of time that the 
area is closed and open to scallop fishing as an access area, it does 
not exceed the established F threshold for the scallop fishery; in open 
areas it shall not exceed the F threshold for the scallop fishery; and 
for access and open areas combined, it is set at a level that has a 75-
percent probability of remaining below the F associated with ABC, as 
specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, taking into account all 
sources of fishing mortality in the limited access and LAGC fleets of 
the scallop fishery.
    (3) ABC. The Council shall specify ABC for each year covered under 
the biennial or other framework adjustment. ABC shall be the catch that 
has an associated F that has a 75-percent probability of remaining below 
the F associated with OFL. ABC shall be equal to ACL for the scallop 
fishery.
    (4) Deductions from ABC. Incidental catch, equal to the value 
established in Sec. 648.53(a)(2), shall be removed from ABC/ACL. One 
percent of ABC/ACL shall be removed from ABC/ACL for observer set-aside. 
Scallop catch equal to the value specified in Sec. 648.56(d) shall be 
removed from ABC/ACL for research set-aside. These deductions for 
incidental catch, observer set-aside, and research set-aside, shall be 
made prior to establishing ACLs for the limited access and LAGC fleets, 
as specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
    (5) Sub-ACLs for the limited access and LAGC fleets. The Council 
shall specify sub-ACLs for the limited access and LAGC fleets for each 
year covered under the biennial or other framework adjustment. After 
applying the deductions as specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section, a sub-ACL equal to 94.5 percent of the ABC/ACL shall be 
allocated to the limited access fleet. After applying the deductions as 
specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, a sub-ACL of 5.5 percent 
of ABC/ACL shall be allocated to the LAGC fleet, so that 5 percent of 
ABC/ACL is allocated to the LAGC fleet of vessels that do not also have 
a limited access scallop permit, and 0.5 percent of the ABC/ACL is 
allocated to the LAGC fleet of vessels that have limited access scallop 
permits. This specification of sub-ACLs shall not account for catch 
reductions associated with the application of AMs or adjustment of the 
sub-ACL as a result of the limited access AM exception as specified in 
Sec. 648.53(b)(4)(iii).
    (6) ACT for the limited access and LAGC fleets. The Council shall 
specify ACTs for the limited access and LAGC fleets for each year 
covered under the biennial or other framework adjustment. The ACT for 
the limited access fishery shall be set at a level that has an 
associated F with a 75-percent probability of remaining below the F 
associated with ABC/ACL. The LAGC ACT shall be set equal to the LAGC 
sub-ACL as specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
    (7) AMs. The Council shall specify AMs for the limited access and 
LAGC fleets for each year covered under the biennial or other framework 
adjustment. For the limited access scallop fleet, AMs result in a DAS 
reduction for each limited access scallop vessel as specified in Sec. 
648.53(b)(4)(ii). For the LAGC scallop fleet, AMs result in an IFQ 
deduction for each vessel issued a LAGC scallop permit as specified in 
Sec. 648.53(h)(2)(vi).
    (d) Yellowtail flounder sub-ACL. The Council shall specify the 
yellowtail flounder sub-ACL allocated to the scallop fishery through the 
framework adjustment process specified in Sec. 648.90.
    (e) Third-year default management measures. The biennial framework 
action shall include default management measures that shall be effective 
in the third year unless replaced by the measures included in the next 
biennial framework action. If the biennial framework action is not 
published in the Federal Register with an effective date on or before 
March 1, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, the third-
year measures shall be effective beginning March 1 of each fishing year 
until the framework adjustment is implemented, or for the

[[Page 598]]

entire fishing year if the framework adjustment is completed or is not 
implemented by NMFS for the third year. The framework action shall 
specify the measures necessary to address inconsistencies between 
specifications and allocations for the period after March 1 but before 
the framework adjustment is implemented for that year. In the case of 
third-year measures of a biennial adjustment being implemented, if no 
framework adjustment has been implemented by March 1 of the following 
year, the measures from the preceding year shall continue to be in 
effect until replaced by subsequent action.
    (f) After considering the PDT's findings and recommendations, or at 
any other time, if the Council determines that adjustments to, or 
additional management measures are necessary, it shall develop and 
analyze appropriate management actions over the span of at least two 
Council meetings. To address interactions between the scallop fishery 
and sea turtles and other protected species, such adjustments may 
include proactive measures including, but not limited to, the timing of 
Sea Scallop Access Area openings, seasonal closures, gear modifications, 
increased observer coverage, and additional research. The Council shall 
provide the public with advance notice of the availability of both the 
proposals and the analyses, and opportunity to comment on them prior to 
and at the second Council meeting. The Council's recommendation on 
adjustments or additions to management measures must include measures to 
prevent overfishing of the available biomass of scallops and ensure that 
OY is achieved on a continuing basis, and must come from one or more of 
the following categories:
    (1) Total allowable catch and DAS changes;
    (2) Shell height;
    (3) Offloading window reinstatement;
    (4) Effort monitoring;
    (5) Data reporting;
    (6) Trip limits;
    (7) Gear restrictions;
    (8) Permitting restrictions;
    (9) Crew limits;
    (10) Small mesh line;
    (11) Onboard observers;
    (12) Modifications to the overfishing definition;
    (13) VMS Demarcation Line for DAS monitoring;
    (14) DAS allocations by gear type;

hearings;
    (16) Scallop size restrictions, except a minimum size or weight of 
individual scallop meats in the catch;
    (17) Aquaculture enhancement measures and closures;
    (18) Closed areas to increase the size of scallops caught;
    (19) Modifications to the opening dates of closed areas;
    (20) Size and configuration of rotational management areas;
    (21) Controlled access seasons to minimize bycatch and maximize 
yield;
    (22) Area-specific trip allocations;
    (23) TAC specifications and seasons following re-opening;
    (24) Limits on number of area closures;
    (25) Set-asides for funding research;
    (26) Priorities for scallop-related research that is funded by 
research TAC set-aside;
    (27) Finfish TACs for controlled access areas;
    (28) Finfish possession limits;
    (29) Sea sampling frequency;
    (30) Area-specific gear limits and specifications;
    (31) Modifications to provisions associated with observer set-
asides; observer coverage; observer deployment; observer service 
provider; and/or the observer certification regulations;
    (32) Specifications for IFQs for limited access general category 
vessels;
    (33) Revisions to the cost recovery program for IFQs;
    (34) Development of general category fishing industry sectors and 
fishing cooperatives;

[[Page 599]]

    (g) The Council may make recommendations to the Regional 
Administrator to implement measures in accordance with the procedures 
described in this section to address gear conflict as defined under 
Sec. 600.10 of this chapter. In developing such recommendation, the 
Council shall define gear management areas, each not to exceed 2,700 
mi\2\ (6,993 km\2\), and seek industry comments by referring the matter 
to its standing industry advisory committee for gear conflict, or to any 
ad hoc industry advisory committee that may be formed. The standing 
industry advisory committee or ad hoc committee on gear conflict shall 
hold public meetings seeking comments from affected fishers and develop 
findings and recommendations on addressing the gear conflict. After 
receiving the industry advisory committee findings and recommendations, 
or at any other time, the Council shall determine whether it is 
necessary to adjust or add management measures to address gear conflicts 
and which FMPs must be modified to address such conflicts. If the 
Council determines that adjustments or additional measures are 
necessary, it shall develop and analyze appropriate management actions 
for the relevant FMPs over the span of at least two Council meetings. 
The Council shall provide the public with advance notice of the 
availability of the recommendation, the appropriate justification and 
economic and biological analyses, and opportunity to comment on them 
prior to and at the second or final Council meeting before submission to 
the Regional Administrator. The Council's recommendation on adjustments 
or additions to management measures for gear conflicts must come from 
one or more of the following categories:
    (1) Monitoring of a radio channel by fishing vessels;
    (2) Fixed-gear location reporting and plotting requirements;
    (3) Standards of operation when gear conflict occurs;
    (4) Fixed-gear marking and setting practices;
    (5) Gear restrictions for specific areas (including time and area 
closures);
    (6) VMS;
    (7) Restrictions on the maximum number of fishing vessels or amount 
of gear; and
    (8) Special permitting conditions.
    (h) The measures shall be evaluated and approved by the relevant 
committees with oversight authority for the affected FMPs. If there is 
disagreement between committees, the Council may return the proposed 
framework adjustment to the standing or ad hoc gear conflict committee 
for further review and discussion.
    (i) Unless otherwise specified, after developing a framework 
adjustment and receiving public testimony, the Council shall make a 
recommendation to the Regional Administrator. The Council's 
recommendation must include supporting rationale and, if management 
measures are recommended, an analysis of impacts and a recommendation to 
the Regional Administrator on whether to publish the framework 
adjustment as a final rule. If the Council recommends that the framework 
adjustment should be published as a final rule, the Council must 
consider at least the following factors and provide support and analysis 
for each factor considered:
    (1) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended 
management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a 
proposed rule, and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire 
harvest/fishing season;
    (2) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for 
participation by the public and members of the affected industry, 
consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act, in the development of 
the Council's recommended management measures;
    (3) Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource or to 
impose management measures to resolve gear conflicts; and
    (4) Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management 
measures adopted following their promulgation as a final rule.
    (j) If the Council's recommendation includes adjustments or 
additions to management measures, and if, after reviewing the Council's 
recommendation and supporting information:

[[Page 600]]

    (1) The Regional Administrator approves the Council's recommended 
management measures, the Secretary may, for good cause found pursuant to 
the Administrative Procedure Act, waive the requirement for a proposed 
rule and opportunity for public comment in the Federal Register. The 
Secretary, in doing so, shall publish only the final rule. Submission of 
a recommendation by the Council for a final rule does not affect the 
Secretary's responsibility to comply with the Administrative Procedure 
Act; or
    (2) The Regional Administrator approves the Council's recommendation 
and determines that the recommended management measures should be 
published first as a proposed rule, the action shall be published as a 
proposed rule in the Federal Register. After additional public comment, 
if the Regional Administrator concurs with the Council recommendation, 
the action shall be published as a final rule in the Federal Register; 
or
    (3) The Regional Administrator does not concur, the Council shall be 
notified, in writing, of the reasons for the non-concurrence.
    (k) Nothing in this section is meant to derogate from the authority 
of the Secretary to take emergency action under section 305(c) of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act.

Sec. 648.56  Scallop research.

    (a) At least biennially, in association with the biennial framework 
process, the Council and NMFS shall prepare and issue an announcement of 
Federal Funding Opportunity (FFO) that identifies research priorities 
for projects to be conducted by vessels using research set-aside as 
specified in paragraph (d) of this section and Sec. 648.60(e), provides 
requirements and instructions for applying for funding of a proposed RSA 
project, and specifies the date by which applications must be received. 
The FFO shall be published as soon as possible by NMFS and shall provide 
the opportunity for applicants to apply for projects to be awarded for 1 
or 2 years by allowing applicants to apply for RSA funding for the first 
year, second year, or both.
    (b) Proposals submitted in response to the FFO must include the 
following information, as well as any other specific information 
required within the FFO: A project summary that includes the project 
goals and objectives, the relationship of the proposed research to 
scallop research priorities and/or management needs, project design, 
participants other than the applicant, funding needs, breakdown of 
costs, and the vessel(s) for which authorization is requested to conduct 
research activities.
    (c) NOAA shall make the final determination as to what proposals are 
approved and which vessels are authorized to take scallops in excess of 
possession limits, or take additional trips into Open or Access Areas. 
NMFS shall provide authorization of such activities to specific vessels 
by letter of acknowledgement, letter of authorization, or Exempted 
Fishing Permit issued by the Regional Administrator, which must be kept 
on board the vessel.
    (d) Available RSA allocation shall be 1.25 million lb (567 mt) 
annually, which shall be deducted from the ABC/ACL specified in Sec. 
648.53(a) prior to setting ACLs for the limited access and LAGC fleets, 
as specified in Sec. 648.53(a)(3) and (a)(4), respectively. Approved 
RSA projects shall be allocated an amount of scallop pounds that can be 
harvested in open areas and available access areas. The specific access 
areas that are open to RSA harvest shall be specified through the 
framework process as identified in Sec. 648.60(e)(1). In a year in 
which a framework adjustment is under review by the Council and/or NMFS, 
NMFS shall make RSA awards prior to approval of the framework, if 
practicable, based on total scallop pounds needed to fund each research 
project. Recipients may begin compensation fishing in open areas prior 
to approval of the framework, or wait until NMFS approval of the 
framework to begin compensation fishing within approved access areas.
    (e) If all RSA TAC is not allocated in a fishing year, and proceeds 
from compensation fishing for approved projects fall short of funds 
needed to cover a project's budget due to a lower-than-expected scallop 
price, unused RSA allocation can be provided to that year's awarded 
projects to compensate for the

[[Page 601]]

funding shortfall, or to expand a project, rather than having that RSA 
go unused. NMFS shall identify the process for the reallocation of 
available RSA pounds as part of the FFO for the RSA program. The FFO 
shall specify the conditions under which a project that has been awarded 
RSA could be provided additional RSA pounds as supplemental compensation 
to account for lower-than-expected scallop price or for expansion of the 
project, timing of reallocation, and information submission 
requirements.
    (f) If all RSA pounds awarded to a project cannot be harvested 
during the applicable fishing year, RSA TAC awarded to that project may 
be harvested through May 31 of the fishing year subsequent to the 
fishing year in which the set-aside is awarded.
    (g) Vessels conducting research under an approved RSA project may be 
exempt from crew restrictions specified in Sec. 648.51, seasonal 
closures of access areas specified in Sec. 648.59, and the restriction 
on fishing in only one access area during a trip specified in Sec. 
648.60(a)(4). The RSA project proposal must list which of these measures 
for which an exemption is required. An exemption shall be provided by 
Letter of Authorization issued by the Regional Administrator. RSA 
compensation fishing trips and combined compensation and research trips 
are not eligible for these exemptions.
    (h) Upon completion of scallop research projects approved pursuant 
to this section and the applicable NOAA grants review process, 
researchers must provide the Council and NMFS with a report of research 
findings, which must include at least the following: A detailed 
description of methods of data collection and analysis; a discussion of 
results and any relevant conclusions presented in a format that is 
understandable to a non-technical audience; and a detailed final 
accounting of all funds used to conduct the sea scallop research.

Sec. 648.57  Sea scallop area rotation program.

    An area rotation program is established for the scallop fishery, 
which may include areas closed to scallop fishing defined in Sec. 
648.58, and/or Sea Scallop Access Areas defined in Sec. 648.59, subject 
to the Sea Scallop Area Access program requirements specified in Sec. 
648.60. Areas not defined as Rotational Closed Areas, Sea Scallop Access 
Areas, EFH Closed Areas, or areas closed to scallop fishing under other 
FMPs, are open to scallop fishing as governed by the other management 
measures and restrictions in this part. The Council's development of 
area rotation programs is subject to the framework adjustment process 
specified in Sec. 648.55, including the Area Rotation Program factors 
included in Sec. 648.55(a). The percentage of the total allowable catch 
for each Sea Scallop Access Area that is allocated to limited access 
scallop vessels and limited access general category scallop vessels 
shall be specified in Sec. 648.59 through the framework adjustment 
process specified in Sec. 648.55.

Sec. 648.58  Rotational Closed Areas.

    (a)-(b) [Reserved]
    (c) Transiting. No vessel possessing scallops may enter or be in the 
area(s) specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section unless the 
vessel is transiting the area and the vessel's fishing gear is 
unavailable for immediate use as defined in Sec. 648.23(b), or there is 
a compelling safety reason to be in such areas.
    (d) Vessels fishing for species other than scallops. A vessel may 
fish for species other than scallops within the closed areas specified 
in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section as allowed in this part, 
provided the vessel does not fish for, catch, or retain scallops or 
intend to fish for, catch, or retain scallops. Declaration through VMS 
that the vessel is fishing in the general category scallop fishery is 
deemed to be an intent to fish for, catch, or retain scallops.
    (e) [Reserved]
    (f) Delmarva Closed Area. No vessel may fish for scallops in, or 
possess or land scallops from, the area known as the Delmarva Closed 
Area. No vessel may possess scallops in the Delmarva Closed Area, unless 
such vessel is only transiting the area as provided in paragraph (c) of 
this section. The Delmarva

<R05>
Sec. 648.59  Sea Scallop Access Areas.

    (a) Delmarva Sea Scallop Access Area. (1) From March 1, 2011, 
through February 28, 2014 (i.e., fishing years 2011 through 2013), a 
vessel issued a scallop permit may fish for, possess, or land scallops 
in or from the area known as the Delmarva Sea Scallop Access Area, 
described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, only if the vessel is 
participating in, and complies with the requirements of, the area access 
program described in Sec. 648.60. The Delmarva Scallop Access Area 
schedule and TACs specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section for 
fishing year 2013 are default measures and subject to change through a 
future framework adjustment.
    (2) The Delmarva Sea Scallop Access Area is defined by straight 
lines connecting the following points in the order stated (copies of a 
chart depicting this area are available from the Regional Administrator 
upon request):

    (3) Number of trips--(i) Limited access vessels. Based on its permit 
category, a vessel issued a limited access scallop permit may fish no 
more than the maximum number of trips in the Delmarva Access Area as 
specified in Sec. 648.60(a)(3)(i), unless the vessel owner has made an 
exchange with another vessel owner whereby the vessel gains a Delmarva 
Access Area trip and gives up a trip into another Sea Scallop Access 
Area, as specified in Sec. 648.60(a)(3)(ii), or unless the vessel is 
taking a compensation trip for a prior Delmarva Access Area trip that 
was terminated early, as specified in Sec. 648.60(c). Additionally, 
limited access full-time and part-time scallop vessels are restricted in 
the number of trips that may be taken from June 15 through October 31, 
as specified in Sec. 648.60(a)(3)(i)(B)(4) and (a)(3)(i)(C)(4). The 
number of trips allocated to limited access vessels in the Delmarva 
Access Area shall be based on the TAC for the access area, which shall 
be determined through the annual framework process and specified in 
paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section. The Delmarva Access Area scallop 
TACs for limited access scallop vessels are 5,886,000 lb (2,670 mt) in 
fishing year 2011, and 2,943,000 lb (1,335 mt) in fishing years 2012 and 
2013.
    (ii) LAGC IFQ scallop vessels.--(A) The percentage of the Delmarva 
Access Area TAC to be allocated to LAGC IFQ scallop vessels shall be 
specified in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(A) of this section through the 
framework adjustment process, and shall determine the number of trips 
allocated to LAGC IFQ scallop vessels as specified in paragraph 
(a)(4)(ii)(B) of this section. LAGC IFQ vessels will be allocated 
355,900 lb (161 mt) in fishing year 2011, 177,490 lb (81 mt) in fishing 
year 2012, and 178,600 lb (81 mt) in fishing year 2013, which represent 
5.5 percent of the Delmarva Access Area TACs for each fishing year. This 
TAC applies to both LAGC IFQ vessels and limited access vessels with 
LAGC IFQ permits that are fishing under the provisions of the LAGC IFQ 
permit.
    (B) Based on the TAC specified in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(A) of this 
section, LAGC scallop vessels are allocated 593 trips in fishing year 
2011, 296 trips in fishing year 2012, and 298 trips in fishing year 2013 
to the Delmarva Access Area. This fleet-wide trip allocation applies to 
both LAGC IFQ vessels and limited access vessels with LAGC IFQ

[[Page 603]]

permits that are fishing under the provisions of the LAGC IFQ permit. 
The Regional Administrator shall notify all LAGC IFQ scallop vessels of 
the date when the total number of trips have been, or are projected to 
be, taken by providing notification in the Federal Register, in 
accordance with Sec. 648.60(g)(4). An LAGC IFQ scallop vessel may not 
fish for, possess, or land sea scallops in or from the Delmarva Access 
Area, or enter the Delmarva Access Area on a declared LAGC IFQ scallop 
trip after the effective date published in the Federal Register, unless 
transiting pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section.
    (1) If the fleet-wide Delmarva Access Area trip allocation 
implemented by Framework 22 is exceeded in the 2011 fishing year, the 
fleet-wide Delmarva Access Area trip allocation in fishing year 2012 
shall be reduced by the number of trips taken in excess of the amount 
specified in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (C) Scallops landed by each LAGC IFQ vessel on a Delmarva Access 
Area trip shall be counted against that vessel's IFQ.
    (4) [Reserved]
    (b) Closed Area I Access Area--(1) From March 1, 2013, through 
February 28, 2014 (i.e., fishing year 2013), vessels issued scallop 
permits may not fish for, possess, or land scallops in or from, the area 
known as the Closed Area I Access Area, described in paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section, unless transiting pursuant to paragraph (f) of this 
section. Vessels issued both a NE Multispecies permit and an LAGC 
scallop permit may fish in an approved SAP under Sec. 648.85 and under 
multispecies DAS in the scallop access area, provided they comply with 
restrictions in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(C) of this section. The Closed Area 
I Sea Scallop Access Area schedule and TACs specified in paragraph 
(b)(5) of this section for fishing year 2013 are default measures and 
subject to change through a future framework adjustment.
    (2) From March 1, 2011, through February 28, 2013 (i.e., fishing 
years 2011 and 2012), subject to the seasonal restrictions specified in 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section, a vessel issued a scallop permit may 
fish for, possess, and land scallops in or from the area known as the 
Closed Area I Access Area, described in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section, only if the vessel is participating in, and complies with the 
requirements of, the area access program described in 648.60.
    (3) The Closed Area I Access Area is defined by straight lines

    (4) Season. A vessel issued a scallop permit may not fish for, 
possess, or land scallops in or from, the area known as the Closed Area 
I Sea Scallop Access Area, described in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section, except during the period June 15 through January 31 of each 
year the Closed Area I Sea Scallop Access Area is open to scallop 
vessels, unless transiting pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section.
    (5) Number of trips--(i) Limited access vessels. Based on its permit 
category, a vessel issued a limited access scallop permit may fish no 
more than the maximum number of trips in the Closed Area I Access Area, 
unless the vessel owner has made an exchange with another vessel owner 
whereby the vessel gains a Closed Area I Access Area trip and gives up a 
trip into another Sea Scallop Access Area, as specified in Sec. 
648.60(a)(3)(ii), or unless the vessel is taking a compensation trip for 
a prior Closed Area I Access Area trip that was terminated early, as 
specified in Sec. 648.60(c). The number of trips allocated to limited 
access vessels in the Closed Area I Access Area shall be based on the 
TAC for the access area, which will be determined through the

[[Page 604]]

annual framework process and specified in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this 
section. The number of trips allocated to limited access vessels in the 
Closed Area I Access Area shall be based on the TAC for the access area, 
which shall be determined through the annual framework process and 
specified in this paragraph (b)(5)(i). The Closed Area I Access Area 
scallop TAC for limited access scallop vessels is 8,829,000 (4,005 mt) 
in fishing year 2011, and 2,943,000 lb (1,335 mt) in fishing year 2012. 
Closed Area I Access Area is closed to limited access vessels for the 
2013 fishing year.
    (ii) LAGC scallop vessels. (A) The percentage of the Closed Area I 
Access Area TAC to be allocated to LAGC scallop vessels shall be 
specified through the framework adjustment process and shall determine 
the number of trips allocated to LAGC scallop vessels as specified in 
paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B) of this section. The TAC applies to both LAGC 
IFQ vessels and limited access vessels with LAGC IFQ permits that are 
fishing under the provisions of the LAGC IFQ permit. LAGC IFQ vessels 
will be allocated 533,850 lb (242 mt) in fishing year 2011, and 177,490 
lb (81 mt) in fishing year 2012, which represent 5.5 percent of the 
Closed Area I Access Area TACs for each fishing year. This TAC applies 
to both LAGC IFQ vessels and limited access vessels with LAGC IFQ 
permits that are fishing under the provisions of the LAGC IFQ permit. 
The Closed Area I Access Area will be closed to LAGC IFQ vessels in 
fishing year 2013.
    (B) Based on the TACs specified in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this 
section, LAGC IFQ vessels are allocated a total of 890 trips in fishing 
year 2011, and 296 trips in fishing year 2012 in the Closed Area I 
Access Area. No LAGC IFQ trips will be allocated in Closed Area I Access 
Area in fishing year 2013. The Regional Administrator shall notify all 
LAGC scallop vessels of the date when the maximum number of allowed 
trips for the applicable fishing year have been, or are projected to be, 
taken by providing notification in the Federal Register, in accordance 
with Sec. 648.60(g)(4). Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(C) 
of this section, and subject to the seasonal restrictions specified in 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section, an LAGC scallop vessel may not fish 
for, possess, or land sea scallops in or from the Closed Area I Access 
Area, or enter the Closed Area I Access Area on a declared LAGC scallop 
trip after the effective date published in the Federal Register, unless 
transiting pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section.
    (C) A vessel issued a NE Multispecies permit and a LAGC scallop 
permit that is fishing in an approved SAP under Sec. 648.85 under 
multispecies DAS may fish in the Scallop Access Areas without being 
subject to the restrictions of paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section, 
provided that it has not enrolled in the Scallop Area Access program. 
Such vessel is prohibited from fishing for, possessing, or landing 
scallops.
    (D) Scallops landed by each LAGC IFQ vessel on a Closed Area I 
Access Area trip shall count against that vessel's IFQ.
    (iii) Limited access vessels. Based on its permit category, a vessel 
issued a limited access scallop permit may fish no more than the maximum 
number of trips in the Closed Area I Access Area, unless the vessel 
owner has made an exchange with another vessel owner whereby the vessel 
gains a Closed Area I Access Area trip and gives up a trip into another 
Sea Scallop Access Area, as specified in Sec. 648.60(a)(3)(ii), or 
unless the vessel is taking a compensation trip for a prior Closed Area 
I Access Area trip that was terminated early, as specified in Sec. 
648.60(c).

Sec. 648.60  Sea scallop access area program requirements.

    (a) A limited access scallop vessel may only fish in the Sea Scallop 
Access Areas specified in Sec. 648.59, subject to the seasonal 
restrictions specified in Sec. 648.59, when fishing under a scallop 
DAS, provided the vessel complies with the requirements specified in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(9), and (b) through (f) of this section. 
An LAGC scallop vessel may fish in the Sea Scallop Access Areas 
specified in Sec. 648.59, subject to the seasonal restrictions 
specified in Sec. 648.59, provided the vessel complies with the 
requirements specified in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (1) VMS. Each vessel participating in the Sea Scallop Access Area 
Program must have installed on board an operational VMS unit that meets 
the minimum performance criteria specified in Sec. Sec. 648.9 and 
648.10, and paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) Vessels participating in the Sea Scallop Access Area Program 
must comply with the trip declaration requirements specified in Sec. 
648.10(f) and vessel notification requirements specified in Sec. 
648.11(g) for observer deployment.
    (3) Number of Sea Scallop Access Area trips--(i) Limited access 
vessel trips. (A) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, 
paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(B) through (E) of this section specify the total 
number of trips that a limited access scallop vessel may take into Sea 
Scallop Access Areas during applicable seasons specified in Sec. 
648.59. The number of trips per vessel in any one Sea Scallop Access 
Area may not exceed the maximum number of trips allocated for such Sea 
Scallop Access Area as specified in Sec. 648.59, unless the vessel 
owner has exchanged a trip with another vessel owner for an additional 
Sea Scallop Access Area trip, as specified in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of 
this section, or has been allocated a compensation trip pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (1) In fishing year 2011, if a full-time vessel engages in trip 
exchanges, as specified in Sec. 648.60(a)(3)(ii), prior to the 
implementation of Framework 22, resulting in such vessel receiving a 
total of five access area trips due to the mid-year implementation of 
Framework 22, the vessel must relinquish one trip of the vessel owner's 
choice in fishing year 2011 from its available access area trip 
allocation in order not to exceed the allocation of four trips as 
specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B) of this section. As soon as possible 
after the implementation of Framework 22, NMFS shall send a notification 
letter to the owner of such a vessel regarding the requirement that one 
of the vessel's unused access area trips must be relinquished in fishing 
year 2011 to account for the previous trip exchange. The vessel owner 
will be given the opportunity to select the area from which the trip 
will be deducted, with NMFS determining the area if the vessel owner 
fails to respond within 30 days according to instructions provided in 
such letter.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (B) Full-time scallop vessels.--(1) In fishing year 2011, each full-
time vessel shall have a total of four access area trips and is subject 
to the following seasonal trip restrictions specified in paragraph 
(a)(3)(i)(B)(4) of this section. All full-time scallop vessels shall be 
allocated one trip in the Delmarva Access Area, one trip into the Hudson 
Canyon Access Area, and one trip into the Closed Area I Access Area. In 
addition, each vessel shall receive either an

additional trip into the Closed Area I Access Area or a trip into the 
Closed Area II Access Area. These allocations shall be determined by the 
Regional Administrator through a random assignment and shall be made 
publically available on the Northeast Regional website prior to the 
start of the 2011 fishing year.
    (2) In fishing year 2012, each full-time vessel shall have a total 
of four access area trips and is subject to the following seasonal trip 
restrictions specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B)(4) of this section. All 
full-time vessels shall receive one trip into the Closed Area II Access 
Area and one trip into the Hudson Canyon Access Area. Each vessel shall 
also receive an additional two access area trips that must be allocated 
in one of the following combinations: One trip in the Closed Area I 
Access Area and one trip in the Nantucket Lightship Access Area; one 
trip in the Closed Area I Access Area and one additional trip in the 
Hudson Canyon Access Area; one trip in the Closed Area I Access Area and 
one trip in the Delmarva Access Area; one trip in the Nantucket 
Lightship Access Area and an additional trip in the Hudson Canyon Access 
Area; one trip in the Nantucket Lightship Access Area and one trip in 
the Delmarva Access Area; or an additional trip in the Hudson Canyon 
Access Area and one in the Delmarva Access Area. These allocations shall 
be determined by the Regional Administrator through a random assignment 
and shall be made publically available prior to the start of the 2012 
fishing year. A full description of the random assignment process for FY 
2012 is outlined in Section 2.4.2 of Framework 22 to the Scallop Fishery 
Management Plan.
    (3) At the start of fishing year 2013, each full-time vessel shall 
have a total of four access area trips and are subject to the following 
seasonal trip restrictions specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B)(4) of 
this section. The access area trip allocations for the 2013 fishing year 
are default allocations that are subject to change in a future framework 
adjustment. All full-time scallop vessels shall be allocated one trip in 
the Closed Area II Access Area, one trip in the Nantucket Lightship 
Access Area, and one trip in the Hudson Canyon Access Area. In addition, 
each vessel shall receive either an additional trip in the Hudson Canyon 
Access Area or in the Delmarva Access Area. These allocations shall be 
determined by the Regional Administrator through a random assignment and 
will be made publically available prior to the start of the 2013 fishing 
year. A full description of the random assignment process for FY 2013 is 
outlined in Section 2.4.2 of Framework 22 to the Scallop Fishery 
Management Plan.
    (4) A full-time scallop vessel may not fish for, possess, or retain 
more than a combined total of 18,000 lb (8,165 kg) of scallops during 
the period June 15 through October 31, the equivalent of one full trip 
possession limit specified in Sec. 648.60(a)(5)(i), during this time 
period from the Delmarva and Hudson Canyon Access Areas specified in 
Sec. 648.59(a) and (e). For example, a full-time vessel may possesses 
or land up to 18,000 lb (8,165 kg) from the Hudson Canyon Access Area, 
up to 18,000 lb (8,165 kg) from the Delmarva Access Area, or up to 
18,000 lb (8,165 kg) combined from separate trips into each access area 
during June 15 through October 31. The remaining access area trips may 
be taken during the remainder of the fishing year. These possession and 
landing restrictions do not include the additional possession allowance 
to defray the cost of carrying an observer as specified in Sec. 
648.60(d) that occur during observed trips between June 15 through 
October 31. In addition, if the owner of a full-time vessel has 
exchanged a trip(s) with another vessel owner(s) so that the vessel has 
an allocation of four combined trips into the Delmarva and/or Hudson 
Canyon Access Areas, that vessel may not fish for, possess, or retain 
more than a combined total of 36,000 lb (16,329 kg) of scallops, the 
equivalent of two full trip possession limits specified in Sec. 
648.60(a)(5)(i), during this time period from the Delmarva and/or Hudson 
Canyon Access Areas combined.
    (i) If, prior to the implementation of Framework 22, a full-time 
vessel with less than four total Mid-Atlantic access trips possesses or 
lands more than 18,000 lb (8,165 kg) from declared access

[[Page 610]]

area trips into the Delmarva and Hudson Canyon Access Areas during June 
15 through October 31 in fishing year 2011, that vessel shall not 
declare an access area trip in fishing year 2012 in the Mid-Atlantic 
during June 15 through October 31. Alternatively, a full-time vessel 
could account for the overage by exchanging trips with another vessel(s) 
so that it has an allocation of a total of four Mid-Atlantic trips and 
continue to fish up to a maximum of 36,000 lb (16,329 kg) (i.e., the 
equivalent of two full-time limited access trips) through October 31, 
2011.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (5) In fishing year 2012, each full-time vessel shall have a total 
of four access area trips and is subject to the following seasonal trip 
restrictions specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B)(4) of this section. All 
full-time vessels shall receive one trip into the Closed Area II Access 
Area and one trip into the Hudson Canyon Access Area. Each vessel shall 
also receive an additional two access area trips that must be allocated 
in one of the following combinations: Two trips in the Closed Area I 
Access Area; one trip in the Closed Area I Access Area and one trip in 
the Nantucket Lightship Access Area; one trip in the Closed Area I 
Access Area and one additional trip in the Hudson Canyon Access Area; or 
one trip in the Nantucket Lightship Access Area and an additional trip 
in the Hudson Canyon Access Area. These allocations shall be determined 
by the Regional Administrator through a random assignment and shall be 
made publically available prior to the start of the 2012 fishing year. A 
full description of the random assignment process for FY 2012 is 
outlined in Section 2.4.2 of Framework 22 to the Scallop Fishery 
Management Plan.
    (i) If a full-time vessel was allocated, declared, and fully 
harvested a 2012 fishing year Delmarva Access Area trip, as originally 
allocated under Framework Adjustment 22 management measures, prior to 
the Delmarva Access Area closure implemented under emergency action 
authority, it will not receive a 2012 fishing year Closed Area I Access 
Area trip once the Delmarva Access Area closes under emergency action. 
If the vessel terminated a 2012 fishing year Delmarva Access Area trip 
early and received a Delmarva Access Area compensation trip fish the 
remainder of its allowed possession limit, as specified in Sec. 
648.60(c), the compensation trip will reallocated to Closed Area I 
Access Area trip once the Delmarva Access Area closes under emergency 
action.
    (ii) [Reserved]

and one trip in the Delmarva Access Area. Part-time vessels are subject 
to the seasonal trip restrictions specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(C)(4) 
of this section. The access area trip allocations for the 2013 fishing 
year are default allocations and are subject to change in a future 
framework adjustment.
    (4) A part-time scallop vessel may not fish for, possess, or retain 
more than a combined total of 14,400 lb (6,532 kg) of scallops, the 
equivalent of one full trip possession limit specified in Sec. 
648.60(a)(5)(i), during the period June 15 through October 31 from the 
Delmarva and Hudson Canyon Access Areas specified in Sec. 648.59(a) and 
(e). For example, a part-time vessel may possess or land up to 14,400 lb 
(6,532 kg) from the Hudson Canyon Access Area, up to 14,400 lb (6,532 
kg) from the Delmarva Access Area, or up to 14,400 lb (6,532 kg) 
combined from separate trips into each access area during June 15 
through October 31. The remaining access area trips allocated to part-
time vessels may be taken in the Hudson Canyon Access Area or Delmarva 
Access Area during the remainder of the fishing year, or taken in a 
different access area during the period of June 15 through October 31. 
These possession and landing restrictions do not include the additional 
possession allowance to defray the cost of carrying an observer as 
specified in Sec. 648.60(d) that occur during observed trips between 
June 15 through October 31.
    (i) If, prior to the implementation of Framework 22, a part-time 
vessel possesses or lands more than 14,400 lb (6,532 kg) from declared 
access area trips into the Delmarva and Hudson Canyon Access Areas 
combined during June 15 through October 31 in fishing year 2011, that 
vessel shall not declare an access area trip in fishing year 2012 in the 
Mid-Atlantic during June 15 through October 31.
    (ii) [Reserved]

    (E) [Reserved]

[[Page 612]]

    (ii) One-for-one area access trip exchanges. If the total number of 
trips allocated to a vessel into all Sea Scallop Access Areas combined 
is more than one, the owner of a vessel issued a limited access scallop 
permit may exchange, on a one-for-one basis, unutilized trips into one 
access area for another vessel's unutilized trips into another Sea 
Scallop Access Area. One-for-one exchanges may be made only between 
vessels with the same permit category. For example, a full-time vessel 
may not exchange trips with a part-time vessel, and vice versa. Vessel 
owners must request the exchange of trips by submitting a completed Trip 
Exchange Form at least 15 days before the date on which the applicant 
desires the exchange to be effective. Trip exchange forms are available 
from the Regional Administrator upon request. Each vessel owner involved 
in an exchange is required to submit a completed Trip Exchange Form. The 
Regional Administrator shall review the records for each vessel to 
confirm that each vessel has unutilized trips remaining to exchange. The 
exchange is not effective until the vessel owner(s) receive a 
confirmation in writing from the Regional Administrator that the trip 
exchange has been made effective. A vessel owner may exchange trips 
between two or more vessels under his/her ownership. A vessel owner 
holding a Confirmation of Permit History is not eligible to exchange 
trips between another vessel and the vessel for which a Confirmation of 
Permit History has been issued.
    (A) Trip exchanges involving Elephant Trunk Access Area trips that 
occur in the 2011 fishing year prior to the implementation of Framework 
22. See Sec. 648.53(b)(4)(vii).
    (B) [Reserved]
    (iii) [Reserved]
    (4) Area fished. While on a Sea Scallop Access Area trip, a vessel 
may not fish for, possess, or land scallops in or from areas outside the 
Sea Scallop Access Area in which the vessel operator has declared the 
vessel will fish during that trip, and may not enter or exit the 
specific declared Sea Scallop Access Area more than once per trip. A 
vessel on a Sea Scallop Access Area trip may not enter or be in another 
Sea Scallop Access Area on the same trip except such vessel may transit 
another Sea Scallop Access Area provided its gear is stowed in 
accordance with Sec. 648.23(b).
    (i) Reallocation of trips into open areas. If the yellowtail 
flounder TAC allocated for a Scallop Access Area specified in Sec. 
648.59(b) through (d) has been harvested and such area has been closed, 
a vessel with trips remaining to be taken in such Access Areas may fish 
the remaining DAS associated with the unused trip(s) in Open Areas, up 
to the maximum DAS specified in Sec. 648.53(b)(4)(i) through (iii).
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (5) Possession and landing limits--(i) Scallop possession limits. 
Unless authorized by the Regional Administrator, as specified in 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, after declaring a trip into a 
Sea Scallop Access Area, a vessel owner or operator of a limited access 
scallop vessel may fish for, possess, and land, per trip, scallops, up 
to the maximum amounts specified in the table in this paragraph (a)(5). 
Full-time and part-time vessels shall not fish for, possess, or retain 
more than 18,000 lb (8,165 kg) and 14,400 lb (6,532 kg), respectively, 
of scallops from the Hudson Canyon and Delmarva Access Areas, combined, 
from trips taken between June 15 and October 31 (i.e., the equivalent of 
one full trip based on permit category). In addition, if the owner of a 
full-time vessel has exchanged a trip(s) with another vessel owner(s) so 
that the vessel has a total allocation of four combined trips into the 
Delmarva and/or Hudson Canyon Access Areas, that vessel may not fish 
for, possess, or retain more than a combined total of 36,000 lb (16,329 
kg) of scallops, the equivalent of two full trip possession limits 
specified in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, during this time 
period from the Delmarva and/or Hudson Canyon Access Areas. These 
possession and landing restrictions do not include the additional 
possession allowance to defray the cost of carrying an observer as 
specified in paragraph (d) of this section that occur during observed 
trips between June 15 and October 31. No vessel declared into the Access 
Areas as described in Sec. 648.59(a) through (e) may possess more than 
50 bu (17.62 hL)

[[Page 613]]

of in-shell scallops outside of the Access Areas described in Sec. 
648.59(a) through (e).

    (ii) NE multispecies possession limits and yellowtail flounder TACs. 
A limited access scallop vessel that is declared into a trip and fishing 
within the Sea Scallop Access Areas described in Sec. 648.59(b) through 
(d), and issued a valid NE multispecies permit as specified in Sec. 
648.4(a)(1), may fish for, possess, and land, per trip, up to a maximum 
of 1,000 lb (453.6 kg) of all NE multispecies combined, excluding 
yellowtail flounder, subject to the minimum commercial fish size 
restrictions specified in Sec. 648.83(a)(1), and the additional 
restrictions for Atlantic cod, haddock, and yellowtail flounder 
specified in paragraphs (a)(5)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section. Such 
vessel is subject to the seasonal restriction established under the Sea 
Scallop Area Access Program and specified in Sec. 648.59(b)(4), (c)(4), 
and (d)(4).
    (A) Atlantic cod. Such vessel may bring onboard and possess only up 
to 100 lb (45.4 kg) of Atlantic cod per trip, provided such fish is 
intended for personal use only and cannot be not sold, traded, or 
bartered.
    (B) Haddock. Such vessels may possess and land haddock up to the 
overall possession limit of all NE multispecies combined, as specified 
in paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section, except that such vessels are 
prohibited from possessing or landing haddock from January 1 through 
June 30.
    (C) Yellowtail flounder. Such vessel must retain all yellowtail 
flounder that meet the minimum size restrictions specified under Sec. 
648.83(a)(1).
    (1) [Reserved]
    (2) U.S./Canada Area TAC availability. After declaring a trip into 
and fishing in the Closed Area I or Closed Area II Access Area described 
in Sec. 648.59(b) and (c), a scallop vessel that has a valid NE 
multispecies permit, as specified in Sec. 648.4(a)(1), may possess and 
land yellowtail flounder, provided that the Regional Administrator has 
not issued a notice that the U.S./Canada yellowtail flounder TAC 
specified in Sec. 648.85(a)(2) has been harvested. If the yellowtail 
flounder TAC established for the U.S./Canada Management Area pursuant to 
Sec. 648.85(a)(2) has been or is projected to be harvested, as 
described in Sec. 648.85(a)(3)(iv)(C)(3), scallop vessels are 
prohibited from possessing or landing yellowtail flounder in or from the 
Closed Area I and Closed Area II Access Areas.
    (3) [Reserved]
    (iii)-(iv) [Reserved]
    (6) Gear restrictions. (i) The minimum ring size for dredge gear 
used by a vessel fishing on a Sea Scallop Access Area trip is 4 inches 
(10.2 cm) in diameter. Dredge or trawl gear used by a vessel fishing on 
a Sea Scallop Access Area trip must be in accordance with the 
restrictions specified in Sec. 648.51(a) and (b).
    (ii) Vessels fishing in the Closed Area I, Closed Area II, and 
Nantucket Lightship Closed Area Sea Scallop Access Areas described in 
Sec. 648.59(b) through (d) are prohibited from fishing with trawl gear 
as specified in Sec. 648.51(f)(1).
    (7) Transiting. While outside a Sea Scallop Access Area on a Sea 
Scallop Access Area trip, the vessel must have all fishing gear stowed 
in accordance with Sec. 648.23(b), unless there is a compelling safety 
reason to be transiting the area without gear stowed.
    (8) Off-loading restrictions. The vessel may not offload its catch 
from a Sea Scallop Access Area trip at more than one location per trip.
    (9) Reporting. The owner or operator must submit reports through the 
VMS, as specified in Sec. 648.10(f)(4)(i).
    (b) [Reserved]

[[Page 614]]

    (c) Compensation for Sea Scallop Access Area trips terminated early. 
If a Sea Scallop Access Area trip is terminated before catching the 
allowed possession limit, the vessel may be authorized to fish an 
additional trip in the same Sea Scallop Access Area based on the 
following conditions and requirements.
    (1) The vessel owner/operator has determined that the Sea Scallop 
Access Area trip should be terminated early for reasons deemed 
appropriate by the operator of the vessel;
    (2) The amount of scallops landed by the vessel for the trip must be 
less than the maximum possession limit specified in paragraph (a)(5) of 
this section;
    (3) The vessel owner/operator must report the termination of the 
trip prior to entering the access area if the trip is terminated while 
transiting to the area, or prior to leaving the Sea Scallop Access Area 
if the trip is terminated after entering the access area, by VMS e-mail 
messaging, with the following information: Vessel name, vessel owner, 
vessel operator, time of trip termination, reason for terminating the 
trip (for NMFS recordkeeping purposes), expected date and time of return 
to port, and amount of scallops on board in pounds;
    (4) The vessel owners/operator must request that the Regional 
Administrator authorize an additional trip as compensation for the 
terminated trip by submitting a written request to the Regional 
Administrator within 30 days of the vessel's return to port from the 
terminated trip; and
    (5) The Regional Administrator shall authorize the vessel to take an 
additional trip and shall specify the amount of scallops that the vessel 
may land on such trip pursuant to the calculation specified in paragraph 
(c)(5)(i) of this section. Such authorization shall be made within 10 
days of receipt of the formal written request for compensation.
    (i) The amount of scallops that can be landed on an authorized 
additional compensation Sea Scallop Access Area trip shall equal the 
possession limit specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section minus the 
amount of scallops landed on the terminated trip. For example, if the 
possession limit for a full-time vessel is 18,000 lb (8,165 kg) per 
trip, and the vessel lands 6,500 lb (2,948.4 kg) of scallops and 
requests compensation for the terminated trip, the possession limit for 
the additional trip is 11,500 lb (5,216.3 kg) or 18,000 lb (8,165 kg) 
minus 6,500 lb (2,948.4 kg)).
    (ii) If a vessel is authorized more than one additional compensation 
trip into any Sea Scallop Access Area as the result of more than one 
terminated trip in the same Access Area, the possession limits for the 
authorized trips may be combined, provided the total possession limit on 
a combined additional compensation trip does not exceed the possession 
limit for a trip as specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. For 
example, a vessel that has two broken trips with corresponding 
additional compensation trip authorizations of 10,000 lb (4,536 kg) and 
8,000 lb (3,629 kg) may combine the authorizations to allow one 
compensation trip with a possession limit of 18,000 lb (8,165 kg).
    (A) Pursuant to paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(B)(4) or (a)(3)(i)(C)(4) of 
this section, a full-time or part-time vessel may not take a 
compensation trip based on a single or multiple terminated trip(s) 
during the period June 15 through October 31 if the compensation trip 
would allow a vessel to land more than 18,000 lb (8,165 kg) or 14,400 lb 
(6,532 kg) (i.e., the equivalent of one full access area trip), 
respectively, during the period June 15 through October 31, in the 
Hudson Canyon Access Area and Delmarva Access Area combined. For 
example, a vessel that terminated a trip in the Delmarva Access Area on 
June 1, 2011, and intends to declare two full trips in the Hudson Canyon 
Access Area access area from June 15 through October 31, must wait to 
fish its compensation trip in the Delmarva Access Area until on or after 
November 1, 2011. If the owner of a full-time vessel has exchanged a 
trip(s) with another vessel owner(s) so that the vessel has an 
allocation of four combined trips into the Delmarva and/or Hudson Canyon 
Access Areas, that vessel may not fish for, possess, or retain more than 
a combined total of 36,000 lb (16,329 kg) of scallops, the equivalent of 
two full trip

[[Page 615]]

possession limits specified in paragraph 648.60(a)(5)(i) of this 
section, during this time period from the Delmarva and/or Hudson Canyon 
Access Areas.
    (B) [Reserved]
    (iii) A vessel operator must comply with all notification 
requirements prior to taking an additional compensation trip, and for 
each such trip, must enter a trip identification number by entering the 
number in the VMS for each such trip. The trip identification number 
will be included in the Regional Administrator's authorization for each 
additional compensation trip. If a vessel operator is combining 
additional compensation trips, the trip identification numbers from each 
authorization must be entered into VMS.
    (iv) [Reserved]
    (v) Additional compensation trip carryover. If an Access Area trip 
conducted during the last 60 days of the open period or season for the 
Access Area is terminated before catching the allowed possession limit, 
and the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section are met, the 
vessel operator shall be authorized to fish an additional trip as 
compensation for the terminated trip in the following fishing year. The 
vessel owner/operator must take such additional compensation trips, 
complying with the trip notification procedures specified in paragraph 
(a)(2)(iii) of this section, within the first 60 days of that fishing 
year the Access Area first opens in the subsequent fishing year. For 
example, a vessel that terminates an Delmarva Access Area trip on 
December 29, 2011, must declare that it is beginning its additional 
compensation trip during the first 60 days that the Delmarva Access Area 
is open (March 1, 2012, through April 29, 2012). If an Access Area is 
not open in the subsequent fishing year, then the additional 
compensation trip authorization would expire at the end of the Access 
Area Season in which the trip was broken. For example, a vessel that 
terminates a Closed Area I trip on December 10, 2012, may not carry its 
additional compensation trip into the 2013 fishing year because Closed 
Area I is not open during the 2013 fishing year, and must complete any 
compensation trip by January 31, 2013.
    (d) Possession limit to defray costs of observers--(1) Observer set-
aside limits by area--(i) Nantucket Lightship Access Area. For the 2012 
and 2013 fishing years, the observer set-asides for the Nantucket 
Lightship Access Area are 36,000 lb (16 mt) and 84,450 lb (38 mt), 
respectively.
    (ii) Closed Area I Access Area. For the 2011 and 2012 fishing years, 
the observer set-asides for the Closed Area I Access Area are 111,540 lb 
(51 mt) and 36,000 lb (316 mt), respectively.
    (iii) Closed Area II Access Area. For the 2011, 2012, and 2013 
fishing years, the observer set-aside for the Closed Area II Access Area 
are 35,060 lb (16 mt), 67,890 lb (31 mt), and 79,600 lb (36 mt), 
respectively.
    (iv) Delmarva Access Area. For the 2011, 2012, and 2013 fishing 
years, the observer set-aside for the Delmarva Access Area are 74,360 lb 
(34 mt), 36,000 lb (316 mt), and 42,230 lb (19 mt), respectively.
    (v) Hudson Canyon Access Area. For the 2011, 2012, and 2013 fishing 
years, the observer set-aside for the Hudson Canyon Access Area are 
74,360 lb (34 mt), 107,980 lb (49 mt), and 126,680 lb (57 mt), 
respectively.
    (vi) Closed Area I Access Area. For the 2011 and 2012 fishing years, 
the observer set-asides for the Closed Area I Access Area are 111,540 lb 
(51 mt) and 72,000 lb (33 mt), respectively.
    (2) Increase in the possession limit to defray the costs of 
observers. The Regional Administrator may increase the sea scallop 
possession limit specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section to defray 
costs of at-sea observers deployed on area access trips subject to the 
limits specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. An owner of a 
scallop vessel shall be notified of the increase in the possession limit 
through a permit holder letter issued by the Regional Administrator. If 
the observer set-aside is fully utilized prior to the end of the fishing 
year, the Regional Administrator shall notify owners of scallop vessels 
that, effective on a specified date, the increase in the possession 
limit is no longer available to offset the cost of observers. Unless 
otherwise

[[Page 616]]

notified by the Regional Administrator, vessel owners shall be 
responsible for paying the cost of the observer, regardless of whether 
the vessel lands or sells sea scallops on that trip, and regardless of 
the availability of set-aside for an increased possession limit.
    (e) Sea Scallop Research Set-Aside Harvest in Access Areas--(1) 
Access Areas available for harvest of research set-aside (RSA). RSA may 
be harvested in any access area that is open in a given fishing year, as 
specified through a framework adjustment and pursuant to Sec. 648.56. 
The amount of pounds that can be harvested in each access area by 
vessels participating in approved RSA projects shall be determined 
through the RSA application review and approval process. The access 
areas open for RSA harvest for fishing years 2011 through 2013 are:
    (i) 2011: Delmarva Access Area, Hudson Canyon Access Area, Closed 
Area I Access Area, and Closed Area II Access Area.
    (ii) 2012: Delmarva Access Area, Hudson Canyon Access Area, Closed 
Area I Access Area, Closed Area II Access Area, and Nantucket Lightship 
Access Area.
    (iii) 2013: Delmarva Access Area, Hudson Canyon Access Area, 
Nantucket Lightship Access Area, and Closed Area II Access Area.
    (iv) 2012: Hudson Canyon Access Area, Closed Area I Access Area, 
Closed Area II Access Area, and Nantucket Lightship Access Area.
    (2) Increase of possession limit to defray the costs of sea scallop 
research. The Regional Administrator may increase the sea scallop 
possession limit specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section or allow 
additional trips into a Sea Scallop Access Area to defray costs for 
approved sea scallop research up to the amount specified in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section.
    (3) Yellowtail flounder research TAC set-aside. Vessels conducting 
research approved under the process described in Sec. 648.56, and in 
the Access Areas specified in Sec. 648.59(b) through (d) may harvest 
cumulative yellowtail flounder up to a total amount that equals 0.2 
percent of the yellowtail flounder TACs established annually, according 
to the specification procedure described in Sec. 648.85(a)(2), and 
subject to the possession limits specified in paragraph (a)(5)(ii)(C) of 
this section. Once 0.2 percent of the yellowtail flounder TACs 
established according to the specification procedure described in Sec. 
648.85(a)(2) has been harvested by research vessels, research may no 
longer be authorized in the applicable Access Area.
    (f) VMS polling. For the duration of the Sea Scallop Area Access 
Program, as described in this section, all sea scallop vessels equipped 
with a VMS unit shall be polled at a minimum of twice per hour, 
regardless of whether the vessel is enrolled in the Sea Scallop Area 
Access Program. Vessel owners shall be responsible for paying the costs 
of polling twice per hour.
    (g) Limited Access General Category Vessels. (1) An LAGC scallop 
vessel may only fish in the scallop access areas specified in Sec. 
648.59(a) through (e), subject to the seasonal restrictions specified in 
Sec. 648.59(b)(4), (c)(4), and (d)(4), and subject to the possession 
limit specified in Sec. 648.52(a), and provided the vessel complies 
with the requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(6) 
through (9), (d), (e), (f), and (g) of this section. A vessel issued 
both a NE multispecies permit and an LAGC scallop permit may fish in an 
approved SAP under Sec. 648.85 and under multispecies DAS in the Closed 
Area I, Closed Area II, and Nantucket Lightship Sea Scallop Access Areas 
specified in Sec. 648.59(b) through (d), provided the vessel complies 
with the requirements specified in Sec. 648.59(b)(5)(ii), (c)(5)(ii), 
and (d)(5)(ii), and this paragraph (g), but may not fish for, possess, 
or land scallops on such trips
    (2) Limited Access General Category Gear restrictions. An LAGC IFQ 
scallop vessel authorized to fish in the Access Areas specified in Sec. 
648.59(a) through (e) must fish with dredge gear only. The combined 
dredge width in use by, or in possession on board of, an LAGC scallop 
vessel fishing in Closed Area I, Closed Area II, and Nantucket Lightship 
Access Areas may not exceed 10.5 ft (3.2 m). The combined dredge width 
in use by, or in possession on board of, an LAGC scallop vessel fishing 
in the remaining Access Areas described in Sec. 648.59 may not exceed 
31 ft

[[Page 617]]

(9.4 m). Dredge width is measured at the widest point in the bail of the 
dredge.
    (3) LAGC IFQ Access Area Trips. An LAGC scallop vessel authorized to 
fish in the Access Areas specified in Sec. 648.59(a) through (e) may 
land scallops, subject to the possession limit specified in Sec. 
648.52(a), unless the Regional Administrator has issued a notice that 
the number of LAGC IFQ access area trips specified in Sec. 
648.59(a)(3)(ii), (b)(5)(ii), (c)(5)(ii), (d)(5)(ii), and (e)(4)(ii) 
have been or are projected to be taken. Upon a determination from the 
Regional Administrator that the total number of LAGC IFQ trips in a 
specified Access Area have been or are projected to be taken, the 
Regional Administrator shall publish notification of this determination 
in the Federal Register, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure 
Act. Once this determination has been made, an LAGC IFQ scallop vessel 
may not fish for, possess, or land scallops in or from the specified 
Access Area after the effective date of the notification published in 
the Federal Register.
    (4) Possession Limits--(i) Scallops. A vessel issued a NE 
multispecies permit and a general category scallop permit that is 
fishing in an approved SAP under Sec. 648.85 under multispecies DAS, 
and that has not enrolled in the LAGC Access Area fishery, is prohibited 
from possessing scallops. An LAGC scallop vessel authorized to fish in 
the Access Areas specified in Sec. 648.59(a) through (e) may possess 
scallops up to the possession limit specified in Sec. 648.52(a).
    (ii) Other species. Unless issued an LAGC scallop permit and fishing 
under an approved NE multispecies SAP under NE multispecies DAS, an LAGC 
IFQ vessel fishing in the Access Areas specified in Sec. 648.59(a) 
through (e) is prohibited from possessing any species of fish other than 
scallops and monkfish, as specified in Sec. 648.94(c)(8).
    (5) Number of trips. An LAGC IFQ scallop vessel may not fish for, 
possess, or land scallops in or from the Access Areas specified in Sec. 
648.59(a) through (e) after the effective date of the notification 
published in the Federal Register, stating that the total number of 
trips specified in Sec. 648.59(a)(3)(ii), (b)(5)(ii), (c)(5)(ii), 
(d)(5)(ii), and (e)(4)(ii) have been, or are projected to be, taken by 
LAGC IFQ scallop vessels.

<R05>
Sec. 648.62  Northern Gulf of Maine (NGOM) Management Program.

    (a) The NGOM scallop management area is the area north of 42[deg]20' 
N. lat. and within the boundaries of the Gulf of Maine Scallop Dredge 
Exemption Area as specified in Sec. 648.80(a)(11). To fish for or 
possess scallops in the NGOM scallop management area, a vessel must have 
been issued a scallop permit as specified in Sec. 648.4(a)(2).
    (1) If a vessel has been issued a NGOM scallop permit, the vessel is 
restricted to fishing for or possessing scallops only in the NGOM 
scallop management area.

[[Page 619]]

    (2) Scallop landings by vessels issued NGOM permits shall be 
deducted from the NGOM scallop total allowable catch when vessels fished 
all or part of a trip in the Federal waters portion of the NGOM. If a 
vessel with a NGOM scallop permit fishes exclusively in state waters 
within the NGOM, scallop landings from those trips will not be deducted 
from the Federal NGOM quota.
    (3) Scallop landings by all vessels issued LAGC IFQ scallop permits 
and fishing in the NGOM scallop management area shall be deducted from 
the NGOM scallop total allowable catch specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section. Scallop landings by IFQ scallop vessels fishing in the 
NGOM scallop management area shall be deducted from their respective 
scallop IFQs. Landings by incidental catch scallop vessels and limited 
access scallop vessels fishing under the scallop DAS program shall not 
be deducted from the NGOM total allowable catch specified in paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (4) A vessel issued a NGOM or IFQ scallop permit that fishes in the 
NGOM may fish for, possess, or retain up to 200 lb (90.7 kg) of shucked 
or 25 bu (8.81 hL) of in-shell scallops, and may possess up to 50 bu 
(17.6 hL) of in-shell scallops seaward of the VMS Demarcation Line. A 
vessel issued an incidental catch general category scallop permit that 
fishes in the NGOM may fish for, possess, or retain only up to 40 lb of 
shucked or 5 U.S. bu (1.76 hL) of in-shell scallops, and may possess up 
to 10 bu (3.52 hL) of in-shell scallops seaward of the VMS Demarcation 
Line.
    (b) Total allowable catch. The total allowable catch for the NGOM 
scallop management area shall be specified through the framework 
adjustment process. The total allowable catch for the NGOM scallop 
management area shall be based on the Federal portion of the scallop 
resource in the NGOM. The total allowable catch shall be determined by 
historical landings until additional information on the NGOM scallop 
resource is available, for example through an NGOM resource survey and 
assessment. The ABC/ACL as specified in Sec. 648.53(a) shall not 
include the total allowable catch for the NGOM scallop management area, 
and landings from the NGOM scallop management area shall not be counted 
against the ABC/ACL specified in Sec. 648.53(a).
    (1) NGOM annual hard TACs. The annual hard TAC for the NGOM is 
70,000 lb (31.8 mt) for the 2011, 2012, and 2013 fishing years. The NGOM 
TAC for the 2013 fishing year is a default allocation and is subject to 
change in a future framework adjustment.
    (2) Unless a vessel has fished for scallops outside of the NGOM 
scallop management area and is transiting the NGOM scallop management 
area with all fishing gear stowed in accordance with Sec. 648.23(b), no 
vessel issued a scallop permit pursuant to Sec. 648.4(a)(2) may 
possess, retain, or land scallops in the NGOM scallop management area 
once the Regional Administrator has provided notification in the Federal 
Register that the NGOM scallop total allowable catch in accordance with 
this paragraph (b) has been reached. Once the NGOM hard TAC is reached, 
a vessel issued a NGOM permit may no longer declare a state-only NGOM 
scallop trip and fish for scallops exclusively in state waters within 
the NGOM. A vessel that has not been issued a Federal scallop permit 
that fishes exclusively in state waters is not subject to the closure of 
the NGOM scallop management area.
    (3) If the TAC specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is 
exceeded, the amount of NGOM scallop landings in excess of the TAC 
specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be deducted from the 
NGOM TAC for the subsequent fishing year, as soon as practicable, once 
scallop landings data for the NGOM fishery is available.
    (c) VMS requirements. Except scallop vessels issued a limited access 
scallop permit pursuant to Sec. 648.4(a)(2)(i) that have declared a 
trip under the scallop DAS program, a vessel issued a scallop permit 
pursuant to Sec. 648.4(a)(2) that intends to fish for scallops in the 
NGOM scallop management area or fishes for, possesses, or lands scallops 
in or from the NGOM scallop management area, must declare a NGOM scallop 
management area trip and report scallop catch through the vessel's VMS 
unit, as required in Sec. 648.10. If the vessel has a NGOM permit, the 
vessel can declare either a Federal NGOM trip or a state-

[[Page 620]]

waters NGOM trip. If a vessel intends to fish any part of a NGOM trip in 
Federal NGOM waters, it may not declare into the state water NGOM 
fishery.
    (d) Gear restrictions. Except scallop vessels issued a limited 
access scallop permit pursuant to Sec. 648.4(a)(2)(i) that have 
properly declared a trip under the scallop DAS program, the combined 
dredge width in use by, or in possession on board, LAGC scallop vessels 
fishing in the NGOM scallop management area may not exceed 10.5 ft (3.2

Sec. 648.63  General category Sectors and harvesting cooperatives.

    (a) Procedure for implementing Sector allocation proposals. (1) Any 
person may submit a Sector allocation proposal for a group of LAGC 
scallop vessels to the Council, at least 1 year in advance of the start 
of the proposed sector, and request that the Sector be implemented 
through a framework procedure specified at Sec. 648.55, in accordance 
with the conditions and restrictions of this section.
    (2) Upon receipt of a Sector allocation proposal, the Council must 
decide whether to initiate such framework. Should a framework adjustment 
to authorize a Sector allocation be initiated, the Council shall follow 
the framework adjustment provisions of Sec. 648.55. Any framework 
adjustment developed to implement a Sector allocation proposal must be 
in compliance with the general requirements specified in paragraphs (b) 
and (c) of this section. Vessels that do not join a Sector remain 
subject to the LAGC scallop vessel regulations for non-Sector vessels 
specified under this part.
    (b) General requirements applicable to all Sector allocations. All 
Sectors approved under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section 
must submit the documents specified under paragraphs (a)(1) and (c) of 
this section, and comply with the conditions and restrictions of this 
paragraph (b).
    (1) Participation. (i) Only LAGC scallop vessels are eligible to 
form Sectors, and Sectors may choose which eligible permit holders to 
include or exclude in the sector, consistent with all applicable law. A 
Sector may establish additional criteria for determining its membership, 
provided such criteria are specified in the Sector's operations plan and 
are consistent with all applicable law. Any interested group that meets 
the eligibility criteria may submit a proposal for a Sector. To initiate 
the process of Sector creation, a group (two or more) of permit holders 
must agree to cooperate and submit a binding plan for management of that 
Sector's allocation of total allowable catch. Vessels that do not choose 
to participate in a sector will fish under the IFQ program and remain in 
the non-sector scallop fishery.
    (ii) Participation by incidental catch or NGOM scallop vessels in 
the Sector is subject to approval by the Council as part of the action 
that implements the Sector allocation, provided the details of such 
participation are specified in the Sector's operations plan. A Sector 
allocation may be harvested by non-Sector members, provided the Sector 
operations plan specifies that the Sector may authorize non-Sector 
vessels to harvest the Sector allocation. In this case, if the Sector is 
approved, the landings history of the participating non-Sector vessels 
may not be used in the calculation of future Sector shares and may not 
be used as scallop catch history for such vessels. The operations plan 
must specify how such participating non-Sector shall be subject to the 
rules of the Sector.
    (iii) Once a vessel operator and/or vessel owner signs a binding 
contract to have his/her vessel participate in a Sector, that vessel 
must remain in the Sector for the remainder of the fishing year.
    (iv) Vessels that fish in the LAGC scallop fishery outside the 
Sector allocation in a given fishing year may not participate in a 
Sector during that same fishing year, unless the Operations Plan 
provides an acceptable method for accounting for IFQ used, or catch by 
the vessel, prior to implementation of the Sector.
    (v) Once a vessel operator and/or vessel owner has agreed to 
participate in a Sector as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this 
section, that vessel

[[Page 621]]

must remain in the Sector for the entire fishing year. If a permit is 
transferred by a Sector participant during the fishing year, the new 
owner must also comply with the Sector regulations for the remainder of 
the fishing year.
    (vi) Vessels and vessel operators and/or vessel owners removed from 
a Sector for violation of the Sector rules will not be eligible to fish 
under the scallop regulations for non-Sector vessels specified under 
this part either for any period specified in the final decision of 
penalty or sanction.
    (vii) If a pre-existing Sector accepts a new member, the percentage 
share brought to the Sector is based on that vessel's average 
qualification landings at the time it joins the Sector (i.e., the vessel 
is treated as a ``Sector of one'' and a share based on the appropriate 
adjusted TACs is calculated). This new single-vessel-Sector share is 
added to the existing Sector. If a vessel leaves a Sector, that Sector's 
share is reduced by the individual vessel share the exiting vessel had 
when it joined the Sector.
    (viii) A vessel may not be a member of more than one Sector. Once a 
vessel enters into a Sector, it cannot fish during that fishing year 
under the regulations that apply to the common pool. Additionally, 
vessels cannot shift from one Sector to another during a single fishing 
year. Therefore, if a vessel leaves a Sector for any reason, it cannot 
participate in the general category scallop fishery during the remainder 
of that fishing year
    (2) Allocation of TAC to Sectors. (i) The sector allocation shall be 
equal to a percentage share of the ACL allocation for IFQ scallop 
vessels specified in Sec. 648.53(a), similar to an IFQ scallop vessel's 
IFQ as specified in Sec. 648.53(h). The sector's percentage share of 
the IFQ scallop fishery ACL catch shall not change, but the amount of 
allocation based on the percentage share will change based on the ACL 
specified in Sec. 648.53(a).
    (ii) Sector share determination. When a Sector proposal is 
submitted, NMFS shall verify the contribution percentage as specified in 
Sec. 648.53(h)(2)(iii) for each vessel listed as a Sector member. The 
Sector's share shall be the sum of the participating vessels' 
contribution percentages.
    (iii) A sector shall not be allocated more than 20 percent of the 
ACL for IFQ vessels specified in Sec. 648.53(a)(4)(i) or (ii).
    (3) Once a Sector's allocation is projected to be harvested, Sector 
operations will be terminated for the remainder of the fishing year.
    (4) If a Sector's allocation is exceeded in a given fishing year, 
the Sector, each vessel, and vessel operator and/or vessel owner 
participating in the Sector may be charged jointly and severally for 
civil penalties and permit sanction pursuant to 15 CFR part 904. If a 
Sector exceeds its allocation in more than one fishing year, the 
Sector's authorization to operate may be withdrawn.
    (5) A vessel operator and/or vessel owner participating in a Sector 
is not subject to the limit on the vessel's catch based on the vessel's 
own IFQ or contribution percentage as defined in Sec. 
648.53(h)(2)(iii), provided the vessel is participating in the Sector 
and carries on board a Letter of Authorization to participate in the 
Sector and exempts the vessel from its IFQ limit and any other related 
measures. The Sector shall determine how the Sector's allocation will be 
divided between its participating vessels, regardless of whether the 
catch by a participating vessel exceeds that vessel's own IFQ.
    (6) Each vessel operator and/or vessel owner fishing under an 
approved Sector must comply with all scallop management measures of this 
part and other applicable law, unless exempted under a Letter of 
Authorization, as specified in paragraph (b)(11) of this section. Each 
vessel and vessel operator and/or vessel owner participating in a Sector 
must also comply with all applicable requirements and conditions of the 
Operations Plan specified in paragraph (c) of this section and the 
Letter of Authorization issued pursuant to paragraph (b)(11) of this 
section. It shall be unlawful to violate any such conditions and 
requirements and each Sector, vessel, and vessel operator and/or vessel 
owner participating in the Sector may be charged jointly and severally 
for civil penalties and permit sanctions pursuant to 15 CFR part 904.

[[Page 622]]

    (7) Approved Sectors must submit an annual year-end report to NMFS 
and the Council, within 60 days of the end of the fishing year, that 
summarizes the fishing activities of its members, including harvest 
levels of all federally managed species by Sector vessels, enforcement 
actions, and other relevant information required to evaluate the 
performance of the Sector.
    (8) It shall be the responsibility of each Sector to track its 
activity and internally enforce any provisions adopted through 
procedures established in the operations plan and agreed to through the 
Sector contract. Sector contracts should describe graduated sanctions, 
including grounds for expulsion of Sector member vessels. The Sector and 
participating Sector vessels shall be subject to NMFS enforcement action 
for violations of the regulations pertaining to Sectors and other 
regulations under 50 CFR part 648. Vessels operating within a Sector are 
responsible for judgments against the Sector. Sector operations plans 
shall specify how a Sector will monitor its landings to assure that 
Sector landings do not exceed the Sector allocation. At the end of the 
fishing year, NMFS shall evaluate landings using VMS and any other 
available information to determine whether a Sector has exceeded any of 
its allocations based on the list of participating vessels submitted in 
the operations plan. If a Sector exceeds its TAC, the Sector may have 
its authorization as a Sector withdrawn by the Regional Administrator, 
after consultation with the Council, and may be subject to enforcement 
action.
    (9) Permanent or temporary transfers of allocation between Sectors 
or between Sector and non-Sector participants is prohibited. For 
purposes of harvesting a Sector allocation only, vessels under contract 
to a Sector are assumed to be part of that Sector for the duration of 
that contract.
    (10) The Sector allocation proposal must contain an appropriate 
analysis that assesses the impact of the proposed Sector, in compliance 
with the National Environmental Policy Act.
    (11) If a Sector is approved as specified in paragraph (d)(3) of 
this section, the Regional Administrator shall issue a Letter of 
Authorization to each vessel operator and/or owner for the participating 
Sector vessel. The Letter of Authorization shall authorize participation 
in the Sector operations and may exempt the participating vessel from 
the requirement that the vessel cannot exceed its own IFQ and related 
measures. The Letter of Authorization may include requirements and 
conditions deemed necessary to ensure effective administration of and 
compliance with the Sector's operations plan and the Sector's 
allocation.
    (c) Operations plans. (1) A group that wants to form a Sector and 
receive an allocation must submit a legally binding operations plan to 
the Council and the Regional Administrator. The operations plan must be 
agreed upon and signed by all members of the Sector and, if approved, 
shall constitute a contract.
    (2) The operations plan among all of the Sector members must have, 
at a minimum, the following components:
    (i) A list of all participants;
    (ii) A contract signed by all participants indicating their 
agreement to abide by the operations plan;
    (iii) An entity name, address, phone number, and the name and 
contact information for a Sector representative (a manager or director) 
that NMFS can contact regarding Sector management issues;
    (iv) A plan explaining how the Sector will harvest its allocation, 
including methods to inform NMFS of changes in those arrangements over 
the year;
    (v) The original distribution of catch history of vessels in the 
Sector (maintaining vessel data confidentiality);
    (vi) A plan detailing how the Sector will avoid exceeding its 
allocated TACs, including provisions for monitoring and enforcement of 
the Sector regulations, and documenting all landings and discards;
    (vii) Rules for entry to and exit from the Sector, including 
sanctions and procedures for removing members who do not comply with the 
operations plan;
    (viii) Procedure for notifying NMFS if a member is no longer part of 
the Sector and the reason for leaving;
    (ix) The process through which the operations plan can be amended by 
Sector members;

[[Page 623]]

    (x) If the Sector plans to authorize non-Sector vessels to harvest 
scallops allocated to the Sector, details of such arrangements must be 
described in the operations plan;
    (xi) Any documents and analyses necessary to comply with the 
National Environmental Protection Act must be submitted to NMFS. The 
development of the analytical document is the responsibility of the 
applicants.
    (xii) Any other information determined to be necessary and 
appropriate.
    (d) Sector review, approval, and revocation. (1) A Sector shall 
submit its operations plan and any NEPA documents to the Regional 
Administrator and the Council no less than 1 year prior to the date that 
it wishes to begin operations under the Sector. The Council shall 
consider this plan in the course of the periodic framework adjustment or 
specification process and may, if approved, implement it through either 
of those processes. After Council approval of a Sector, the details of 
its operation shall be addressed between the Sector and NMFS, although 
the New England Fishery Management Council may review and provide 
comment on the proposed details.
    (2) The Regional Administrator may withdraw approval of a Sector at 
any time if he/she, in consultation with the New England Fishery 
Management Council, determines that Sector participants are not 
complying with the requirements of an approved operations plan or that 
the continuation of the operations plan will undermine achievement of 
fishing mortality objectives of the FMP. Withdrawal of approval of a 
Sector shall be completed after notice and comment rulemaking, pursuant 
to the Administrative Procedure Act.
    (3) A Sector is required to resubmit its operations plan to the 
Regional Administrator no later than July 1 of each year, whether or not 
the plan has changed. Once the submission documents specified under 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (c)(2) of this section have been determined to 
comply with the requirements of this section, NMFS may consult with the 
Council and shall approve or disapprove Sector operations consistent 
with applicable law.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Exemption for LAGC IFQ vessels. Vessels issued an LAGC IFQ 
permit and fishing under the LAGC IFQ scallop fishery shall be exempt 
from the closure(s) specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. 
Yellowtail bycatch by such vessels shall be counted against the 
applicable yellowtail flounder sub-ACL specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (e) Process for implementing the AM. On or about January 15 of each 
year, based upon catch and other information available to NMFS, the 
Regional Administrator shall determine whether a yellowtail flounder 
sub-ACL was exceeded, or is projected to be exceeded, by scallop vessels 
prior to the end of the scallop fishing year ending on February 28/29. 
The determination shall include the amount of the overage or projected 
amount of the overage, specified as a percentage of the overall sub-ACL 
for the applicable yellowtail flounder stock, in accordance with the 
values specified in paragraph (a) of this section. Based on this initial 
projection in mid-January, the Regional Administrator shall implement 
the AM in accordance with the APA and notify owners of limited access 
scallop vessels by letter identifying the length of the closure and a 
summary of the yellowtail flounder catch, overage, and projection that 
resulted in the closure. The initial projected estimate shall be updated 
after the end of each scallop fishing

[[Page 625]]

year once complete fishing year information becomes available. An AM 
implemented at the start of the fishing year will be reevaluated and 
adjusted proportionately, if necessary, once updated information is 
obtained. For example, if in January 2013, the preliminary estimate of 
2012 Southern New England/Mid-Atlantic yellowtail flounder catch is 
estimated to be 5 percent over the 2012 sub-ACL, the Regional 
Administrator shall implement AMs for the 2013 scallop fishing year in 
that stock area. Based on the schedule in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, limited access vessels would be prohibited from fishing in the 
area specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for 4 months (i.e., 
March through May 2013, and February 2014). Continuing the example, 
after the 2012 fishing year is completed, if the final estimate of 
Southern New England/Mid-Atlantic yellowtail flounder catch indicates 
the scallop fishery caught 1.5 percent of the sub-ACL, rather than 5 
percent, the Regional Administrator, in accordance with the APA, would 
adjust the AM for the 2014 fishing year based on the overage schedule in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section. As a result, limited access vessels 
would be subject to a 2-month seasonal closure in March and April 2013. 
In this example, due to the availability of final fishing year data, it 
is possible that the original AM closure was already in effect during 
the month of May. However, the unnecessary AM closure in February 2014 
would be avoided. If the Regional Administrator determines that a final 
estimate is higher than the original projection, the Regional 
Administrator, if necessary, shall make adjustments to the current 
fishing year's respective AM closure schedules in accordance with the 
overage schedule in paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), and (c)(2) of this 
section.

                            Quahog Fisheries


<R05>
Sec. 648.70  Surfclam and ocean quahog Annual Catch Limit (ACL).

    (a) The MAFMC staff shall recommend to the MAFMC ACLs for the 
surfclam and ocean quahog fisheries, which shall be equal to the ABCs 
recommended by the SSC.
    (1) Sectors. The surfclam and ocean quahog ACLs will be established 
consistent with the guidelines contained in the Atlantic Surfclam and 
Ocean Quahog FMP. The ACL for ocean quahog will then be allocated to the 
Maine and non-Maine components of the fishery according to the 
allocation guidelines of the Atlantic Surfclam and Ocean Quahog FMP as 
specified in Sec. 648.78(b).
    (2) Periodicity. The surfclam and ocean quahog ACLs may be 
established on an annual basis for up to 3 years at a time, dependent on 
whether the SSC provides single or multiple year ABC recommendations.
    (b) Performance review. The MAFMC staff shall conduct a detailed 
review of the fishery performance relative to the ACLs at least every 5 
years.
    (1) If the surfclam or the ocean quahog ACL is exceeded with a 
frequency greater than 25 percent (i.e., more than once in 4 years or 
any 2 consecutive years), the MAFMC staff will review fishery 
performance information and make recommendations to the MAFMC for 
changes in measures intended to ensure the ACL is not exceeded as 
frequently.
    (2) The MAFMC may specify more frequent or more specific ACL 
performance review criteria as part of a stock rebuilding plan following 
a determination that a stock has become overfished.
    (3) Performance reviews shall not substitute for annual reviews that 
occur to ascertain if prior year ACLs have been exceeded, but may be 
conducted in conjunction with such reviews.

Sec. 648.71  Surfclam and ocean quahog Annual Catch Targets (ACT).

    (a) The MAFMC staff shall identify and review the relevant sources 
of management uncertainty to recommend ACTs to the MAFMC as part of the 
surfclam and ocean quahog specification process. The MAFMC staff 
recommendations shall identify the specific sources of management 
uncertainty that were considered, technical approaches to mitigating 
these sources of uncertainty, and any additional relevant information 
considered in the ACT recommendation process.
    (1) Sectors. The surfclam ACT and the sum of the Maine and non-Maine 
ocean quahog ACTs shall be less than or equal to the ACL for the 
corresponding stock. The MAFMC staff shall recommend any reduction in 
catch necessary to address management uncertainty, consistent with 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) Periodicity. ACTs may be established on an annual basis for up 
to 3 years at a time, dependent on whether the SSC provides single or 
multiple year ABC recommendations.
    (b) Performance review. The MAFMC staff shall conduct a detailed 
review of fishery performance relative to ACTs in conjunction with any 
ACL performance review, as outlined in Sec. 648.70(b)(1) through (3).

Sec. 648.72  Surfclam and ocean quahog specifications.

    (a) Establishing catch quotas. The amount of surfclams or ocean 
quahogs that may be caught annually by fishing vessels subject to these 
regulations will be specified for up to a 3-year period by the Regional 
Administrator. Specifications of the annual quotas will be accomplished 
in the final year of the quota period, unless the quotas are modified in 
the interim pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. The amount of 
surfclams available for harvest annually must be specified within the 
range of 1.85 to 3.4 million bu (98.5 to 181 million L). The amount of 
ocean quahogs available for harvest annually must be specified within 
the range of 4 to 6 million bu (213 to 319.4 million L). Quotas for 
surfclams and ocean quahogs may be specified below these ranges if the 
ABC recommendation of the SSC limits the ACL to a value less than the 
minimum of the range indicated.
    (1) Quota reports. On an annual basis, MAFMC staff will produce and 
provide to the MAFMC an Atlantic surfclam and ocean quahog annual quota 
recommendation paper based on the ABC recommendation of the SSC, the 
latest available stock assessment report prepared by NMFS, data reported 
by harvesters and processors, and other relevant data, as well as the 
information contained in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (vi) of this 
section. Based on that report, and at least once prior to August 15 of 
the year in which a multi-year annual quota specification expires, the 
MAFMC, following an opportunity for public comment, will recommend to 
the Regional Administrator annual quotas and estimates of DAH and DAP 
within the ranges specified for up to a 3-year period. In selecting the 
annual quotas, the MAFMC shall consider the current stock assessments, 
catch reports, and other relevant information concerning:
    (i) Exploitable and spawning biomass relative to the OY.
    (ii) Fishing mortality rates relative to the OY.
    (iii) Magnitude of incoming recruitment.
    (iv) Projected effort and corresponding catches.
    (v) Geographical distribution of the catch relative to the 
geographical distribution of the resource.
    (vi) Status of areas previously closed to surfclam fishing that are 
to be opened during the year and areas likely to be closed to fishing 
during the year.
    (2) Public review. Based on the recommendation of the MAFMC, the 
Regional Administrator shall publish proposed surfclam and ocean quahog 
quotas in the Federal Register. The Regional Administrator shall 
consider public comments received, determine the appropriate annual 
quotas, and publish the annual quotas in the Federal Register. The quota 
shall be set at that amount that is most consistent with the objectives 
of the Atlantic Surfclam and Ocean Quahog FMP. The Regional 
Administrator may set

[[Page 627]]

quotas at quantities different from the MAFMC's recommendations only if 
he/she can demonstrate that the MAFMC's recommendations violate the 
national standards of the Magnuson-Stevens Act or the objectives of the 
Atlantic Surfclam and Ocean Quahog FMP or other applicable law.
    (b) Interim quota modifications. Based upon information presented in 
the quota reports described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the 
MAFMC may recommend to the Regional Administrator a modification to the 
annual quotas that have been specified for a 3-year period and any 
estimate of DAH or DAP made in conjunction with such specifications 
within the ranges specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Based 
upon the MAFMC's recommendation, the Regional Administrator may propose 
surfclam and or ocean quahog quotas that differ from the annual quotas 
specified for the current 3-year period. Such modification shall be in 
effect for a period of up to 3 years, unless further modified. Any 
interim modification shall follow the same procedures for establishing 
the annual quotas that are specified for up to a 3-year period.
    (c) Annual quotas. The annual quotas for surfclams and ocean quahogs 
will remain effective unless revised pursuant to this section. At the 
end of a multiyear quota period, NMFS will issue notification in the 
Federal Register if the previous year's specifications will not be 
changed.

Sec. 648.73  Surfclam and ocean quahog Accountability Measures.

    (a) Commercial ITQ fishery. (1) If the ACL for surfclam or ocean 
quahog is exceeded, and the overage can be attributed to one or more ITQ 
allocation holders, the full amount of the overage will be deducted from 
the appropriate ITQ allocation in the following fishing year.
    (2) Any amount of an ACL overage that cannot be otherwise attributed 
to an ITQ allocation holder will be deducted from the appropriate ACL in 
the following fishing year.
    (b) Maine mahogany quahog fishery. If the ocean quahog ACL is 
exceeded, and the Maine mahogany quahog fishery is responsible for the 
overage, than the Maine fishery ACT shall be reduced in the following 
year by an amount equal to the ACL overage.

Sec. 648.74  Annual individual allocations.

    (a) General. (1) Each fishing year, the Regional Administrator shall 
determine the initial allocation of surfclams and ocean quahogs for the 
next fishing year for each allocation holder owning an allocation 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section. For each species, the 
initial allocation for the next fishing year is calculated by 
multiplying the allocation percentage owned by each allocation owner as 
of the last day of the previous fishing year in which allocation owners 
are permitted to permanently transfer allocation percentage pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section (i.e., October 15 of every year), by the 
quota specified by the Regional Administrator pursuant to Sec. 648.72. 
The total number of bushels of allocation shall be divided by 32 to 
determine the appropriate number of cage tags to be issued or acquired 
under Sec. 648.77. Amounts of allocation of 0.5 cages or smaller 
created by this division shall be rounded downward to the nearest whole 
number, and amounts of allocation greater than 0.5 cages created by this 
division shall be rounded upward to the nearest whole number, so that 
allocations are specified in whole cages. These allocations shall be 
made in the form of an allocation permit specifying the allocation 
percentage and the allocation in cages and cage tags for each species. 
An allocation permit is only valid for the entity for which it is 
issued. Such permits shall be issued on or before December 15, to allow 
allocation owners to purchase cage tags from a vendor specified by the 
Regional Administrator pursuant to Sec. 648.77(b).
    (2) The Regional Administrator may, after publication of a fee 
notification in the Federal Register, charge a permit fee before 
issuance of the permit to recover administrative expenses. Failure to 
pay the fee will preclude issuance of the permit.
    (b) Transfers--(1) Allocation percentage. Subject to the approval of 
the Regional Administrator, part or all of an

[[Page 628]]

allocation percentage may be transferred in the year in which the 
transfer is made, to any person or entity eligible to own a documented 
vessel under the terms of 46 U.S.C. 12102(a). Approval of a transfer by 
the Regional Administrator and for a new allocation permit reflecting 
that transfer may be requested by submitting a written application for 
approval of the transfer and for issuance of a new allocation permit to 
the Regional Administrator at least 10 days before the date on which the 
applicant desires the transfer to be effective, in the form of a 
completed transfer log supplied by the Regional Administrator. The 
transfer is not effective until the new holder receives a new or revised 
annual allocation permit from the Regional Administrator. An application 
for transfer may not be made between October 15 and December 31 of each 
year.
    (2) Cage tags. Cage tags issued pursuant to Sec. 648.77 may be 
transferred at any time, and in any amount subject to the restrictions 
and procedure specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; provided 
that application for such cage tag transfers may be made at any time 
before December 10 of each year. The transfer is effective upon the 
receipt by the transferee of written authorization from the Regional 
Administrator.
    (3) Review. If the Regional Administrator determines that the 
applicant has been issued a Notice of Permit Sanction for a violation of 
the Magnuson-Stevens Act that has not been resolved, he/she may decline 
to approve such transfer pending resolution of the matter.

Sec. 648.75  Shucking at sea and minimum surfclam size.

    (a) Shucking at sea--(1) Observers. (i) The Regional Administrator 
may allow the shucking of surfclams or ocean quahogs at sea if he/she 
determines that an observer carried aboard the vessel can measure 
accurately the total amount of surfclams and ocean quahogs harvested in 
the shell prior to shucking.
    (ii) Any vessel owner may apply in writing to the Regional 
Administrator to shuck surfclams or ocean quahogs at sea. The 
application shall specify: Name and address of the applicant; permit 
number of the vessel; method of calculating the amount of surfclams or 
ocean quahogs harvested in the shell; vessel dimensions and 
accommodations; and length of fishing trip.
    (iii) The Regional Administrator shall provide an observer to any 
vessel owner whose application is approved. The owner shall pay all 
reasonable expenses of carrying the observer on board the vessel.
    (iv) Any observer shall certify at the end of each trip the amount 
of surfclams or ocean quahogs harvested in the shell by the vessel. Such 
certification shall be made by the observer's signature on the daily 
fishing log required by Sec. 648.7.
    (2) Conversion factor. (i) Based on the recommendation of the MAFMC, 
the Regional Administrator may allow shucking at sea of surfclams or 
ocean quahogs, with or without an observer, if he/she determines a 
conversion factor for shucked meats to calculate accurately the amount 
of surfclams or ocean quahogs harvested in the shell.
    (ii) The Regional Administrator shall publish notification in the 
Federal Register specifying a conversion factor, together with the data 
used in its calculation, for a 30-day comment period. After 
consideration of the public comments and any other relevant data, the 
Regional Administrator may publish final notification in the Federal 
Register specifying the conversion factor.
    (iii) If the Regional Administrator makes the determination 
specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, he/she may authorize the 
vessel owner to shuck surfclams or ocean quahogs at sea. Such 
authorization shall be in writing and be carried aboard the vessel.
    (b) Minimum surfclam size--(1) Minimum length. The minimum length 
for surfclams is 4.75 inches (12.065 cm).
    (2) Determination of compliance. No more than 50 surfclams in any 
cage may be less than 4.75 inches (12.065 cm) in length. If more than 50 
surfclams in any inspected cage of surfclams are less than 4.75 inches 
(12.065 cm) in length, all cages landed by the same vessel from the same 
trip are deemed

[[Page 629]]

to be in violation of the minimum size restriction.
    (3) Suspension. Upon the recommendation of the MAFMC, the Regional 
Administrator may suspend annually, by publication in the Federal 
Register, the minimum shell-length standard, unless discard, catch, and 
survey data indicate that 30 percent of the surfclams are smaller than 
4.75 inches (12.065 cm) and the overall reduced shell length is not 
attributable to beds where the growth of individual surfclams has been 
reduced because of density dependent factors.
    (4) Measurement. Length is measured at the longest dimension of the 
surfclam shell.

Sec. 648.76  Closed areas.

    (a) Areas closed because of environmental degradation. Certain areas 
are closed to all surfclam and ocean quahog fishing because of adverse 
environmental conditions. These areas will remain closed until the 
Regional Administrator determines that the adverse environmental 
conditions no longer exist. If additional areas are identified by the 
Regional Administrator as being contaminated by the introduction or 
presence of hazardous materials or pollutants, they may be closed by the 
Regional Administrator in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. 
The areas closed are:
    (1) Boston Foul Ground. The waste disposal site known as the 
``Boston Foul Ground'' and located at 42[deg]25[min]36[sec] N. lat., 
70[deg]35[min]00[sec] W. long., with a radius of 1 nm (1.61 km) in every 
direction from that point.
    (2) New York Bight. The polluted area and waste disposal site known 
as the ``New York Bight'' and located at 40[deg]25[min]04[sec] N. lat., 
73[deg]42[min]38[sec] W. long., and with a radius of 6 nm (9.66 km) in 
every direction from that point, extending further northwestward, 
westward and southwestward between a line from a point on the arc at 
40[deg]31[min]00[sec] N. lat., 73[deg]43[min]38[sec] W. long., directly 
northward toward Atlantic Beach Light in New York to the limit of the 
state territorial waters of New York; and a line from the point on the 
arc at 40[deg]19[min]48[sec] N. lat., 73[deg]45[min]42[sec] W. long., to 
a point at the limit of the state territorial waters of New Jersey at 
40[deg]14[min]00[sec] N. lat., 73[deg]55[min]42[sec] W. long.
    (3) 106 Dumpsite. The toxic industrial site known as the ``106 
Dumpsite'' and located between 38[deg]40[min]00[sec] and 
39[deg]00[min]00[sec] N. lat., and between 72[deg]00[min]00[sec] and 
72[deg]30[min]00[sec] W. long.
    (4) Georges Bank. The paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) 
contaminated area, which is located on Georges Bank, and located east of 
69[deg] W. long., and south of 42[deg]20[min] N. lat.
    (b) Areas closed because of small surfclams. Areas may be closed 
because they contain small surfclams.
    (1) Closure. The Regional Administrator may close an area to 
surfclams and ocean quahog fishing if he/she determines, based on 
logbook entries, processors' reports, survey cruises, or other 
information, that the area contains surfclams of which:
    (i) Sixty percent or more are smaller than 4.5 inches (11.43 cm); 
and
    (ii) Not more than 15 percent are larger than 5.5 inches (13.97 cm) 
in size.
    (2) Reopening. The Regional Administrator may reopen areas or parts 
of areas closed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if he/she 
determines, based on survey cruises or other information, that:
    (i) The average length of the dominant (in terms of weight) size 
class in the area to be reopened is equal to or greater than 4.75 inches 
(12.065 cm); or
    (ii) The yield or rate of growth of the dominant shell-length class 
in the area to be reopened would be significantly enhanced through 
selective, controlled, or limited harvest of surfclams in the area.
    (c) Procedure. (1) The Regional Administrator may hold a public 
hearing on the proposed closure or reopening of any area under paragraph 
(a) or (b) of this section. The Regional Administrator shall publish 
notification in the Federal Register of any proposed area closure or 
reopening, including any restrictions on harvest in a reopened area. 
Comments on the proposed closure or reopening must be submitted to the 
Regional Administrator within 30 days after publication. The Regional 
Administrator shall consider all comments and publish the final 
notification of closure or reopening, and any restrictions on harvest, 
in

[[Page 630]]

the Federal Register. Any adjustment to harvest restrictions in a 
reopened area shall be made by notification in the Federal Register. The 
Regional Administrator shall send notice of any action under this 
paragraph (c)(1) to each surfclam and ocean quahog processor and to each 
surfclam and ocean quahog permit holder.
    (2) If the Regional Administrator determines, as the result of 
testing by state, Federal, or private entities, that a closure of an 
area under paragraph (a) of this section is necessary to prevent any 
adverse effects fishing may have on the public health, he/she may close 
the area for 60 days by publication of notification in the Federal 
Register, without prior comment or public hearing. If an extension of 
the 60-day closure period is necessary to protect the public health, the 
hearing and notice requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
shall be followed.
    (d) Areas closed due to the presence of paralytic shellfish 
poisoning toxin--(1) Maine mahogany quahog zone. The Maine mahogany 
quahog zone is closed to fishing for ocean quahogs except in those areas 
of the zone that are tested by the State of Maine and deemed to be 
within the requirements of the National Shellfish Sanitation Program and 
adopted by the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference as acceptable 
limits for the toxin responsible for PSP. Harvesting is allowed in such 
areas during the periods specified by the Maine Department of Marine 
Resources during which quahogs are safe for human consumption. For 
information regarding these areas contact the State of Maine Division of

Sec. 648.77  Cage identification.

    Except as provided in Sec. 648.78, the following cage 
identification requirements apply to all vessels issued a Federal 
fishing permit for surfclams and ocean quahogs:
    (a) Tagging. Before offloading, all cages that contain surfclams or 
ocean quahogs must be tagged with tags acquired annually under 
provisions of paragraph (b) of this section. A tag must be fixed on or 
as near as possible to the upper crossbar of the cage. A tag is required 
for every 60 ft\3\ (1,700 L) of cage volume, or portion thereof. A tag 
or tags must not be removed until the cage is emptied by the processor, 
at which time the processor must promptly remove and retain the tag(s) 
for 60 days beyond the end of the calendar year, unless otherwise 
directed by authorized law enforcement agents.
    (b) Issuance. The Regional Administrator will issue a supply of tags 
to each individual allocation owner qualifying for an allocation under 
Sec. 648.74 prior to the beginning of each fishing year, or he/she may 
specify, in the Federal Register, a vendor from whom the tags shall be 
purchased. The number of tags will be based on the owner's initial 
allocation as specified in Sec. 648.74(a). Each tag represents 32 bu 
(1,700 L) of allocation.
    (c) Expiration. Tags will expire at the end of the fishing year for 
which they are issued, or if rendered null and void in accordance with 
15 CFR part 904.
    (d) Return. Tags that have been rendered null and void must be 
returned to the Regional Administrator, if possible.
    (e) Loss. Loss or theft of tags must be reported by the owner, 
numerically identifying the tags to the Regional Administrator by 
telephone as soon as the loss or theft is discovered and in writing 
within 24 hours. Thereafter, the reported tags shall no longer be valid 
for use under this part.
    (f) Replacement. Lost or stolen tags may be replaced by the Regional 
Administrator if proper notice of the loss is provided by the person to 
whom the tags were issued. Replacement tags may be purchased from the 
Regional Administrator or a vendor with a written authorization from the 
Regional Administrator.
    (g) Transfer. See Sec. 648.74(b)(2).
    (h) Presumptions. Surfclams and ocean quahogs found in cages without 
a valid state tag are deemed to have been harvested in the EEZ and to be 
part of an individual's allocation, unless the individual demonstrates 
that he/she has surrendered his/her Federal vessel permit issued under 
Sec. 648.4(a)(4) and conducted fishing operations exclusively within 
waters under the jurisdiction of any state. Surfclams and ocean

[[Page 631]]

quahogs in cages with a Federal tag or tags, issued and still valid 
pursuant to this section, affixed thereto are deemed to have been 
harvested by the individual allocation holder to whom the tags were 
issued under the provisions of Sec. 648.77(b) or transferred under the 
provisions of Sec. 648.74(b).

    (a) Landing requirements. (1) A vessel issued a valid Maine mahogany 
quahog permit pursuant to Sec. 648.4(a)(4)(i), and fishing for or 
possessing ocean quahogs within the Maine mahogany quahog zone, must 
land its catch in the State of Maine.
    (2) A vessel fishing under an individual allocation permit, 
regardless of whether it has a Maine mahogany quahog permit, fishing for 
or possessing ocean quahogs within the zone, may land its catch in the 
State of Maine, or, consistent with applicable state law in any other 
state that utilizes food safety-based procedures including sampling and 
analyzing for PSP toxin consistent with those food safety-based 
procedures used by the State of Maine for such purpose, and must comply 
with all requirements in Sec. Sec. 648.74 and 648.77. Documentation 
required by the state and other laws and regulations applicable to food 
safety-based procedures must be made available by federally permitted 
dealers for inspection by NMFS.
    (b) ACT monitoring and closures--(1) Catch quota. (i) The ACT for 
harvest of mahogany quahogs from within the Maine mahogany quahog zone 
is 100,000 Maine bu (35,239 hL). The ACL may be revised annually within 
the range of 17,000 and 100,000 Maine bu (5,991 and 35,239 hL) following 
the procedures set forth in Sec. Sec. 648.72 and 648.73, if applicable.
    (ii) All mahogany quahogs landed for sale in Maine by vessels issued 
a Maine mahogany quahog permit and not fishing for an individual 
allocation of ocean quahogs under Sec. 648.74 shall be applied against 
the Maine mahogany quahog ACT, regardless of where the mahogany quahogs 
are harvested.
    (iii) All mahogany quahogs landed by vessels fishing in the Maine 
mahogany quahog zone for an individual allocation of quahogs under Sec. 
648.74 will be counted against the ocean quahog allocation for which the 
vessel is fishing.
    (iv) The Regional Administrator will monitor the ACT based on dealer 
reports and other available information, and shall determine the date 
when the ACT will be harvested. NMFS shall publish notification in the 
Federal Register advising the public that, effective upon a specific 
date, the Maine mahogany quahog quota has been harvested, and notifying 
vessel and dealer permit holders that no Maine mahogany quahog quota is 
available for the remainder of the year.
    (2) Maine Mahogany Quahog Advisory Panel. The MAFMC shall establish 
a Maine Mahogany Quahog Advisory Panel consisting of representatives of 
harvesters, dealers, and the Maine Department of Marine Resources. The 
Advisory Panel shall make recommendations, through the Surfclam and 
Ocean Quahog Committee of the MAFMC, regarding revisions to the annual 
quota and other management measures.

Sec. 648.79  Surfclam and ocean quahog framework adjustments to
management measures.

    (a) Within season management action. The MAFMC may, at any time, 
initiate action to add or adjust management measures within the Atlantic 
Surfclam and Ocean Quahog FMP if it finds that action is necessary to 
meet or be consistent with the goals and objectives of the plan.
    (1) Adjustment process. The MAFMC shall develop and analyze 
appropriate management actions over the span of at least two MAFMC 
meetings. The MAFMC must provide the public with advance notice of the 
availability of the recommendation(s), appropriate justification(s) and 
economic and biological analyses, and the opportunity to comment on the 
proposed adjustment(s) at the first meeting, and prior to and at the 
second MAFMC meeting. The MAFMC's recommendations on adjustments or 
additions to management measures must come from one or more of the 
following categories: Adjustments within existing ABC control rule 
levels; adjustments to the existing MAFMC risk policy; introduction of

[[Page 632]]

new AMs, including sub-ACTs; description and identification of EFH (and 
fishing gear management measures that impact EFH); habitat areas of 
particular concern; set-aside quota for scientific research; VMS; OY 
range; and suspension or adjustment of the surfclam minimum size limit. 
Issues that require significant departures from previously contemplated 
measures or that are otherwise introducing new concepts may require an 
amendment of the FMP instead of a framework adjustment.
    (2) MAFMC recommendation. After developing management actions and 
receiving public testimony, the MAFMC shall make a recommendation to the 
Regional Administrator. The MAFMC's recommendation must include 
supporting rationale, if management measures are recommended, an 
analysis of impacts, and a recommendation to the Regional Administrator 
on whether to issue the management measures as a final rule. If the 
MAFMC recommends that the management measures should be issued as a 
final rule, it must consider at least the following factors, and provide 
support and analysis for each factor considered:
    (i) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended 
management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a 
proposed rule, and whether the regulations would have to be in place for 
an entire harvest/fishing season.
    (ii) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for 
participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the 
development of recommended management measures.
    (iii) Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource.
    (iv) Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management 
measures adopted following their implementation as a final rule.
    (3) NMFS action. If the MAFMC's recommendation includes adjustments 
or additions to management measures and after reviewing the MAFMC's 
recommendation and supporting information:
    (i) If NMFS concurs with the MAFMC's recommended management measures 
and determines that the recommended management measures should be issued 
as a final rule based on the factors specified in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section, the measures will be issued as a final rule in the Federal 
Register.
    (ii) If NMFS concurs with the MAFMC's recommended management 
measures and determines that the recommended management measures should 
be published first as a proposed rule, the measures will be published as 
a proposed rule in the Federal Register. After additional public 
comment, if NMFS concurs with the MAFMC recommendation, the measures 
will be published as a final rule in the Federal Register.
    (iii) If NMFS does not concur, the MAFMC will be notified in writing 
of the reasons for the non-concurrence.
    (4) Emergency actions. Nothing in this section is meant to derogate 
from the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under

This restriction does not apply to nets or pieces of nets smaller than 3 
ft (0.9 m) x 3 ft (0.9 m), (9 sq ft (0.81 sq m)), or to vessels that 
have not been issued a NE multispecies permit and that are fishing 
exclusively in state waters.
    (iii) Large-mesh vessels. When fishing in the GOM Regulated Mesh 
Area, the minimum mesh size for any trawl net

[[Page 634]]

vessel, or sink gillnet, on a vessel or used by a vessel fishing under a 
DAS in the Large-mesh DAS program, specified in Sec. 648.82(b)(4), is 
8.5-inch (21.6-cm) diamond or square mesh throughout the entire net. 
This restriction does not apply to nets or pieces of nets smaller than 3 
ft (0.9 m) x 3 ft (0.9 m), (9 sq ft (0.81 sq m)), or to vessels that 
have not been issued a NE multispecies permit and that are fishing 
exclusively in state waters.
    (iv) Gillnet vessels--(A) Trip gillnet vessels--(1) Mesh size. 
Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3)(iv) and (vi) of this section, 
and unless otherwise restricted under paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this 
section, for any vessel that obtains an annual designation as a Trip 
gillnet vessel, the minimum mesh size for any sink gillnet when fishing 
in the NE multispecies DAS program or on a sector trip in the GOM 
Regulated Mesh Area is 6.5 inches (16.5 cm) throughout the entire net. 
This restriction does not apply to nets or pieces of nets smaller than 3 
ft (0.9 m) x 3 ft (0.9 m), (9 sq ft (0.81 sq m)), or to vessels that 
have not been issued a NE multispecies permit and that are fishing 
exclusively in state waters.
    (2) Net size requirements. Nets may not be longer than 300 ft (91.4 
m), or 50 fathoms (91.4 m) in length.
    (B) Day gillnet vessels--(1) Mesh size. Except as provided in 
paragraphs (a)(3)(iv) and (vi) of this section, and unless otherwise 
restricted under paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, for any vessel 
that obtain an annual designation as a Day gillnet vessel, the minimum 
mesh size for any sink gillnet when fishing under the NE multispecies 
DAS program or on a sector trip in the GOM Regulated Mesh Area is 6.5 
inches (16.5 cm) throughout the entire net. This restriction does not 
apply to nets or pieces of nets smaller than 3 ft (0.9 m) x 3 ft (0.9 
m), (9 sq ft (0.81 sq m)), or to vessels that have not been issued a NE 
multispecies permit and that are fishing exclusively in state waters.
    (2) Number of nets. A day gillnet vessel fishing under a NE 
multispecies DAS or on a sector trip and fishing in the GOM Regulated 
Mesh Area may not fish with, haul, possess, or deploy more than 50 
roundfish sink gillnets or 100 flatfish (tie-down) sink gillnets, each 
of which must be tagged pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(C) of this 
section, except as provided in Sec. 648.92(b)(8)(i). Vessels may fish 
any combination of roundfish and flatfish gillnets up to 100 nets, and 
may stow additional nets not to exceed 160 nets, counting deployed nets.
    (3) Net size requirements. Nets may not be longer than 300 ft (91.4 
m), or 50 fathoms (91.4 m) in length.
    (4) Tags. Roundfish nets must be tagged with two tags per net, with 
one tag secured to each bridle of every net, within a string of nets, 
and flatfish nets must have one tag per net, with one tag secured to 
every other bridle of every net within a string of nets. Gillnet vessels 
must also abide by the tagging requirements in paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(C) 
of this section.
    (C) Obtaining and replacing tags. Tags must be obtained as described 
in Sec. 648.4(c)(2)(iii), and vessels must have on board written 
confirmation issued by the Regional Administrator, indicating that the 
vessel is a Day gillnet vessel or a Trip gillnet vessel. The vessel 
operator must produce all net tags upon request by an authorized 
officer. A vessel may have tags on board in excess of the number of tags 
corresponding to the allowable number of nets, provided such tags are 
onboard the vessel and can be made available for inspection.
    (1) Lost tags. Vessel owners or operators are required to report 
lost, destroyed, and missing tag numbers as soon as feasible after tags 
have been discovered lost, destroyed or missing, by letter or fax to the 
Regional Administrator.
    (2) Replacement tags. Vessel owners or operators seeking replacement 
of lost, destroyed, or missing tags must request replacement of tags by 
letter or fax to the Regional Administrator. A check for the cost of the 
replacement tags must be received by the Regional Administrator before 
tags will be re-issued.
    (v) Hook gear restrictions. Unless otherwise specified in this 
paragraph (a)(3)(v) or Sec. 648.87(c), vessels fishing with a valid NE 
multispecies limited access permit and fishing under a NE multispecies 
DAS or on a sector trip, and vessels fishing with a valid NE

[[Page 635]]

multispecies limited access Small-Vessel permit in the GOM Regulated 
Mesh Area, and persons on such vessels, are prohibited from fishing, 
setting, or hauling back, per day, or possessing on board the vessel, 
more than 2,000 rigged hooks. All longline gear hooks must be circle 
hooks, of a minimum size of 12/0. An unbaited hook and gangion that has 
not been secured to the ground line of the trawl on board a vessel 
during the fishing trip is deemed to be a replacement hook and is not 
counted toward the 2,000-hook limit. A ``snap-on'' hook is deemed to be 
a replacement hook if it is not rigged or baited during the fishing 
trip. The use of de-hookers (``crucifer'') with less than 6-inch (15.2-
cm) spacing between the fairlead rollers is prohibited. Vessels fishing 
with a valid NE multispecies limited access Hook Gear permit and fishing 
under a multispecies DAS or on a sector trip in the GOM Regulated Mesh 
Area, and persons on such vessels, are prohibited from possessing gear 
other than hook gear on board the vessel. Vessels fishing with a valid 
NE multispecies limited access Handgear A permit, and persons on such 
vessels, are prohibited from fishing, or possessing on board the vessel, 
gear other than handgear. Vessels fishing with tub-trawl gear are 
prohibited from fishing, setting, or hauling back, per day, or 
possessing on board the vessel more than 250 hooks.
    (vi) Other restrictions and exemptions. A vessel is prohibited from 
fishing in the GOM or GB Exemption Area as defined in paragraph (a)(17) 
of this section, except if fishing with exempted gear (as defined under 
this part) or under the exemptions specified in paragraphs (a)(5) 
through (7), (a)(9) through (a)(16) and (a)(18), (d), (e), (h), and (i) 
of this section; or if fishing under a NE multispecies DAS; or if 
fishing on a sector trip; or if fishing under the Small Vessel or 
Handgear A permit specified in Sec. 648.82(b)(5) and (6), respectively; 
or if fishing under a Handgear B permit specified in Sec. 648.88(a); or 
if fishing under the scallop state waters exemptions specified in Sec. 
648.54 and paragraph (a)(11) of this section; or if fishing under a 
scallop DAS in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section; or if 
fishing pursuant to a NE multispecies open access Charter/Party or 
Handgear permit specified in Sec. 648.88; or if fishing as a charter/
party or private recreational vessel in compliance with Sec. 648.89. 
Any gear used by a vessel in this area must be authorized under one of 
these exemptions. Any gear on a vessel that is not authorized under one 
of these exemptions must be stowed as specified in Sec. 648.23(b).
    (vii) Rockhopper and roller gear restrictions. For all trawl vessels 
fishing in the GOM/GB Inshore Restricted Roller Gear Area, the diameter 
of any part of the trawl footrope, including discs, rollers, or 
rockhoppers, must not exceed 12 inches (30.5 cm). The GOM/GB Inshore

this section.
    (v) Hook gear restrictions. Unless otherwise specified in this 
paragraph

[[Page 637]]

(a)(4)(v), vessels fishing with a valid NE multispecies limited access 
permit and fishing under a NE multispecies DAS, and vessels fishing with 
a valid NE multispecies limited access Small-Vessel permit, in the GB 
Regulated Mesh Area, and persons on such vessels, are prohibited from 
possessing gear other than hook gear on board the vessel and prohibited 
from fishing, setting, or hauling back, per day, or possessing on board 
the vessel, more than 3,600 rigged hooks. All longline gear hooks must 
be circle hooks, of a minimum size of 12/0. An unabated hook and 
gangions that has not been secured to the ground line of the trawl on 
board a vessel is deemed to be a replacement hook and is not counted 
toward the 3,600-hook limit. A ``snap-on'' hook is deemed to be a 
replacement hook if it is not rigged or baited. The use of de-hookers 
(``crucifer'') with less than 6-inch (15.2-cm) spacing between the 
fairlead rollers is prohibited. Vessels fishing with a valid NE 
multispecies limited access Hook gear permit and fishing under a 
multispecies DAS in the GB Regulated Mesh Area, and persons on such 
vessels, are prohibited from possessing gear other than hook gear on 
board the vessel. Vessels fishing with a valid NE multispecies limited 
access Handgear A permit are prohibited from fishing or possessing on 
board the vessel, gear other than hand gear. Vessels fishing with tub-
trawl gear are prohibited from fishing, setting, or hauling back, per 
day, or possessing on board the vessel more than 250 hooks.
    (5) Small Mesh Northern Shrimp Fishery Exemption. Vessels subject to 
the minimum mesh size restrictions specified in this paragraph (a) may 
fish for, harvest, possess, or land northern shrimp in the GOM, GB, SNE, 
and MA Regulated Mesh Areas, as described under paragraphs (a)(1), 
(a)(2), (b)(1), and (c)(1) of this section, respectively, with nets with 
a mesh size smaller than the minimum size specified, if the vessel 
complies with the requirements of paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (iii) of 
this section.
    (i) Restrictions on fishing for, possessing, or landing fish other 
than shrimp. An owner or operator of a vessel fishing in the northern 
shrimp fishery under the exemption described in this paragraph (a)(5) 
may not fish for, possess on board, or land any species of fish other 
than shrimp, except for the following, with the restrictions noted, as 
allowable incidental species: Longhorn sculpin; combined silver hake and 
offshore hake--up to an amount equal to the total weight of shrimp 
possessed on board or landed, not to exceed 3,500 lb (1,588 kg); and 
American lobster--up to 10 percent, by weight, of all other species on 
board or 200 lobsters, whichever is less, unless otherwise restricted by 
landing limits specified in Sec. 697.17 of this chapter. Silver hake 
and offshore hake on board a vessel subject to this possession limit 
must be separated from other species of fish and stored so as to be 
readily available for inspection.
    (ii) Requirement to use a finfish excluder device (FED). A vessel 
must have a rigid or semi-rigid grate consisting of parallel bars of not 
more than 1-inch (2.54-cm) spacing that excludes all fish and other 
objects, except those that are small enough to pass between its bars 
into the codend of the trawl, secured in the trawl, forward of the 
codend, in such a manner that it precludes the passage of fish or other 
objects into the codend without the fish or objects having to first pass 
between the bars of the grate, in any net with mesh smaller than the 
minimum size specified in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section. The 
net must have an outlet or hole to allow fish or other objects that are 
too large to pass between the bars of the grate to exit the net. The 
aftermost edge of this outlet or hole must be at least as wide as the 
grate at the point of attachment. The outlet or hole must extend forward 
from the grate toward the mouth of the net. A funnel of net material is 
allowed in the lengthening piece of the net forward of the grate to 
direct catch towards the grate. (Copies of a schematic example of a 
properly configured and installed FED are available from the Regional 
Administrator upon request.)
    (iii) Time restrictions. A vessel may only fish under this exemption 
during the northern shrimp season, as established by the Commission and 
announced in the Commission's letter to participants.

    (6) Cultivator Shoal Whiting Fishery Exemption Area. Vessels subject 
to the minimum mesh size restrictions specified in paragraphs (a)(3) and 
(4) of this section may fish with, use, or possess nets in the 
Cultivator Shoal Whiting Fishery Exemption Area with a mesh size smaller 
than the minimum size specified, if the vessel complies with the 
requirements specified in paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section. The 
Cultivator Shoal Whiting Fishery Exemption Area (copies of a map

    (i) Requirements. (A) A vessel fishing in the Cultivator Shoal 
Whiting Fishery Exemption Area under this exemption must have on board a 
valid letter of authorization issued by the Regional Administrator.
    (B) An owner or operator of a vessel fishing in this area may not 
fish for, possess on board, or land any species of fish other than 
whiting and offshore hake combined--up to a maximum of 30,000 lb (13,608 
kg), except for the following, with the restrictions noted, as allowable 
incidental species: Herring; longhorn sculpin; squid; butterfish; 
Atlantic mackerel; dogfish; red hake; monkfish and monkfish parts--up to 
10 percent, by weight, of all other species on board or up to 50 lb (23 
kg) tail-weight/166 lb (75 kg) whole-weight of monkfish per trip, as 
specified in Sec. 648.94(c)(4), whichever is less; and American 
lobster--up to 10 percent, by weight, of all other species on board or 
200 lobsters, whichever is less, unless otherwise restricted by landing 
limits specified in Sec. 697.17 of this chapter.
    (C) Counting from the terminus of the net, all nets must have a 
minimum mesh size of 3-inch (7.6-cm) square or diamond mesh applied to 
the first 100 meshes (200 bars in the case of square mesh) for vessels 
greater than 60 ft (18.3 m) in length and applied to the first 50 meshes 
(100 bars in the case of square mesh) for vessels less than or equal to 
60 ft (18.3 m) in length.
    (D) Fishing is confined to a season of June 15 through October 31, 
unless otherwise specified by notification in the Federal Register.
    (E) When a vessel is transiting through the GOM or GB Regulated Mesh 
Areas specified under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, any 
nets with a mesh size smaller than the minimum mesh specified in 
paragraphs (a)(3) or (4) of this section must be stowed in accordance 
with one of the methods specified in Sec. 648.23(b), unless the vessel 
is fishing for small-mesh multispecies under another exempted fishery 
specified in this paragraph (a).
    (F) A vessel fishing in the Cultivator Shoal Whiting Fishery 
Exemption Area may fish for small-mesh multispecies in exempted 
fisheries outside of the Cultivator Shoal Whiting Fishery Exemption 
Area, provided that the vessel complies with the more restrictive gear, 
possession limit, and other requirements specified in the regulations of 
that exempted fishery for the entire participation period specified on 
the vessel's letter of authorization and consistent with paragraph 
(a)(15)(i)(G) of this section.
    (ii) Sea sampling. The Regional Administrator shall conduct periodic 
sea sampling to determine if there is a need to change the area or 
season designation, and to evaluate the bycatch of regulated species, 
especially haddock.
    (iii) Annual review. The NEFMC shall conduct an annual review of 
data to determine if there are any changes in area or season designation 
necessary, and to make appropriate recommendations to the Regional 
Administrator following the procedures specified in Sec. 648.90.
    (7) Transiting. (i) Vessels fishing in the Small Mesh Area 1/Small 
Mesh Area 2 fishery, as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this section, 
may transit through the Scallop Dredge Fishery Exemption Area as 
specified in paragraph (a)(11) of this section with nets

[[Page 639]]

of mesh size smaller than the minimum mesh size specified in paragraphs 
(a)(3) or (4) of this section, provided that the nets are stowed and not 
available for immediate use in accordance with one of the methods 
specified in Sec. 648.23(b). Vessels fishing in the Small Mesh Northern 
Shrimp Fishery, as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, may 
transit through the GOM, GB, SNE, and MA Regulated Mesh Areas, as 
described in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (b)(1), and (c)(1) of this 
section, respectively, with nets of mesh size smaller than the minimum 
mesh size specified in paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), (b)(2), and (c)(2) of 
this section, provided the nets are stowed and not available for 
immediate use in accordance with one of the methods specified in Sec. 
648.23(b).
    (ii) Vessels subject to the minimum mesh size restrictions specified 
in paragraphs (a)(3) or (4) of this section may transit through the 
Scallop Dredge Fishery Exemption Areas defined in paragraphs (a)(11) and 
(18) of this section with nets on board with a mesh size smaller than 
the minimum size specified, provided that the nets are stowed in 
accordance with one of the methods specified in Sec. 648.23(b), and 
provided the vessel has no fish on board.
    (iii) Vessels subject to the minimum mesh size restrictions 
specified in paragraphs (a)(3) or (4) of this section may transit 
through the GOM and GB Regulated Mesh Areas defined in paragraphs (a)(1) 
and (2) of this section with nets on board with a mesh size smaller than 
the minimum mesh size specified and with small mesh exempted species on 
board, provided that the following conditions are met:
    (A) All nets with a mesh size smaller than the minimum mesh size 
specified in paragraphs (a)(3) or (4) of this section are stowed in 
accordance with one of the methods specified in Sec. 648.23(b).
    (B) A letter of authorization issued by the Regional Administrator 
is on board.
    (C) Vessels do not fish for, possess on board, or land any fish, 
except when fishing in the areas specified in paragraphs (a)(6), 
(a)(10), (a)(15), (b), and (c) of this section. Vessels may retain 
exempted small-mesh species as provided in paragraphs (a)(6)(i), 
(a)(10)(i), (a)(15)(i), (b)(3), and (c)(3) of this section.
    (8) Addition or deletion of exemptions--(i) Exemption allowing no 
incidental catch of regulated multispecies. An exemption may be added in 
an existing fishery for which there are sufficient data or information 
to ascertain the amount of regulated species bycatch, if the Regional 
Administrator, after consultation with the NEFMC, determines that the 
percentage of regulated species caught as bycatch is, or can be reduced 
to, less than 5 percent, by weight, of total catch, unless otherwise 
specified in this paragraph (a)(8)(i) of this section, and that such 
exemption will not jeopardize fishing mortality objectives. The 5-
percent regulated species incidental bycatch standard could be modified 
for a stock that is not in an overfished condition, or if overfishing is 
not occurring on that stock. When considering modifications of the 
standard, it must be shown that the change will not delay a rebuilding 
program, or result in overfishing or an overfished condition. In 
determining whether exempting a fishery may jeopardize meeting fishing 
mortality objectives, the Regional Administrator may take into 
consideration various factors including, but not limited to, juvenile 
mortality, sacrifices in yield that will result from that mortality, the 
ratio of target species to regulated species, status of stock 
rebuilding, and recent recruitment of regulated species. A fishery can 
be defined, restricted, or allowed by area, gear, season, or other means 
determined to be appropriate to reduce bycatch of regulated species. The 
Regional Administrator may modify or delete an existing exemption if he/
she determines that the catch of regulated species is equal to or 
greater than 5 percent, by weight of total catch, or another pertinent 
approved amount, or that continuing the exemption may jeopardize meeting 
fishing mortality objectives. Notification of additions, deletions, or 
modifications will be made through issuance of a rule in the Federal 
Register.
    (ii) Exemption allowing incidental catch of regulated species. An 
exemption may be added in an existing fishery that would allow vessels 
to retain and land

[[Page 640]]

regulated multispecies, under the restrictions specified in paragraphs 
(a)(8)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section, if the Regional 
Administrator, after consultation with the NEFMC, considers the status 
of the regulated species stock or stocks caught in the fishery, the risk 
that this exemption would result in a targeted regulated species 
fishery, the extent of the fishery in terms of time and area, and the 
possibility of expansion in the fishery. Incidental catch in exempted 
fisheries under this paragraph (a)(8)(ii) are subject, at a minimum, to 
the following restrictions:
    (A) A prohibition on the possession of regulated multispecies that 
are overfished or where overfishing is occurring;
    (B) A prohibition on the possession of regulated species in NE 
multispecies closure areas; and
    (C) A prohibition on allowing an exempted fishery to occur that 
would allow retention of a regulated multispecies stock under an ongoing 
rebuilding program, unless it can be determined that the catch of the 
stock in the exempted fishery is not likely to result in exceeding the 
rebuilding mortality rate.
    (iii) For exemptions allowing no incidental catch of regulated 
species, as defined under paragraph (a)(8)(i) of this section, the NEFMC 
may recommend to the Regional Administrator, through the framework 
procedure specified in Sec. 648.90(c), additions or deletions to 
exemptions for fisheries, either existing or proposed, for which there 
may be insufficient data or information for the Regional Administrator 
to determine, without public comment, percentage catch of regulated 
species. For exemptions allowing incidental catch of regulated species, 
as defined under paragraph (a)(8)(ii) of this section, the NEFMC may 
recommend to the Regional Administrator, through the framework procedure 
specified in Sec. 648.90(c), additions or deletions to exemptions for 
fisheries, either existing or proposed, for which there may be 
insufficient data or information for the Regional Administrator to 
determine, without public comment, the risk that this exemption would 
result in a targeted regulated species fishery, the extent of the 
fishery in terms of time and area, and the possibility of expansion in 
the fishery.
    (iv) Unless otherwise specified within the exempted fisheries 
authorized under this paragraph (a)(8), incidental catch is restricted, 
at a minimum, to the following:
    (A) With the exception of fisheries authorized under paragraph 
(a)(8)(ii) of this section, a prohibition on the possession of regulated 
species;
    (B) A limit on the possession of monkfish or monkfish parts of 10 
percent, by weight, of all other species on board or as specified by 
Sec. 648.94(c)(3), (4), (5) or (6), as applicable, whichever is less;
    (C) A limit on the possession of lobsters of 10 percent, by weight, 
of all other species on board or 200 lobsters, whichever is less; and
    (D) A limit on the possession of skate or skate parts in the SNE 
Exemption Area described in paragraph (b)(10) of this section of 10 
percent, by weight, of all other species on board.
    (9) Small Mesh Area 1/Small Mesh Area 2--(i) Description. (A) Unless 
otherwise prohibited in Sec. 648.81, a vessel subject to the minimum 
mesh size restrictions specified in paragraphs (a)(3) or (4) of this 
section may fish with or possess nets with a mesh size smaller than the 
minimum size, provided the vessel complies with the requirements of 
paragraphs (a)(5)(ii) or (a)(9)(ii) of this section, and Sec. 
648.86(d), from July 15 through November 15, when fishing in Small Mesh 
Area 1; and from January 1 through June 30, when fishing in Small Mesh 
Area 2. While lawfully fishing in these areas with mesh smaller than the 
minimum size, an owner or operator of any vessel may not fish for, 
possess on board, or land any species of fish other than: Silver hake 
and offshore hake--up to the amounts specified in Sec. 648.86(d), 
butterfish, dogfish, herring, Atlantic mackerel, scup, squid, and red 
hake.
    (B) Small-mesh Areas 1 and 2 are defined by straight lines 
connecting the following points in the order stated (copies of a chart 
depicting these areas are available from the Regional Administrator upon 
request):

    (ii) Raised footrope trawl. Vessels fishing with trawl gear must 
configure it in such a way that, when towed, the gear is not in contact 
with the ocean bottom. Vessels are presumed to be fishing in such a 
manner if their trawl gear is designed as specified in paragraphs 
(a)(9)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section and is towed so that it does 
not come into contact with the ocean bottom.
    (A) Eight-inch (20.3-cm) diameter floats must be attached to the 
entire length of the headrope, with a maximum spacing of 4 ft (122.0 cm) 
between floats.
    (B) The ground gear must all be bare wire not larger than \1/2\-inch 
(1.2-cm) for the top leg, not larger than \5/8\-inch (1.6-cm) for the 
bottom leg, and not larger than \3/4\-inch (1.9-cm) for the ground 
cables. The top and bottom legs must be equal in length, with no 
extensions. The total length of ground cables and legs must not be 
greater than 40 fathoms (73 m) from the doors to wingends.
    (C) The footrope must be longer than the length of the headrope, but 
not more than 20 ft (6.1 m) longer than the length of the headrope. The 
footrope must be rigged so that it does not contact the ocean bottom 
while fishing.
    (D) The raised footrope trawl may be used with or without a chain 
sweep. If used without a chain sweep, the drop chains must be a maximum 
of \3/8\-inch (0.95-cm) diameter bare chain and must be hung from the 
center of the footrope and each corner (the quarter, or the junction of 
the bottom wing to the belly at the footrope). Drop chains must be hung 
at intervals of 8 ft (2.4 m) along the footrope from the corners to the 
wing ends. If used with a chain sweep, the sweep must be rigged so it is 
behind and below the footrope, and the footrope is off the bottom. This 
is accomplished by having the sweep longer than the footrope and having 
long drop chains attaching the sweep to the footrope at regular 
intervals. The forward end of the sweep and footrope must be connected 
to the bottom leg at the same point. This attachment, in conjunction 
with the headrope flotation, keeps the footrope off the bottom. The 
sweep and its rigging, including drop chains, must be made entirely of 
bare chain with a maximum diameter of \5/16\ inches (0.8 cm). No 
wrapping or cookies are allowed on the drop chains or sweep. The total 
length of the sweep must be at least 7 ft (2.1 m) longer than the total 
length of the footrope, or 3.5 ft (1.1 m) longer on each side. Drop 
chains must connect the footrope to the sweep chain, and the length of 
each drop chain must be at least 42 inches (106.7 cm). One drop chain 
must be hung from the center of the footrope to the center of the sweep, 
and one drop chain must be hung from each corner. The attachment points 
of each drop chain on the sweep and the footrope must be the same 
distance from the center drop chain attachments. Drop chains must be 
hung at intervals of 8 ft (2.4 m) from the corners toward the wing ends. 
The distance of the drop chain that is nearest the wing end to the end 
of the footrope may differ from net to net. However, the sweep must be 
at least 3.5 ft (1.1 m) longer than the footrope between the drop chain 
closest to the wing ends and the end of the sweep that attaches to the 
wing end.
    (10) Nantucket Shoals Dogfish Fishery Exemption Area. Vessels 
subject to the minimum mesh size restrictions specified in paragraph 
(a)(3) or paragraph (a)(4) of this section may fish with, use, or 
possess nets of mesh smaller than the minimum size specified in the 
Nantucket Shoals Dogfish Fishery Exemption Area, if the vessel complies 
with

[[Page 642]]

the requirements specified in paragraph (a)(10)(i) of this section. The 
Nantucket Shoals Dogfish Fishery Exemption Area (copies of a map 
depicting this area are available from the Regional Administrator upon

    (E) A vessel fishing in the Nantucket Shoals Dogfish Fishery 
Exemption Area, under the exemption, must comply with any additional 
gear restrictions specified in the letter of authorization issued by the 
Regional Administrator.
    (ii) Sea sampling. The Regional Administrator may conduct periodic 
sea sampling to determine if there is a need to change the area or 
season designation, and to evaluate the bycatch of regulated species.
    (11) GOM Scallop Dredge Exemption Area. Unless otherwise prohibited 
in Sec. 648.81, vessels with a limited access scallop permit that have 
declared out of the DAS program as specified in Sec. 648.10, or that 
have used up their DAS allocations, and vessels issued a General 
Category scallop permit, may fish in the GOM Regulated Mesh Area 
specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, when not under a NE 
multispecies DAS, providing the vessel fishes in the GOM Scallop Dredge

    (i) Requirements. (A) A vessel fishing in the Raised Footrope Trawl 
Whiting Fishery under this exemption must have on board a valid letter 
of authorization issued by the Regional Administrator. To obtain a 
letter of authorization, vessel owners must write to or call during 
normal business hours the Northeast Region Permit Office and provide the 
vessel name, owner name, permit number, and the desired period of time 
that the vessel will be enrolled. Since letters of authorization are 
effective the day after they are requested, vessel owners should allow 
appropriate processing and mailing time. To withdraw from a category, 
vessel owners must write to or call the Northeast Region Permit Office. 
Withdrawals are effective the day after the date of request. Withdrawals 
may occur after a minimum of 7 days of enrollment.
    (B) All nets must be no smaller than a minimum mesh size of 2.5-inch 
(6.35-cm) square or diamond mesh, subject to the restrictions as 
specified in paragraph (a)(15)(i)(D) of this section. An owner or 
operator of a vessel enrolled in the raised footrope whiting fishery may 
not fish for, possess on board, or land any species of fish other than 
whiting and offshore hake, subject to the applicable possession limits 
as specified in Sec. 648.86, except for the following allowable 
incidental species: Red hake, butterfish, dogfish, herring, mackerel, 
scup, and squid.
    (C) [Reserved]
    (D) All nets must comply with the minimum mesh sizes specified in 
paragraphs (a)(15)(i)(B) of this section. Counting from the terminus of 
the net, the minimum mesh size is applied to the first 100 meshes (200 
bars in the case of square mesh) from the terminus of the net for 
vessels greater than 60 ft (18.3 m) in length and is applied to the 
first 50 meshes (100 bars in the case of square mesh) from the terminus 
of the net for vessels less than or equal to 60 ft (18.3 m) in length.
    (E) Raised footrope trawl gear is required and must be configured as 
specified in paragraphs (a)(9)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section.
    (F) Fishing may only occur from September 1 through November 20 of 
each fishing year, except that it may occur in the eastern portion only 
of the Raised Footrope Trawl Whiting Fishery Exemption Area from 
November 21 through December 31 of each fishing year.
    (G) A vessel enrolled in the Raised Footrope Trawl Whiting Fishery 
may fish for small-mesh multispecies in exempted fisheries outside of 
the Raised Footrope Trawl Whiting Fishery exemption area, provided that 
the vessel complies with the more restrictive gear, possession limit and 
other requirements specified in the regulations of that exempted fishery 
for the entire participation period specified on the vessel's letter of 
authorization. For example, a vessel may fish in both the Raised 
Footrope Trawl Whiting Fishery and the Cultivator Shoal Whiting Fishery 
Exemption Area, and would be restricted to a minimum mesh size of 3 
inches (7.6 cm), as required in the Cultivator Shoal Whiting Fishery 
Exemption Area; the use of the raised footrope trawl; and the catch and 
bycatch restrictions of the Raised Footrope Trawl Whiting Fishery, 
except for scup.
    (ii) Sea sampling. The Regional Administrator shall conduct periodic 
sea sampling to evaluate the bycatch of regulated species.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) Mesh requirements and possession restrictions. (A) All nets must 
comply with a minimum mesh size of 2.5-inch (6.35-cm) square or diamond 
mesh, subject to the restrictions specified in paragraph (a)(16)(i)(B) 
of this section. An owner or operator of a vessel participating in the 
GOM Grate Raised Footrope Trawl Exempted Whiting Fishery may not fish 
for, possess on board, or land any species of fish, other than whiting 
and offshore hake, subject to the applicable possession limits as 
specified in paragraph (a)(16)(i)(C) of this section, except for the 
following allowable incidental species: Red hake, butterfish, herring, 
mackerel, squid, and alewife.
    (B) All nets must comply with the minimum mesh size specified in 
paragraph (a)(16)(i)(A) of this section. Counting from the terminus of 
the net, the minimum mesh size is applied to the first 100 meshes (200 
bars in the case of square mesh) from the terminus of the net for 
vessels greater than 60 ft (18.3 m) in length and is applied to the 
first 50 meshes (100 bars in the case of square mesh) from the terminus 
of the net for vessels less than or equal to 60 ft (18.3 m) in length.
    (C) An owner or operator of a vessel participating in the GOM Grate 
Raised Footrope Trawl Exempted Whiting Fishery may fish for, possess, 
and land combined silver hake and offshore hake only up to 7,500 lb 
(3,402 kg). An owner or operator fishing with mesh larger than the 
minimum mesh size specified in paragraph (a)(16)(i)(A) of this section 
may not fish for, possess, or land silver hake or offshore hake in 
quantities larger than 7,500 lb (3,402 kg).
    (ii) Gear specifications. In addition to the requirements specified 
in paragraph (a)(16)(i) of this section, an owner or operator of a 
vessel fishing in the GOM Grate Raised Footrope Trawl Exempted Whiting 
Fishery must configure the vessel's trawl gear as specified in 
paragraphs (a)(16)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section.
    (A) An owner or operator of a vessel fishing in the GOM Grate Raised 
Footrope Trawl Exempted Whiting Fishery must configure the vessel's 
trawl gear with a raised footrope trawl as specified in paragraphs 
(a)(9)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section. In addition, the restrictions 
specified in paragraphs (a)(16)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section apply to 
vessels fishing in the GOM Grate Raised Footrope Trawl Exempted Whiting 
Fishery.
    (B) The raised footrope trawl must be used without a sweep of any 
kind (chain, roller frame, or rockhopper). The drop chains must be a 
maximum of \3/8\-inch (0.95 cm) diameter bare chain and must be hung 
from the center of the footrope and each corner (the quarter, or the 
junction of the bottom wing to the belly at the footrope). Drop chains 
must be at least 42 inches (106.7 cm) in length and must be hung at 
intervals of 8 ft (2.4 m) along the footrope from the corners to the 
wing ends.
    (C) The raised footrope trawl net must have a rigid or semi-rigid 
grate consisting of parallel bars of not more than 50 mm (1.97 inches) 
spacing that excludes all fish and other objects, except those that are 
small enough to pass between its bars into the codend of the trawl. The 
grate must be secured in the trawl, forward of the codend, in such a 
manner that it precludes the

[[Page 646]]

passage of fish or other objects into the codend without the fish or 
objects having to first pass between the bars of the grate. The net must 
have an outlet or hole to allow fish or other objects that are too large 
to pass between the bars of the grate to exit the net. The aftermost 
edge of this outlet or hole must be at least as wide as the grate at the 
point of attachment. The outlet or hole must extend forward from the 
grate toward the mouth of the net. A funnel of net material is allowed 
in the lengthening piece of the net forward of the grate to direct catch 
towards the grate.
    (iii) Annual review. On an annual basis, the Groundfish PDT will 
review data from this fishery, including sea sampling data, to determine 
whether adjustments are necessary to ensure that regulated species 
bycatch remains at a minimum. If the Groundfish PDT recommends 
adjustments to ensure that regulated species bycatch remains at a 
minimum, the Council may take action prior to the next fishing year 
through the framework adjustment process specified in Sec. 648.90(c), 
and in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.

permit, in the SNE Regulated Mesh Area, and persons on such vessels, are 
prohibited from fishing, setting, or hauling back, per day, or 
possessing on board the vessel, more than 2,000 rigged hooks. All 
longline gear hooks must be circle hooks, of a minimum size of 12/0. An 
unabated hook and gangions that has not been secured to the ground line 
of the trawl on board a vessel is deemed to be a replacement hook and is 
not counted toward the 2,000-hook limit. A ``snap-on'' hook is deemed to 
be a replacement hook if it is not rigged or baited. The use of de-
hookers (``crucifer'') with less than 6-inch (15.2-cm) spacing between 
the fairlead rollers is prohibited. Vessels fishing with a valid NE 
multispecies limited access Hook Gear permit and fishing under a 
multispecies DAS in the SNE Regulated Mesh Area, and persons on such

other regulated NE. multispecies may not be sold, purchased, received, 
traded, bartered, or transferred, or attempted to be sold, purchased, 
received, traded, bartered, or transferred for, or intended for, human 
consumption. Haddock or other regulated NE. multispecies that are 
separated out from the herring catch pursuant to Sec. 648.15(d) may not 
be sold, purchased, received, traded, bartered, or transferred, or 
attempted to be sold, purchased, received, traded, bartered, or 
transferred for any purpose. A vessel issued an All Areas Limited Access 
Herring Permit and/or an Areas 2 and 3 Limited Access Herring Permit 
fishing on a declared herring trip, regardless of gear or area fished, 
or a vessel issued a Limited Access Incidental Catch Herring Permit and/
or an Open Access Herring Permit and fishing with midwater trawl gear 
pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, may not discard haddock that 
has been brought on the deck or pumped into the hold;
    (5) To fish for herring under this exemption, a vessel issued an All 
Areas Limited Access Herring Permit and/or an Areas 2 and 3 Limited 
Access Herring Permit fishing on a declared herring trip, or a vessel 
issued a Limited Access Incidental Catch Herring Permit and/or an Open 
Access Herring Permit fishing with midwater trawl gear in Management 
Areas 1A, 1B, and/or 3, as defined in Sec. 648.200(f)(1) and (3), must 
provide notice of the following information to NMFS at least 72 hr prior 
to beginning any trip into these areas for the purposes of observer 
deployment: Vessel name; contact name for coordination of observer 
deployment; telephone number for contact; the date, time, and port of 
departure; and whether the vessel intends to engage in fishing in Closed 
Area I, as defined in Sec. 648.81(a), at any point in the trip; and
    (6) A vessel issued an All Areas Limited Access Herring Permit and/
or an Areas 2 and 3 Limited Access Herring Permit fishing on a declared 
herring trip with midwater trawl gear, or a vessel issued a Limited 
Access Incidental Catch Herring Permit and fishing with midwater trawl 
gear in Management Areas 1A, 1B, and/or 3, as defined at Sec. 
648.200(f)(1) and (3), must notify NMFS Office of Law Enforcement 
through VMS of the time and place of offloading at least 6 hr prior to 
crossing the VMS demarcation line on their return trip to port, or, for 
a vessel that has not fished seaward of the VMS demarcation line, at 
least 6 hr prior to landing. The Regional Administrator may adjust the 
prior notification minimum time through publication of a notice in the 
Federal Register consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act.
    (7) Fishing in Closed Area I. (i) No vessel issued a Federal 
Atlantic herring permit and fishing with midwater trawl gear, may fish, 
possess or land fish in or from, Closed Area I unless it has declared 
first its intent to fish in Closed Area I as required by paragraph 
(d)(5) of this section, and is carrying onboard a NMFS-approved 
observer.
    (ii) No vessel issued a Federal Atlantic herring permit and fishing 
with midwater trawl gear, when fishing any part of a midwater trawl tow 
in Closed Area I, may release fish from the codend of the net, transfer 
fish to another vessel that is not carrying a NMFS-approved observer 
(e.g., an Atlantic herring at-sea processing vessel or an Atlantic 
herring carrier vessel), or otherwise discard fish at sea, unless the 
fish has first been brought aboard the vessel and made available for 
sampling and inspection by the observer, except in the following 
circumstances:
    (A) The vessel operator has determined, and the preponderance of 
available evidence indicates that, there is a compelling safety reason; 
or
    (B) A mechanical failure precludes bringing the fish aboard the 
vessel for inspection; or,
    (C) After pumping of fish onto the vessel has begun, the vessel 
operator determines that pumping becomes impossible as a result of spiny 
dogfish clogging the pump intake. The vessel operator shall take 
reasonable measures (such as strapping and splitting the net) to remove 
all fish which can be pumped from the net prior to release; or
    (iii) If fish are released prior to being brought aboard the vessel 
due to any of the exceptions in paragraphs

[[Page 655]]

(d)(7)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section, the vessel operator must:
    (A) Exit Closed Area I. Once the vessel has exited CA I, it may 
continue to fish, but may not fish inside Closed Area I for the 
remainder of that trip.
    (B) Complete and sign a Closed Area I Midwater Trawl Released Codend 
Affidavit detailing the vessel name and permit number; the VTR serial 
number; where, when, and for what reason the catch was released; the 
total weight of fish caught on that tow; and the weight of fish released 
(if less than the full tow). A completed affidavit must be submitted to 
NMFS within 48 hr of the end of the trip.
    (e) Purse seine gear exempted fishery. Fishing may take place 
throughout the fishing year with purse seine gear of mesh size smaller 
than the applicable minimum size specified in this section, provided 
that:
    (1) The vessel uses purse seine gear exclusively;
    (2) When fishing under this exemption in the GOM/GB Exemption Area, 
as defined in paragraph (a)(17) of this section, the vessel has on board 
a letter of authorization issued by the Regional Administrator and 
complies with the following:
    (i) The vessel only fishes for, possesses, or lands Atlantic 
herring, blueback herring, mackerel, or menhaden; and
    (ii) The vessel must carry a NMFS-approved sea sampler/observer, if 
requested to do so by the Regional Administrator;
    (3) The vessel is issued a letter of authorization for a minimum of 
7 days, and cancels it only as instructed by the Regional Administrator. 
The vessel can be issued LOAs for the midwater trawl exempted fishery 
and the purse seine exempted fishery at the same time; and
    (4) The vessel does not fish for, possess, or land NE. multispecies, 
except that vessels that have an All Areas Limited Access Herring Permit 
and/or an Areas 2 and 3 Limited Access Herring Permit fishing on a 
declared herring trip may possess and land haddock or other regulated 
species consistent with possession restrictions in Sec. 648.86(a)(3) 
and (k), respectively. Such haddock or other regulated multispecies may 
not be sold, purchased, received, traded, bartered, or transferred, or 
attempted to be sold, purchased, received, traded, bartered, or 
transferred for, or intended for, human consumption. Haddock or other 
regulated species that are separated out from the herring catch pursuant 
to Sec. 648.15(d) may not be sold, purchased, received, traded, 
bartered, or transferred, or attempted to be sold, purchased, received, 
traded, bartered, or transferred for any purpose. A vessel issued an All 
Areas Limited Access Herring Permit and/or an Areas 2 and 3 Limited 
Access Herring Permit may not discard haddock that has been brought on 
the deck or pumped into the hold;
    (5) To fish for herring under this exemption, vessels that have an 
All Areas Limited Access Herring Permit and/or an Areas 2 and 3 Limited 
Access Herring Permit must provide notice to NMFS of the vessel name; 
contact name for coordination of observer deployment; telephone number 
for contact; and the date, time, and port of departure, at least 72 hr 
prior to beginning any trip into these areas for the purposes of 
observer deployment; and
    (6) All vessels that have an All Areas Limited Access Herring Permit 
and/or an Areas 2 and 3 Limited Access Herring Permit must notify NMFS 
Office of Law Enforcement through VMS of the time and place of 
offloading at least 6 hr prior to crossing the VMS demarcation line on 
their return trip to port, or, for vessels that have not fished seaward 
of the VMS demarcation line, at least 6 hr prior to landing. The 
Regional Administrator may adjust the prior notification minimum time 
through publication of a notice in the Federal Register consistent with 
the Administrative Procedure Act.
    (f) Mesh measurements--(1) Gillnets. Mesh size of gillnet gear shall 
be measured by lining up 5 consecutive knots perpendicular to the float 
line and, with a ruler or tape measure, measuring 10 consecutive 
measures on the diamond, inside knot to inside knot. The mesh shall be 
the average of the measurements of 10 consecutive measures.
    (2) All other nets. With the exception of gillnets, mesh size is 
measured by a wedge-shaped gauge having a taper of 2 cm (0.79 inches) in 
8 cm (3.15 inches),

[[Page 656]]

and a thickness of 2.3 mm (0.09 inches), inserted into the meshes under 
a pressure or pull of 5 kg (11.02 lb) for mesh size less than 120 mm 
(4.72 inches) and under a pressure or pull of 8 kg (17.64 lb) for mesh 
size at, or greater, than 120 mm (4.72 inches).
    (i) Square-mesh measurement. Square mesh in the regulated portion of 
the net is measured by placing the net gauge along the diagonal line 
that connects the largest opening between opposite corners of the 
square. The square-mesh size is the average of the measurements of 20 
consecutive adjacent meshes from the terminus forward along the long 
axis of the net. The square mesh is measured at least five meshes away 
from the lacings of the net.
    (ii) Diamond-mesh measurement. Diamond mesh in the regulated portion 
of the net is measured running parallel to the long axis of the net. The 
diamond-mesh size is the average of the measurements of any series of 20 
consecutive meshes. The mesh is measured at least five meshes away from 
the lacings of the net.
    (g) Restrictions on gear and methods of fishing--(1) Net obstruction 
or constriction. Except as provided in paragraph (g)(5) of this section, 
a fishing vessel subject to minimum mesh size restrictions shall not use 
any device or material, including, but not limited to, nets, net 
strengtheners, ropes, lines, or chafing gear, on the top of a trawl net, 
except that one splitting strap and one bull rope (if present), 
consisting of line and rope no more than 3 in (7.6 cm) in diameter, may 
be used if such splitting strap and/or bull rope does not constrict, in 
any manner, the top of the trawl net. ``The top of the trawl net'' means 
the 50 percent of the net that (in a hypothetical situation) would not 
be in contact with the ocean bottom during a tow if the net were laid 
flat on the ocean floor. For the purpose of this paragraph, head ropes 
are not considered part of the top of the trawl net.
    (2) Net obstruction or constriction. (i) Except as provided in 
paragraph (g)(5) of this section, a fishing vessel may not use any mesh 
configuration, mesh construction, or other means on or in the top of the 
net subject to minimum mesh size restrictions, as defined in paragraph 
(g)(1) of this section, if it obstructs the meshes of the net in any 
manner.
    (ii) A fishing vessel may not use a net capable of catching NE 
multispecies if the bars entering or exiting the knots twist around each 
other.
    (3) Pair trawl prohibition. No vessel may fish for NE multispecies 
while pair trawling, or possess or land NE multispecies that have been 
harvested by means of pair trawling, except as authorized under 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (4) Brush-sweep trawl prohibition. No vessel may fish for, possess, 
or land NE multispecies while fishing with, or while in possession of, 
brush-sweep trawl gear.
    (5) Net strengthener restrictions when fishing for or possessing 
small-mesh multispecies--(i) Nets of mesh size less than 2.5 inches (6.4 
cm). A vessel lawfully fishing for small-mesh multispecies in the GOM/
GB, SNE, or MA Regulated Mesh Areas, as defined in paragraphs (a), (b), 
and (c) of this section, with nets of mesh size smaller than 2.5 inches 
(6.4-cm), as measured by methods specified in paragraph (f) of this 
section, may use net strengtheners (covers, as described at Sec. 
648.23(d)), provided that the net strengthener for nets of mesh size 
smaller than 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) complies with the provisions specified 
under Sec. 648.23(d).
    (ii) Nets of mesh size equal to or greater than 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) 
but less than 3 inches (7.6 cm). A vessel lawfully fishing for small-
mesh multispecies in the GOM/GB, SNE, or MA Regulated Mesh Areas, as 
defined in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, with nets with 
mesh size equal to or greater than 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) but less than 3 
inches (7.6 cm) (as measured by methods specified in paragraph (f) of 
this section, and as applied to the part of the net specified in 
paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section) may use a net strengthener (i.e., 
outside net), provided the net strengthener does not have an effective 
mesh opening of less than 6 inches (15.2 cm), diamond or square mesh, as 
measured by methods specified in paragraph (f) of this section. The 
inside net (as applied to the part of the net specified in paragraph 
(d)(1)(iv) of this section) must not be more than 2 ft (61 cm) longer

[[Page 657]]

than the outside net, must be the same circumference or smaller than the 
smallest circumference of the outside net, and must be the same mesh 
configuration (i.e., both square or both diamond mesh) as the outside 
net.
    (6) Gillnet requirements to reduce or prevent marine mammal takes--
(i) Requirements for gillnet gear capable of catching NE multispecies to 
reduce harbor porpoise takes. In addition to the requirements for 
gillnet fishing identified in this section, all persons owning or 
operating vessels in the EEZ that fish with sink gillnet gear and other 
gillnet gear capable of catching NE multispecies, with the exception of 
single pelagic gillnets (as described in Sec. 648.81(f)(2)(ii)), must 
comply with the applicable provisions of the Harbor Porpoise Take 
Reduction Plan found in Sec. 229.33 of this title.
    (ii) Requirements for gillnet gear capable of catching NE 
multispecies to prevent large whale takes. In addition to the 
requirements for gillnet fishing identified in this section, all persons 
owning or operating vessels in the EEZ that fish with sink gillnet gear 
and other gillnet gear capable of catching NE multispecies, with the 
exception of single pelagic gillnets (as described in Sec. 
648.81(f)(2)(ii)), must comply with the applicable provisions of the 
Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan found in Sec. 229.32 of this 
title.
    (h) Scallop vessels. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of 
this section, a scallop vessel that possesses a limited access scallop 
permit and either a NE multispecies Combination vessel permit or a 
scallop/multispecies possession limit permit, and that is fishing under 
a scallop DAS allocated under Sec. 648.53, may possess and land up to 
300 lb (136.1 kg) of regulated species per trip, provided that the 
amount of regulated species on board the vessel does not exceed the trip 
limits specified in Sec. 648.86, and provided the vessel has at least 
one standard tote on board, unless otherwise restricted by Sec. 
648.86(a)(2).
    (2) Limited access scallop vessels issued a limited access NE 
multispecies permit and fishing under a NE multispecies DAS are subject 
to the gear restrictions specified in this section and may possess and 
land unlimited amounts of regulated species or ocean pout, unless 
otherwise restricted by Sec. 648.86. Such vessels may simultaneously 
fish under a scallop DAS, but are prohibited from using scallop dredge 
gear on such trips.
    (i) State waters winter flounder exemption. Any vessel issued a NE 
multispecies permit may fish for, possess, or land winter flounder while 
fishing with nets of mesh smaller than the minimum size specified in 
paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(2), and (c)(2) of this section, provided that:
    (1) The vessel has on board a certificate approved by the Regional 
Administrator and issued by the state agency authorizing the vessel's 
participation in the state's winter flounder fishing program and is in 
compliance with the applicable state laws pertaining to minimum mesh 
size for winter flounder.
    (2) Fishing is conducted exclusively in the waters of the state from 
which the certificate was obtained.
    (3) The state's winter flounder plan has been approved by the 
Commission as being in compliance with the Commission's winter flounder

    (4) The state elects, by a letter to the Regional Administrator, to 
participate in the exemption program described by this section (for a 
particular fishing year).
    (5) The vessel does not enter or transit the EEZ.
    (6) The vessel does not enter or transit the waters of another 
state, unless such other state is participating in the exemption program 
described by this section and the vessel is enrolled in that state's 
program.
    (7) The vessel, when not fishing under the DAS program, does not 
fish for, possess, or land more than 500 lb (226.8 kg) of winter 
flounder, and has at least one standard tote on board.
    (8) The vessel does not fish for, possess, or land any species of 
fish other than winter flounder and the exempted small-mesh species 
specified under paragraphs (a)(5)(i), (a)(9)(i), (b)(3), and (c)(4) of 
this section when fishing in the areas specified under paragraphs 
(a)(5), (a)(9), (b)(10), and (c)(5) of this section, respectively.

<R05>
Sec. 648.82  Effort-control program for NE multispecies limited access
vessels.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. Sec. 648.17 and 648.82(a)(2), a 
vessel issued a limited access NE multispecies permit may not fish for, 
possess, or land regulated species, except during a DAS, as allocated 
under, and in accordance with, the applicable DAS program described in 
this section, unless otherwise provided elsewhere in this part.
    (1) End-of-year carry-over. With the exception of vessels that held 
a Confirmation of Permit History, as described in Sec. 
648.4(a)(1)(i)(J), for the entire fishing year preceding the carry-over 
year, limited access vessels that have unused DAS on the last day of 
April of any year may carry over a maximum of 10 DAS into the next year. 
Unused leased DAS may not be carried over. Vessels that have been 
sanctioned through enforcement proceedings will be credited with unused 
DAS based on their DAS allocation minus any total DAS that have been 
sanctioned through enforcement proceedings. For

[[Page 668]]

the 2004 fishing year only, DAS carried over from the 2003 fishing year 
will be classified as Regular B DAS, as specified under paragraph (d)(2) 
of this section. Beginning with the 2005 fishing year, for vessels with 
a balance of both unused Category A DAS and unused Category B DAS at the 
end of the previous fishing year (e.g., for the 2005 fishing year, 
carry-over DAS from the 2004 fishing year), Category A DAS will be 
carried over first, than Regular B DAS, than Reserve B DAS. Category C 
DAS cannot be carried over.
    (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, any vessel 
issued a NE multispecies limited access permit may not call into the DAS 
program and fish under a DAS, fish on a sector trip, or fish under the 
provisions of a limited access Small Vessel Category or Handgear A 
permits pursuant to paragraphs (b)(5) and (6) of this section, 
respectively, if such vessel carries passengers for hire for any portion 
of a fishing trip.
    (b) Permit categories. All limited access NE multispecies permit 
holders shall be assigned to one of the following permit categories, 
according to the criteria specified. Permit holders may request a change 
in permit category, as specified in Sec. 648.4(a)(1)(i)(I)(2). Each 
fishing year shall begin on May 1 and extend through April 30 of the 
following year. Beginning May 1, 2004, with the exception of the limited 
access Small Vessel and Handgear A vessel categories described in 
paragraphs (b)(5) and (6) of this section, respectively, NE multispecies 
DAS available for use will be calculated pursuant to paragraphs (c) and 
(d) of this section.
    (1) Individual DAS category. This category is for vessels allocated 
individual DAS that are not fishing under the Hook Gear, Combination, or 
Large-mesh individual categories. Beginning May 1, 2004, for a vessel 
fishing under the Individual DAS category, the baseline for determining 
the number of NE multispecies DAS available for use shall be calculated 
based upon the fishing history associated with the vessel's permit, as 
specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The number and categories 
of DAS that are allocated for use in a given fishing year are specified 
in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) Hook Gear category. To be eligible for a Hook Gear category 
permit, the vessel must have been issued a limited access multispecies 
permit for the preceding year, be replacing a vessel that was issued a 
Hook Gear category permit for the preceding year, or be replacing a 
vessel that was issued a Hook Gear category permit that was issued a 
Confirmation of Permit History. Beginning May 1, 2004, for a vessel 
fishing under the Hook Gear category, the baseline for determining the 
number of NE multispecies DAS available for use shall be calculated 
based upon the fishing history associated with the vessel's permit, as 
specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The number and categories 
of DAS that are allocated for use in a given fishing year are specified 
in paragraph (d) of this section. A vessel fishing under this category 
in the DAS program must meet or comply with the gear restrictions 
specified under Sec. 648.80(a)(3)(v), (a)(4)(v), (b)(2)(v) and 
(c)(2)(iv) when fishing in the respective regulated mesh areas.
    (3) Combination vessel category. To be eligible for a Combination 
vessel category permit, a vessel must have been issued a Combination 
vessel category permit for the preceding year, be replacing a vessel 
that was issued a Combination vessel category permit for the preceding 
year, or be replacing a vessel that was issued a Combination vessel 
category permit that was also issued a Confirmation of Permit History. 
Beginning May 1, 2004, for a vessel fishing under the Combination vessel 
category, the baseline for determining the number of NE multispecies DAS 
available for use shall be calculated based upon the fishing history 
associated with the vessel's permit, as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section. The number and categories of DAS that are allocated for 
use in a given fishing year are specified in paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (4) Large Mesh Individual DAS category. This category is for vessels 
allocated individual DAS that area not fishing under the Hook Gear, 
Combination, or Individual DAS categories. Beginning May 1, 2004, for a 
vessel fishing under the Large Mesh Individual DAS

[[Page 669]]

category, the baseline for determining the number of NE multispecies DAS 
available for use shall be calculated based upon the fishing history 
associated with the vessel's permit, as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section. The number and categories of DAS that are allocated for 
use in a given fishing year are specified in paragraph (d) of this 
section. The number of Category A DAS shall be increased by 36 percent. 
To be eligible to fish under the Large Mesh Individual DAS category, a 
vessel, while fishing under this category, must fish under the specific 
regulated mesh area minimum mesh size restrictions, as specified in 
Sec. 648.80(a)(3)(iii), (a)(4)(iii), (b)(2)(iii), and (c)(2)(ii).
    (5) Small Vessel category--(i) DAS allocation. A vessel qualified 
and electing to fish under the Small Vessel category may retain up to 
300 lb (136.1 kg) of cod, haddock, and yellowtail flounder, combined, 
and one Atlantic halibut per trip, without being subject to DAS 
restrictions, provided the vessel does not exceed the yellowtail 
flounder possession restrictions specified at Sec. 648.86(g). Such a 
vessel is subject to the possession limits specified for other regulated 
species and ocean pout, as specified at Sec. 648.86. Any vessel may 
elect to switch into the Small Vessel category, as provided in Sec. 
648.4(a)(1)(i)(I)(2), if the vessel meets or complies with the 
following:
    (A) The vessel is 30 ft (9.1 m) or less in length overall, as 
determined by measuring along a horizontal line drawn from a 
perpendicular raised from the outside of the most forward portion of the 
stem of the vessel to a perpendicular raised from the after most portion 
of the stern.
    (B) If construction of the vessel was begun after May 1, 1994, the 
vessel must be constructed such that the quotient of the length overall 
divided by the beam is not less than 2.5.
    (C) Acceptable verification for vessels 20 ft (6.1 m) or less in 
length shall be USCG documentation or state registration papers. For 
vessels over 20 ft (6.1 m) in length overall, the measurement of length 
must be verified in writing by a qualified marine surveyor, or the 
builder, based on the vessel's construction plans, or by other means 
determined acceptable by the Regional Administrator. A copy of the 
verification must accompany an application for a NE multispecies permit.
    (D) Adjustments to the Small Vessel category requirements, including 
changes to the length requirement, if required to meet fishing mortality 
goals, may be made by the Regional Administrator following framework 
procedures of Sec. 648.90.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (6) Handgear A category. A vessel qualified and electing to fish 
under the Handgear A category, as described in Sec. 648.4(a)(1)(i)(A), 
may retain, per trip, up to 300 lb (135 kg) of cod, one Atlantic 
halibut, and the daily possession limit for other regulated species and 
ocean pout, as specified under Sec. 648.86. If either the GOM or GB cod 
trip limit applicable to a vessel fishing under a NE multispecies DAS 
permit, as specified in Sec. 648.86(b)(1) and (2), respectively, is 
reduced below 300 lb (135 kg) per DAS by NMFS, the cod trip limit 
specified in this paragraph (b)(6) shall be adjusted to be the same as 
the applicable cod trip limit specified for NE multispecies DAS permits. 
For example, if the GOM cod trip limit for NE multispecies DAS vessels 
was reduced to 250 lb (113.4 kg) per DAS, then the cod trip limit for a 
vessel issued a Handgear A category permit that is fishing in the GOM 
Regulated Mesh Area would also be reduced to 250 lb (113.4 kg). 
Qualified vessels electing to fish under the Handgear A category are 
subject to the following restrictions:
    (i) The vessel must not use or possess on board gear other than 
handgear while in possession of, fishing for, or landing NE 
multispecies, and must have at least one standard tote on board.
    (ii) A vessel may not fish for, possess, or land regulated species 
from March 1 through March 20 of each year.
    (iii) Tub-trawls must be hand-hauled only, with a maximum of 250 
hooks.
    (iv) Declaration. For any such vessel that is not required to use 
VMS pursuant to Sec. 648.10(b)(4), to fish for GB cod south of the GOM 
Regulated Mesh Area, as defined at Sec. 648.80(a)(1), a vessel owner or 
operator must obtain, and retain on board, a letter of authorization 
from the Regional Administrator

[[Page 670]]

stating an intent to fish south of the GOM Regulated Mesh Area and may 
not fish in any other area for a minimum of 7 consecutive days from the 
effective date of the letter of authorization. For any such vessel that 
is required, or elects, to use VMS pursuant to Sec. 648.10(b)(4), to 
fish for GB cod south of the GOM Regulated Mesh Area, as defined at 
Sec. 648.80(a)(1), a vessel owner or operator must declare an intent to 
fish south of the GOM Regulated Mesh Area on each trip through the VMS 
prior to leaving port, in accordance with instructions provided by the 
Regional Administrator. Such vessels may transit the GOM Regulated Mesh 
Area, as defined at Sec. 648.80(a)(1), provided that their gear is 
stowed in accordance with the provisions at Sec. 648.23(b).
    (c) Used DAS baseline--(1) Calculation of used DAS baseline. For all 
valid limited access NE multispecies DAS vessels, vessels issued a valid 
small vessel category permit, and NE multispecies Confirmation of Permit 
Histories, beginning with the 2004 fishing year, a vessel's used DAS 
baseline shall be based on the fishing history associated with its 
permit and shall be determined by the highest number of reported DAS 
fished during a single qualifying fishing year, as specified in 
paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section, during the 6-year 
period from May 1, 1996, through April 30, 2002, not to exceed the 
vessel's annual allocation prior to August 1, 2002. A qualifying year is 
one in which a vessel landed 5,000 lb (2,268 kg) or more of regulated 
multispecies, based upon landings reported through dealer reports (based 
on live weights of landings submitted to NMFS prior to April 30, 2003). 
If a vessel that was originally issued a limited access NE multispecies 
permit was lawfully replaced in accordance with the replacement 
restrictions specified in Sec. 648.4(a), then the used DAS baseline 
shall be defined based upon the DAS used by the original vessel and by 
subsequent vessel(s) associated with the permit during the qualification 
period specified in this paragraph (c)(1). The used DAS baseline shall 
be used to calculate the number and category of DAS that are allocated 
for use in a given fishing year, as specified in paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (i) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) through (iv) of this 
section, the vessel's used DAS baseline shall be determined by 
calculating DAS use reported under the DAS notification requirements in 
Sec. 648.10.
    (ii) For a vessel exempt from, or not subject to, the DAS 
notification system specified in Sec. 648.10 during the period May 1996 
through June 1996, the vessel's used DAS baseline for that period will 
be determined by calculating DAS use from vessel trip reports submitted 
to NMFS prior to April 9, 2003.
    (iii) For a vessel enrolled in a Large Mesh DAS category, as 
specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the calculation of the 
vessel's used DAS baseline may not include any DAS allocated or used by 
the vessel pursuant to the provisions of the Large Mesh DAS category.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (d) DAS categories and allocations. For all valid limited access NE 
multispecies DAS permits, and NE multispecies Confirmation of Permit 
Histories, beginning with the 2004 fishing year, DAS shall be allocated 
and available for use for a given fishing year according to the 
following DAS Categories (unless otherwise specified, ``NE multispecies 
DAS'' refers to any authorized category of DAS):
    (1) Category A DAS. Calculation of Category A DAS for each fishing 
year is specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section. 
An additional 36 percent of Category A DAS will be added and available 
for use for participants in the Large Mesh Individual DAS permit 
category, as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, provided the 
participants comply with the applicable gear restrictions. Category A 
DAS may be used in the NE multispecies fishery to harvest and land 
stocks of regulated species or ocean pout, in accordance with all of the 
conditions and restrictions of this part.
    (i) For the 2004 and 2005 fishing years, Category A DAS are defined 
as 60 percent of the vessel's used DAS baseline specified under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

[[Page 671]]

    (ii) For the 2006 through 2008 fishing years, Category A DAS are 
defined as 55 percent of the vessel's used DAS baseline specified under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (iii) For fishing year 2009 (May 1, 2009, through April 30, 2010), 
Category A DAS are defined as 45 percent of the vessel's used DAS 
baseline specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (iv) Starting in fishing year 2010 (beginning May 1, 2010), Category 
A DAS are defined as follows:
    (A) For a vessel fishing under the provisions of the common pool, as 
defined in this part, Category A DAS are defined as 27.5 percent of the 
vessel's used DAS baseline specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, unless otherwise revised pursuant to paragraph (n)(1) of this 
section, or reduced pursuant to Sec. 648.87(b)(1)(iii).
    (B) For a sector vessel, Category A DAS allocated for use when 
fishing in other fisheries that require the concurrent use of a NE 
multispecies DAS are defined as 45 percent of the vessel's used DAS 
baseline specified in paragraph
    (2) Category B DAS. Category B DAS are divided into Regular B DAS 
and Reserve B DAS. Calculation of Category B DAS for each fishing year, 
and restrictions on use of Category B DAS, are specified in paragraphs 
(d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) Regular B DAS--(A) Restrictions on use. Regular B DAS can only 
be used by NE multispecies vessels in an approved SAP or in the Regular 
B DAS Program as specified in Sec. 648.85(b)(6). Unless otherwise 
restricted under the Regular B DAS Program as described in Sec. 
648.85(b)(6)(i), vessels may fish under both a Regular B DAS and a 
Reserve B DAS on the same trip (i.e., when fishing in an approved SAP as 
described in Sec. 648.85(b)). Vessels that are required by the Monkfish 
Fishery Management Plan to utilize a NE multispecies DAS, as specified 
under Sec. 648.92(b)(2), may not elect to use a NE multispecies 
Category B DAS to satisfy that requirement.
    (B) Calculation. Regular B DAS are calculated as follows:
    (1) For the 2004 and 2005 fishing years, Regular B DAS are defined 
as 20 percent of the vessel's DAS baseline specified under paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section.
    (2) For the 2006 through 2008 fishing years, Regular B DAS are 
defined as 22.5 percent of the vessel's DAS baseline specified under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (3) For fishing year 2009 (May 1, 2009, through April 30, 2010), 
Regular B DAS are defined as 27.5 percent of the vessel's used DAS 
baseline specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (4) Starting in fishing year 2010 (beginning May 1, 2010), Regular B 
DAS are defined as follows:
    (i) For a common pool vessel, Regular B DAS are defined as 36.25 
percent of the vessel's used DAS baseline specified in paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section, unless otherwise revised pursuant to paragraph (n)(1) 
of this section.
    (ii) For a sector vessel, Regular B DAS are defined as 27.5 percent 
of the vessel's used DAS baseline specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section.
    (ii) Reserve B DAS--(A) Restrictions on use. Reserve B DAS can only 
be used in an approved SAP, as specified in Sec. 648.85.
    (B) Calculation. Reserve B DAS are calculated as follows:
    (1) For the 2004 and 2005 fishing years, Reserve B DAS are defined 
as 20 percent of the vessel's DAS baseline specified under paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section.
    (2) For the 2006 through 2008 fishing years, Reserve B DAS are 
defined as 22.5 percent of the vessel's DAS baseline specified under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (3) For fishing year 2009 (May 1, 2009, through April 30, 2010), 
Reserve B DAS are defined as 27.5 percent of the vessel's used DAS 
baseline specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (4) Starting in fishing year 2010 (beginning May 1, 2010), Reserve B 
DAS are defined as follows:
    (i) For a common pool vessel, Reserve B DAS are defined as 36.25 
percent of the vessel's used DAS baseline specified in paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section, unless otherwise revised pursuant to paragraph (n)(1) 
of this section.
    (ii) For a sector vessel, Reserve B DAS are defined as 27.5 percent 
of the vessel's used DAS baseline specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section.

[[Page 672]]

    (3) Category C DAS--(i) Restriction on use. Category C DAS are 
reserved and may not be fished.
    (ii) Calculation. Category C DAS are defined as the difference 
between a vessel's used DAS baseline, as described in paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section, and the number of DAS allocated to the vessel as of May 
1, 2001.
    (e) Accrual of DAS. (1) When a vessel is participating in the NE 
multispecies DAS program, as required by the regulations in this part, 
NE multispecies DAS shall accrue as specified in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) 
and (ii) of this section and shall be based upon the time called, or 
logged into the DAS program, consistent with the DAS notification 
requirements specified in Sec. 648.10. For the purpose of calculating 
trip limits specified in this part, the amount of DAS deducted from a 
vessel's DAS allocation shall determine the amount of fish the vessel 
can land legally.
    (i) Common pool vessels. For a common pool vessel, Category A DAS 
shall accrue in 24-hr increments, unless otherwise required under 
paragraphs (n) or (o) of this section. For example, a vessel that fished 
from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. would be charged 24 hr of Category A DAS, not 16 
hr; a vessel that fished for 25 hr would be charged 48 hr of Category A 
instead of 25 hr.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (2) [Reserved]
    (3) Regular B DAS Program 24-hr clock. For a vessel electing to fish 
in the Regular B DAS Program, as specified at Sec. 648.85(b)(6), that 
remains fishing under a Regular B DAS for the entire fishing trip 
(without a DAS flip), DAS shall accrue at the rate of 1 full DAS for 
each calendar day, or part of a calendar day fished. For example, a 
vessel that fished on 1 calendar day from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. would be 
charged 24 hr of Regular B DAS, not 16 hr; a vessel that left on a trip 
at 11 p.m. on the first calendar day and returned at 10 p.m. on the 
second calendar day would be charged 48 hr of Regular B DAS instead of 
23 hr, because the fishing trip would have spanned 2 calendar days. For 
the purpose of calculating trip limits specified under Sec. 648.86, the 
amount of DAS deducted from a vessel's DAS allocation shall determine 
the amount of fish the vessel can land legally. For a vessel electing to 
fish in the Regular B DAS Program, as specified at Sec. 648.85(b)(6), 
while also fishing in an area subject to differential DAS counting 
pursuant to paragraph (n)(1)(i) of this section, Category B DAS shall 
accrue at the rate described in this paragraph (e)(3), unless the vessel 
flips to a Category A DAS, in which case the vessel is subject to the 
pertinent DAS accrual restrictions of paragraph (n)(1) of this section 
for the entire trip. For vessels electing to fish in both the Regular B 
DAS Program, as specified in Sec. 648.85(b)(8), and in the Eastern 
U.S./Canada Area, as specified in Sec. 648.85(a), DAS counting will 
begin and end according to the DAS rules specified in Sec. 
648.10(e)(5)(iv).
    (f) DAS credits--(1) Good Samaritan credit. A limited access vessel 
fishing under the DAS program and that spends time at sea assisting in a 
USCG search and rescue operation or assisting the USCG in towing a 
disabled vessel, and that can document the occurrence through the USCG, 
shall not accrue DAS for the time documented.
    (2) Canceled trip DAS credit. A limited access vessel operating 
under the DAS program and that ends a fishing trip prior to setting and/
or hauling fishing gear for any reason may request a cancelled trip DAS 
credit for the trip based on the following conditions and requirements:
    (i) There is no fish onboard the vessel and no fishing operations on 
the vessel were initiated, including setting and/or hauling fishing 
gear; and
    (ii) The owner or operator of the vessel fishing under a DAS program 
and required to use a VMS as specified under Sec. 648.10(b) makes an 
initial trip cancelation notification from sea, at the time the trip was 
canceled, or at the earliest opportunity prior to crossing the 
demarcation line as defined at Sec. 648.10(a). These reports are in the 
form of an email to NMFS Office of Law Enforcement and include at least 
the following information: Operator name; vessel name; vessel permit 
number; port where vessel will return; date trip started; estimated 
date/time of return to port; and a statement from the

[[Page 673]]

operator must that no fish were onboard and no fishing activity 
occurred; and
    (iii) The owner or operator of the vessel operating under the DAS 
program required to use the IVR call in as specified under Sec. 
648.10(h) makes an initial trip cancelation notification to NMFS by 
calling the IVR back at the time the trip was canceled, or at the 
earliest opportunity prior to returning to port. This request must 
include at least the following information: Operator name; vessel name; 
vessel permit number; port where vessel will return; date trip started; 
estimated date/time of return to port; and a statement from the operator 
that no fish were onboard and no fishing activity occurred; and
    (iv) The owner or operator of the vessel requesting a canceled trip 
DAS credit, in addition to the requirements in paragraphs (f)(2)(ii) and 
(iii) of this section, submits a written DAS credit request form to NMFS 
within 30 days of the vessel's return to port from the canceled trip. 
This application must include at least the following information: Date 
and time when the vessel canceled the fishing trip; date and time of 
trip departure and landing; operator name; owner/corporation name; 
permit number; hull identification number; vessel name; date and time 
notification requirements specified under paragraphs (f)(2)(ii) and 
(iii) of this section were made; reason for canceling the trip; and 
owner/operator signature and date; and
    (v) The vessel trip report for the canceled trip as required under 
Sec. 648.7(b) is submitted along with the DAS credit request form; and
    (vi) For DAS credits that are requested near the end of the fishing 
year as defined at Sec. 648.2, and approved by the Regional 
Administrator, the credited DAS apply to the fishing year in which the 
canceled trip occurred. Credited DAS that remain unused at the end of 
the fishing year or are not credited until the following fishing year 
may be carried over into the next fishing year, not to exceed the 
maximum number of carryover DAS as specified under paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section.
    (3) DAS credit for standing by entangled whales. A limited access 
vessel fishing under the DAS program that reports and stands by an 
entangled whale may request a DAS credit for the time spent standing by 
the whale. The following conditions and requirements must be met to 
receive this credit:
    (i) At the time the vessel begins standing by the entangled whale, 
the vessel operator must notify the USCG and the Center for Coastal 
Studies, or another organization authorized by the Regional 
Administrator, of the location of the entangled whale and that the 
vessel is going to stand by the entangled whale until the arrival of an 
authorized response team;
    (ii) Only one vessel at a time may receive credit for standing by an 
entangled whale. A vessel standing by an entangled whale may transfer 
its stand-by status to another vessel while waiting for an authorized 
response team to arrive, provided it notifies the USCG and the Center 
for Coastal Studies, or another organization authorized by the Regional 
Administrator, of the transfer. The vessel to which stand-by status is 
transferred must also notify the USCG and the Center for Coastal Studies 
or another organization authorized by the Regional Administrator of this 
transfer and comply with the conditions and restrictions of this part;
    (iii) The stand-by vessel must be available to answer questions on 
the condition of the animal, possible species identification, severity 
of entanglement, etc., and take photographs of the whale, if possible, 
regardless of the species of whale or whether the whale is alive or 
dead, during its stand-by status and after terminating its stand-by 
status. The stand-by vessel must remain on scene until the USCG or an 
authorized response team arrives, or the vessel is informed that an 
authorized response team will not arrive. If the vessel receives notice 
that a response team is not available, the vessel may discontinue 
standing-by the entangled whale and continue fishing operations; and
    (iv) To receive credit for standing by an entangled whale, a vessel 
must submit a written request to the Regional Administrator. This 
request must include at least the following information: Date and time 
when the vessel began its stand-by status; date of first communication 
with the USCG; and

[[Page 674]]

date and time when the vessel terminated its stand-by status. DAS credit 
shall not be granted for the time a vessel fishes when standing by an 
entangled whale. Upon a review of the request, NMFS shall consider 
granting the DAS credit based on information available at the time of 
the request, regardless of whether an authorized response team arrives 
on scene or a rescue is attempted. NMFS shall notify the permit holder 
of any DAS adjustment that is made or explain the reasons why an 
adjustment will not be made.
    (g) Spawning season restrictions. A vessel issued a valid Small 
Vessel or Handgear A category permit specified in paragraphs (b)(5) or 
(b)(6) of this section, respectively, or a vessel issued an open access 
Handgear B permit, as specified in Sec. 648.88(a), may not fish for, 
possess, or land regulated species or ocean pout from March 1 through 
March 20 of each year. A common pool vessel must declare out and be out 
of the NE multispecies DAS program, and a sector must declare that the 
vessel will not fish with gear capable of catching NE multispecies 
(i.e., gear that is not defined as exempted gear under this part), for a 
20-day period between March 1 and May 31 of each calendar year, using 
the notification requirements specified in Sec. 648.10. A vessel 
fishing under a Day gillnet category designation is prohibited from 
fishing with gillnet gear capable of catching NE multispecies during its 
declared 20-day spawning block, unless the vessel is fishing in an 
exempted fishery, as described in Sec. 648.80. If a vessel owner has 
not declared and been out of the fishery for a 20-day period between 
March 1 and May 31 of each calendar year on or before May 12 of each 
year, the vessel is prohibited from fishing for, possessing or landing 
any regulated species, ocean pout, or non-exempt species during the 
period May 12 through May 31, inclusive.
    (h) Declaring DAS and blocks of time out. A vessel's owner or 
authorized representative shall notify the Regional Administrator of a 
vessel's participation in the DAS program; declaration of its 120 days 
out of the non-exempt gillnet fishery, if designated as a Day gillnet 
category vessel, as specified in paragraph (j) of this section; and 
declaration of its 20-day period out of the NE multispecies DAS program, 
or, for a sector vessel that the vessel will not fish with gear capable 
of catching NE multispecies, using the notification requirements 
specified in Sec. 648.10.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) Gillnet restrictions. A vessel issued a limited access NE 
multispecies permit may fish under a NE multispecies DAS, under the 
provisions of the small vessel permit category, or on a sector trip with 
gillnet gear, provided the owner of the vessel obtains an annual 
designation as either a Day or Trip gillnet vessel, as described in 
Sec. 648.4(c)(2)(iii), and provided the vessel complies with the 
gillnet vessel gear requirements and restrictions specified in Sec. 
648.80.
    (1) Day gillnet vessels. Unless otherwise exempted in this part, a 
Day gillnet vessel fishing with gillnet gear under a NE multispecies 
DAS, the provisions of a small vessel permit category, or on a sector 
trip is not required to remove gear from the water upon returning to the 
dock and calling out of the DAS program, as appropriate, provided the 
vessel complies with the restrictions specified in paragraphs (j)(1)(i) 
through (iii) of this section. Vessels electing to fish under the Day 
gillnet designation must have on board written confirmation, issued by 
the Regional Administrator, that the vessel is a Day gillnet vessel.
    (i) Removal of gear. All gillnet gear must be brought to port prior 
to the vessel fishing in an exempted fishery.
    (ii) Declaration of time out of the gillnet fishery. (A) During each 
fishing year, a Day gillnet vessel must declare, and take, a total of 
120 days out of the non-exempt gillnet fishery. Each period of time 
declared and taken must be a minimum of 7 consecutive days. At least 21 
days of this time must be taken between June 1 and September 30 of each 
fishing year. The spawning season time out period required by paragraph 
(g) of this section shall be credited toward the 120 days time out of 
the non-exempt gillnet fishery. If a vessel owner has not declared and 
taken any or all of the remaining periods of time required to be out of 
the fishery by the last possible date to

[[Page 675]]

meet these requirements, the vessel is prohibited from fishing for, 
possessing, or landing regulated multispecies, ocean pout, or non-exempt 
species harvested with gillnet gear and from having gillnet gear on 
board the vessel that is not stowed in accordance with Sec. 648.23(b) 
while fishing under a NE multispecies DAS, the provisions of the small 
vessel category permit, or on a sector trip from that date through the 
end of the period between June 1 and September 30, or through the end of 
the fishing year, as applicable, unless otherwise exempt pursuant to 
Sec. 648.87.
    (B) Any such vessel shall declare its required time periods through 
the notification procedures specified in Sec. 648.10(j)(2).
    (C) During each period of time declared out, any such vessel is 
prohibited from fishing with non-exempted gillnet gear and must remove 
such gear from the water. However, the vessel may fish in an exempted 
fishery, as described in Sec. 648.80, or it may fish under a NE 
multispecies DAS, under the provisions of the small vessel category 
permit, or on a sector trip, provided it fishes with gear other than 
non-exempted gillnet gear.
    (iii) Method of counting DAS. A Day gillnet vessel fishing with 
gillnet gear under a NE multispecies DAS shall accrue DAS as follows:
    (A) A Day gillnet vessel fishing with gillnet gear that has elected 
to fish in the Regular B DAS Program, as specified in Sec. 
648.85(b)(6), under a Category B DAS, is subject to the DAS accrual 
provisions of paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.
    (B) A Day gillnet vessel fishing with gillnet gear under a NE 
multispecies Category A DAS shall accrue DAS as follows:
    (1) A Day gillnet vessel on a common pool trip is subject to the DAS 
accrual provisions of paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.
    (2) A Day gillnet vessel on a sector trip is subject to the DAS 
accrual provisions of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (2) Trip gillnet vessels. When fishing under a NE multispecies DAS, 
under the provisions of the small vessel category permit, or on a sector 
trip, a Trip gillnet vessel is required to remove all gillnet gear from 
the water before returning to port upon the completion of a fishing trip 
and calling out of a NE multispecies DAS, as applicable, under Sec. 
648.10(e)(5) or (h)(5), respectively. When not fishing under a NE 
multispecies DAS, Trip gillnet vessels may fish in an exempted fishery 
with gillnet gear, as authorized by Sec. 648.80. Vessels electing to 
fish under the Trip gillnet designation must have on board written 
confirmation issued by the Regional Administrator that the vessel is a 
Trip gillnet vessel.
    (k) NE Multispecies DAS Leasing Program--(1) Program description. 
Eligible vessels, as specified in paragraph (k)(2) of this section, may 
lease Category A DAS to and from other eligible vessels, in accordance 
with the restrictions and conditions of this section. The Regional 
Administrator has final approval authority for all NE multispecies DAS 
leasing requests.
    (2) Eligible vessels. (i) A vessel issued a valid limited access NE 
multispecies permit is eligible to lease Category A DAS to or from 
another such vessel, subject to the conditions and requirements of this 
part, unless the vessel was issued a valid Small Vessel or Handgear A 
permit specified under paragraphs (b)(5) and (6) of this section, 
respectively, or is a valid participant in an approved Sector, as 
described in Sec. 648.87(a). Any NE multispecies vessel that does not 
require use of DAS to fish for regulated multispecies may not lease any 
NE multispecies DAS.
    (ii) Subject to the conditions and requirements of this part, DAS 
associated with a confirmation of permit history may be leased to 
another vessel without placing the permit on an active vessel.
    (3) Application to lease NE multispecies DAS--(i) Application 
information requirements. An application to lease Category A DAS must 
contain the following information: Lessor's owner name, vessel name, 
permit number and official number or state registration number; Lessee's 
owner name, vessel name, permit number and official number or state 
registration number; number of NE multispecies DAS to be leased; total 
priced paid for leased DAS; signatures of Lessor and Lessee; and date 
form was completed. Information obtained

[[Page 676]]

from the lease application will be held confidential, according to 
applicable Federal law. Aggregate data may be used in the analysis of 
the DAS Leasing Program.
    (ii) Approval of lease application. Unless an application to lease 
Category A DAS is denied according to paragraph (k)(3)(iii) of this 
section, the Regional Administrator shall issue confirmation of 
application approval to both Lessor and Lessee within 45 days of receipt 
of an application.
    (iii) Denial of lease application. The Regional Administrator may 
deny an application to lease Category A DAS for any of the following 
reasons, including, but not limited to: The application is incomplete or 
submitted past the March 1 deadline; the Lessor or Lessee has not been 
issued a valid limited access NE multispecies permit or is otherwise not 
eligible; the Lessor's or Lessee's DAS are under sanction pursuant to an 
enforcement proceeding; the Lessor's or Lessee's vessel is prohibited 
from fishing; the Lessor's or Lessee's limited access NE multispecies 
permit is sanctioned pursuant to an enforcement proceeding; the Lessor 
or Lessee vessel is determined not in compliance with the conditions, 
restrictions, and requirements of this part; or the Lessor has an 
insufficient number of allocated or unused DAS available to lease. Upon 
denial of an application to lease NE multispecies DAS, the Regional 
Administrator shall send a letter to the applicants describing the 
reason(s) for application rejection. The decision by the Regional 
Administrator is the final agency decision.
    (4) Conditions and restrictions on leased DAS--(i) Confirmation of 
permit history. Pursuant to paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of this section, DAS 
associated with a confirmation of permit history may be leased.
    (ii) Sub-leasing. In a fishing year, a Lessor or Lessee vessel may 
not sub-lease DAS that have already been leased to another vessel. Any 
portion of a vessel's DAS may not be leased more than one time during a 
fishing year.
    (iii) Carry-over of leased DAS. Leased DAS that remain unused at the 
end of the fishing year may not be carried over to the subsequent 
fishing year by the Lessor or Lessee vessel.
    (iv) [Reserved]
    (v) History of leased DAS use. The history of leased DAS use shall 
be presumed to remain with the Lessor vessel. In the case of multiple 
leases to one vessel, the history of leased DAS use shall be presumed to 
remain with the Lessor in the order in which such leases were approved 
by NMFS. For the purpose of accounting for leased DAS use, leased DAS 
will be accounted for (subtracted from available DAS) prior to allocated 
DAS.
    (vi) Monkfish Category C, D, F, G and H vessels. A vessel that 
possesses a valid limited access NE multispecies DAS permit and a valid 
limited access monkfish Category C, D, F, G, or H permit and leases NE 
multispecies DAS to or from another vessel is subject to the 
restrictions specified in Sec. 648.92(b)(2).
    (vii) DAS Category restriction. A vessel may lease only Category A 
DAS, as described under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (viii) Duration of lease. A vessel leasing DAS may only fish those 
leased DAS during the fishing year in which they were leased.
    (ix) Size restriction of Lessee vessel. A Lessor vessel only may 
lease DAS to a Lessee vessel with a baseline main engine horsepower 
rating that is no more than 20 percent greater than the baseline engine 
horsepower of the Lessor vessel. A Lessor vessel may only lease DAS to a 
Lessee vessel with a baseline length overall that is no more than 10 
percent greater than the baseline length overall of the Lessor vessel. 
For the purposes of this program, the baseline horsepower and length 
overall specifications of vessels are those associated with the permit 
as of January 29, 2004, unless otherwise modified according to paragraph 
(k)(4)(xi) of this section.
    (x) Leasing by vessels fishing under a sector allocation. A sector 
vessel may not lease DAS to or from common pool vessels, but may lease 
DAS to or from another sector vessel during the fishing year in which 
the vessel is a member of a sector.
    (xi) One-time downgrade of DAS Leasing Program baseline. Unless 
otherwise specified in paragraph (k)(4)(xi)(B) and

[[Page 677]]

(C) of this section, for the purposes of determining eligibility for 
leasing DAS only, a vessel owner may elect to make a one-time downgrade 
to the vessel's DAS Leasing Program baseline length and horsepower as 
specified in paragraph (k)(4)(ix) of this section to match the length 
overall and horsepower specifications of the vessel that is currently 
issued the permit.
    (A) Application for a one-time DAS Leasing Program baseline 
downgrade. To downgrade the DAS Leasing Program baseline, eligible NE 
multispecies vessels must submit a completed application form obtained 
from the Regional Administrator. An application to downgrade a vessel's 
DAS Leasing Program baseline must contain at least the following 
information: Vessel owner's name, vessel name, permit number, official 
number or state registration number, current vessel length overall and 
horsepower specifications, an indication whether additional information 
is included to document the vessel's current specifications, and the 
signature of the vessel owner.
    (B) Applicability of the one-time DAS Leasing Program baseline 
downgrade. The downgraded DAS Leasing Program baseline may only be used 
to determine eligibility for the DAS Leasing Program and does not affect 
or change the baseline associated with the DAS Transfer Program 
specified in paragraph (l)(1)(ii) of this section, or the vessel 
replacement or upgrade restrictions specified at Sec. 648.4(a)(1)(i)(E) 
and (F), or any other provision.
    (C) Duration of the one-time DAS Leasing Program baseline downgrade. 
Unless otherwise specified in this paragraph (k)(4)(xi)(C) of this 
section, the downgraded DAS Leasing Program baseline remains in effect 
until the DAS Leasing Program expires or the permit is transferred to 
another vessel via a vessel replacement, or through a DAS transfer. With 
the exception of vessels combining DAS Leasing Program baselines from 
two different vessels through the DAS Transfer Program as outlined in 
paragraph (k)(4)(xi)(C)(2) of this section, once the DAS Leasing Program 
baseline is downgraded for a particular permit, no further downgrades 
may be authorized for that permit.
    (1) Vessel replacement. If the permit is transferred to another 
vessel via a vessel replacement, the DAS Leasing Program baseline 
reverts to the baseline horsepower and length overall specifications 
associated with the permit prior to the one-time downgrade.
    (2) DAS Transfer Program. For vessels involved in a DAS Transfer 
Program transaction as described in paragraph (l) of this section, if 
the transferee vessel baseline is adopted, consistent with the 
regulations under paragraph (l)(1)(ii) of this section, and the DAS 
Leasing Program baseline of the transferee vessel was previously 
downgraded, consistent with the regulations under this paragraph 
(k)(4)(xi), the downgraded DAS Leasing Program baseline specifications 
remain valid. For vessels involved in a DAS Transfer Program transaction 
where a combination of the transferor and transferee vessel baselines is 
adopted resulting in a new vessel baseline, any previous DAS Leasing 
Program baseline downgrade for either the transferor or transferee 
vessel will be voided and the transferee vessel would have an additional 
opportunity to downgrade its combined DAS Leasing Program baseline.
    (l) DAS Transfer Program. Except for vessels fishing under a sector 
allocation as specified in Sec. 648.87, or a vessel that acted as a 
lessee or lessor in the DAS Leasing Program transaction, a vessel issued 
a valid limited access NE multispecies permit may transfer all of its NE 
multispecies DAS for an indefinite time to another vessel with a valid 
NE multispecies permit, in accordance with the conditions and 
restrictions described under this section. The Regional Administrator 
has final approval authority for all NE multispecies DAS transfer 
requests.
    (1) DAS transfer conditions and restrictions. (i) The transferor 
vessel must transfer all of its DAS. Upon approval of the DAS transfer, 
all history associated with the transferred NE multispecies DAS 
(moratorium right history, DAS use history, and catch history) shall be 
associated with the permit rights of the transferee. Neither the 
individual permit history elements, nor

[[Page 678]]

total history associated with the transferred DAS may be retained by the 
transferor.
    (ii) NE multispecies DAS may be transferred only to a vessel with a 
baseline main engine horsepower rating that is no more than 20 percent 
greater than the baseline engine horsepower of the transferor vessel. NE 
multispecies DAS may be transferred only to a vessel with a baseline 
length overall that is no more than 10 percent greater than the baseline 
length overall of the transferor vessel. For the purposes of this 
program, the baseline horsepower and length overall are those associated 
with the permit as of January 29, 2004. Upon approval of the transfer, 
the baseline of the transferee vessel would be the smaller baseline of 
the two vessels or, if the transferee vessel had not previously upgraded 
either its size (including LOA, GRT, and NT) or HP under the vessel 
replacement rules, the vessel owner could choose to adopt the larger 
baseline of the two vessels, which would constitute the vessel's one-
time upgrade, provided such an upgrade is consistent with provisions of 
this paragraph (l)(1)(ii). A subsequent upgrade to another specification 
through a subsequent action (either a vessel replacement or DAS 
transfer) is not permissible. A vessel that has executed a one-time 
downgrade of a DAS Leasing Program baseline in accordance with paragraph 
(k)(4)(xi) is subject to the restrictions of paragraph (k)(4)(xi)(C) of 
this section.
    (iii) The transferor vessel must transfer all of its Federal limited 
access permits for which it is eligible to the transferee vessel in 
accordance with the vessel replacement restrictions under Sec. 648.4, 
or permanently cancel such permits. When duplicate permits exist, i.e, 
those permits for which both the transferor and transferee vessel are 
eligible, one of the duplicate permits must be permanently cancelled.
    (iv) [Reserved]
    (v) In any particular fishing year, a vessel may not execute a DAS 
transfer as a transferor if it previously participated in the DAS 
Leasing Program as either a lessee or a lessor, as described under 
paragraph (k) of this section. A vessel may participate in DAS lease 
transaction (as a lessee or a lessor) and submit an application for a 
DAS transfer (as a transferor) during the same fishing year, but the 
transfer, if approved, would not be effective until the beginning of the 
following fishing year. Other combinations of activities under the DAS 
Leasing and DAS Transfer programs are permissible during the same 
fishing year (i.e., act as a transferee, or act as transferor and 
subsequently conduct a DAS lease).
    (vi) Confirmation of permit history. NE multispecies DAS associated 
with a Confirmation of Permit History may be transferred.
    (vii) Transfer by sector vessels. A sector vessel may not transfer 
DAS to or from vessels that are fishing under the provisions of the 
common pool or another sector, but may transfer DAS to or from another 
vessel participating in that vessel's sector during the fishing year in 
which the vessel is a member of a particular sector.
    (viii) Unless otherwise restricted by this part, a vessel with a NE 
multispecies limited access Category D permit may transfer DAS only to a 
vessel with a NE multispecies limited access Category D permit, but may 
receive transferred DAS from any eligible NE multispecies vessel.
    (2) Application to transfer DAS. Owners of the vessels applying to 
transfer and receive DAS must submit a completed application form 
obtained from the Regional Administrator. The application must be signed 
by both seller/transferor and buyer/transferee of the DAS, and submitted 
to the Regional Office at least 45 days before the date on which the 
applicant desires to have the DAS effective on the buying vessel. The 
Regional Administrator will notify the applicants of any deficiency in 
the application pursuant to this section. Applications may be submitted 
at any time during the fishing year, up until March 1.
    (i) Application information requirements. An application to transfer 
NE multispecies DAS must contain the following information: Seller's/
transferor's name, vessel name, permit number and official number or 
state registration number; buyer's/transferee's name, vessel name, 
permit number and official number or state registration

[[Page 679]]

number; total price paid for purchased DAS; signatures of seller and 
buyer; and date the form was completed. Information obtained from the 
transfer application will be held confidential, and will be used only in 
summarized form for management of the fishery.
    (ii) Approval of transfer application. Unless an application to 
transfer NE multispecies DAS is denied according to paragraph 
(l)(2)(iii) of this section, the Regional Administrator shall issue 
confirmation of application approval to both seller/transferor and 
buyer/transferee within 45 days of receipt of an application.
    (iii) Denial of transfer application. The Regional Administrator may 
reject an application to transfer NE multispecies DAS for the following 
reasons: The application is incomplete or submitted past the March 1 
deadline; the seller/transferor or buyer/transferee does not possess a 
valid limited access NE multispecies permit; the seller's/transferor's 
or buyer's/transferee's DAS is sanctioned, pursuant to an enforcement 
proceeding; the seller's/transferor's or buyer/transferee's vessel is 
prohibited from fishing; the seller's/transferor's or buyer's/
transferee's limited access NE multispecies permit is sanctioned 
pursuant to enforcement proceedings; or the seller/transferor has a DAS 
baseline of zero. Upon denial of an application to transfer NE 
multispecies DAS, the Regional Administrator shall send a letter to the 
applicants describing the reason(s) for application rejection. The 
decision by the Regional Administrator is the final agency decision and 
there is no opportunity to appeal the Regional Administrator's decision.
    (m) [Reserved]
    (n) NE multispecies common pool accountability measure (AM). Common 
pool vessels are subject to the following AMs, in addition to the DAS 
accrual provisions specified in paragraph (e) of this section and other 
measures specified in this part.
    (1) Differential DAS counting AM for fishing years 2010 and 2011. 
Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Sec. 648.90(a)(5), based upon 
catch and other information available to NMFS by February of each year, 
the Regional Administrator shall project the catch of regulated species 
or ocean pout by common pool vessels for the fishing year ending on 
April 30 to determine whether such catch will exceed any of the sub-ACLs 
specified for common pool vessels pursuant to Sec. 648.90(a)(4)(iii). 
This initial projection of common pool catch shall be updated shortly 
after the end of each fishing year once information becomes available 
regarding the catch of regulated species and ocean pout by vessels 
fishing for groundfish in state waters outside of the FMP, vessels 
fishing in exempted fisheries, and vessels fishing in the Atlantic sea 
scallop fishery; and the catch of Atlantic halibut, SNE/MA winter 
flounder, ocean pout, windowpane flounder, and Atlantic wolffish by 
sector vessels to determine if excessive catch by such vessels resulted 
in the overall ACL for a particular stock to be exceeded. If such catch 
resulted in the overall ACL for a particular stock being exceeded, the 
common pool's catch of that stock shall be increased by an amount equal 
to the amount of the overage of the overall ACL for that stock 
multiplied by the common pool's share of the overall ACL for that stock 
calculated pursuant to Sec. 648.90(a)(4)(iii)(E)(2). For example, if 
the 2010 overall ACL for GOM cod was exceeded by 10,000 lb (4,536 kg) 
due to excessive catch of that stock by vessels fishing in state waters 
outside the FMP, and the common pool's share of the 2010 overall GOM cod 
ACL was 5 percent, then the common pool's 2010 catch of GOM cod shall be 
increased by 500 lb (226.8 kg) (10,000 lb (4,536 kg) x 0.05 of the 
overall GOM cod ACL). If based on the initial projection completed in 
February, the Regional Administrator projects that any of the sub-ACLs 
specified for common pool vessels will be exceeded or underharvested, 
the Regional Administrator shall implement a differential DAS counting 
factor to all Category A DAS used within the stock area in which the 
sub-ACL was exceeded or underharvested, as specified in paragraph 
(n)(1)(i) of this section, during the following fishing year, in a 
manner consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act. Any 
differential DAS counting implemented at the start of the fishing year 
will be reevaluated and recalculated, if necessary, once updated

[[Page 680]]

information is obtained. The differential DAS counting factor shall be 
based upon the projected proportion of the sub-ACL of each NE 
multispecies stock caught by common pool vessels, rounded to the nearest 
even tenth, as specified in paragraph (n)(1)(ii) of this section, unless 
otherwise specified pursuant to Sec. 648.90(a)(5). For example, if the 
Regional Administrator projects that common pool vessels will catch 1.18 
times the sub-ACL for GOM cod during fishing year 2010, the Regional 
Administrator shall implement a differential DAS counting factor of 1.2 
to all Category A DAS used by common pool vessels only within the 
Inshore GOM Differential DAS Area during fishing year 2011 (i.e., 
Category A DAS will be charged at a rate of 28.8 hr for every 24 hr 
fished--1.2 times 24-hr DAS counting). If it is projected that catch in 
a particular fishing year will exceed or underharvest the sub-ACLs for 
several regulated species stocks within a particular stock area, 
including both exceeding and underharvesting several sub-ACLs within a 
particular stock area, the Regional Administrator shall implement the 
most restrictive differential DAS counting factor derived from paragraph 
(n)(1)(ii) of this section for the sub-ACLs exceeded or underharvested 
to any Category A DAS used by common pool vessels within that particular 
stock area. For example, if it is projected that common pool vessels 
will be responsible for 1.2 times the GOM cod sub-ACL and 1.1 times the 
CC/GOM yellowtail flounder sub-ACL, the Regional Administrator shall 
implement a differential DAS counting factor of 1.2 to any Category A 
DAS fished by common pool vessels only within the Inshore GOM 
Differential DAS Area during the following fishing year. For any 
differential DAS counting factor implemented in fishing year 2011, the 
differential DAS counting factor shall be applied against the DAS 
accrual provisions specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section for 
the time spent fishing in the applicable differential DAS counting area 
based upon the first VMS position into the applicable differential DAS 
counting area and the first VMS position outside of the applicable 
differential DAS counting area, pursuant to Sec. 648.10. For example, 
if a vessel fished 12 hr inside a differential DAS counting area where a 
differential DAS counting factor of 1.2 would be applied, and 12 hr 
outside of the differential DAS counting area, the vessel would be 
charged 48 hr of DAS use because DAS would be charged in 24-hr 
increments ((12 hr inside the area x 1.2 = 14.4 hr) + 12 hr outside the 
area, rounded up to the next 24-hr increment to determine DAS charged). 
For any differential DAS counting factor implemented in fishing year 
2012, the differential DAS counting factor shall be applied against the 
DAS accrual provisions in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, or if a 
differential DAS counting factor was implemented for that stock area 
during fishing year 2011, against the DAS accrual rate applied in 
fishing year 2011. For example, if a differential DAS counting factor of 
1.2 was applied to the Inshore GOM Differential DAS Area during fishing 
year 2011 due to a 20-percent overage of the GOM cod sub-ACL, yet the 
GOM cod sub-ACL was exceeded again, but by 50 percent during fishing 
year 2011, an additional differential DAS factor of 1.5 would be applied 
to the DAS accrual rate applied during fishing year 2012 (i.e., the DAS 
accrual rate in the Inshore GOM Differential DAS Counting Area during 
fishing year 2012 would be 43.2 hr charged for every 24-hr fished--1.2 x 
1.5 x 24-hr DAS charge). If the Regional Administrator determines that 
similar DAS adjustments are necessary in all stock areas, the Regional 
Administrator will adjust the ratio of Category A:Category B DAS

    (B) Trimester TAC adjustment. The distribution of trimester TACs 
specified in paragraph (n)(2)(i)(A) of this section may be adjusted 
pursuant to the biennial adjustment process specified in Sec. 648.90. 
Future adjustments to the distribution of trimester TACs shall use catch 
data for the most recent 5-year period prior to the reevaluation of 
trimester TACs.
    (ii) Stock area closures. If the Regional Administrator projects 
that 90 percent of the trimester TACs specified in paragraph (n)(2)(i) 
of this section will be caught based upon available information, the 
Regional Administrator shall close the area where 90 percent of the 
catch for each such stock occurred, according to available VTR data and 
other information, to all common pool vessels using gear capable of 
catching such stocks for the remainder of that trimester, as specified 
in paragraphs (n)(2)(ii)(A) through (N) of this section, in a manner 
consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act. For example, if the 
Regional Administrator projects that 90 percent of the CC/GOM yellowtail 
flounder Trimester 1 TAC will be caught, common pool vessels using trawl 
and gillnet gear shall be prohibited from fishing in the CC/GOM 
Yellowtail Flounder Closure Area specified in paragraph (n)(2)(ii)(G) of 
this section until the beginning of Trimester 2 on September 1 of that 
fishing year. Based upon all available information, the Regional 
Administrator is authorized to expand or narrow the areas closed under 
this paragraph (n)(2)(ii) in a manner consistent with the Administrative 
Procedure Act. If it is not possible to identify an area where only 90 
percent of the catch occurred, the Regional Administrator shall close 
the smallest area possible where greater than 90 percent of the catch 
occurred.
    (A) GB Cod Trimester TAC Area. For the purposes of the trimester TAC 
AM closure specified in paragraph (n)(2)(ii) of this section, the GB Cod 
Trimester TAC Area shall apply to common pool vessels using trawl gear,

carried forward into the next trimester. Uncaught portions of any 
trimester TAC following Trimester 3 may not be carried over into the 
following fishing year. If any trimester TAC is exceeded during the 
Trimesters 1 or 2, the overage shall be deducted from the Trimester 3 
TAC for that stock. If the entire sub-ACL for a particular stock that is 
allocated to the common pool is exceeded (i.e., the common pool catch of 
that stock at the end of the fishing year, including the common pool's 
share of any overage of the overall ACL for a particular stock caused by 
excessive catch by other sub-components of the fishery pursuant to Sec. 
648.90(a)(5), exceeds all three trimester TACs for that stock combined), 
an amount equal to the overage shall be deducted from the sub-ACL for 
that stock that is allocated to common pool vessels pursuant to Sec. 
648.90(a)(4) for the following fishing year.
    (iv) Monitoring requirements. Except as specified in paragraph 
(n)(2)(iv)(C), starting in fishing year 2012 (May 1, 2012), landings of 
regulated species or ocean pout by common pool vessels shall be 
monitored at the point of offload by independent, third-party service 
providers approved to provide such services by NMFS, as specified in 
paragraphs (n)(2)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section. Unless otherwise 
instructed by NMFS, these service providers shall deploy dockside 
monitors to monitor the offload of catch directly to a dealer, and 
roving monitors to monitor the offload of catch onto a truck for 
subsequent shipment to a dealer. For fishing year 2012 only, common pool 
vessels must comply with any dockside/roving monitoring program 
specified by NMFS pursuant to Sec. 648.87(b)(1)(v)(B)(1). None of the 
costs associated with dockside/roving monitors during fishing year 2012 
shall be paid by the owner or operator of a vessel subject to these 
requirements. Starting in fishing year 2013 and thereafter, the costs 
associated with monitoring vessel offloads shall be the responsibility 
of individual vessels, unless otherwise instructed by NMFS. An 
individual vessel owner or operator may only use one dockside/roving 
monitoring service provider per fishing year beginning in fishing year 
2013, and must contract for such services with a service provider 
approved by NMFS pursuant to Sec. 648.87(b)(4), as instructed by the 
Regional Administrator. Both common pool vessels and service providers 
providing offloading monitoring services will be subject to the 
requirements specified in Sec. 648.87(b)(5).
    (A) Coverage levels. For fishing year 2012, dockside/roving 
monitoring coverage levels shall be determined by NMFS based on 
available funding. If NMFS does not require 100-percent coverage of all 
common pool trips, NMFS shall first provide dockside/roving monitoring 
for trips that are not also assigned an observer or at-sea monitor 
pursuant to Sec. 648.11. Starting in fishing year 2013, at least 20 
percent of the trips taken by vessels operating under the provisions of 
the common pool shall be monitored. To ensure that these levels of 
coverage are achieved, if a trip has been selected to be observed by a 
dockside/roving monitor, all offloading events associated with that trip 
must be monitored by a dockside/roving monitor, as specified in 
paragraph (n)(2) of this section, and a vessel may not offload any of 
its catch until the dockside/roving monitor arrives. For example, a 
vessel offloading at more than one dealer or facility must have a 
dockside/roving monitor present during offload at each location. All 
landing events at remote ports that are selected to be observed by a 
dockside/roving monitor must have a roving monitor present to witness 
offload activities to the truck, as well as a dockside monitor present 
at each dealer to certify weigh-out of all landings. Except as provided 
in this paragraph

[[Page 688]]

(n)(2)(iv)(A) or paragraph (n)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, or as 
instructed by the Regional Administrator, any service provider providing 
dockside/monitoring services required under this paragraph (n)(2)(iv) 
must ensure that coverage is randomly distributed among all such trips, 
and that the landing events monitored are representative of fishing 
operations by common pool vessels throughout the fishing year.
    (B) Dockside/roving monitor service provider standards. Starting in 
fishing year 2013, a common pool vessel must employ a service provider 
approved by NMFS to provide dockside/roving monitor services, as 
identified by the Regional Administrator. To be approved to provide the 
services specified in paragraph (n)(2) of this section, dockside/roving 
monitor service providers must meet the standards in Sec. 648.87(b)(4).
    (C) Exemption. Common pool vessels operating under the provisions of 
either a limited access Northeast multispecies Small Vessel Category 
permit or Handgear A permit, as specified at Sec. Sec. 648.82(b)(5) and 
(6), respectively, or an open access Northeast multispecies Handgear B 
permit, as specified at Sec. 648.88(a), are exempt from the dockside/
roving monitoring requirements specified in this paragraph (n)(2)(iv).
    (v) Adjustments to trimester TACs. The distribution of trimester 
TACs specified in paragraph (n)(2)(i) of this section may be revised 
pursuant to the biennial adjustment or framework process specified in 
Sec. 648.90(a)(2) and shall use the distribution of landings of the 
most recent 5-year period available.
    (vi) Trip limit adjustment. When 60 percent of the northern or 
southern windowpane flounder, ocean pout, or Atlantic halibut sub-ACLs 
specified for common pool vessels pursuant to Sec. 
648.90(a)(4)(iii)(E)(2) is projected to be caught, the Regional 
Administrator may specify a possession limit for these stocks that is 
calculated to prevent the yearly sub-ACL from being exceeded prior to 
the end of the fishing year.
    (o) Inseason adjustment to differential DAS counting for NE 
multispecies common pool vessels. (1) In addition to the DAS accrual 
provisions specified in paragraphs (e) and (n) of this section, and 
other measures specified in this part, common pool vessels are subject 
to the following restrictions: The Regional Administrator shall project 
the catch of regulated species or ocean pout by common pool vessels and 
shall determine whether such catch will exceed any of the sub-ACLs 
specified for common pool vessels as described in Sec. 648.90(a)(4). 
This projection shall include catch by common pool vessels, as well as 
available information, regarding the catch of regulated species and 
ocean pout by vessels fishing for NE multispecies in State waters 
outside of the authority of the FMP, vessels fishing in exempted 
fisheries, and vessels fishing in the Atlantic sea scallop fishery. If 
it is projected that catch will exceed or under-harvest the common pool 
sub-ACL, the Regional Administrator may, at any time during the fishing 
year, implement a differential DAS counting factor to all Category A DAS 
used within the pertinent stock area(s), as specified in paragraph 
(n)(1)(i) of this section, in a manner consistent with the 
Administrative Procedure Act. Notwithstanding the fact that the 
differential DAS accountability measures described in paragraph (n)(1) 
of this section are intended to address potential over-harvests in 
fishing year 2010 and 2011, the scope of the Regional Administrator 
authority specified in this paragraph (o) is not limited to FY 2010 and 
2011.
    (2) The differential DAS counting factor shall be based on the 
projected proportion of the sub-ACL of each NE multispecies stock caught 
by common pool vessels, rounded to the nearest even tenth, as specified 
in paragraph (n)(1)(ii) of this section, unless otherwise specified in 
Sec. 648.90(a)(5). For example, if the Regional Administrator projects 
that common pool vessels will catch 1.18 times the sub-ACL for GOM cod 
by the end of fishing year 2010, the Regional Administrator may 
implement a differential DAS counting factor of 1.2 to all Category A 
DAS used by common pool vessels within the Inshore GOM Differential DAS 
Area during fishing year 2010 (i.e., Category A DAS will be charged at a 
rate of 28.8 hr for every 24 hr fished--1.2 times 24-hr DAS counting). 
If it is projected that catch will simultaneously exceed

[[Page 689]]

or underharvest the sub-ACLs for several regulated species stocks within 
a particular stock area, the Regional Administrator may implement the 
most restrictive differential DAS counting factor derived from paragraph 
(n)(1)(ii) of this section for the sub-ACLs exceeded or underharvested 
to any Category A DAS used by common pool vessels within that particular 
stock area. For example, if it is projected that the common pool vessel 
catch will exceed the GOM cod sub-ACL by a factor of 1.2 and the CC/GOM 
yellowtail flounder sub-ACL by a factor of 1.1, the Regional 
Administrator may implement a differential DAS counting factor of 1.2 to 
any Category A DAS fished by common pool vessels within the Inshore GOM 
Differential DAS Area during the fishing year. For any inseason 
differential DAS counting factor implemented, the differential DAS 
counting factor shall be applied against the DAS accrual provisions 
specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section for the time spent 
fishing in the applicable differential DAS counting area based upon the 
first VMS position into the applicable differential DAS counting area 
and the first VMS position outside of the applicable differential DAS 
counting area pursuant to Sec. 648.10. For example, if a vessel fished 
12 hr inside a differential DAS counting area where a differential DAS 
counting factor of 1.2 would be applied, and 12 hr outside of the 
differential DAS counting area, the vessel would be charged 48 hr of 
DAS, because DAS would be charged in 24-hr increments ((12 hr inside the 
area x 1.2 = 14.4 hr) + 12 hr outside the area, rounded to the next 24-
hr increment to determine DAS charged).
    (3) For any inseason differential DAS counting factor implemented in 
fishing year 2011, the inseason differential DAS counting factor shall 
be applied in accordance with the DAS accrual provisions specified in 
paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, and, if pursuant to paragraph 
(n)(1) of this section, in conjunction with a differential DAS counting 
factor also implemented for the same differential DAS area during 
fishing year 2011 as an AM. For example, if a differential DAS counting 
factor of 1.2 was applied to the Inshore GOM Differential DAS Area 
during fishing year 2011, as an AM due to a 20-percent overage of the 
GOM cod sub-ACL in fishing year 2010, and during fishing year 2011 the 
GOM cod sub-ACL was projected to be exceeded by 30 percent, an 
additional differential DAS factor of 1.3 would be applied to the DAS 
accrual rate as an inseason action during fishing year 2011. Under this 
example, the DAS accrual rate after both the AM and the inseason 
differential DAS rate is applied to FY 2011 in the Inshore GOM 
Differential DAS Counting Area would be 37.4 hr charged for every 24 hr 
fished--1.2 x 1.3 x 24-hr DAS charge.

Sec. 648.83  Multispecies minimum fish sizes.

    (a) Minimum fish sizes. (1) Minimum fish sizes for recreational 
vessels and charter/party vessels that are not fishing under a NE 
multispecies DAS are specified in Sec. 648.89. Except as provided in 
Sec. 648.17, all other vessels are subject to the following minimum 
fish sizes, determined by total length (TL):

             Minimum Fish Sizes (TL) for Commercial Vessels
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Species                           Size (inches)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cod....................................  22 (55.9 cm)
Haddock................................  18 (45.7 cm)
Pollock................................  19 (48.3 cm)
Witch flounder (gray sole).............  14 (35.6 cm)
Yellowtail flounder....................  13 (33.0 cm)
American plaice (dab)..................  14 (35.6 cm)
Atlantic halibut.......................  41 (104.1 cm)
Winter flounder (blackback)............  12 (30.5 cm)
Redfish................................  9 (22.9 cm)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) The minimum fish size applies to whole fish or to any part of a 
fish while possessed on board a vessel, except as provided in paragraph 
(b) of this section, and to whole, whole-gutted or gilled fish only, 
after landing. For purposes of determining compliance with the 
possession limits in Sec. 648.86, the weight of fillets and parts of 
fish, other than whole-gutted or gilled fish, will be

[[Page 690]]

multiplied by 3. Fish fillets, or parts of fish, must have skin on while 
possessed on board a vessel and at the time of landing in order to meet 
minimum size requirements. ``Skin on'' means the entire portion of the 
skin normally attached to the portion of the fish or to fish parts 
possessed is still attached.
    (b) Exceptions. (1) Each person aboard a vessel issued a NE 
multispecies limited access permit and fishing under the NE multispecies 
DAS program or on a sector trip may possess up to 25 lb (11.3 kg) of 
fillets that measure less than the minimum size, if such fillets are 
from legal-sized fish and are not offered or intended for sale, trade, 
or barter. The weight of fillets and parts of fish, other than whole-
gutted or gilled fish, shall be multiplied by 3. For the purposes of 
accounting for all catch by sector vessels as specified at Sec. 
648.87(b)(1)(v), the weight of all fillets and parts of fish, other than 
whole-gutted or gilled fish reported for at-home consumption shall be 
multiplied by a factor of 3.
    (2) Recreational, party, and charter vessels may possess fillets 
less than the minimum size specified, if the fillets are taken from 
legal-sized fish and are not offered or intended for sale, trade or 
barter.
    (3) Vessels fishing exclusively with pot gear may possess NE 
multispecies frames used, or to be used, as bait, that measure less than 
the minimum fish size, if there is a receipt for purchase of those 
frames on board the vessel.
    (4) Vessels that have an All Areas Limited Access Herring Permit 
and/or an Areas 2 and 3 Limited Access Herring Permit may possess and 
land haddock and other regulated species that are smaller than the 
minimum size specified under Sec. 648.83, consistent with the bycatch 
caps specified in Sec. Sec. 648.86(a)(3) and 648.86(k). Such fish may 
not be sold for human consumption.
    (c) Adjustments. (1) At any time when information is available, the 
NEFMC will review the best available mesh selectivity information to 
determine the appropriate minimum size for the species listed in 
paragraph (a) of this section, except winter flounder, according to the 
length at which 25 percent of the regulated species would be retained by 
the applicable minimum mesh size.
    (2) Upon determination of the appropriate minimum sizes, the NEFMC 
shall propose the minimum fish sizes to be implemented following the 
procedures specified in Sec. 648.90.
    (3) Additional adjustments or changes to the minimum fish sizes 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section, and exemptions specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section, may be made at any time after 
implementation of the final rule as specified under Sec. 648.90.

Sec. 648.84  Gear-marking requirements and gear restrictions.

    (a) Bottom-tending fixed gear, including, but not limited to, 
gillnets and longlines designed for, capable of, or fishing for NE 
multispecies or monkfish, must have the name of the owner or vessel or 
the official number of that vessel permanently affixed to any buoys, 
gillnets, longlines, or other appropriate gear so that the name of the 
owner or vessel or the official number of the vessel is visible on the 
surface of the water.
    (b) Bottom-tending fixed gear, including, but not limited to 
gillnets or longline gear, must be marked so that the westernmost end 
(measuring the half compass circle from magnetic south through west to, 
and including, north) of the gear displays a standard 12-inch (30.5-cm) 
tetrahedral corner radar reflector and a pennant positioned on a staff 
at least 6 ft (1.8 m) above the buoy. The easternmost end (meaning the 
half compass circle from magnetic north through east to, and including, 
south) of the gear need display only the standard 12-inch (30.5-cm) 
tetrahedral radar reflector positioned in the same way.
    (c) Continuous gillnets must not exceed 6,600 ft (2,011.7 m) between 
the end buoys.
    (d) In the GOM and GB regulated mesh area specified in Sec. 
648.80(a), gillnet gear set in an irregular pattern or in any way that 
deviates more than 30[deg] from the original course of the set must be 
marked at the extremity of

[[Page 691]]

the deviation with an additional marker, which must display two or more 
visible streamers and may either be attached to or independent of the 
gear.

Sec. 648.85  Special management programs.

    (a) U.S./Canada Resource Sharing Understanding. No NE multispecies 
fishing vessel, or person on such vessel, may enter, fish in, or be in 
the U.S./Canada Resource Sharing Understanding Management Areas (U.S./
Canada Management Areas), as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, unless the vessel is fishing in accordance with the 
restrictions and conditions of this section. These restrictions do not 
preclude fishing under an approved Special Access Program specified 
under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (1) U.S./Canada Management Areas. A vessel issued a NE multispecies 
permit that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section 
may fish in the U.S./Canada Management Areas described in paragraphs

    (2) TAC allocation--(i) Process for establishing TACs. The amount of 
GB cod and haddock TAC that may be harvested from the Eastern U.S./
Canada Area described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, and the 
amount of GB yellowtail flounder TAC that may be harvested from the 
Western U.S./Canada Area and the Eastern U.S./Canada Area, as described 
in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, combined, shall be 
determined by the process specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(A) through 
(D) of this section.
    (A) To the extent practicable, by June 30 of each year, the Terms of 
Reference for the U.S./Canada shared resources for GB cod, haddock, and 
yellowtail flounder shall be established by the Steering Committee and 
the Transboundary Management Guidance Committee (TMGC).
    (B) To the extent practicable, by July 31 of each year, a 
Transboundary Resource Assessment Committee (TRAC) joint assessment of 
the U.S./Canada shared resources for GB cod, haddock and yellowtail 
flounder shall occur.
    (C) To the extent practicable, by August 31 of each year, the TMGC 
shall recommend TACs for the U.S./Canada shared resources for GB cod, 
haddock, and yellowtail flounder. Prior to October 31 of each year, the 
Council may refer any or all recommended TACs back to the TMGC and 
request changes to any or all TACs. The TMGC shall consider such 
recommendations and respond to the Council prior to October 31.
    (D) To the extent practicable, by October 31 of each year, the 
Council shall review the TMGC recommended TACs for the U.S. portion of 
the U.S./Canada

[[Page 692]]

Management Area resources for GB cod, haddock, and yellowtail flounder. 
Based on the TMGC recommendations, the Council shall recommend to the 
Regional Administrator the U.S. TACs for the shared stocks for the 
subsequent fishing year as a subset of the ACLs for these stocks 
available to the commercial fishery pursuant to Sec. 648.90(a)(4). NMFS 
shall review the Council's recommendations and shall publish the 
proposed TACs in the Federal Register and provide a 30-day public 
comment period. NMFS shall make a final determination concerning the 
TACs and publish notification of the approved TACs and responses to 
public comments in the Federal Register. The Council, at this time, may 
also consider modification of management measures in order to ensure 
compliance with the U.S./Canada Resource Sharing Understanding. Any 
changes to management measures will be modified pursuant to Sec. 
648.90.
    (ii) Adjustments to TACs. Any overages of the GB cod, GB haddock, 
and GB yellowtail flounder TACs specified for either the common pool or 
individual sectors pursuant to this paragraph (a)(2) that occur in a 
given fishing year shall be subtracted from the respective TAC in the 
following fishing year and may be subject to the overall groundfish AM 
provisions as specified in Sec. 648.90(a)(5)(ii) if the overall ACL for 
a particular stock in a given fishing year, specified pursuant to Sec. 
648.90(a)(4), is exceeded.
    (iii) Distribution of TACs. For stocks managed by the U.S./Canada 
Resource Sharing Understanding, as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, the TAC allocation determined pursuant to this paragraph (a)(2) 
shall be distributed between sectors approved pursuant to Sec. 
648.87(c), common pool vessels, and scallop vessels, as specified in 
Sec. 648.90(a)(4). Approved sectors will be allocated ACE for Eastern 
GB cod and Eastern GB haddock proportional to the sector's allocation of 
the overall ACL for these stocks, based upon the fishing histories of 
sector vessels, as specified in Sec. 648.87(b)(1)(i). Any ACE for 
Eastern GB cod and Eastern GB haddock allocated to an individual sector 
is considered a subset of the overall GB cod and GB haddock ACE 
allocated to that sector and may only be harvested from the Eastern 
U.S./Canada Area, while the remaining ACE for GB cod and GB haddock 
available to that sector may only be harvested outside of the Eastern 
U.S./Canada Area. For example, if a sector is allocated 10 percent of 
the GB haddock ACL, it will also be allocated 10 percent of the Eastern 
GB haddock TAC for that particular fishing year.
    (3) Requirements for vessels in U.S./Canada Management Areas. Any 
common pool or sector vessel, provided the sector to which a vessel 
belongs is allocated ACE for stocks caught in the Eastern U.S./Canada 
Area pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section and Sec. 
648.87(b)(1)(i), may fish in the U.S./Canada Management Areas, provided 
it complies with conditions and restrictions of this section. A vessel 
other than a NE multispecies vessel may fish in the U.S./Canada 
Management Area, subject to the restrictions specified in paragraph 
(a)(3)(iv)(E) of this section and all other applicable regulations for 
such vessels.
    (i) VMS requirement. A NE multispecies vessel fishing in the U.S./
Canada Management Areas described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
must have installed on board an operational VMS unit that meets the 
minimum performance criteria specified in Sec. Sec. 648.9 and 648.10.
    (ii) Declaration. To fish in the U.S./Canada Management Area under a 
NE multispecies DAS or on a sector trip, a NE multispecies vessel must 
declare through the VMS the specific area within the U.S./Canada 
Management Areas, as described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this 
section, or the specific SAP within the U.S./Canada Management Areas, as 
described in paragraph (b) of this section, the vessel will be fishing 
in prior to leaving the dock, in accordance with instructions to be 
provided by the Regional Administrator, and must comply with the 
restrictions and conditions in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A) through (C) of 
this section. Vessels other than NE multispecies vessels are not 
required to declare into the U.S./Canada Management Areas.
    (A) A common pool vessel fishing under a NE multispecies DAS in the 
Eastern U.S./Canada Area may fish

[[Page 693]]

both inside and outside of the Eastern U.S./Canada Area on the same 
trip, provided it complies with the most restrictive DAS counting 
requirements specified in Sec. 648.10(e)(5), trip limits, and reporting 
requirements for the areas fished for the entire trip, and the 
restrictions specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A)(1) through (4) of 
this section. A vessel on a sector trip may fish both inside and outside 
of the Eastern U.S./Canada Area on the same trip, provided it complies 
with the restrictions specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A)(1) through 
(3) of this section. When a vessel operator elects to fish both inside 
and outside of the Eastern U.S./Canada Area, all cod, haddock, and 
yellowtail flounder caught on that trip shall count toward the 
applicable hard TAC specified for the U.S./Canada Management Area.
    (1) The vessel operator must notify NMFS via VMS prior to leaving 
the Eastern U.S./Canada Area (including at the time of initial 
declaration into the Eastern U.S./Canada Area) that it is also electing 
to fish outside the Eastern U.S./Canada Area, as instructed by the 
Regional Administrator. With the exception of vessels participating in 
the Regular B DAS Program and fishing under a Regular B DAS and vessels 
on a sector trip that are not fishing under a NE multispecies DAS for 
the purposes of complying with the restrictions of other fisheries, once 
a vessel elects to fish outside of the Eastern U.S./Canada Area, 
Category A DAS shall accrue from the time the vessel crosses the VMS 
Demarcation Line at the start of its fishing trip until the time the 
vessel crosses the VMS Demarcation Line on its return to port, in 
accordance with Sec. 648.10(e)(5)(iii).
    (2) Unless otherwise exempted pursuant to this part, the vessel must 
comply with the reporting requirements of the U.S./Canada Management 
Area specified in Sec. 648.85(a)(3)(v) for the duration of the trip.
    (3) [Reserved]
    (4) If a common pool vessel fishing under a NE multispecies DAS 
possesses yellowtail flounder in excess of the trip limits for CC/GOM 
yellowtail flounder or SNE/MA yellowtail flounder, as specified in Sec. 
648.86(g), the vessel may not fish in either the CC/GOM or SNE/MA 
yellowtail flounder stock area during that trip (i.e., may not fish 
outside of the U.S./Canada Management Area).
    (B) A common pool vessel fishing under a NE multispecies DAS in the 
Western U.S./Canada Area may fish inside and outside the Western U.S./
Canada Area on the same trip, provided it complies with the more 
restrictive regulations applicable to the area fished for the entire 
trip (e.g., the possession restrictions specified in paragraph 
(a)(3)(iv)(C)(4) of this section), and the reporting requirements 
specified in Sec. 648.85(a)(3)(v). A vessel on a sector trip in the 
Western U.S./Canada Area may fish inside and outside the Western U.S./
Canada Area on the same trip, provided it complies with the more 
restrictive reporting requirements specified in Sec. 648.85(a)(3)(v), 
unless otherwise exempted pursuant to this part.
    (C) For the purposes of selecting vessels for observer deployment, a 
vessel fishing in either of the U.S./Canada Management Areas specified 
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must provide notice to NMFS of the 
vessel name; contact name for coordination of observer deployment; 
telephone number for contact; and the date, time, and port of departure, 
at least 48 hr prior to the beginning of any trip that it declares into 
the U.S./Canada Management Area as required under this paragraph 
(a)(3)(ii).
    (iii) Gear requirements. A NE multispecies vessel fishing with trawl 
gear in the Eastern U.S./Canada Area defined in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of 
this section, unless otherwise provided in paragraphs (b)(6) and (8) of 
this section, must fish with a Ruhle trawl, as described in paragraph 
(b)(6)(iv)(J)(1) of this section, or a haddock separator trawl, or a 
flounder trawl net, as described in paragraphs (a)(3)(iii)(A) and (B) of 
this section (all three nets may be onboard the fishing vessel 
simultaneously). Unless otherwise restricted by Sec. 648.80(n), gear 
other than the Ruhle trawl, haddock separator trawl, or the flounder 
trawl net, or gear authorized under paragraphs (b)(6) and (8) of this 
section, may be on board the vessel during a trip to the Eastern U.S./
Canada Area, provided the gear is stowed according to the regulations in

[[Page 694]]

Sec. 648.23(b). The description of the haddock separator trawl and the 
flounder trawl net, and the description of the Ruhle trawl may be 
further specified by the Regional Administrator through publication of 
such specifications in the Federal Register, in a manner consistent with 
the Administrative Procedure Act.
    (A) Haddock Separator Trawl. A haddock separator trawl is defined as 
a groundfish trawl modified to a vertically oriented trouser trawl 
configuration, with two extensions arranged one over the other, where a 
codend shall be attached only to the upper extension, and the bottom 
extension shall be left open and have no codend attached. A horizontal 
large mesh separating panel constructed with a minimum of 6.0 inch (15.2 
cm) diamond mesh must be installed between the selvedges joining the 
upper and lower panels, as described in paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A) and (B) 
of this section, extending forward from the front of the trouser 
junction to the aft edge of the first belly behind the fishing circle.
    (1) Two-seam bottom trawl nets--For two seam nets, the separator 
panel will be constructed such that the width of the forward edge of the 
panel is 80-85 percent of the width of the after edge of the first belly 
of the net where the panel is attached. For example, if the belly is 200 
meshes wide (from selvedge to selvedge), the separator panel must be no 
wider than 160-170 meshes wide.
    (2) Four-seam bottom trawl nets--For four seam nets, the separator 
panel will be constructed such that the width of the forward edge of the 
panel is 90-95 percent of the width of the after edge of the first belly 
of the net where the panel is attached. For example, if the belly is 200 
meshes wide (from selvedge to selvedge), the separator panel must be no 
wider than 180-190 meshes wide. The separator panel will be attached to 
both of the side panels of the net along the midpoint of the side 
panels. For example, if the side panel is 100 meshes tall, the separator 
panel must be attached at the 50th mesh.
    (B) Flounder Trawl Net. A flounder trawl net is defined as bottom 
trawl gear meeting one of the following two net descriptions:
    (1) A two-seam, low-rise net constructed with mesh size in 
compliance with Sec. 648.80(a)(4), where the maximum footrope length is 
not greater than 105 ft (32.0 m) and the headrope is at least 30 percent 
longer than the footrope. The footrope and headrope lengths shall be 
measured from the forward wing end.
    (2) A two-seam, low-rise net constructed with mesh size in 
compliance with Sec. 648.80(a)(4), with the exception that the top 
panel of the net contains a section of mesh at least 10 ft (3.05 m) long 
and stretching from selvedge to selvedge, composed of at least 12-in 
(30.5-cm) mesh that is inserted no farther than 4.5 meshes behind the 
headrope.
    (iv) Harvest controls. Unless otherwise specified in this paragraph 
(a)(3)(iv), any NE multispecies vessel fishing in the U.S./Canada 
Management Areas is subject to the following restrictions. For common 
pool vessels, the trip limits specified in this paragraph (a)(3)(iv) are 
in addition to any other possession or landing limits applicable to 
vessels not fishing in the U.S./Canada Management Areas. A sector vessel 
is subject to the trip limits specified in Sec. 648.87(b)(1)(ix).
    (A) Cod landing limit restrictions. Notwithstanding other applicable 
possession and landing restrictions under this part, a common pool 
vessel fishing in the Eastern U.S./Canada Area described in paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii) of this section may not land more than 500 lb (226.8 kg) of 
cod per DAS, or any part of a DAS, up to 5,000 lb (2,268 kg) per trip. A 
vessel fishing in the Eastern U.S./Canada Area may be further restricted 
by participation in other Special Management Programs, as required under 
this section.
    (1) Initial cod landing limit. Unless modified pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(3)(iv)(D) of this section, notwithstanding other applicable 
possession and landing restrictions under this part, a common pool 
vessel fishing in the Eastern U.S./Canada Area described in paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii) of this section may not land more than 500 lb (226.8 kg) of 
cod per DAS, or any part of a DAS, up to 5,000 lb (2,268 kg) per trip. A 
vessel fishing in the Eastern U.S./Canada Area may be further restricted 
by

[[Page 695]]

participation in other Special Management Programs, as required under 
this section.
    (2) Possession restriction when 100 percent of TAC is harvested. 
When the Regional Administrator projects that 100 percent of the TAC 
allocation for cod specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section will be 
harvested, NMFS shall, in a manner consistent with the Administrative 
Procedure Act, close the Eastern U.S./Canada Area to all limited access 
NE multispecies DAS and sector vessels subject to that particular TAC 
allocation, as specified in paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(E) of this section, by 
prohibiting such vessels and all other vessels not issued a limited 
access NE multispecies permit from entering or being in this area and 
from harvesting, possessing, or landing cod in or from the Eastern U.S./
Canada Area during the closure period.
    (B) Haddock landing limit--(1) Initial haddock landing limit. The 
initial haddock landing limit for common pool vessels is specified in 
Sec. 648.86(a), unless adjusted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(3)(iv)(B)(2) 
and (3) of this section.
    (2) Implementation of haddock landing limit for Eastern U.S./Canada 
Area. When the Regional Administrator projects that 70 percent of the 
haddock TAC allocation specified for common pool vessels, as described 
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, will be harvested, NMFS shall 
implement, in a manner consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act, 
a haddock trip limit for common pool vessels fishing in the Eastern 
U.S./Canada Area of 1,500 lb (680.4 kg) per day, and 15,000 lb (6,804.1 
kg) per trip.
    (3) Possession restriction when 100 percent of TAC is harvested. 
When the Regional Administrator projects that 100 percent of the TAC 
allocation for haddock distributed to either common pool vessels or a 
particular sector, as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, 
will be harvested, NMFS shall, in a manner consistent with the 
Administrative Procedure Act, close the Eastern U.S./Canada Area to all 
limited access NE multispecies vessels subject to that particular TAC 
allocation, as specified in paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(E) of this section, and 
prohibit such vessels and all other vessels not issued a limited access 
NE multispecies permit from harvesting, possessing, or landing haddock 
in or from the Eastern U.S./Canada Area.
    (C) Yellowtail flounder landing limit--(1) Initial yellowtail 
flounder landing limit. Unless further restricted under paragraphs 
(a)(3)(iv)(C)(2) or (D) of this section (gear performance incentives), 
or modified pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(D) of this section, there 
is no initial limit to the amount of yellowtail flounder that could be 
landed for each fishing year.
    (2) Regional Administrator authority to adjust the yellowtail 
flounder landing limit mid-season. If, based upon available information, 
the Regional Administrator projects that the yellowtail flounder catch 
may exceed the yellowtail flounder TAC for a fishing year, the Regional 
Administrator may implement, adjust, or remove the yellowtail flounder 
landing limit at any time during that fishing year in order to prevent 
yellowtail flounder catch from exceeding the TAC, or to facilitate 
harvesting the TAC, in a manner consistent with the Administrative 
Procedure Act. If, based upon available information, the Regional 
Administrator projects that the yellowtail flounder catch is less than 
90 percent of the TAC, the Regional Administrator may adjust or remove 
the yellowtail flounder landing limit at any time during the fishing 
year in order to facilitate the harvest of the TAC, in a manner 
consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act. The Regional 
Administrator may specify yellowtail flounder trip limits that apply to 
the entire U.S./Canada Management Area or to only the Western or Eastern 
Area.
    (3) Possession restriction when 100 percent of TAC is harvested. 
When the Regional Administrator projects that 100 percent of the TAC 
allocation for yellowtail flounder distributed to either common pool 
vessels or a particular sector, as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, will be harvested, NMFS shall, in a manner consistent with the 
Administrative Procedure Act, close the Eastern U.S./Canada Area to all 
limited access NE multispecies vessels subject to that particular TAC 
allocation, as specified in paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(E) of this section, and

[[Page 696]]

prohibit such vessels and all other vessels not issued a limited access 
NE multispecies permit from harvesting, possessing, or landing 
yellowtail flounder from the U.S./Canada Management Area.
    (4) Yellowtail flounder landing limit for vessels fishing both 
inside and outside the Western U.S./Canada Area on the same trip. A 
vessel fishing both inside and outside of the Western U.S./Canada Area 
on the same trip, as allowed under paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of this 
section, is subject to the most restrictive landing limits that apply to 
any of the areas fished, for the entire trip.
    (D) Other restrictions or inseason adjustments. In addition to the 
possession restrictions specified in paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this 
section, the Regional Administrator, in a manner consistent with the 
Administrative Procedure Act, may modify the gear requirements, modify 
or close access to the U.S./Canada Management Areas, or modify the total 
number of trips into the U.S./Canada Management Area, to prevent over-
harvesting or to facilitate achieving the TAC specified in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section. Such adjustments may be made at any time during 
the fishing year, or prior to the start of the fishing year. If 
necessary to give priority to using Category A DAS versus using Category 
B DAS, the Regional Administrator may implement different management 
measures for vessels using Category A DAS than for vessels using 
Category B DAS. If the Regional Administrator, under this authority, 
requires use of a particular gear type in order to reduce catches of 
stocks of concern, unless further restricted elsewhere in this part, the 
following gear performance incentives will apply: Possession of 
flounders (all species combined), monkfish, and skates is limited to 500 
lb (226.8 kg) (whole weight) each (i.e., no more than 500 lb (226.8 kg) 
of all flounders, no more than 500 lb (226.8 kg) of monkfish, and no 
more than 500 lb (226.8 kg) of skates), and possession of lobsters is 
prohibited.
    (E) Closure of Eastern U.S./Canada Area. Based upon available 
information, when the Regional Administrator projects that any 
individual TAC allocation specified in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this 
section will be caught, NMFS shall close, in a manner consistent with 
the Administrative Procedure Act, the Eastern U.S./Canada Area to all 
vessels subject to that particular TAC allocation, unless otherwise 
allowed under this paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(E). For example, if the Eastern 
GB cod TAC specified for common pool vessels is projected to be caught, 
NMFS shall close the Eastern U.S./Canada Area to all common pool vessels 
operating under a NE multispecies DAS. Should the Eastern U.S./Canada 
Area close as described in this paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(E), common pool 
vessels fishing under a DAS may continue to fish in a SAP within the 
Eastern U.S./Canada Area, provided that the TAC for the target stock 
identified for that particular SAP (i.e., haddock for the Eastern U.S./
Canada Haddock SAP or haddock or yellowtail flounder for the CA II 
Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP) has not been fully harvested. A vessel 
fishing on a sector trip may only fish in a SAP if that vessel's sector 
has ACE available for all stocks caught in that SAP. For example, should 
the GB cod TAC allocation specified for common pool vessels in paragraph 
(a)(2)(iii) of this section be attained, and the Eastern U.S./Canada 
Area closure implemented for common pool vessels, common pool vessels 
could continue to fish for yellowtail flounder within the SAP identified 
as the Closed Area II Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP, described in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, in accordance with the requirements of 
that program. Upon closure of the Eastern U.S./Canada Area, vessels may 
transit through this area as described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this 
section, provided that its gear is stowed in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 648.23(b), unless otherwise restricted under this 
part.
    (v) Reporting. The owner or operator of a common pool vessel must 
submit reports via VMS, in accordance with instructions provided by the 
Regional Administrator, for each day of the fishing trip when declared 
into either of the U.S./Canada Management Areas. A vessel fishing on a 
sector trip is subject to the reporting requirements specified in this 
paragraph (a)(3)(v) unless the Regional Administrator determines

[[Page 697]]

that weekly sector catch reports, as required by Sec. 648.87(b)(1)(v), 
are sufficient to monitor sector catch within the U.S./Canada Management 
Areas, and the Regional Administrator makes that determination in a 
manner consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act. Vessels subject 
to this reporting requirement must continue to report daily, even after 
exiting the U.S./Canada Management Area. The reports must be submitted 
in 24-hr intervals for each day, beginning at 0000 hr and ending at 2359 
hr, and must be submitted by 0900 hr of the following day, or as 
instructed by the Regional Administrator. The reports must include at 
least the following information:
    (A) VTR serial number or other universal ID specified by the 
Regional Administrator;
    (B) Date fish were caught and statistical area in which fish were 
caught; and
    (C) Total pounds of cod, haddock, yellowtail flounder, winter 
flounder, witch flounder, pollock, American plaice, redfish, Atlantic 
halibut, ocean pout, Atlantic wolffish, and white hake kept (in pounds, 
live weight) in each broad stock area, specified in Sec. 648.10(k)(3), 
as instructed by the Regional Administrator.
    (vi) Withdrawal from U.S./Canada Resource Sharing Understanding. At 
any time, the Regional Administrator, in consultation with the Council, 
may withdraw from the provisions of the U.S./Canada Resource Sharing 
Understanding described in this section, if the Understanding is 
determined to be inconsistent with the goals and objectives of the FMP, 
the Magnuson-Stevens Act, or other applicable law. If the United States 
withdraws from the Understanding, the implementing measures, including 
TACs, remain in place until changed through the framework or FMP 
amendment process.
    (vii) Transiting. A NE multispecies vessel that has declared into 
the Eastern U.S./Canada Area, as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this 
section, and that is not fishing in the CA II Yellowtail Flounder/
Haddock SAP described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, may transit 
the CA II Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP Area, as described in 
paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, provided all fishing gear is 
stowed in accordance with the regulations in Sec. 648.23(b).
    (b) Special Access Programs. A SAP is a narrowly defined fishery 
that results in increased access to a stock that, in the absence of such 
authorization, would not be allowed due to broadly applied regulations. 
A SAP authorizes specific fisheries targeting either NE multispecies 
stocks or non-multispecies stocks in order to allow an increased yield 
of the target stock(s) without undermining the achievement of the goals 
of the NE Multispecies FMP. A SAP should result in a harvest level that 
more closely approaches OY, without compromising efforts to rebuild 
overfished stocks, end overfishing, minimize bycatch, or minimize impact 
on EFH. Development of a SAP requires a relatively high level of fishery 
dependent and fishery independent information in order to be consistent 
with this rationale.
    (1) SAPs harvesting NE multispecies. A SAP to harvest NE 
multispecies may be proposed by the Council and approved by NMFS through 
the framework process described under Sec. 648.90.
    (2) SAPs harvesting stocks other than NE multispecies. A SAP to 
harvest stocks of fish other than NE multispecies (non-multispecies SAP) 
may be proposed by the Council and approved by NMFS through the 
framework process described under Sec. 648.90.
    (3) Closed Area II Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP--(i) Eligibility. 
Any vessel issued a valid limited access NE multispecies permit fishing 
under a NE multispecies DAS or on a sector trip, provided the sector to 
which the vessel belongs has been allocated ACE for all stocks that may 
be caught within the Eastern U.S./Canada Area pursuant to Sec. 
648.87(b)(1)(i), are eligible to participate in the Closed Area II 
Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP, and may fish in the Closed Area II 
Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock Access Area, as described in paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii) of this section, for the period specified in paragraph 
(b)(3)(iii) of this section, provided the Eastern U.S./Canada Area, as 
described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, is not closed 
according to the provisions specified in paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(E) of this 
section, or that the sector to

[[Page 698]]

which a vessel belongs no longer has ACE available for all stocks caught 
within the Eastern U.S./Canada Area pursuant to Sec. 648.87(b)(1)(i). 
All eligible vessels must comply with the requirements of this section, 
unless otherwise specified in this paragraph (b)(3).
    (ii) Closed Area II Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP Area. The Closed 
Area II Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP Area is the area defined by 
straight lines connecting the following points in the order stated:

           Closed Area II Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP Area

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (iii) Season--(A) Season when the CA II Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock 
SAP is open to target yellowtail flounder. When the CA II Yellowtail 
Flounder/Haddock SAP is open to target yellowtail flounder, as specified 
in paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of this section, eligible vessels may fish in 
the Closed Area II Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP from July 1 through 
December 31.
    (B) Season when the CA II Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP is open 
only to target haddock. When the CA II Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP 
is open only to target haddock, as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of 
this section, eligible vessels may fish in the CA II Yellowtail 
Flounder/Haddock SAP from August 1 through January 31.
    (iv) VMS requirement. All NE multispecies vessels fishing in the 
U.S./Canada Management Areas described in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section must have installed on board an operational VMS unit that meets 
the minimum performance criteria specified in Sec. Sec. 648.9 and 
648.10.
    (v) Declaration. For the purposes of selecting vessels for observer 
deployment, a vessel must provide notice to NMFS of the vessel name; 
contact name for coordination of observer deployment; telephone number 
for contact; date, time and port of departure; and special access 
program to be fished, at least 48 hr prior to the beginning of any trip 
that it declares into the SAP as required under this paragraph 
(b)(3)(v). To fish in the Closed Area II Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock 
SAP, a vessel must declare into this area through the VMS prior to 
departure from port, in accordance with instructions provided by the 
Regional Administrator. A vessel declared into the Closed Area II 
Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP may also fish in the area outside the 
Eastern U.S./Canada Area, as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this 
section, on the same trip, provided the vessel also declares into this 
area prior to departure from port and fishes under the most restrictive 
DAS counting requirements specified in Sec. 648.10(e)(5), trip limits, 
and reporting requirements for the areas fished during the entire trip.
    (vi) Number of trips per vessel--(A) Number of trips allowed when 
the CA II Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP is open to target yellowtail 
flounder. When the CA II Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP is open to 
target yellowtail flounder, as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of 
this section, eligible common pool vessels are restricted to one trip 
per calendar month during the season described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) 
of this section.
    (B) Number of trips allowed when the CA II Yellowtail Flounder/
Haddock SAP is open only to target haddock. When the CA II Yellowtail 
Flounder/Haddock SAP is open only to target haddock, as specified in 
paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of this section, there is no limit on the number 
of trips that can be taken by eligible vessels during the season 
described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (vii) Opening criteria--(A) Opening the CA II Yellowtail Flounder/
Haddock SAP to target yellowtail flounder. Unless otherwise authorized 
by the Regional Administrator, as specified in paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(D) 
of this section, the total number of allowed trips by common pool 
vessels that may be declared into the Closed Area II Yellowtail 
Flounder/Haddock SAP for each fishing year shall be as announced by the 
Regional Administrator on or about June 1, after consultation with the 
Council, in a manner consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act. 
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(B) of this

[[Page 699]]

section, the total number of trips by all common pool vessels that may 
be declared into this SAP when the SAP is open to target yellowtail 
flounder shall not exceed 320 per year. When determining the total 
number of trips, the Regional Administrator shall consider the available 
yellowtail flounder TAC under the U.S./Canada Resource Sharing 
Understanding, the potential catch of GB yellowtail flounder by all 
vessels fishing outside of the SAP, recent discard estimates in all 
fisheries that catch yellowtail flounder, the expected number of SAP 
participants, and any other available information. If the Regional 
Administrator determines that the available catch, as determined by 
subtracting the potential catch of GB yellowtail flounder by all vessels 
outside of the SAP from the GB yellowtail flounder TAC allocation 
specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, is insufficient to allow 
for at least 150 trips with a possession limit of 15,000 lb (6,804 kg) 
of yellowtail flounder per trip, the Regional Administrator may choose 
not to authorize any trips into the SAP during a fishing year.
    (B) Opening the CA II Yellowtail/Haddock SAP to only target haddock. 
If the CA II Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP is not open to targeting 
yellowtail flounder due to an insufficient amount of yellowtail flounder 
TAC, or because the maximum number of trips allowed into the CA II 
Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP to target yellowtail flounder has been 
achieved pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(A) of this section, eligible 
vessels may target haddock in the CA II Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock 
Access Area, as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, 
provided the Eastern GB haddock TAC specified in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section has not been caught, the Eastern U.S./Canada Area is not 
closed pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(D) of this section; and, for 
vessels on a sector trip, the sector to which the sector vessel belongs 
has ACE remaining for the stocks caught in the Eastern U.S./Canada Area.
    (viii) Trip limits. Vessels subject to the provisions of the common 
pool that are fishing in the Closed Area II Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock 
SAP are subject to the following trip limits, unless otherwise 
restricted in this part. Vessels subject to the restrictions and 
conditions of an approved sector operations plan fishing in the Closed 
Area II Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP are subject to the trip limits 
specified in Sec. 648.87(b)(1)(ix).
    (A) Yellowtail flounder trip limit--(1) Trip limits when the CA II 
Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP is open to target yellowtail flounder. 
Unless otherwise authorized by the Regional Administrator as specified 
in paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(D) of this section, when the CA II Yellowtail 
Flounder/Haddock SAP is open to target yellowtail flounder, as specified 
in paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of this section, a vessel subject to the 
provisions of the common pool that is fishing in the CA II Yellowtail 
Flounder/Haddock SAP may fish for, possess, and land up to 10,000 lb 
(4,536 kg) of yellowtail flounder per trip. The Regional Administrator 
may adjust this limit to a maximum of 30,000 lb (13,608 kg) per trip 
after considering the factors listed in paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of this 
section for the maximum number of trips.
    (2) Trip limits when the CA II Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP is 
open to target haddock. Unless otherwise specified by the Regional 
Administrator pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(D) of this section, when 
the CA II Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP is only open to target 
haddock, as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of this section, the trip 
limit for yellowtail flounder is specified in paragraph (b)(3)(viii)(C) 
of this section.
    (B) Cod and haddock trip limit. Unless otherwise restricted, a 
common pool vessel fishing any portion of a trip in the Closed Area II 
Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP on a NE multispecies DAS may not fish 
for, possess, or land more than 1,000 lb (453.6 kg) of cod per trip, 
regardless of trip length. A common pool vessel fishing on a NE 
multispecies DAS in the Closed Area II Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP 
is subject to the haddock requirements described in Sec. 648.86(a), 
unless further restricted under paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section.
    (C) Other species trip limits. A common pool vessel fishing on a NE 
multispecies DAS in the CA II Yellowtail

[[Page 700]]

Flounder/Haddock SAP using a haddock separator trawl, a Ruhle trawl, or 
any other gear specified pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(x)(B) must comply 
with the trip limits specified in Sec. 648.86, unless further 
restricted by the trip limits specified in paragraph (e) of this 
section.
    (ix) Area fished. Eligible vessels that have declared a trip into 
the Closed Area II Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP, and other areas as 
specified in paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section, may not fish for, 
possess, or land fish in or from outside of the declared area during the 
same trip.
    (x) Gear requirements--(A) Approved gear. When the CA II Yellowtail 
Flounder/Haddock SAP is open to target yellowtail flounder, as specified 
in paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of this section, NE multispecies vessels 
fishing with trawl gear must use a haddock separator trawl or a flounder 
trawl net, as described in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, or the 
Ruhle trawl, as described in paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(J)(3) of this section 
(all three nets may be onboard the fishing vessel simultaneously). When 
this SAP is only open to target haddock, NE multispecies vessels must 
use a haddock separator trawl, a Ruhle trawl, or hook gear. Gear other 
than the haddock separator trawl, the flounder trawl, or the Ruhle trawl 
may be on board the vessel during a trip to the Eastern U.S./Canada Area 
outside of the CA II Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP, provided the gear 
is stowed according to the regulations at Sec. 648.23(b).
    (B) Approval of additional gear. The Regional Administrator may 
authorize additional gear for use in the CA II Yellowtail Flounder/
Haddock SAP in accordance with the standards and requirements specified 
in paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(J)(2) of this section.
    (xi) No-discard provision and DAS flips. A vessel fishing in the CA 
II Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP under a NE multispecies DAS or on a 
sector trip may not discard legal-sized regulated NE multispecies, 
unless the possession of the species is prohibited pursuant to Sec. 
648.86, or unless otherwise specified in this paragraph (b)(3)(xi). A 
vessel may discard Atlantic halibut exceeding the one fish per trip 
possession limit. If a vessel fishing in the CA II Yellowtail Flounder/
Haddock SAP exceeds an applicable trip limit, the vessel must exit the 
SAP. If a common pool vessel operator fishing in the CA II Yellowtail 
Flounder/Haddock SAP under a Category B DAS harvests and brings on board 
more legal-sized regulated NE multispecies or Atlantic halibut than the 
maximum landing limits allowed per trip, as specified in paragraph 
(b)(3)(iv) or (viii) of this section, or in Sec. 648.86, the vessel 
operator must immediately notify NMFS via VMS to initiate a DAS flip 
(from a Category B DAS to a Category A DAS). Once this notification has 
been received by NMFS, the vessel's entire trip will accrue as a 
Category A DAS trip. For a vessel that notifies NMFS of a DAS flip, the 
Category B DAS that have accrued between the time the vessel started 
accruing Category B DAS (i.e., either at the beginning of the trip, or 
at the time the vessel crossed into the Eastern U.S./Canada Area) and 
the time the vessel declared its DAS flip shall be accrued as Category A 
DAS, and not Category B DAS.
    (xii) Minimum Category A DAS. For vessels fishing under a Category B 
DAS, the number of Category B DAS that can be used on a trip cannot 
exceed the number of available Category A DAS the vessel has at the 
start of the trip.
    (xiii) Catch distribution. All catch of GB haddock from vessels 
declared into the CA II Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP shall be applied 
against the Eastern GB haddock TAC, as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section, for either common pool vessels or individual approved 
sectors.
    (4) [Reserved]
    (5) Incidental Catch TACs. Unless otherwise specified in this 
paragraph (b)(5), Incidental Catch TACs shall be based upon the portion 
of the ACL for a stock specified for the common pool vessels pursuant to 
Sec. 648.90(a)(4), and allocated as described in this paragraph (b)(5), 
for each of the following stocks: GOM cod, GB cod, GB yellowtail 
flounder, GB winter flounder, CC/GOM yellowtail flounder, American 
plaice, white hake, SNE/MA yellowtail flounder, SNE/MA winter flounder, 
and witch flounder. Because GB yellowtail

[[Page 701]]

flounder and GB cod are transboundary stocks, the incidental catch TACs 
for these stocks shall be based upon the common pool portion of the ACL 
available to U.S. vessels. NMFS shall send letters to limited access NE 
multispecies permit holders notifying them of such TACs.
    (i) Stocks other than GB cod, GB yellowtail flounder, and GB winter 
flounder. With the exception of GB cod, GB yellowtail flounder, and GB 
winter flounder, 100 percent of the Incidental Catch TACs specified in 
this paragraph (b)(5) shall be allocated to the Regular B DAS Program 
described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.
    (ii) GB cod. The Incidental Catch TAC for GB cod specified in this 
paragraph (b)(5) shall be subdivided as follows: 50 percent to the 
Regular B DAS Program described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section; 16 
percent to the CA I Hook Gear Haddock SAP described in paragraph (b)(7) 
of this section; and 34 percent to the Eastern U.S./Canada Haddock SAP 
described in paragraph (b)(8) of this section.
    (6) Regular B DAS Pilot Program--(i) Eligibility. Vessels issued a 
valid limited access NE multispecies DAS permit and allocated Regular B 
DAS are eligible to participate in the Regular B DAS Program, and may 
elect to fish under a Regular B DAS, provided they comply with the 
requirements and restrictions of this paragraph (b)(6), and provided the 
use of Regular B DAS is not restricted according to paragraphs 
(b)(6)(iv)(G) or (H), or paragraph (b)(6)(vi) of this section. Vessels 
are required to comply with the no discarding and DAS flip requirements 
specified in paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(E) of this section, and the DAS 
balance and accrual requirements specified in paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(F) of 
this section. Vessels may fish under the B Regular DAS Program and in 
the U.S./Canada Management Area on the same trip, but may not fish under 
the Regular B DAS Program and in a SAP on the same trip.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (iii) Quarterly Incidental Catch TACs. The Incidental Catch TACs 
specified in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section shall be 
divided into quarterly catch TACs as follows: The first quarter shall 
receive 13 percent of the Incidental Catch TACs and the remaining 
quarters shall each receive 29 percent of the Incidental Catch TACs. 
NMFS shall send letters to all limited access NE multispecies permit 
holders notifying them of such TACs.
    (iv) Program requirements--(A) VMS requirement. A NE multispecies 
DAS vessel fishing in the Regular B DAS Program described in paragraph 
(b)(6)(i) of this section must have installed on board an operational 
VMS unit that meets the minimum performance criteria specified in 
Sec. Sec. 648.9 and 648.10.
    (B) Observer notification. For the purposes of selecting vessels for 
observer deployment, a vessel must provide notice to NMFS of the vessel 
name; contact name for coordination of observer deployment; telephone 
number for contact; the date, time, and port of departure; and the 
planned fishing area or areas (GOM, GB, or SNE/MA) at least 72 hr prior 
to the beginning of any trip declared into the Regular B DAS Program as 
required by paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(C) of this section, and in accordance 
with the Regional Administrator's instructions. Providing notice of the 
area that the vessel intends to fish does not restrict the vessel's 
activity on that trip to that area only (i.e., the vessel operator may 
change his/her plans regarding planned fishing areas).
    (C) VMS declaration. To participate in the Regular B DAS Program 
under a Regular B DAS, a vessel must declare into the Program via VMS 
prior to departure from port, in accordance with instructions provided 
by the Regional Administrator. A vessel declared into the Regular B DAS 
Program cannot fish in an approved SAP described under this section on 
the same trip. Mere declaration of a Regular B DAS Program trip does not 
reserve a vessel's right to fish under the Program, if the vessel has 
not crossed the VMS demarcation line.
    (D) Landing limits. Unless otherwise specified in this paragraph 
(b)(6)(iv)(D), or restricted pursuant to Sec. 648.86, a NE multispecies 
vessel fishing in the Regular B DAS Program described in this paragraph 
(b)(6), and fishing under a Regular B DAS, may not land more than 100 lb 
(45.5 kg) per DAS, or any part of a DAS, up to a maximum of

[[Page 702]]

1,000 lb (454 kg) per trip, of any of the following species/stocks from 
the areas specified in paragraph (b)(6)(v) of this section: Cod (both 
GOM and GB), American plaice, white hake, witch flounder, SNE/MA winter 
flounder, GB winter flounder, GB yellowtail flounder, and pollock; and 
may not land more than 25 lb (11.3 kg) per DAS, or any part of a DAS, up 
to a maximum of 250 lb (113 kg) per trip of CC/GOM or SNE/MA yellowtail 
flounder. In addition, trawl vessels, which are required to fish with a 
haddock separator trawl, as specified in paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A), or a 
Ruhle trawl, as specified in paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(J) of this section, 
and other gear that may be required in order to reduce catches of stocks 
of concern as described in paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(J) of this section, are 
restricted to the trip limits specified in paragraph (e) of this 
section.
    (E) No-discard provision and DAS flips. A vessel fishing in the 
Regular B DAS Program under a Regular B DAS may not discard legal-sized 
regulated species, ocean pout, or monkfish. This prohibition on 
discarding does not apply in areas or times where the possession or 
landing of regulated species or ocean pout is prohibited, as specified 
in Sec. Sec. 648.85 and 648.86. If such a vessel harvests and brings on 
board legal-sized regulated species or ocean pout in excess of the 
allowable landing limits specified in paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(D) of this 
section or Sec. 648.86, the vessel operator must notify NMFS 
immediately via VMS to initiate a DAS flip from a B DAS to an A DAS. 
Once this notification has been received by NMFS, the vessel shall 
automatically be switched by NMFS to fishing under a Category A DAS for 
its entire fishing trip. Thus, any Category B DAS that accrued between 
the time the vessel declared into the Regular B DAS Program at the 
beginning of the trip (i.e., at the time the vessel crossed the 
demarcation line at the beginning of the trip) and the time the vessel 
declared its DAS flip shall be accrued as Category A DAS, and not 
Regular B DAS. After flipping to a Category A DAS, the vessel is subject 
to the applicable trip limits specified in Sec. 648.85(a) or Sec. 
648.86 and may discard fish in excess of the applicable trip limits.
    (F) Minimum Category A DAS and B DAS accrual. For a vessel fishing 
under the Regular B DAS Program, the number of Regular B DAS that may be 
used on a trip cannot exceed the number of Category A DAS that the 
vessel has at the start of the trip. If a vessel is fishing in an area 
subject to differential DAS counting pursuant to Sec. 648.82(n)(1), the 
number of Regular B DAS that may be used on a trip cannot exceed the 
number of Category A DAS that the vessel has at the start of the trip 
divided by the applicable differential DAS counting factor specified in 
Sec. 648.82(n)(1)(ii). For example, if a vessel plans a trip under the 
Regular B DAS Program in the Inshore GOM Differential DAS Area during a 
fishing year in which the area is subject to a differential DAS counting 
factor of 1.2, and the vessel has 10 Category A DAS available at the 
start of the trip, the maximum number of Regular B DAS that the vessel 
may fish under the Regular B Program is 8 (10 divided by 1.2 = 8.33, but 
since Regular B DAS are charged in 24-hr intervals, 8 Regular B DAS is 
the maximum that can be used for this trip). A vessel fishing in the 
Regular B DAS Program for its entire trip shall accrue DAS in accordance 
with Sec. 648.82(e)(1).
    (G) Restrictions when 100 percent of the incidental catch TAC is 
harvested. With the exception of white hake, when the Regional 
Administrator provides notification through rulemaking consistent with 
the Administrative Procedure Act, that 100 percent of one or more of 
quarterly incidental TACs specified under paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this 
section has projected to have been harvested, the use of Regular B DAS 
shall be prohibited in the pertinent stock area(s) as defined under 
paragraph (b)(6)(v) of this section for the duration of the calendar 
quarter. The closure of a stock area to all Regular B DAS use will occur 
even if the quarterly incidental catch TACs for other stocks in that 
stock area have not been completely harvested. When the Regional 
Administrator projects that 100 percent of the quarterly white hake 
incidental catch TAC specified under paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this 
section has been harvested, vessels fishing under a Regular B DAS, or 
that complete a trip under a

[[Page 703]]

Regular B DAS, will be prohibited from retaining white hake.
    (H) Closure of Regular B DAS Program and quarterly DAS limits. 
Unless otherwise closed as a result of the harvest of an Incidental 
Catch TAC as described in paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(G) of this section, or as 
a result of an action by the Regional Administrator under paragraph 
(b)(6)(vi) of this section, the use of Regular B DAS shall, in a manner 
consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act, be prohibited when 500 
Regular B DAS have been used during the first quarter of the fishing 
year (May-July), or when 1,000 Regular B DAS have been used during any 
of the remaining quarters of the fishing year, in accordance with Sec. 
648.82(e)(1).
    (I) Reporting requirements. The owner or operator of a NE 
multispecies DAS vessel must submit catch reports via VMS in accordance 
with instructions provided by the Regional Administrator, for each day 
fished when declared into the Regular B DAS Program. The reports must be 
submitted in 24-hr intervals for each day, beginning at 0000 hr and 
ending at 2359 hr. The reports must be submitted by 0900 hr of the 
following day. For vessels that have declared into the Regular B DAS 
Program in accordance with paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(C) of this section, the 
reports must include at least the following information: VTR serial 
number or other universal ID specified by the Regional Administrator; 
date fish were caught; statistical area fished; and the total pounds of 
cod, haddock, yellowtail flounder, winter flounder, witch flounder, 
pollock, American plaice, redfish, Atlantic halibut, and white hake kept 
in each broad stock area (in pounds, live weight), specified in Sec. 
648.10(k)(3), as instructed by the Regional Administrator. Daily 
reporting must continue even if the vessel operator is required to flip, 
as described in paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(E) of this section.
    (J) Gear requirement. (1) Vessels fishing with trawl gear in the 
Regular B DAS Program must use the haddock separator trawl or Ruhle 
trawl, as described in paragraphs (a)(3)(iii)(A) and (b)(6)(iv)(J)(3) of 
this section, respectively, or other type of gear if approved as 
described in this paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(J). Other gear may be on board 
the vessel, provided it is stowed when the vessel is fishing under the 
Regular B DAS Program pursuant to Sec. 648.23(b).
    (2) Approval of additional gear. At the request of the Council or 
the Council's Executive Committee, the Regional Administrator may 
authorize additional gear for use in the Regular B DAS Program, through 
notice consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act. The proposed 
gear must satisfy standards specified in paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(J)(2)(i) 
or (ii) of this section in a completed experiment that has been reviewed 
according to the standards established by the Council's research policy 
before the gear can be considered and approved by the Regional 
Administrator. Comparisons of the criteria specified in this paragraph 
(b)(6)(iv)(J)(2) will be made to an appropriately selected control gear.
    (i) The gear must show a statistically significant reduction in 
catch of at least 50 percent (by weight, on a trip-by-trip basis) of 
each regulated species stock of concern, unless otherwise allowed in 
this paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(J)(2)(i), or other non-groundfish stocks that 
are overfished or subject to overfishing identified by the Council. This 
requirement does not apply to regulated species identified by the 
Council as not being subject to gear performance standards; or
    (ii) The catch of each regulated species stock of concern, unless 
otherwise allowed in this paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(J)(2)(ii), or other non-
groundfish stocks that are overfished or subject to overfishing 
identified by the Council, must be less than 5 percent of the total 
catch of regulated groundfish (by weight, on a trip-by-trip basis). This 
requirement does not apply to regulated species identified by the 
Council as not being subject to gear performance standards.
    (3) Ruhle Trawl. The Ruhle Trawl is a four-seam bottom groundfish 
trawl designed to reduce the bycatch of cod while retaining or 
increasing the catch of haddock, when compared to traditional groundfish 
trawls. A Ruhle Trawl must be constructed in accordance with the 
standards described and referenced in this paragraph

[[Page 704]]

Sec. 648.85(b)(6)(iv)(J)(3). The mesh size of a particular section of 
the Ruhle Trawl is measured in accordance with Sec. 648.80(f)(2), 
unless insufficient numbers of mesh exist, in which case the maximum 
total number of meshes in the section will be measured (between 2 and 20 
meshes).
    (i) The net must be constructed with four seams (i.e., a net with a 
top and bottom panel and two side panels), and include at least the 
following net sections as depicted in Figure 1 of this part (this figure 
is also available from the Administrator, Northeast Region): Top jib, 
bottom jib, jib side panels (x 2), top wing, bottom wing, wing side 
panels (x 2), bunt, square, square side panels (x 2), first top belly, 
first bottom belly, first belly side panels (x 2), and second bottom 
belly.
    (ii) The top and bottom jibs, jib side panels, top and bottom wings, 
and wing side panels, bunt, and first bottom belly (the first bottom 
belly and all portions of the net in front of the first bottom belly, 
with the exception of the square and the square side panels) must be at 
least two meshes long in the fore and aft direction. For these net 
sections, the stretched length of any single mesh must be at least 7.9 
ft (240 cm), measured in a straight line from knot to knot.
    (iii) Mesh size in all other sections must be consistent with mesh 
size requirements specified under Sec. 648.80 and meet the following 
minimum specifications: Each mesh in the square, square side panels, and 
second bottom belly must be 31.5 inches (80 cm); each mesh in the first 
top belly, and first belly side panels must be at least 7.9 inches (20 
cm); and 6 inches (15.24 cm) or larger in sections following the first 
top belly and second bottom belly sections, all the way to the codend. 
The mesh size requirements of the top sections apply to the side panel 
sections.
    (iv) The trawl must have at least 15 meshes (240 cm each) at the 
wide end of the first bottom belly, excluding the gore.
    (v) The trawl must have a single or multiple kite panels with a 
total surface area of at least 19.3 sq. ft. (1.8 sq. m) on the forward 
end of the square to help maximize headrope height, for the purpose of 
capturing rising fish. A kite panel is a flat structure, usually semi-
flexible, used to modify the shape of trawl and mesh openings by 
providing lift when a trawl is moving through the water.
    (4) Mesh size. An eligible vessel fishing in the Regular B DAS 
Program within the GB Cod Stock Area as defined in paragraph 
(b)(6)(v)(B) of this section pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this 
section must use trawl gear described in this paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(J) 
with a minimum codend mesh size of 6-inch (15.24-cm) square or diamond 
mesh.
    (v) Definition of stock areas. The species stock areas associated 
with the incidental catch TACs for the Regular B DAS Program are defined 
in paragraphs (b)(6)(v)(A) through (K) of this section. Where specified, 
these areas also identify stock areas applicable for trip limits 
specified in Sec. 648.86 and for determining areas applicable to sector 
allocations of ACE pursuant to Sec. 648.87(b). Copies of a chart 
depicting these areas are available from the Regional Administrator upon 
request.
    (A) GOM cod stock area. The GOM cod stock area, for the purposes of 
the Regular B DAS Program and determining areas applicable to sector 
allocations of ACE pursuant to Sec. 648.87(b), is defined as the area 
bounded on the north and west by the coastline of the United States, on 
the east by the U.S./Canadian maritime boundary, and on the south by 
straight lines connecting the following points in the order stated:

specified in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section. Further program 
restrictions specific to sector and common pool vessels are specified in 
paragraphs (b)(7)(v) and (vi) of this section, respectively.
    (A) DAS use restrictions. A vessel fishing in the Closed Area I Hook 
Gear Haddock SAP under a NE multispecies DAS may not initiate a DAS 
flip. A vessel is prohibited from fishing in the Closed Area I Hook Gear 
Haddock SAP while making a trip under the Regular B DAS Program 
described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. DAS will be charged as 
described in Sec. 648.10.
    (B) VMS requirement. An eligible NE multispecies vessel fishing in 
the CA I Hook Gear Haddock SAP specified in this paragraph (b)(7) must 
have installed on board an operational VMS unit that meets the minimum 
performance criteria specified in Sec. Sec. 648.9 and 648.10.
    (C) Observer notifications. For the purpose of selecting vessels for 
observer deployment, a vessel must provide notice to NMFS of the vessel 
name; contact name for coordination of observer deployment; telephone 
number for contact; and date, time, and port of departure at least 48 hr 
prior to the beginning of any trip that it declares into the CA I Hook 
Gear Haddock SAP, as required in paragraph (b)(7)(iv)(C) of this 
section, and in accordance with instructions provided by the Regional 
Administrator.
    (D) VMS declaration. To fish in the CA I Hook Gear Haddock SAP prior 
to departure from port, a vessel must declare into the SAP via VMS, and, 
for a vessel fishing under a NE multispecies DAS, indicate the type of 
DAS that it intends to fish, prior to departure from port, as instructed 
by the Regional Administrator. A vessel declared into the CA I Hook Gear 
Haddock SAP may fish only in the CA I Hook Gear Haddock Special Access 
Area described in paragraph (b)(7)(ii) of this section on a declared 
trip.

longline

[[Page 708]]

gear or tub trawl gear only, unless further restricted as specified in 
paragraphs (b)(7)(v)(A) and (vi)(B) of this section.
    (F) Haddock TAC. The maximum total amount of haddock that may be 
caught (landings and discards) in the CA I Hook Gear Haddock SAP Area in 
any fishing year is based upon the size of the TAC allocated for the 
2004 fishing year (1,130 mt live weight), adjusted according to the 
growth or decline of the western GB (WGB) haddock exploitable biomass 
(in relationship to its size in 2004), according to the following 
formula: BiomassYEAR X = (1,130 mt live weight) x (Projected WGB Haddock 
ExploitableBiomassYEAR X/WGB Haddock Exploitable Biomass2004). The size 
of the western component of the stock is considered to be 35 percent of 
the total stock size, unless modified by a stock assessment. The 
Regional Administrator shall specify the haddock TAC for the SAP, in a 
manner consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act.
    (G) Trip restrictions. A vessel is prohibited from deploying fishing 
gear outside of the CA I Hook Gear Haddock SAP Area on the same fishing 
trip on which it is declared into the CA I Hook Gear Haddock SAP. A 
vessel operating under a NE multispecies DAS must end the trip if the 
vessel exceeds the applicable landing limits described in paragraphs 
(b)(7)(v)(B) and (b)(7)(vi)(C) of this section.
    (H) Landing limits. For all vessels legally declared into the CA I 
Hook Gear Haddock SAP described in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section, 
landing limits for NE multispecies are specified in paragraphs 
(b)(7)(v)(B) and (b)(7)(vi)(C) of this section, respectively. Unless 
otherwise specified in this part, such vessels are prohibited from 
discarding legal-sized regulated species and ocean pout, and must exit 
the SAP and cease fishing if any trip limit is achieved or exceeded.
    (I) Mandatory closure of CA I Hook Gear Haddock Access Area. When 
the Regional Administrator determines that the haddock TAC specified in 
paragraph (b)(7)(iv)(F) of this section has been caught, NMFS shall 
close, in a manner consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act, the 
CA I Hook Gear Haddock SAP Area as specified in paragraph (b)(7)(ii) of 
this section, to all eligible vessels, including both common pool and 
sector vessels.
    (v) Sector vessel program restrictions. In addition to the general 
program restrictions specified in paragraph (b)(7)(iv) of this section, 
a sector vessel declared into the CA I Hook Gear Haddock SAP is also 
required to comply with the restrictions specified in this paragraph 
(b)(7)(v).
    (A) Gear restrictions. A sector vessel is subject to the gear 
requirements of the sector Operations Plan as approved under Sec. 
648.87(c) and those specified under paragraph (b)(7)(iv)(E) of this 
section.
    (B) Landing limits. A sector vessel declared into the CA I Hook Gear 
Haddock SAP described in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section is subject 
to the landing limits for regulated species in effect under the sector's 
Operations Plan, as approved under Sec. 648.87(c).
    (C) Reporting requirements. The owner or operator of a sector vessel 
declared into the CA I Hook Gear Haddock SAP must submit reports to the 
sector Manager, consistent with instructions to be provided by the 
sector Manager, for each day fished in the CA I Hook Gear Haddock SAP 
Area. The sector Manager shall provide daily reports to NMFS, including 
at least the following information: Total pounds of haddock, cod, 
yellowtail flounder, winter flounder, witch flounder, pollock, ocean 
pout, Atlantic halibut, Atlantic wolffish, and white hake kept; total 
pounds of haddock, cod, yellowtail flounder, winter flounder, witch 
flounder, pollock, ocean pout, Atlantic halibut, Atlantic wolffish, and 
white hake discarded; date fish were caught; and VTR serial numbers for 
each trip declared into the CA I Hook Gear Haddock SAP, as instructed by 
the Regional Administrator. Daily reporting must continue even if the 
vessel operator is required to exit the SAP as required under paragraph 
(b)(7)(iv)(G) or (H) of this section.
    (D) Incidental catch TACs. There are no incidental catch TACs 
specified for regulated species or ocean pout for sector vessels

    (iii) [Reserved]
    (iv) Season. An eligible vessel may fish in the Eastern U.S./Canada 
Haddock SAP from August 1 through December 31.
    (v) Program restrictions--(A) Area and DAS use restrictions. A 
common pool vessel fishing under a NE multispecies DAS in the Eastern 
U.S./Canada Haddock SAP may elect to fish under a Category A or Category 
B DAS in accordance with Sec. 648.82(d)(2), or in multiple areas in 
accordance with the restrictions of this paragraph (b)(8)(v)(A). A 
vessel on a sector trip in the Eastern U.S./Canada Haddock SAP may elect 
to fish in multiple areas in accordance with the restrictions of this 
paragraph (b)(8)(v)(A).
    (1) If fishing under a Category B DAS, a vessel is required to 
comply with the no discarding and DAS flip requirements specified in 
paragraph (b)(8)(v)(I) of this section, and the minimum Category A DAS 
requirements of paragraph (b)(8)(v)(J) of this section.
    (2) A vessel that is declared into the Eastern U.S./Canada Haddock 
SAP described in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section may fish, on the 
same trip, in the Eastern U.S./Canada Haddock SAP Area and in the Closed 
Area II Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP Area, as described in paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii) of this section, and, for common pool vessels fishing a NE 
multispecies DAS, while under either a Category A DAS or a Category B 
DAS.
    (3) A vessel may choose, on the same trip, to fish in either/both 
the Eastern U.S./Canada Haddock SAP Program and the Closed Area II 
Yellowtail Flounder/Haddock SAP Area, and in the portion of the Eastern 
U.S./Canada Area described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section that 
lies outside of these two SAPs, provided a common pool vessel fishes 
under a Category A DAS and all eligible vessels comply with the VMS 
restrictions of paragraph (b)(8)(v)(D) of this section. Such a vessel 
may also elect to fish outside of the Eastern U.S./Canada Area on the 
same trip, in accordance with the restrictions of paragraph 
(a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.
    (4) A common pool vessel fishing under a NE multispecies DAS that 
elects to fish in multiple areas, as described in this paragraph 
(b)(8)(v)(A), must fish under the most restrictive DAS counting 
requirements specified in Sec. 648.10(e)(5), trip limits, and reporting 
requirements of the areas fished for the entire trip. A vessel on a 
sector trip that elects to fish in multiple areas, as described in this 
paragraph (b)(8)(v)(A), must comply with the most restrictive reporting 
requirements of the areas fished for the entire trip, unless otherwise 
specified by the Regional Administrator in a manner consistent with the 
Administrative Procedure Act.
    (B) VMS requirement. A vessel issued a limited access NE 
multispecies permit fishing in the Eastern U.S./Canada Haddock SAP 
Program specified in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section must have 
installed on board an operational VMS unit that meets the minimum 
performance criteria specified in Sec. Sec. 648.9 and 648.10.
    (C) Observer notifications. For the purpose of selecting vessels for 
observer deployment, a vessel must provide notice to NMFS of the vessel 
name; contact name for coordination of observer deployment; telephone 
number for contact; areas to be fished; and date, time, and port of 
departure at least 72 hours prior to the beginning of any trip that it 
declares into the Eastern U.S./Canada Haddock SAP Program specified in

[[Page 711]]

paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section, as required under paragraph 
(b)(8)(v)(D) of this section, and in accordance with instructions 
provided by the Regional Administrator.
    (D) VMS declaration. To fish in the Eastern U.S./Canada Haddock SAP, 
a vessel issued a limited access NE multispecies permit must declare 
into the SAP via VMS and provide information on the areas within the 
Eastern U.S./Canada Area that it intends to fish and the type of DAS 
(Category A, Regular B, or Reserve B) that it intends to fish, if 
operating under the provisions of the common pool, prior to departure 
from port, in accordance with paragraph (b)(8)(v)(A) of this section and 
any instructions provided by the Regional Administrator.
    (E) Gear requirement--(1) Unless otherwise specified in this 
paragraph (b)(8)(v)(E)(1), a vessel issued a limited access NE 
multispecies permit fishing in the Eastern U.S./Canada Haddock SAP must 
use the haddock separator trawl or the Ruhle Trawl, as described in 
paragraphs (a)(3)(iii)(A) and (b)(6)(iv)(J)(3) of this section, 
respectively, or another type of gear, if approved as described in this 
paragraph (b)(8)(v)(E). A vessel on a sector trip in the Eastern U.S./
Canada Haddock SAP is not restricted to only using the haddock separator 
trawl or the Ruhle trawl, but may use any gear authorized in paragraph 
(a)(3)(iii) of this section, unless otherwise restricted by a sector 
operations plan approved pursuant to Sec. 648.87(c). Other gear may be 
on board the vessel when on a trip in the Eastern U.S./Canada Haddock 
SAP, provided that the gear is stowed in accordance with Sec. 
648.23(b).
    (2) Approval of additional gear. The Regional Administrator may 
authorize additional gear for use in the Eastern U.S./Canada Haddock SAP 
in accordance with the standards and requirements specified at Sec. 
648.85(b)(6)(iv)(J)(2).
    (F) Landing limits. Unless otherwise restricted under this part, a 
vessel fishing any portion of a trip in the Eastern U.S./Canada Haddock 
SAP under a NE multispecies DAS may not fish for, possess, or land more 
than 1,000 lb (453.6 kg) of cod, per trip, regardless of trip length. A 
common pool vessel fishing in the Eastern U.S./Canada Haddock SAP under 
a NE multispecies DAS is subject to the haddock requirements described 
in Sec. 648.86(a), unless further restricted under paragraph (a)(3)(iv) 
of this section. A common pool vessel fishing in the Eastern U.S./Canada 
Haddock SAP may not land more than 100 lb (45.5 kg) per DAS, or any part 
of a DAS, of GB yellowtail flounder and 100 lb (45.5 kg) of GB winter 
flounder, up to a maximum of 500 lb (227 kg) of all flatfish species, 
combined. Possession of monkfish (whole weight) and skates (whole 
weight) is limited to 500 lb (227 kg) each, unless otherwise restricted 
by Sec. 648.94(b)(3), and possession of lobsters is prohibited.
    (G) Reporting requirements. The owner or operator of a vessel 
declared into the Eastern U.S./Canada Haddock SAP, as described in 
paragraph (b)(8) of this section, must submit reports in accordance with 
the reporting requirements described in paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this 
section.
    (H) Incidental TACs. The maximum amount of GB cod, GB yellowtail 
flounder, GB winter flounder, and pollock, both landings and discards, 
that may be caught when fishing in the Eastern U.S./Canada Haddock SAP 
Program in a fishing year by vessels fishing under a Category B DAS, as 
authorized in paragraph (b)(8)(v)(A), is the amount specified in 
paragraphs (b)(5)(ii) and (iii) of this section. All regulated species 
and ocean pout caught by a vessel on a sector trip will be applied 
against the ACE for each stock that is specified for the sector in which 
the vessel participates.
    (I) No discard provision and DAS flips. A vessel fishing in the 
Eastern U.S./Canada Haddock SAP Program may not discard legal-sized 
regulated or ocean pout unless otherwise required due to a prohibition 
of the possession of such species specified in this part. If a common 
pool vessel fishing in the Eastern U.S./Canada Haddock SAP under a 
Category B DAS exceeds the applicable maximum landing limit per trip 
specified in paragraph (b)(8)(v)(F) of this section, or in Sec. 648.86, 
the vessel operator must retain the fish and immediately notify NMFS via 
VMS to initiate a DAS flip (from a Category B DAS to a Category A DAS). 
After flipping to a Category A DAS, the vessel is

[[Page 712]]

subject to all applicable landing limits specified in Sec. 648.85(a) or 
Sec. 648.86. If a common pool vessel fishing in this SAP while under a 
Category B DAS or a Category A DAS exceeds a trip limit specified in 
paragraph (b)(8)(v)(F) of this section or Sec. 648.86, or other 
applicable trip limit, the vessel must immediately exit the SAP area 
defined in paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this section for the remainder of the 
trip. For a common pool vessel that notifies NMFS of a DAS flip, the 
Category B DAS that have accrued between the time the vessel started 
accruing Category B DAS and the time the vessel declared its DAS flip 
will be accrued as Category A DAS pursuant to Sec. 648.82(e)(1), and 
not Category B DAS.
    (J) Minimum Category A DAS. To fish under a Category B DAS, the 
number of Category B DAS that can be used on a trip cannot exceed the 
number of available Category A DAS the vessel has at the start of the 
trip.
    (K) Mandatory closure of Eastern U.S./Canada Haddock SAP. When the 
Regional Administrator projects that one or more of the TAC allocations 
specified in paragraph (b)(8)(v)(H) of this section has been caught by 
vessels fishing under Category B DAS, NMFS shall prohibit the use of 
Category B DAS in the Eastern U.S./Canada Haddock SAP, through 
publication in the Federal Register consistent with the Administrative 
Procedure Act. In addition, the closure regulations described in 
paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(E) of this section shall apply to the Eastern U.S./
Canada Haddock SAP Program.
    (L) General closure of the Eastern U.S./Canada Haddock SAP Area. The 
Regional Administrator, based upon information required under Sec. 
648.7, 648.9, 648.10, or 648.85, and any other relevant information may, 
through rulemaking consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act, 
close the Eastern U.S./Canada Haddock SAP Pilot Program for the duration 
of the season, if it is determined that continuation of the Eastern 
U.S./Canada Haddock SAP Pilot Program would undermine the achievement of 
the objectives of the FMP or the Eastern U.S./Canada Haddock SAP Pilot 
Program.
    (c) Scallop fishery closed area access program. Limited access 
scallop vessels operating under the Sea Scallop Area Access Program, as 
defined in Sec. 648.59, and fishing in accordance with the regulations 
at Sec. 648.60 may possess and land up to 1,000 lb (453.6 kg) of all NE 
multispecies combined, as provided in Sec. 648.60(a)(5)(ii), unless 
otherwise restricted in this section.
    (d) Haddock incidental catch allowance for some Atlantic herring 
vessels. The haddock incidental catch allowance for a vessel issued a 
Federal Atlantic herring permit and fishing with midwater trawl gear in 
Management Areas 1A, 1B, and/or 3, as defined in Sec. 648.200(f)(1) and 
(3), is 1 percent of each of the ABCs for GOM haddock and GB haddock 
(U.S. catch only) specified according to Sec. 648.90(a)(4) for a 
particular NE. multispecies fishing year. Such haddock catch will be 
determined as specified in Sec. 648.86(a)(3)(ii).
    (e) Authorized gear performance standards. Unless otherwise 
restricted in this part, in areas and times when a special management 
program, as specified in this section, requires the use of gear 
authorized by that program to reduce catches of stocks of concern, 
participating vessels are restricted to the following trip limits: 500 
lb (227 kg) of all flatfish species (American plaice, witch flounder, 
winter flounder, windowpane flounder, and GB yellowtail flounder), 
combined; 500 lb (227 kg) of monkfish (whole weight); 500 lb (227 kg) of 
skates (whole weight); and zero possession of lobsters, unless otherwise 
restricted by Sec. 648.94(b)(3).

Sec. 648.86  NE Multispecies possession restrictions.

    Except as provided in Sec. 648.17 or elsewhere in this part, the 
following possession restrictions apply:
    (a) Haddock--(1) NE multispecies common pool vessels. Haddock 
possession restrictions for such vessels may be implemented through 
Regional Administrator authority, as specified in paragraph (r) of this 
section.
    (2) Scallop dredge vessels. (i) No person owning or operating a 
scallop dredge

[[Page 713]]

vessel issued a NE multispecies permit may land haddock from, or possess 
haddock on board, a scallop dredge vessel from January 1 through June 
30.
    (ii) No person owning or operating a scallop dredge vessel without 
an NE multispecies permit may possess haddock in, or harvested from, the 
EEZ from January 1 through June 30.
    (iii) Unless otherwise authorized by the Regional Administrator as 
specified in paragraph (f) of this section, scallop dredge vessels or 
persons owning or operating a scallop dredge vessel that is fishing 
under a scallop DAS allocated under Sec. 648.53 may land or possess on 
board up to 300 lb (136.1 kg) of haddock, except as specified in Sec. 
648.88(c), provided that the vessel has at least one standard tote on 
board. This restriction does not apply to vessels also issued limited 
access NE multispecies permits that are fishing under a multispecies 
DAS. Haddock on board a vessel subject to this possession limit must be 
separated from other species of fish and stored so as to be readily 
available for inspection.
    (3)(i) Incidental catch allowance for some Atlantic herring vessels. 
A vessel issued an All Areas Limited Access Herring Permit and/or an 
Areas 2 and 3 Limited Access Herring Permit fishing on a declared 
herring trip, regardless of gear or area fished, or a vessel issued a 
Limited Access Incidental Catch Herring Permit and/or an Open Access 
Herring Permit and fishing with midwater trawl gear pursuant to Sec. 
648.80(d), may only possess and land haddock, in accordance with 
requirements specified in Sec. 648.80(d) and (e).
    (ii) Haddock incidental catch cap. (A)(1) When the Regional 
Administrator has determined that the incidental catch allowance for a 
given haddock stock as specified in Sec. 648.85(d), has been caught, no 
vessel issued an Atlantic herring permit and fishing with midwater trawl 
gear in the applicable stock area, i.e., the Herring GOM Haddock 
Accountability Measure (AM) Area or Herring GB Haddock AM Area, as 
defined in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A)(2) and (3) of this section, may fish 
for, possess, or land herring in excess of 2,000 lb (907.2 kg) per trip 
in or from that area, unless all herring possessed and landed by the 
vessel were caught outside the applicable AM Area and the vessel 
complies with the gear stowage provisions specified in Sec. 648.23(b) 
while transiting the AM Area. Upon this determination, the haddock 
possession limit is reduced to 0 lb (0 kg) for a vessel issued a Federal 
Atlantic herring permit and fishing with midwater trawl gear or for a 
vessel issued an All Areas Limited Access Herring Permit and/or an Areas 
2 and 3 Limited Access Herring Permit fishing on a declared herring 
trip, regardless of area fished or gear used, in the applicable AM area, 
unless the vessel also possesses a NE. multispecies permit and is 
operating on a declared (consistent with Sec. 648.10(g)) NE. 
multispecies trip. In making this determination, the Regional 
Administrator shall use haddock catches observed by NMFS-approved 
observers by herring vessel trips using midwater trawl gear in 
Management Areas 1A, 1B, and/or 3, as defined in Sec. 648.200(f)(1) and 
(3), expanded to an estimate of total haddock catch for all such trips 
in a given haddock stock area.
    (2) Herring GOM Haddock Accountability Measure Area. The Herring GOM 
Haddock AM Area is defined by the straight lines connecting the 
following points in the order stated (copies of a map depicting the area 
are available from the Regional Administrator upon request):

    (4) The haddock incidental catch caps specified are for the NE 
multispecies fishing year (May 1-April 30), which differs from the 
herring fishing year (January 1-December 31). If the haddock incidental 
catch allowance is attained by the herring midwater trawl fishery for 
the GOM or GB, as specified in Sec. 648.85(d), the 2,000-lb (907.2-kg) 
limit on herring possession in the applicable AM Area, as described in 
paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A)(2) or (3) of this section, shall be in effect 
until the end of the NE. multispecies fishing year. For example, the 
2011 haddock incidental catch cap is specified for the period May 1, 
2011-April 30, 2012, and the 2012 haddock catch cap would be specified 
for the period May 1, 2012-April 30, 2013. If the catch of haddock by 
herring midwater trawl vessels reached the 2011 incidental catch cap at 
any time prior to the end of the NE. multispecies fishing year (April 
30, 2012), the 2,000-lb (907.2-kg) limit on possession of herring in the 
applicable AM Area would extend through April 30, 2012. Beginning May 1, 
2012, the 2012 catch cap would go into effect.
    (B) [Reserved]
    (b) Cod--(1) GOM cod landing limit. Except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(4) of this section, or unless otherwise restricted under Sec. 
648.85, a vessel fishing under a NE multispecies DAS permit, including a 
vessel issued a monkfish limited access permit and fishing under the 
monkfish Category C or D permit provisions, may land up to 800 lb (362.9 
kg) of cod for each DAS, or part of a DAS, up to 4,000 lb (1,818.2 kg) 
per trip. Cod on board a vessel subject to this landing limit must be 
separated from other species of fish and stored so as to be readily 
available for inspection.
    (2) GB cod landing and maximum possession limits. Unless otherwise 
restricted under Sec. 648.85, a vessel fishing under a NE multispecies 
DAS permit, including a vessel issued a monkfish limited access permit 
and fishing under the monkfish Category C or D permit provisions, may 
land up to 2,000 lb (907.2 kg) of cod per DAS, or part of a DAS, up to 
20,000 lb (9,072 kg) provided it complies with the requirements 
specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section and this paragraph (b)(2). 
Cod on board a vessel subject to this landing limit must be separated 
from other species of fish and stored so as to be readily available for 
inspection.
    (3) [Reserved]
    (4) Exemption. A common pool vessel fishing under a NE multispecies 
DAS is exempt from the landing limit described in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section when fishing south of the GOM Regulated Mesh Area, defined 
in Sec. 648.80(a)(1), provided that it complies with the requirement of 
this paragraph (b)(4).
    (i) Declaration. With the exception of a vessel declared into the 
U.S./Canada Management Area, as described in Sec. 648.85(a)(3)(ii), a 
common pool vessel that fishes or intends to fish under a NE 
multispecies DAS south of the line described in paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section, under the cod trip limits described in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, must, prior to leaving port, declare its intention to do so 
through the VMS, in accordance with instructions to be provided by the 
Regional Administrator. In lieu of a VMS declaration, the Regional 
Administrator may authorize such vessels to obtain a letter

[[Page 715]]

of authorization. If a letter of authorization is required, such vessel 
may not fish north of the exemption area for a minimum of 7 consecutive 
days (when fishing under the multispecies DAS program), and must carry 
the letter of authorization on board.
    (ii) A common pool vessel exempt from the GOM cod landing limit 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section may not fish north of 
the line specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section for the duration 
of the trip, but may transit the GOM Regulated Mesh Area, provided that 
its gear is stowed in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 648.23(b). 
A vessel fishing north and south of the line on the same trip is subject 
to the most restrictive applicable cod trip limit.
    (c) Atlantic halibut. A vessel issued a NE multispecies permit under 
Sec. 648.4(a)(1) may land or possess on board no more than one Atlantic 
halibut per trip, provided the vessel complies with other applicable 
provisions of this part, unless otherwise specified in Sec. 
648.90(a)(5)(i)(D)(2).
    (d) Small-mesh multispecies. (1) Vessels issued a valid Federal NE 
multispecies permit specified under Sec. 648.4(a)(1) are subject to the 
following possession limits for small-mesh multispecies, which are based 
on the mesh size used by, or on board vessels fishing for, in possession 
of, or landing small-mesh multispecies.
    (i) Vessels possessing on board or using nets of mesh size smaller 
than 2.5 inches (6.35 cm). Owners or operators of a vessel may possess 
and land not more than 3,500 lb (1,588 kg) of combined silver hake and 
offshore hake if either of the following conditions apply:
    (A) The mesh size of any net or any part of a net used by or on 
board the vessel is smaller than 2.5 inches (6.35 cm), as applied to the 
part of the net specified in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section, as 
measured in accordance with Sec. 648.80(f); or
    (B) The mesh size of any net or part of a net on board the vessel 
not incorporated into a fully constructed net is smaller than 2.5 inches 
(6.35 cm), as measured by methods specified in Sec. 648.80(f). 
``Incorporated into a fully constructed net'' means that any mesh 
smaller than 2.5 inches (6.35 cm) that is incorporated into a fully 
constructed net may occur only in the part of the net not subject to the 
mesh size restrictions specified in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this 
section, and the net into which the mesh is incorporated must be 
available for immediate use.
    (ii) Vessels possessing on board or using nets of mesh size equal to 
or greater than 2.5 inches (6.35 cm) but less than 3 inches (7.62 cm). 
Owners or operators of a vessel that is not subject to the possession 
limit specified in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section may possess and 
land not more than 7,500 lb (3,402 kg) of combined silver hake and 
offshore hake if either of the following conditions apply:
    (A) The mesh size of any net or any part of a net used by or on 
board the vessel is equal to or greater than 2.5 inches (6.35 cm) but 
smaller than 3 inches (7.62 cm), as applied to the part of the net 
specified in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section, as measured by 
methods specified in Sec. 648.80(f); or
    (B) The mesh size of any net or part of a net on board the vessel 
not incorporated into a fully constructed net is equal to or greater 
than 2.5 inches (6.35 cm) but smaller than 3 inches (7.62 cm), as 
measured by methods specified in Sec. 648.80(f). ``Incorporated into a 
fully constructed net'' means that any mesh smaller than 2.5 inches 
(6.35 cm) that is incorporated into a fully constructed net may occur 
only in the part of the net not subject to the mesh size restrictions as 
specified in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section, and the net into 
which the mesh is incorporated must be available for immediate use.
    (iii) Vessels possessing on board or using nets of mesh size equal 
to or greater than 3 inches (7.62 cm). An owner or operator of a vessel 
that is not subject to the possession limits specified in paragraphs 
(d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section may possess and land not more than 
30,000 lb (13,608 kg) of combined silver hake and offshore hake if both 
of the following conditions apply:
    (A) The mesh size of any net or any part of a net used by or on 
board the vessel is equal to or greater than 3 inches (7.62 cm), as 
applied to the part of the net specified in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this 
section, as measured by methods specified in Sec. 648.80(f); and

[[Page 716]]

    (B) The mesh size of any net or part of a net on board the vessel 
not incorporated into a fully constructed net is equal to or greater 
than 3 inches (7.62 cm), as measured by methods specified in Sec. 
648.80(f). ``Incorporated into a fully constructed net'' means that any 
mesh smaller than 3 inches (7.62 cm) that is incorporated into a fully 
constructed net may occur only in the part of the net not subject to the 
mesh size restrictions as specified in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this 
section, and the net into which the mesh is incorporated must be 
available for immediate use.
    (iv) Application of mesh size. Counting from the terminus of the 
net, the mesh size restrictions specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) 
through (iii) of this section are only applicable to the first 100 
meshes (200 bars in the case of square mesh) for vessels greater than 60 
ft (18.3 m) in length, and to the first 50 meshes (100 bars in the case 
of square mesh) for vessels 60 ft (18.3 m) or less in length. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the restrictions 
and conditions pertaining to mesh size do not apply to nets or pieces of 
net smaller than 3 ft by 3 ft (0.9 m by 0.9 m), (9 sq ft (0.81 sq m)).
    (2) Possession limit for vessels participating in the northern 
shrimp fishery. Owners and operators of vessels participating in the 
Small-Mesh Northern Shrimp Fishery Exemption Area, as described in Sec. 
648.80(a)(3), with a vessel issued a valid Federal NE multispecies 
permit specified under Sec. 648.4(a)(1), may possess and land silver 
hake and offshore hake, combined, up to an amount equal to the weight of 
shrimp on board, not to exceed 3,500 lb (1,588 kg). Silver hake and 
offshore hake on board a vessel subject to this possession limit must be 
separated from other species of fish and stored so as to be readily 
available for inspection.
    (3) Possession restriction for vessels electing to transfer small-
mesh NE multispecies at sea. Owners and operators of vessels issued a 
valid Federal NE multispecies permit and issued a letter of 
authorization to transfer small-mesh NE multispecies at sea according to 
the provisions specified in Sec. 648.13(b) are subject to a combined 
silver hake and offshore hake possession limit that is 500 lb (226.8 kg) 
less than the possession limit the vessel otherwise receives. This 
deduction shall be noted on the transferring vessel's letter of 
authorization from the Regional Administrator.
    (4) In-season adjustment of small-mesh multispecies possession 
limits. If the Regional Administrator projects that 90 percent of a 
stock area TAL, as defined in Sec. 648.90(b)(3), has been landed, the 
Regional Administrator shall reduce the possession limit of that stock 
described in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section, for the 
remainder of the fishing year through notice consistent with the 
Administrative Procedure Act, unless such a reduction in the possession 
limit would be expected to prevent the TAL from being reached.
    (i) Red hake. If a possession limit reduction is needed for a stock 
area, the incidental possession limit for red hake in that stock area 
will be 400 lb (181.44 kg) for the remainder of the fishing year.
    (ii) Silver hake and offshore hake. If a possession limit reduction 
is needed for a stock area, the incidental possession limit for silver 
hake and offshore hake, combined, in that stock area will be 1,000 lb 
(453.59 kg) for the remainder of the fishing year.
    (e) White hake. Unless otherwise restricted under this part, a 
common pool vessel fishing under a NE multispecies DAS, a limited access 
Handgear A permit, an open access Handgear B permit, or a monkfish 
limited access permit and fishing under the monkfish Category C or D 
permit provisions is not restricted in the amount of white hake the 
vessel may land per trip during fishing years 2010 and 2011. Starting in 
fishing year 2012, unless otherwise restricted under this part, a common 
pool vessel fishing under a NE multispecies DAS, a limited access 
Handgear A permit, an open access Handgear B permit, or a monkfish 
limited access permit and fishing under the monkfish Category C or D 
permit provisions may land up to 500 lb (226.8 kg) of white hake per 
DAS, or any part of a DAS, up to 2,000 lb (907.2 kg) per trip.
    (f) Calculation of weight of fillets or parts of fish. The 
possession limits described under this part are based on the weight of 
whole, whole-gutted, or gilled

[[Page 717]]

fish. For purposes of determining compliance with the possession limits 
specified in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section, the weight of 
fillets and parts of fish, other than whole-gutted or gilled fish, as 
allowed under Sec. 648.83(a) and (b), will be multiplied by 3.
    (g) Yellowtail flounder--(1) CC/GOM and SNE/MA yellowtail flounder 
landing limit. Unless otherwise restricted under this part, a common 
pool vessel fishing under a NE multispecies DAS, a limited access 
Handgear A permit, an open access Handgear B permit, or a monkfish 
limited access permit and fishing under the monkfish Category C or D 
permit provisions, and fishing exclusively outside of the U.S./Canada 
Management Area, as defined in Sec. 648.85(a)(1), may land or possess 
on board up to 250 lb (113.6 kg) of yellowtail flounder per DAS, or any 
part of a DAS, up to a maximum possession limit of 1,500 lb (680.4 kg) 
per trip. A vessel fishing outside and inside of the U.S./Canada 
Management Area on the same trip is subject to the more restrictive 
yellowtail flounder trip limit (i.e., that specified by this paragraph 
(g) or Sec. 648.85(a)(3)(iv)(C)).
    (2) GB yellowtail flounder landing limit. Unless otherwise 
restricted under this part, a common pool vessel fishing under a NE 
multispecies DAS, a limited access Handgear A permit, an open access 
Handgear B permit, or a monkfish limited access permit and fishing under 
the monkfish Category C or D permit provisions, and fishing in the U.S./
Canada Management Area defined in Sec. 648.85(a)(1) is subject to the 
GB yellowtail flounder limit described in paragraph Sec. 
648.85(a)(3)(iv)(c).
    (h) Other possession restrictions. Vessels are subject to any other 
applicable possession limit restrictions of this part.
    (i) Offloading requirement for vessels possessing species regulated 
by a daily possession limit. A vessel that has ended a trip as specified 
in Sec. 648.10(e)(2)(iii) or (h)(5) that possesses on board species 
regulated by a daily possession limit (i.e., pounds per DAS), as 
specified at Sec. 648.85 or Sec. 648.86, must offload species in 
excess of the daily landing limit prior to leaving port on a subsequent 
trip. A vessel may retain on board up to one day's worth of such species 
prior to the start of a subsequent trip. Other species regulated by an 
overall trip limit may be retained on board for a subsequent trip. For 
example, a vessel that possesses cod and winter flounder harvested from 
Georges Bank is subject to a daily possession limit for cod of 1,000 lb 
(453 kg)/DAS and an overall trip limit of 5,000 lb (2,267 kg)/trip for 
winter flounder. In this example, the vessel would be required to 
offload any cod harvested in excess of 1,000 lb (453 kg) (i.e., the 
vessel may retain up to 1,000 lb (453 kg) of Georges Bank cod, but must 
offload any additional cod), but may retain on board winter flounder up 
to the maximum trip limit prior to leaving port and crossing the VMS 
Demarcation Line to begin a subsequent trip.
    (j) GB winter flounder. Unless otherwise restricted under this part, 
a common pool vessel fishing under a NE multispecies DAS, a limited 
access Handgear A permit, an open access Handgear B permit, or a 
monkfish limited access permit and fishing under the monkfish Category C 
or D permit provisions and fishing in the U.S./Canada Management Area 
defined in Sec. 648.85(a)(1) is not restricted in the amount of GB 
winter flounder the vessel may land per trip.
    (k) Other regulated NE. multispecies possession restrictions for 
some Atlantic herring vessels. A vessel issued an All Areas Limited 
Access Herring Permit and/or an Areas 2 and 3 Limited Access Herring 
Permit on a declared herring trip, regardless of area fished or gear 
used, or a vessel issued a Limited Access Incidental Catch Herring 
Permit and/or an Open Access Herring Permit and fishing with midwater 
trawl gear pursuant to Sec. 648.80(d), may possess and land haddock, 
and up to 100 lb (45 kg), combined, of other regulated NE. multispecies, 
other than haddock, in accordance with the requirements in Sec. 
648.80(d) and (e). Such fish may not be sold for human consumption.
    (l) Ocean pout, windowpane flounder, SNE/MA winter flounder, and 
Atlantic wolffish. A vessel issued a limited access NE multispecies 
permit, an open access NE multispecies Handgear B permit, or a limited 
access monkfish permit and fishing under the monkfish Category C or D 
permit provisions may not fish for, possess, or land ocean

[[Page 718]]

pout, windowpane flounder, or Atlantic wolffish. In addition, such 
vessels may not fish for, possess, or land winter flounder caught in or 
from the SNE/MA winter flounder stock area, as defined in Sec. 
648.85(b)(6)(v)(F). Vessels may transit this area with GOM or GB winter 
flounder on board the vessel, provided that gear is stowed in accordance 
with the provisions of Sec. 648.23(b).
    (m) Additional possession restrictions--(1) Daily landing 
restriction. A vessel issued a limited access NE multispecies permit, an 
open access NE multispecies Handgear B permit, or a limited access 
monkfish permit and fishing under the monkfish Category C or D permit 
provisions may only land regulated species or ocean pout once in any 24-
hr period, based upon the time the vessel lands following the end of the 
previous trip. For example, if a vessel lands 1,600 lb (725.7 kg) of GOM 
cod at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, that vessel cannot land any more regulated 
species or ocean pout until at least 6 p.m. on the following Wednesday.
    (2) Possession limits for vessels fishing in multiple areas. If a 
vessel fishes in more than one stock area on the same trip, as defined 
in Sec. 648.85(b)(6)(v) or Sec. 648.87(b)(1)(ii), the most restrictive 
trip limit for a species applies for the entire trip.
    (n) Pollock. Unless otherwise restricted under this part, a vessel 
issued a NE multispecies DAS permit, a limited access Handgear A permit, 
an open access Handgear B permit, or a monkfish limited access permit 
and fishing under the monkfish Category C or D permit provisions, may 
not possess or land more than 1,000 lb (450 kg) of pollock for each DAS 
or part of a DAS fished, up to 10,000 lb (4,500 kg) per trip.
    (o) Regional Administrator authority to implement possession 
limits--(1) Possession restrictions to prevent exceeding common pool 
sub-ACLs. If the Regional Administrator projects that the catch of any 
NE multispecies stock allocated to common pool vessels pursuant to Sec. 
648.90(a)(4) will exceed the pertinent sub-ACL, NMFS may implement or 
adjust, at any time prior to or during the fishing year, in a manner 
consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act, a per-DAS possession 
limit and/or a maximum trip limit in order to prevent exceeding the 
common pool sub-ACL in that fishing year.
    (2) Possession restrictions to facilitate harvest of sub-ACLs 
allocated to the common pool. If the Regional Administrator projects 
that the sub-ACL of any stock allocated to the common pool pursuant to 
Sec. 648.90(a)(4) will not be caught during the fishing year, the 
Regional Administrator may remove or adjust, in a manner consistent with 
the Administrative Procedure Act, a per-DAS possession limit and/or a 
maximum trip limit in order to facilitate harvest and enable the total 
catch to approach, but not exceed, the pertinent sub-ACL allocated to 
the common pool for that fishing year.

<R05>
Sec. 648.87  Sector allocation.

    (a) Procedure for approving/implementing a sector allocation 
proposal. (1) Any person may submit a sector allocation proposal for a 
group of limited access NE multispecies vessels to the Council and 
request that the sector be implemented through either a biennial 
adjustment or framework adjustment, as specified in Sec. 648.90(a)(2), 
as long as it is submitted at least 1 year prior to the date the sector 
wants to begin operations in accordance with the conditions and 
restrictions of this section. The sector allocation proposal must 
contain an appropriate analysis that assesses the impact of the proposed 
sector, in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act.
    (2) Upon receipt of a sector allocation proposal, the Council must 
decide whether to initiate a management action to implement the sector 
proposal. Should a biennial adjustment or framework adjustment to 
authorize a sector allocation proposal be initiated, the Council will 
follow the framework adjustment provisions of Sec. 648.90(a)(2). Any 
biennial adjustment or framework adjustment developed to implement a 
sector allocation proposal must be in

[[Page 719]]

compliance with the general requirements specified in paragraphs (b) and 
(c) of this section.
    (3) Eligibility. Any valid limited access NE multispecies permit, 
including a Handgear A permit and those permits held in confirmation of 
permit history pursuant to Sec. 648.4(a)(1)(i)(J) as of May 1, 2008, is 
eligible to join a NE multispecies sector, provided the permit complies 
with the restrictions specified in this section. Any valid limited 
access Category A or B monkfish permit may be eligible to join a NE 
multispecies sector, as described in this section, pursuant to any 
measures adopted by a future revision to the Monkfish FMP by both the 
New England and Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Councils. Vessels that 
do not join a sector remain subject to the NE multispecies regulations 
for common pool vessels.
    (4) Minimum size. To be authorized to operate as a sector under this 
section, a sector must be comprised of at least three NE multispecies 
permits issued to at least three different persons, none of whom have 
any common ownership interests in the permits, vessels, or businesses 
associated with the permits issued the other two or more persons in that 
sector. Having an ownership interest in a permit includes, but is not 
limited to, persons or entities who are shareholders, officers, or 
partners in a corporation owning a permit; who are partners (general or 
limited) to a permit owner; who, in any way, partly own a permit; or who 
derive any financial benefit, or exercises any control over, another 
permit. As long as at least three persons issued a NE multispecies 
permit meet these requirements, permit owners may have common ownership 
interests in other permits, vessels, or businesses associated with such 
permits.
    (b) General requirements applicable to all approved Sectors. (1) All 
sectors approved under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section 
must submit the documents specified in paragraphs (a)(1), (b)(2), and 
(b)(3) of this section, and comply with the conditions and restrictions 
of this paragraph (b)(1).
    (i) TAC allocation--(A) Allocated stocks. Each sector shall be 
allocated a TAC in the form of an ACE for each NE multispecies stock, 
with the exception of Atlantic halibut, SNE/MA winter flounder, ocean 
pout, windowpane flounder (both the GOM/GB and the SNE/MA stocks), and 
Atlantic wolffish based upon the cumulative PSCs of vessels/permits 
participating in each sector during a particular fishing year, as 
described in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(E) of this section. In the event that a 
future allocation of SNE/MA winter flounder can be made available 
pursuant to the biennial adjustment or framework process specified in 
Sec. 648.90(a)(2), an ACE for this stock will be specified pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(1)(i)(E)(1) of this section.
    (B) Eastern GB stocks. Each sector allocated ACE for stocks managed 
under the terms of the U.S./Canada Resource Sharing Understanding in the 
Eastern U.S./Canada Area, as specified in Sec. 648.85(a), shall be 
allocated a specific portion of the ACE for such stocks that can only be 
harvested from the Eastern U.S./Canada Area, as specified in Sec. 
648.85(a)(1). The ACE specified for the Eastern U.S./Canada Area 
portions of these stocks shall be proportional to the sector's 
allocation of the overall ACL available to all vessels issued a limited 
access NE multispecies permit for these stocks pursuant to Sec. 
648.90(a)(4). For example, if a sector is allocated 10 percent of the GB 
cod ACL available to all vessels issued a limited access NE multispecies 
permit, that sector would also be allocated and may harvest 10 percent 
of that ACE from the Eastern U.S./Canada Area. In this example, if the 
overall GB cod ACL available to all vessels issued a limited access NE 
multispecies permit is 1,000 mt, of which 100 mt is specified to the 
Eastern U.S./Canada Area, the Sector would be allocated 100 mt of GB 
cod, of which no more than 10 mt could be harvested from the Eastern 
U.S./Canada Area and no more than 90 mt could be harvested from the rest 
of the GB cod stock area.
    (C) Carry-over. With the exception of GB yellowtail flounder, a 
sector may carry over an amount of ACE equal to up to 10 percent of its 
original ACE allocation for each stock that is unused at the end of one 
fishing year into the following fishing year. Any unused ACE allocated 
for Eastern GB stocks pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) of

[[Page 720]]

this section will contribute to the 10-percent carry-over allowance for 
each stock, as specified in this paragraph (b)(1)(i)(C), but will not 
increase an individual sector's allocation of Eastern GB stocks during 
the following year. This carry-over ACE remains effective during the 
subsequent fishing year even if vessels that contributed to the sector 
allocation during the previous fishing year are no longer participating 
in the same sector for the subsequent fishing year.
    (D) Maximum ACE allocation. There is no maximum amount of ACE that 
can be allocated to a particular sector during each fishing year.
    (E) Potential sector contribution (PSC). For the purposes of 
allocating a share of the available ACL for each NE multispecies stock 
to approved sectors pursuant to Sec. 648.90(a)(4), the landings history 
of all limited access NE multispecies permits shall be evaluated to 
determine each permit's share of the overall landings for each NE 
multispecies stock as specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(E)(1) and (2) of 
this section. When calculating an individual permit's share of the 
overall landings for a particular regulated species or ocean pout stock, 
landed weight shall be converted to live weight to maintain consistency 
with the way ACLs are calculated pursuant to Sec. 648.90(a)(4) and the 
way ACEs are allocated to sectors pursuant to this paragraph (b)(1)(i). 
This calculation shall be performed on July 1 of each year, unless 
another date is specified by the Regional Administrator, to redistribute 
the landings history associated with permits that have been voluntarily 
relinquished or otherwise canceled among all remaining valid limited 
access NE multispecies permits as of that date during the following 
fishing year. The PSC calculated pursuant to this paragraph (b)(1)(i)(E) 
shall remain with the permit indefinitely, but may be permanently 
reduced or eliminated due to a permit sanction or other enforcement 
action.
    (1) Calculation of PSC for all NE multispecies stocks except GB cod. 
Unless otherwise specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(E)(2) of this section, 
for each valid limited access NE multispecies permit, including limited 
access NE multispecies Handgear A permits, landings recorded in the NMFS 
dealer database of each stock of NE multispecies determined by NMFS to 
be the landings history associated with that permit while subject to the 
NE multispecies regulations based on whether the vessel fishing under 
that permit was issued a limited access NE multispecies permit or 
subsequently qualified for a limited access NE multispecies permit 
pursuant to Sec. 648.4(a)(1)(i), including regulated species or ocean 
pout caught under a NE multispecies DAS when participating in the skate 
or monkfish fisheries, but excluding, for example, landings by scallop 
vessels operating under a scallop DAS, shall be summed for fishing years 
1996 through 2006. This sum shall then be divided by the total landings 
of each NE multispecies stock during the same period by all permits 
eligible to join sectors as of May 1, 2008. The resulting figure shall 
then be multiplied by a factor of 1/PSC of remaining permits as of June 
1 of each year, unless another date is specified by the Regional 
Administrator, to calculate the PSC for each individual valid limited 
access NE multispecies permit for each regulated species or ocean pout 
stock allocated to sectors in the NE multispecies fishery for the 
following fishing year pursuant to this paragraph (b)(1)(i)(E)(1).
    (2) Calculation of GB cod PSC. The GB cod PSC shall be calculated as 
specified in this paragraph (b)(1)(i)(E)(2) and shall remain with the 
permit indefinitely regardless whether the vessel participates in either 
the GB Cod Hook Gear Sector or the GB Cod Fixed Gear Sector, as defined 
in Sec. 648.87(d)(1) or (2), joins a new sector, or fishes pursuant to 
the provisions of the common pool.
    (i) GB cod PSC for permits committed to participate in the GB Cod 
Hook Gear Sector or GB Cod Fixed Gear Sector. For each owner of a valid 
NE multispecies permit, or CPH, that committed to participate in either 
the GB Cod Hook Gear Sector or the GB Cod Fixed Gear Sector as evidenced 
by a valid authorized signature executed on or before March 1, 2008, on 
a preliminary roster for either of these sectors, the PSC for GB cod 
shall be equal to the sum of dealer landings of GB cod for fishing years 
1996 through 2001, divided by the

[[Page 721]]

total landings of GB cod by permits eligible to join sectors as of May 
1, 2008, during that period. The PSC for all other regulated species or 
ocean pout stocks specified for these permits shall be calculated 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i)(E)(1) of this section. The PSC 
calculated pursuant to this paragraph (b)(1)(i)(E)(2)(i) shall then be 
multiplied by a factor of 1/PSC of remaining permits as of June 1 of 
each year, unless another date is specified by the Regional 
Administrator, to calculate the GB cod PSC for each permit for the 
following fishing year.
    (ii) GB cod PSC for all other permits. For each owner of a valid NE 
multispecies permit or CPH that has not committed to participate in 
either the GB Cod Hook Gear Sector or GB Cod Fixed Gear Sector, as 
specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(E)(2)(i) of this section, the GB cod 
PSC for each such permit or CPH shall be based upon the GB cod PSC 
available after accounting for the GB cod PSC calculated pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(1)(i)(E)(2)(i) of this section. To determine the GB cod 
PSC for each of these permits, the sum of the individual permit's 
landings of GB cod available in the NMFS dealer database for fishing 
years 1996 through 2006 shall be divided by the total landings of GB cod 
during that period by the total landings of GB cod by permits eligible 
to join sectors as of May 1, 2008, during that period, after subtracting 
the total landings of GB cod by permits that committed to participate in 
either the GB Cod Hook Sector or GB Cod Fixed Gear Sector as of March 1, 
2008. This individual share shall then be multiplied by the available GB 
cod PSC calculated by subtracting the GB cod PSC allocated pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(1)(i)(E)(2)(i) of this section from one. The PSC 
calculated pursuant to this paragraph (b)(1)(i)(E)(2)(ii) shall then be 
multiplied by a factor of 1/PSC of remaining permits as of July 1 of 
each year, unless another date is specified by the Regional 
Administrator, to calculate the GB cod PSC for each permit.
    (ii) Areas that can be fished. Vessels in a sector may only fish in 
a particular stock area, as specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A) 
through (F) of this section, and Sec. 648.85(b)(6)(v), or the Eastern 
U.S./Canada Area, as specified in Sec. 648.85(a)(1), if the sector has 
been allocated, or acquires, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(viii) of this 
section, ACE for all stocks allocated to sectors pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(1)(i)(A) of this section that are caught in that stock area. A 
sector must project when its ACE for each stock will be exceeded and 
must ensure that all vessels in the sector cease fishing operations 
prior to exceeding it. Once a sector has harvested its ACE for a stock, 
all vessels in that sector must cease fishing operations in that stock 
area on a sector trip unless and until it acquires additional ACE from 
another sector pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(viii) of this section, or as 
otherwise specified in an approved operations plan pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(2)(xiv) of this section. For the purposes of this paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii), an ACE overage means catch of regulated species or ocean 
pout by vessels participating in a particular sector that exceeds the 
ACE allocated to that sector, as of the date received or purchased by 
the dealer, whichever occurs first, after considering all ACE transfer 
requests ultimately approved by NMFS during the current fishing year, 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(viii) of this section, unless otherwise 
specified pursuant to Sec. 648.90(a)(5).
    (iii) Sector AMs. At the end of the fishing year, NMFS shall 
evaluate sector catch using VTR, VMS, IVR, and any other available 
information to determine whether a sector has exceeded any of its ACE 
allocations based upon the cumulative catch by participating permits/
vessels, as identified in the final operations plan approved by the 
Regional Administrator pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, and 
each sector's share of any overage of the overall ACL for any stock 
caused by excessive catch by other sub-components of the fishery 
pursuant to Sec. 648.90(a)(5), if necessary. Should an ACE allocated to 
a sector be exceeded in a given fishing year, the sector's ACE shall be 
reduced by the overage on a pound-for-pound basis during the following 
fishing year, and the sector, each vessel, vessel operator and/or vessel 
owner participating in the sector may be charged, as a result of said 
overages, jointly and severally for civil

[[Page 722]]

penalties and permit sanctions pursuant to 15 CFR part 904. If an ACE 
allocated to a sector is not exceeded in a given fishing year pursuant 
to this paragraph (b)(1)(iii), the sector's ACE allocation shall not be 
reduced for the following fishing year as a result of an overage of an 
ACE by non-compliant sectors or an overage of sub-ACLs allocated to 
common pool vessels, but may be reduced if the excessive catch of a 
particular stock by other sub-components of the fishery causes the 
overall ACL of a particular stock to be exceeded pursuant to Sec. 
648.90(a)(5). If declining stock conditions result in a need to reduce 
fishing mortality, and all sectors and common pool vessels have operated 
within their ACE or sub-ACL limits, a sector's percentage share shall 
not be changed, but the amount this share represents may be reduced due 
to reduced overall ACL for a particular stock. If stock conditions 
improve, and certain sectors stay within their ACE while other sectors 
or the common pool exceed their respective ACEs or sub-ACLs, the sectors 
that stay within their ACEs shall receive a temporary increase in ACE 
equal to the amount that other sectors or the common pool exceeded their 
ACE or sub-ACL, divided among such sectors proportional to each sector's 
share of the ACL available to vessels issued a limited access NE 
multispecies permit.
    (A) Overage penalty if there is sufficient ACE to cover the overage. 
If a sector exceeds an ACE allocated to it during the previous fishing 
year, but has sufficient ACE to address the overage pursuant to this 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) based upon the cumulative PSCs of participating 
vessels during the fishing year following the overage, no overage 
penalty shall be applied to any member permit/vessel that leaves that 
sector to fish under the provisions of the common pool or in another 
sector in the year following the overage. Any impacts to departing 
member permits/vessels may be specified and addressed by the sector 
operations plan and associated sector contract.
    (B) Overage penalty if there is insufficient ACE to cover an 
overage. If a sector exceeds an ACE allocated to it during the previous 
fishing year, but disbands in the year following the overage, or 
otherwise does not have sufficient ACE to address the overage pursuant 
to this paragraph (b)(1)(iii) based upon the cumulative PSCs of permits/
vessels participating in that sector during the fishing year following 
the overage, individual permit holders that participated in the sector 
during the fishing year in which the overage occurred shall be 
responsible for reducing their DAS/PSC to account for that overage in 
the subsequent fishing year, as follows:
    (1) PSC reduction. If a sector disbands following an overage, and 
the owner of an individual permit joins another sector for the 
subsequent fishing year, that permit's contribution toward the ACE for 
the stock for which the overage occurred to the other sector in the 
subsequent fishing year shall be reduced by an amount equal to the 
overage divided by the number of permits/vessels participating in the 
sector during the fishing year in which the overage occurred. For 
example, if a sector comprised of 10 permits/vessels exceeded its GB cod 
ACE by 10,000 lb (4,536 kg) during the previous fishing year, but later 
disbands, each permit/vessel that was in that sector, but then joins 
another sector during the following fishing year shall have its 
contribution of GB cod to another sector temporarily reduced by 1,000 lb 
(453.6 kg) during the subsequent fishing year for the purposes of 
calculating the available GB cod ACE allocated to another sector during 
that fishing year.
    (2) DAS reduction. If a sector disbands following an overage and the 
owner of an individual permit elects to fish under the provisions of the 
common pool during the subsequent fishing year, that permit/vessel's NE 
multispecies Category A DAS allocation for the subsequent fishing year 
shall be temporarily reduced by an amount proportional to the highest 
percentage overage by that sector of any of the stocks for which an 
overage occurred. For example, if a sector exceeded its GB cod ACE by 10 
percent and its pollock ACE by 15 percent, each permit would receive a 
15-percent reduction in its Category A DAS allocation for the subsequent 
fishing year if fishing under the provisions of the common pool.

[[Page 723]]

    (3) Fishing prohibition. If a sector does not disband following an 
overage, but otherwise does not have sufficient ACE to cover an overage 
based upon the PSC of participating permits, that sector's ACE for the 
stock for which the overage occurred shall be temporarily reduced to 
zero for the following fishing year, and that sector shall be prohibited 
from fishing on a sector trip in the stock area associated with the 
stock for which the ACE was exceeded during the following year, unless 
and until that sector can acquire sufficient ACE from another sector to 
cover the remaining overage from the previous fishing year. For example, 
if a sector comprised of 10 permits/vessels was allocated 10 mt of GB 
cod ACE, but caught 25 mt during the previous fishing year (i.e., it 
exceeded its GB cod ACE by 15 mt), each permit/vessel that participating 
in that sector during the following fishing year would have its GB cod 
PSC temporarily reduced to zero during the subsequent fishing year, and 
that sector would not be able to fish on a sector trip in the GB cod 
stock area until it could acquire at least an additional 5 mt of GB cod 
ACE from another sector (i.e., 15 mt overage--10 mt ACE for the 
following year = 5 mt overage remaining).
    (C) ACE buffer. At the beginning of each fishing year, NMFS shall 
withhold 20 percent of a sector's ACE for each stock for a period of up 
to 61 days (i.e., through June 30), unless otherwise specified by NMFS, 
to allow time to process any ACE transfers submitted at the end of the 
fishing year pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(viii) of this section and to 
determine whether the ACE allocated to any sector needs to be reduced, 
or any overage penalties need to be applied to individual permits/
vessels in the current fishing year to accommodate an ACE overage by 
that sector during the previous fishing year, as specified in paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (iv) Sector enforcement--(A) Sector compliance and joint/several 
liability. Unless exempted through a letter of authorization specified 
in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, each vessel operator and/or vessel 
owner fishing under an approved sector must comply with all NE 
multispecies management measures of this part and other applicable law. 
Each vessel and vessel operator and/or vessel owner participating in a 
sector must also comply with all applicable requirements and conditions 
of the operations plan specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and 
the letter of authorization issued pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section. Pursuant to 15 CFR part 904, each sector, permit/vessel owner, 
and vessel operator participating in the sector may be charged jointly 
and severally for violations of the following sector operations plan 
requirements, which may result in an assessment of civil penalties and 
permit sanctions: ACE overages, discarding of legal-sized NE 
multispecies, and misreporting of catch, including both landings and 
discards. For the purposes of enforcement, a sector is a legal entity 
that can be subject to NMFS enforcement action for violations of the 
regulations pertaining to sectors, as specified in this paragraph 
(b)(1)(iv).
    (B) Commitment to a sector. A permit/vessel participating in a 
sector must remain in the sector for the remainder of the fishing year. 
Such permits/vessels cannot fish under both the sector provisions and 
the provisions of the common pool during that same fishing year for any 
reason, including, but not limited to, expulsion from the sector 
pursuant to enforcement actions or other measures specified in an 
approved sector operations plan, vessel replacement, or permit/vessel 
sale to another owner. For example, if a permit/vessel is sold by a 
sector participant during the fishing year, the new owner must comply 
with the sector regulations and the conditions of the sector operations 
plan, sector contract, or any other binding agreements among 
participating sector vessels for the remainder of the fishing year. If a 
permit/vessel has been expelled from a sector, the sector must notify 
NMFS of such an expulsion immediately. Any permit/vessel, vessel 
operator, or vessel owner removed from a sector during a specific 
fishing year consistent with sector rules shall not be eligible to fish 
in another sector or under the NE multispecies regulations for common 
pool vessels specified in this part for the remainder of that fishing 
year. For

[[Page 724]]

the purposes of this paragraph, ``permit/vessel'' refers to the fishing 
and landings history associated with a particular permit/vessel enrolled 
in a specific sector at the start of the fishing year that was used to 
calculate the PSC for that permit/vessel and contribute to the ACE for 
each stock allocated to that specific sector.
    (v) Sector monitoring. Each sector shall monitor catch by 
participating sector vessels to ensure that ACEs are not exceeded during 
the fishing year, as specified in this paragraph (b)(1)(v). The sector 
shall summarize trips validated by dealer reports; oversee the use of 
electronic monitoring equipment and review of associated data; maintain 
a database of VTR, dealer, observer, and electronic monitoring reports; 
determine all species landings by stock areas; apply discard estimates 
to landings; deduct catch from ACEs allocated to sectors; and report 
sector catch on a weekly basis to NMFS, as required in paragraph 
(b)(1)(vi) of this section. Unless otherwise specified in this paragraph 
(b)(1)(v), all catches of stocks allocated to sectors by vessels on a 
sector trip shall be deducted from the sector's ACE for each NE 
multispecies stock regardless of what the fishery the vessel was 
participating in when the fish was caught. For the purposes of this 
paragraph (b)(1)(v), any regulated species or ocean pout caught using 
gear capable of catching NE multispecies (i.e., gear not listed as 
exempted gear under this part) would be deducted from a sector's ACE if 
such catch contributed to the specification of PSC, as described in 
Sec. 648.87(b)(1)(i)(E), and would not apply to another ACL sub-
component pursuant to Sec. 648.90(a)(4). For example, any regulated 
species or ocean pout landed while fishing for or catching skates or 
monkfish pursuant to the regulations for those fisheries would be 
deducted from the sector's ACE for each stock because such regulated 
species or ocean pout were caught while also operating under a NE 
multispecies DAS. However, if a sector vessel is issued a limited access 
General Category Atlantic Sea Scallop permit and fishes for scallops 
under the provisions specific to that permit, any yellowtail flounder 
caught by the vessel on such trips would be deducted from the other sub-
component of the appropriate stock of yellowtail flounder's ACL 
specified for the Atlantic Sea Scallop fishery and not from the 
yellowtail flounder ACE for the sector.
    (A) Discards. A sector vessel may not discard any legal-sized 
regulated species or ocean pout allocated to sectors pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, unless otherwise required pursuant 
to Sec. 648.86(l). Discards of undersized regulated species or ocean 
pout by a sector vessel must be reported to NMFS consistent with the 
reporting requirements specified in paragraph (b)(1)(vi) of this 
section. Discards shall not be included in the information used to 
calculate a vessel's PSC, as described in Sec. 648.87(b)(1)(i)(E), but 
shall be counted against a sector's ACE for each NE multispecies stock 
allocated to a sector.
    (B) Independent third-party monitoring program. A sector must comply 
with any dockside/roving monitoring program specified by NMFS for 
fishing years 2011 and 2012, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B)(1) of 
this section, including the dockside/roving monitoring operational 
standards specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, and develop and 
implement an independent third-party dockside/roving monitoring program 
by fishing year 2013. A sector must also develop, implement, and pay 
for, to the extent not funded by NMFS, an at-sea or electronic 
monitoring program by fishing year 2012 (May 1, 2012) consistent with 
paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B)(2) of this section. Both the dockside/roving and 
at-sea or electronic monitoring program developed by sectors must be 
approved by NMFS for monitoring landings and utilization of sector ACE, 
as specified in this paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B). Any service provider 
providing dockside/roving and at-sea or electronic monitoring services 
pursuant to this paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B) must meet the service provider 
standards specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, and any 
dockside/roving and at-sea or electronic monitoring program proposed by 
sectors must meet the operational standards specified in paragraphs 
(b)(5) and (b)(6) of this section, respectively, and be approved by NMFS

[[Page 725]]

in a manner consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act. None of 
the costs associated with any dockside/roving monitor monitoring 
requirements shall be paid by the owner or operator of a vessel subject 
to these requirements during fishing years 2011 and 2012. Starting in 
fishing year 2013, sectors shall be responsible for paying the costs 
associated with dockside/roving monitoring coverage, unless otherwise 
instructed by NMFS.
    (1) Dockside/roving monitoring program. Dockside/roving monitors 
shall monitor landings of regulated species and ocean pout at every 
offload for which a trip has been selected to be observed by a dockside/
roving monitor, whether directly to a federally permitted dealer or to a 
truck for transfer to a federally permitted dealer, to verify such 
landings at the time the landings are weighed by a federally permitted 
dealer and to certify the landing weights are accurate as reported on 
the dealer report. Unless otherwise specified in this part, the level of 
coverage for landings is specified in paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B)(3) of this 
section. To ensure that these levels of coverage are achieved, if a trip 
has been selected to be observed by a dockside/roving monitor, all 
offloading events associated with that trip, regardless of how many or 
the location of offloading events, must be monitored, and a vessel may 
not offload any of its catch until the dockside/roving monitor arrives. 
For example, if a trip is selected to be observed by a dockside/roving 
monitor, a vessel offloading at more than one dealer or facility must 
have a dockside/roving monitor present during the offload at each 
location. All landing events at remote ports that are selected to be 
observed by a dockside/roving monitor must have a roving monitor present 
to witness offload activities to the truck, as well as a dockside 
monitor present at each dealer to certify weigh-out of all landings. Any 
service provider providing dockside/roving monitoring services pursuant 
to this paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B)(1) must meet the service provider 
standards specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The details of 
the dockside/roving monitoring program used by each sector starting in 
fishing year 2013 pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B) of this section 
must be specified in the sector's operations plan, and must be 
consistent with the operational standards specified in paragraph (b)(5) 
of this section. The Regional Administrator shall review the dockside/
roving monitoring program and approve/disapprove it as part of the 
yearly operations plan in a manner consistent with the Administrative 
Procedure Act. Common pool vessels operating under the provisions of the 
either a limited access Northeast multispecies Small Vessel Category 
permit or Handgear A permit, as specified at Sec. Sec. 648.82(b)(5) and 
(6), respectively, or an open access Northeast multispecies Handgear B 
permit, as specified at Sec. 648.88(a), are exempt from the dockside/
roving monitoring requirements specified in this paragraph 
(b)(1)(v)(B)(1). Except as provided in this paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B)(1), 
all common pool and sector vessels, along with service providers 
providing dockside monitoring services, will be subject to the dockside 
monitoring operational requirements specified at Sec. 648.87(b)(5).
    (2) At-sea/electronic monitoring program. Beginning in fishing year 
2012, in addition to the dockside/roving monitoring requirement 
specified in paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B)(1) of this section, an at-sea/
electronic monitoring program must be implemented to verify area fished 
as well as catch and discards by species and gear type. A sector may 
elect to develop an at-sea/electronic monitoring program before fishing 
year 2012 and specify the details of such a program in its operations 
plan. Electronic monitoring may be used in place of actual observers if 
the technology is deemed sufficient by NMFS for a specific trip type 
based on gear type and area fished, in a manner consistent with the 
Administrative Procedure Act. No electronic monitoring technology may be 
used in place of an at-sea monitor unless approved by NMFS as part of 
the sector's annual operations plan. If either an at-sea monitor or 
electronic monitoring is assigned to a particular trip, a vessel may not 
leave port without the appropriate at-sea monitor or electronic 
monitoring equipment on board. The at-sea/electronic monitoring program 
developed and implemented by each sector must

[[Page 726]]

be consistent with the operational standards specified in paragraph 
(b)(6) of this section, with details of the program specified in the 
sector's annual operations plan. The Regional Administrator shall review 
the at-sea/electronic monitoring program and approve/disapprove it as 
part of the annual operations plan in a manner consistent with the 
Administrative Procedure Act. The level of coverage for landings by 
sector vessels is specified in paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B)(3) of this 
section.
    (3) Coverage levels. Except as specified in paragraph 
(b)(1)(v)(B)(3)(i), any service provider providing dockside/roving or 
at-sea or electronic monitoring services required under this paragraph 
(b)(1)(v)(B)(3) must provide coverage that is fair and equitable, and 
distributed in a statistically random manner among all trips such that 
coverage is representative of fishing activities by all vessels within 
the common pool or each sector, and by all operations of common pool 
vessels or vessels operating in each sector throughout the fishing year.
    (i) Dockside/roving monitoring. For fishing years 2011 and 2012, 
NMFS shall determine the level of coverage for any NMFS-sponsored 
dockside/roving monitoring program specified pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(1)(v)(B)(1) of this section based on available funding. If 100-
percent coverage of all sector and common pool trips is not possible, 
NMFS shall first provide coverage to trips without an observer or at-sea 
monitor assigned pursuant to Sec. 648.11(k), or approved electronic 
monitoring equipment assigned pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B) of this 
section for sector vessels. Starting in fishing year 2013, at least 20 
percent of all sector and common pool trips shall be monitored by 
dockside/roving monitors.
    (ii) At-sea/electronic monitoring. Beginning in fishing year 2012, 
coverage levels for an at-sea monitoring program shall be specified by 
NMFS, but shall be less than 100 percent of all sector trips. Such 
coverage levels must be sufficient to at least meet the coefficient of 
variation specified in the Standardized Bycatch Reporting Methodology 
and accurately monitor sector operations. In the event that a NMFS-
sponsored observer and a third-party at-sea monitor are assigned to the 
same trip, only the NMFS observer must observe that trip.
    (4) Hail reports. For the purposes of the dockside/roving and at-sea 
monitoring requirements specified in this paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B), sector 
vessels must submit all hail reports for a sector trip in which the NE 
multispecies catch applies against the ACE allocated to a sector, as 
specified in this part, to service providers offering dockside/roving 
and at-sea monitoring services pursuant to this paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B). 
The mechanism and timing of the transmission of such hail reports must 
be consistent with instructions provided by the Regional Administrator 
for any dockside/roving monitoring program required by paragraph 
(b)(1)(v)(B)(1) of this section, or specified in the annual sector 
operations plan, consistent with paragraphs (b)(5) and (6) of this 
section.
    (5) Notification of service provider change. If for any reason a 
sector decides to change approved service providers used to provide 
dockside/roving or at-sea or electronic monitoring services required in 
this paragraph (b)(1)(v), the sector manager must first inform NMFS in 
writing in advance of the effective date of the change in approved 
service providers in conjunction with the submission of the next weekly 
sector catch report specified in paragraph (b)(1)(vi)(B) of this 
section. A sector may employ more than one service provider at any time, 
provided any service provider employed by a sector meets the standards 
specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (vi) Sector reporting requirements. In addition to the other 
reporting/recordkeeping requirements specified in this part, a sector's 
vessels must comply with the reporting requirements specified in this 
paragraph (b)(1)(vi).
    (A) VMS declarations and trip-level catch reports. Prior to each 
sector trip, a sector vessel must declare into broad stock areas in 
which the vessel fishes and submit the VTR serial number associated with 
that trip pursuant to Sec. 648.10(k). The sector vessel must also 
submit a VMS catch report detailing regulated species and ocean pout 
catch by broad stock areas when fishing in

[[Page 727]]

multiple stock areas on the same trip, pursuant to Sec. 648.10(k).
    (B) Weekly catch report. Each sector must submit weekly reports to 
NMFS stating the remaining balance of ACE allocated to each sector based 
upon regulated species and ocean pout landings and discards of vessels 
participating in that sector and any compliance/enforcement concerns. 
These reports must include at least the following information, as 
instructed by the Regional Administrator: Week ending date; species, 
stock area, gear, number of trips, reported landings (landed pounds and 
live pounds), discards (live pounds), total catch (live pounds), status 
of the sector's ACE (pounds remaining and percent remaining), and 
whether this is a new or updated record of sector catch for each NE 
multispecies stock allocated to that particular sector; sector 
enforcement issues, including any discrepancies noted by dockside/roving 
monitors between dealers and offloads; summary of offloads witnessed by 
dockside/roving monitors for that reporting week; and a list of vessels 
landing for that reporting week. These weekly catch reports must be 
submitted no later than 0700 hr on the second Monday after the reporting 
week, as defined in this part. The frequency of these reports must be 
increased to more than a weekly submission when the balance of remaining 
ACE is low, as specified in the sector operations plan and approved by 
NMFS. If requested, sectors must provide detailed trip-by-trip catch 
data to NMFS for the purposes of auditing sector catch monitoring data 
based upon guidance provided by the Regional Administrator.
    (C) Year-end report. An approved sector must submit an annual year-
end report to NMFS and the Council, no later than 60 days after the end 
of the fishing year, that summarizes the fishing activities of 
participating permits/vessels, which must include at least the following 
information: Catch, including landings and discards, of all species by 
sector vessels; the permit number of each sector vessel that fished for 
regulated species or ocean pout; the number of vessels that fished for 
non-regulated species or ocean pout; the method used to estimate 
discards by sector vessels; the landing port used by sector vessels; 
enforcement actions; and other relevant information required to evaluate 
the biological, economic, and social impacts of sectors and their 
fishing operations consistent with confidentiality requirements of 
applicable law.
    (vii) Interaction with other fisheries--(A) Use of DAS. A sector 
vessel must comply with all measures specified for another fishery 
pursuant to this part, including any requirement to use a NE 
multispecies DAS. If the regulations of another fishery require the use 
of a NE multispecies DAS, the DAS allocation and accrual provisions 
specified in Sec. 648.82(d) and (e), respectively, apply to each trip 
by a sector vessel, as applicable. For example, if a sector vessel is 
also issued a limited access monkfish Category C permit and is required 
to use a NE multispecies DAS concurrent with a monkfish DAS under this 
part, any NE multispecies DAS used by the sector vessel accrues, as 
specified in Sec. 648.82(e)(1)(ii) based upon the vessel's NE 
multispecies DAS allocation calculated pursuant to Sec. 
648.82(d)(1)(iv)(B).
    (B) Availability of ACE. Notwithstanding the requirements in 
paragraph (b)(1)(vii)(A) of this section, if a sector has not been 
allocated or does not acquire sufficient ACE available to cover the 
catch of a particular stock of NE multispecies while participating in 
another fishery in which such catch would apply to the ACE allocated to 
a sector, vessels participating in that sector cannot participate in 
those other fisheries unless NMFS has approved a sector operations plan 
that ensures that regulated species or ocean pout will not be caught 
while participating in these other fisheries.
    (viii) ACE transfers. All or a portion of a sector's ACE for any NE 
multispecies stock may be transferred to another sector at any time 
during the fishing year and up to 2 weeks into the following fishing 
year (i.e., through May 14), unless otherwise instructed by NMFS, to 
cover any overages during the previous fishing year. A sector is not 
required to transfer ACE to another sector. An ACE transfer only becomes 
effective upon approval by NMFS, as specified in paragraph 
(b)(1)(viii)(B) of this section.

[[Page 728]]

    (A) Application to transfer ACE. ACE may be transferred from one 
sector to another through written request to the Regional Administrator. 
This request must include the name of the sectors involved, the amount 
of each ACE to be transferred, the fishing year in which the ACE 
transfer applies, and the amount of compensation received for any ACE 
transferred, as instructed by the Regional Administrator.
    (B) Approval of an ACE transfer request. NMFS shall approve/
disapprove a request to transfer ACE based upon compliance by each 
sector and its participating vessels with the reporting requirements 
specified in this part. The Regional Administrator shall inform both 
sectors in writing whether the ACE transfer request has been approved 
within 2 weeks of the receipt of the ACE transfer request.
    (C) Duration of transfer. Notwithstanding ACE carried over into the 
next fishing year pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i)(C) of this section, 
ACE transferred pursuant to this paragraph (b)(1)(viii) is only valid 
for the fishing year in which the transfer is approved, with the 
exception of ACE transfer requests that are submitted up to 2 weeks into 
the subsequent fishing year to address any potential ACE overages from 
the previous fishing year, as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this 
section, unless otherwise instructed by NMFS.
    (ix) Trip limits. With the exception of stocks listed in Sec. 
648.86(1) and the Atlantic halibut trip limit at Sec. 648.86(c), a 
sector vessel is not limited in the amount of allocated NE multispecies 
stocks that can be harvested on a particular fishing trip, unless 
otherwise specified in the operations plan.
    (2) Operations plan and sector contract. To be approved to operate, 
each sector must submit an operations plan and preliminary sector 
contract to the Regional Administrator no later than September 1 prior 
to the fishing year in which the sector intends to begin operations, 
unless otherwise instructed by NMFS. A final roster, sector contract, 
and list of Federal and state permits held by participating vessels for 
each sector must be submitted by December 1 prior to the fishing year in 
which the sector intends to begin operations, unless otherwise 
instructed by NMFS. The operations plan may cover a 1- or 2-year period, 
provided the analysis required in paragraph (b)(3) of this section is 
sufficient to assess the impacts of sector operations during the 2-year 
period and that sector membership, or any other parameter that may 
affect sector operations during the second year of the approved 
operations plan, does not differ to the point where the impacts analyzed 
by the supporting NEPA document are compromised. Each vessel and vessel 
operator and/or vessel owner participating in a sector must agree to and 
comply with all applicable requirements and conditions of the operations 
plan specified in this paragraph (b)(2) and the letter of authorization 
issued pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section. It shall be 
unlawful to violate any such conditions and requirements unless such 
conditions or restrictions are identified in an approved operations plan 
as administrative only. If a proposed sector does not comply with the 
requirements of this paragraph (b)(2), NMFS may decline to propose for 
approval such sector operations plans, even if the Council has approved 
such sector. At least the following elements must be contained in either 
the final operations plan or sector contract submitted to NMFS:
    (i) A list of all parties, vessels, and vessel owners who will 
participate in the sector;
    (ii) A list of all Federal and state permits held by persons 
participating in the sector, including an indication for each permit 
whether it is enrolled and will actively fish in a sector, or will be 
subject to the provisions of the common pool;
    (iii) A contract signed by all sector participants indicating their 
agreement to abide by the operations plan;
    (iv) The name of a designated representative or agent of the sector 
for service of process;
    (v) If applicable, a plan for consolidation or redistribution of ACE 
detailing the quantity and duration of such consolidation or 
redistribution within the sector;
    (vi) A list of the specific management rules the sector participants 
will agree to abide by in order to avoid exceeding

[[Page 729]]

the allocated ACE for each stock, including a plan of operations or 
cessation of operations once the ACEs of one or more stocks are 
harvested and detailed plans for enforcement of the sector rules;
    (vii) A plan that defines the procedures by which members of the 
sector that do not abide by the rules of the sector will be disciplined 
or removed from the sector, and a procedure for notifying NMFS of such 
expulsions from the sector;
    (viii) If applicable, a plan of how the ACE allocated to the sector 
is assigned to each vessel;
    (ix) If the operations plan is inconsistent with, or outside the 
scope of the NEPA analysis associated with the sector proposal/framework 
adjustment as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a 
supplemental NEPA analysis may be required with the operations plan;
    (x) Detailed information about overage penalties or other actions 
that will be taken if a sector exceeds its ACE for any stock;
    (xi) Detailed plans for the monitoring and reporting of landings and 
discards by sector participants, including, but not limited to, detailed 
information describing the sector's dockside/roving and at-sea/
electronic monitoring program for monitoring utilization of ACE 
allocated to that sector; identification of the independent third-party 
service providers employed by the sector to provide dockside/roving and 
at-sea/electronic monitoring services; the mechanism and timing of any 
hail reports necessary to coordinate the deployment of dockside/roving 
and at-sea monitors and electronic monitoring equipment; a list of 
specific ports where participating vessels will land fish, with specific 
exemptions noted for safety, weather, etc., allowed, provided the sector 
provides reasonable notification to NMFS concerning a deviation from the 
listed ports; and any other information about such a program required by 
NMFS;
    (xii) ACE thresholds that may trigger revisions to sector operations 
to ensure allocated ACE is not exceeded, and details regarding the 
sector's plans for notifying NMFS once the specified ACE threshold has 
been reached;
    (xiii) Identification of any potential redirection of effort into 
other fisheries expected as a result of sector operations, and, if 
necessary, proposed limitations to eliminate any adverse effects 
expected from such redirection of effort;
    (xiv) If applicable, description of how regulated species and ocean 
pout will be avoided while participating in other fisheries that have a 
bycatch of regulated species or ocean pout if the sector does not have 
sufficient ACE for stocks of regulated species or ocean pout caught as 
bycatch in those fisheries, as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(vii)(B) of 
this section; and
    (xv) A list of existing regulations that the sector is requesting 
exemption from during the following fishing year pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section.
    (3) NEPA analysis. In addition to the documents required by 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, before NMFS can approve a 
sector to operate during a particular fishing year, each sector must 
develop and submit to NMFS, in conjunction with the yearly operations 
plan and sector contract, an appropriate NEPA analysis assessing the 
impacts of forming the sector and operating under the measures described 
in the sector operations plan.
    (4) Independent third-party monitoring provider standards. Any 
service provider intending to provide dockside/roving and at-sea/
electronic monitoring services described in Sec. 648.82(n)(2) and 
paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section must apply to and be approved/
certified by NMFS in a manner consistent with the Administrative 
Procedure Act. NMFS shall approve/certify service providers and 
associated dockside, roving, and/or at-sea monitors as eligible to 
provide sector monitoring services specified in this part and can 
disapprove/decertify service providers and/or individual monitors 
through notice in writing to individual service providers/monitors if

of interest.
    (5) Dockside monitoring operational standards. In addition to the 
independent third-party monitoring provider standards specified in 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section, any dockside monitoring program 
developed by NMFS pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B)(1) of this section 
must meet the following operational standards to be approved by NMFS:
    (i) Vessel requirements--(A) Reporting/recordkeeping requirements. 
In addition to all other reporting/recordkeeping requirements specified 
in this part, to facilitate the deployment of independent dockside and 
roving monitors pursuant to Sec. 648.82(n)(2)(iv) and paragraph 
(b)(1)(v) of this section, the operator of a vessel fishing under the 
provisions of the common pool or on a sector trip must comply with the 
following requirements:
    (1) Trip-start hail report. The vessel operator must submit a trip-
start hail report prior to departing port at the beginning of each trip 
notifying the sector manager and/or dockside/roving monitor service 
provider of the vessel permit number; trip ID number in the form of the 
VTR serial number of the first VTR page for that trip, or another trip 
identifier specified by NMFS; and an estimate of the date and time of 
arrival to port. Trip-start hail reports by vessels operating less than 
6 hr or

[[Page 733]]

within 6 hr of port must also include estimated date and time of 
offload. If the vessel operator does not receive confirmation of the 
receipt of the trip-start hail report from the dockside/roving monitor 
provider, the operator must contact the service provider to confirm the 
trip-start hail report via an independent back-up system developed by 
the service provider.
    (2) Trip-end hail report. Prior to returning to port upon the 
completion of a fishing trip, the vessel operator must submit a trip-end 
hail report notifying the dockside/roving monitor service provider of 
the vessel permit number; trip ID submitted pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(5)(i)(A)(1) of this section; intended offloading location(s), 
including the dock/dealer, port/harbor, and state for the first dealer/
facility where the vessel intends to offload catch and the port/harbor, 
and state for the second dealer/facility where the vessel intends to 
offload catch; estimated date/time of arrival; estimated date/time of 
offload; estimated total amount of regulated species on board (in 
pounds, landed weight); and estimated total amount of all other species 
retained (in pounds, landed weight), including species managed by other 
FMPs, on board. The trip-end hail report must be submitted at least 6 hr 
in advance of landing for all trips at least 6 hr in duration or 
occurring more than 6 hr from port. For shorter trips, the trip-end hail 
reports must be submitted within sufficient time to allow the deployment 
of the dockside/roving monitor to the offloading site, as specified by 
the dockside/roving monitoring service provider in consultation with 
NMFS Office of Law Enforcement. These reports may be in the form of an 
email to the dockside/roving monitor service provider or another means 
of communication specified by the service provider.
    (B) Copies of trip documents. The operator of a sector vessel that 
is issued a waiver from the dockside/roving monitoring requirements 
specified in paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B) of this section for a particular 
trip must provide copies of all VTRs and dealer receipts associated with 
that trip to the sector or designated third party contractor, as 
appropriate, within 24 hr of offloading.
    (C) Vessel offloads. A vessel may not offload any fish from a trip 
that was selected to be observed by a dockside/roving monitor until the 
dockside/roving monitor(s) assigned to that trip is present, as 
specified in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section.
    (ii) Dockside/roving monitor service provider requirements--(A) 
Confirmation of vessel hail reports. Upon receipt of a trip-start or 
trip-end hail reports pursuant to paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A)(1) and (2) of 
this section, the service provider shall immediately send confirmation 
that the trip-start or trip-end hail report was received to the vessel. 
A service provider must establish an independent back-up system to the 
primary hail report system (e.g., a phone number if the primary hail 
report system is based upon email) to ensure receipt of such trip-start 
or trip-end hail reports. In confirming the receipt of a trip-end hail 
report, the service provider will inform the vessel operator that the 
offload(s) associated with that trip will be monitored by a dockside/
roving monitor or that the vessel is issued a dockside/roving monitor 
waiver for that trip. If a dockside/roving monitor is assigned to 
observe a trip's offloads, but cannot meet the vessel as scheduled, the 
service provider must inform the vessel, the sector, and NMFS Office of 
Law Enforcement, as appropriate, as soon as possible, to specify the 
time when the dockside/roving monitor will arrive, or issue the vessel a 
waiver for that particular trip. The service provider or sector manager 
must also provide NMFS Office of Law Enforcement with the information 
contained in the trip-start and trip-end hail reports, including whether 
the vessel has been assigned a dockside/roving monitor for that trip, at 
the same time that the confirmation is sent to the vessel.
    (B) Documentation of offloads--(1) Offloads directly to a dealer. 
Upon the completion of the offload, the dockside/roving monitor shall 
retain a copy of all VTRs associated with the trip, including all 
information submitted (i.e., no blocked cells) provided by the sector 
vessel; record whether the dealer scales were certified by an 
appropriate state agency; observe and record whether ice and box weights 
are tared by the dealer

[[Page 734]]

before catch is added, or record the estimated weight of ice and the box 
from the dealer; record the weight of catch offloaded by species (and 
market category, if culled); determine and record whether all fish have 
been offloaded, including an estimate of the weight of fish being 
retained by captain and crew for personal consumption or other use and 
the reason for retention of such catch; sign the dealer receipt 
associated with the offload for each trip (i.e., dealer/weighout slip or 
other form of documentation of the amount of catch offloaded by the 
dealer), or have the dealer sign the dockside/roving monitor report, as 
appropriate; provide data summarizing the offloads of each trip, 
including copies of the VTR(s), dockside/roving monitor report, and 
dealer receipt(s), if separate from the dockside/roving monitor report, 
to the sector manager or designated third party contractor, as 
appropriate, within 24 hr of offloading; and retain a copy of such 
information to document that the offload was monitored, as instructed by 
the Regional Administrator.
    (2) Offloads to a truck. A roving monitor observing offloads into a 
truck shall retain copies of all VTRs filled out for that trip with all 
information submitted (i.e., no blocked cells) provided by the sector 
vessel; if there are no scales at the offload site, record the number of 
totes of each species and the captain's estimate of the weight in each 
tote; if there are scales at the offload site, record whether the scales 
were certified by an appropriate state agency and observe and record 
whether ice and box weights are tared before catch is added, or record 
the estimated weight of ice and the box; determine and record whether 
all fish have been offloaded, including an estimate of the weight of 
fish being retained by captain and crew for personal consumption or 
other use and the reason for retention of such catch; record all 
offloaded catch by species in a report, unless the driver creates such a 
report that the roving monitor may use which shall be signed by the 
roving monitor; document that each tote is labeled with the appropriate 
identifying information including, but not limited to, the serial number 
of the first VTR page filled out for that trip or another trip ID 
specified by NMFS, the roving monitor's name, tote number, and species; 
provide data summarizing the offloads of each trip, including copies of 
the VTR(s) and roving monitor report to the sector manager or designated 
third party contractor, as appropriate, within 24 hr of offloading; and 
retain a copy of such information to document that the offload was 
monitored, as instructed by the Regional Administrator. The roving 
monitor must submit copies of the VTR(s); driver manifest(s), if 
separate from the roving monitor's report; and the roving monitor's 
report to the sector manager or third-party service provider, as 
appropriate. The tote tagging requirements specified in this paragraph 
(b)(5)(ii)(B)(2), are not required, provided the following three 
requirements are met: The roving monitor that observed the offload at 
the dock will also be the dockside monitor at the truck offload to the 
dealer; the roving monitor will follow the truck, in line of sight, from 
the remote offload to the dealer offload where the weighing occurs; and, 
the truck is loaded with only the catch from the one trip being 
monitored.
    (C) Record retention. The dockside/roving monitor service provider 
shall retain an electronic record of each offload observed and make 
electronic and other records that document an offload available to NMFS 
upon request.
    (D) Safe-harbor provision. The dockside/roving monitor service 
provider must work with the sector and NMFS Office of Law Enforcement to 
establish an acceptable process for safe-harbor situations where a 
vessel is unable to follow normal dockside/roving monitor protocols 
outlined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section due to an emergency 
situation.
    (E) Inspection of fish holds and other areas of a vessel. Except to 
the extent authorized by a sector to inspect fish holds and other areas 
of such sector's members' vessels in which fish are stored, dockside/
roving monitors assigned to observe the offloading of fish shall not 
inspect fish holds or any other areas of a vessel in which fish are 
stored unless first required by the Regional Administrator. Prior to any

[[Page 735]]

such requirement becoming effective, the Regional Administrator shall 
notify affected permit holders and monitoring providers by letter or 
other appropriate means, and shall provide instructions and guidelines 
deemed necessary to carry out such inspections.
    (iii) Adjustment to operational standards. The dockside/roving 
monitor operational standards specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section may be revised by the Regional Administrator in a manner 
consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act.
    (6) At-sea/electronic monitoring operational standards. In addition 
to the independent third-party monitoring provider standards specified 
in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, any at-sea/electronic monitoring 
program developed as part of a sector's yearly operations plan pursuant 
to paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B)(2) of this section must meet the following 
operational standards to be approved by NMFS:
    (i) Gear. Each at-sea monitor must be provided with all of the 
equipment specified by the Northeast Fisheries At-sea Monitoring 
Program. A list of such equipment is available from the Northeast 
Fisheries Science Center upon request. At-sea/electronic monitoring 
service providers are responsible for the cost of providing such gear to 
at-sea monitors to the extent not funded by NMFS. This gear shall be 
inspected by NMFS upon the completion of training required pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(4)(i)(I) of this section.
    (ii) Vessel selection protocol. An at-sea/electronic monitoring 
program service provider must develop a formal vessel-selection protocol 
to deploy at-sea monitors and electronic monitoring equipment in a 
statistically random manner consistent with the coverage levels required 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B)(3) of this section. This protocol 
must include a method to allow for waivers in specific circumstances, 
including how waivers would be requested, assessed, and recorded.
    (iii) Reporting/recordkeeping requirements--(A) Vessel requirements. 
In addition to all other reporting/recordkeeping requirements specified 
in this part, to facilitate the deployment of at-sea monitors and 
electronic monitoring equipment pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B)(2) of 
this section, the operator of a vessel fishing on a sector trip must 
provide at-sea/electronic monitoring service providers with at least the 
following information: The vessel name, permit number, trip ID number in 
the form of the VTR serial number of the first VTR page for that trip or 
another trip identifier specified by NMFS, and an estimate of the date/
time of departure in advance of each trip. The timing of such notice 
shall be sufficient to allow ample time for the service provider to 
determine whether an at-sea monitor or electronic monitoring equipment 
will be deployed on each trip and allow the at-sea monitor or electronic 
monitoring equipment to prepare for the trip and get to port, or to be 
installed on the vessel, respectively. The details of the timing, method 
(e.g., phone, email, etc.), and information needed for such pre-trip 
notifications shall be included as part of a sector's yearly operations 
plan. If a vessel has been informed by a service provider that an at-sea 
monitor or electronic monitoring equipment has been assigned to a 
particular trip pursuant to paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(B)(1) of this section, 
the vessel may not leave port to begin that trip until the at-sea 
monitor has arrived and boarded the vessel, or the electronic monitoring 
equipment has been properly installed.
    (B) At-sea/electronic monitoring service provider requirements--(1) 
Confirmation of pre-trip notification. Upon receipt of a pre-trip 
notification pursuant to paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(A) of this section, the 
service provider shall inform the vessel operator whether the vessel 
will be monitored by an at-sea observer or electronic monitoring 
equipment for that trip, or will be issued an at-sea/electronic 
monitoring waiver for that trip based upon the vessel selection protocol 
specified in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section.
    (2) At-sea/electronic monitoring report. A report detailing area 
fished and the amount of each species kept and discarded shall be 
submitted electronically in a standard acceptable form to the 
appropriate sector and NMFS within 48 hr of the completion of the trip, 
as instructed by the Regional Administrator. The data elements to be 
collected and the format for submission

[[Page 736]]

shall be specified by NMFS and distributed to all approved at-sea/
electronic monitoring service providers and sectors. At-sea/electronic 
monitoring data shall not be accepted until such data pass automated 
NMFS data quality checks.
    (iv) Safety hazards--(A) Vessel requirements. The operator of a 
sector vessel must detail and identify any safety hazards to any at-sea 
monitor assigned pursuant to paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(B)(1) of this section 
prior to leaving port. A vessel cannot begin a trip if it has failed a 
review of safety issues pursuant to paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(B) of this 
section, until the identified safety deficiency has been resolved 
pursuant to Sec. 600.746(i).
    (B) At-sea/electronic monitoring service provider requirements. An 
at-sea monitor must complete a pre-trip vessel safety checklist provided 
by NMFS before an at-sea monitor can leave port onboard a vessel on a 
sector trip. If the vessel fails a review of safety issues pursuant to 
this paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(B), an at-sea monitor cannot be deployed on 
that vessel for that trip.
    (v) Adjustment to operational standards. The at-sea/electronic 
monitoring operational standards specified in paragraph (b)(6) of this 
section may be revised by the Regional Administrator in a manner 
consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act.
    (c) Approval of a sector and granting of exemptions by the Regional 
Administrator. (1) Once the Regional Administrator has made a 
preliminary determination that the documents submitted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section appear to comply 
with the requirements of this section, NMFS may consult with the Council 
and approve or disapprove sector operations consistent with the 
Administrative Procedure Act and other applicable law.
    (2) If a sector is approved, the Regional Administrator shall issue 
a letter of authorization to each vessel operator and/or vessel owner 
participating in the sector. The letter of authorization shall authorize 
participation in the sector operations and may exempt participating 
vessels from any Federal fishing regulation applicable to NE 
multispecies vessels, except those specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and 
(ii) of this section, in order to allow vessels to fish in accordance 
with an approved operations plan, provided such exemptions are 
consistent with the goals and objectives of the FMP. The letter of 
authorization may also include requirements and conditions deemed 
necessary to ensure effective administration of, and compliance with, 
the operations plan and the sector allocation. Solicitation of public 
comment on, and NMFS final determination on such exemptions shall be 
consistent with paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
    (i) Regulations that may not be exempted for sector participants. 
The Regional Administrator may not exempt participants in a sector from 
the following Federal fishing regulations: NE multispecies year-round 
closure areas; permitting restrictions (e.g., vessel upgrades, etc.); 
gear restrictions designed to minimize habitat impacts (e.g., roller 
gear restrictions, etc.); reporting requirements; and AMs specified at 
Sec. 648.90(a)(5)(i)(D). For the purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(i), 
the DAS reporting requirements specified at Sec. 648.82; the SAP-
specific reporting requirements specified at Sec. 648.85; and the 
reporting requirements associated with a dockside monitoring program 
specified in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section are not considered 
reporting requirements, and the Regional Administrator may exempt sector 
participants from these requirements as part of the approval of yearly 
operations plans. This list may be modified through a framework 
adjustment, as specified in Sec. 648.90.
    (ii) Universal sector exemptions. All sector vessels are exempt from 
the following Federal fishing regulations under this part:
    (A) Trip limits on NE multispecies stocks for which a sector 
receives an allocation of ACE pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section (i.e., all stocks except Atlantic halibut, ocean pout, 
windowpane flounder, SNE/MA winter flounder, and Atlantic wolffish);
    (B) The GOM Rolling Closure Areas and the GB Seasonal Closed Area 
specified in Sec. 648.81(f)(1) and (g), respectively, provided sector 
vessels comply with the sector-specific GOM Rolling

[[Page 737]]

Closure Areas specified in Sec. 648.81(f)(2)(vi);
    (C) NE multispecies DAS restrictions other than those required to 
comply with effort controls in other fisheries, as specified in 
Sec. Sec. 648.92 and 648.322; and
    (D) The minimum codend mesh size restrictions for trawl gear 
specified in Sec. 648.80(a)(4)(i) when using a haddock separator trawl 
defined in Sec. 648.85(a)(3)(iii) or the Ruhle trawl defined in Sec. 
648.85(b)(6)(iv)(J)(3) within the GB RMA, as defined in Sec. 
648.80(a)(2), provided sector vessels use a codend with 6-inch (15.2-cm) 
minimum mesh.
    (3) The Regional Administrator may withdraw approval of a sector, 
after consultation with the Council, at any time, if it is determined 
that sector participants are not complying with the requirements of an 
approved operations plan or that the continuation of the operations plan 
will undermine achievement of fishing mortality objectives of the FMP. 
Withdrawal of approval of a sector may only be done in a manner 
consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act and other applicable 
law.
    (d) Approved sector allocation proposals. Eligible NE multispecies 
vessels, as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, may 
participate in the sectors identified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (19) 
of this section, provided the operations plan is approved by the 
Regional Administrator in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section 
and each participating vessel and vessel operator and/or vessel owner 
complies with the requirements of the operations plan, the requirements 
and conditions specified in the letter of authorization issued pursuant 
to paragraph (c) of this section, and all other requirements specified 
in this section. All operational aspects of these sectors shall be 
specified pursuant to the operations plan and sector contract, as 
required by this section.
    (1) GB Cod Hook Sector.

    (22) State of New Hampshire Permit Bank Sector.
    (23) State of Massachusetts Permit Bank Sector.
    (24) Sustainable Harvest Sector III.
    (e) State-operated permit bank. A state-operated permit bank must 
meet and is subject to the following requirements and conditions:
    (1) The state-operated permit bank must be initially established 
using a Federal grant award from NOAA through a valid Memorandum of 
Agreement (MOA) with NMFS and the state must maintain and comply with 
such MOA. The MOA must contain and the state must comply with at least 
the following requirements and conditions:
    (i) The state may not associate a state-operated permit bank permit 
with a vessel engaged in any fishing or other on-the-water activities;
    (ii) The state must establish the minimum eligibility criteria to 
determine whether a sector and its associated vessels are qualified to 
receive either ACE or DAS from the state-operated permit bank;
    (iii) The state must identify a program contact person for the state 
agency administering the state-operated permit bank;
    (iv) The state must provide to NMFS a list of all permits held by 
the state under the aegis of the state-operated permit bank, and declare 
which permits will be used in the coming fishing year for exclusively 
DAS leasing to common pool vessels and which permits are to be used 
exclusively for transferring ACE to sectors (including the leasing of 
DAS to sector vessels for

[[Page 738]]

the purpose of complying with the requirements of other FMPs); and
    (v) The state must prepare and submit an annual performance report 
to NMFS, and that said performance report must include, at a minimum, 
the following elements:
    (A) A comprehensive listing of all permits held by the state-
operated permit bank, identifying whether a permit was used for ACE 
transfers to sectors (including DAS leases to the sector members) or DAS 
leases to common pool vessels, the total amount of ACE, by stock, and 
DAS available to the state-operated permit bank for transfers and leases 
to sectors and common-pool vessels;
    (B) A comprehensive listing of all sectors to which ACE was 
transferred from the state-operated permit bank, including the amount, 
by stock, of ACE transferred to each sector, including a list of all 
vessels that harvested the ACE transferred to the sector and the amounts 
harvested;
    (C) A comprehensive listing of all sector vessels to which DAS were 
leased from the state-operated permit bank, including the number of DAS 
leased to each sector vessel; and
    (D) A comprehensive listing of all common pool vessels to which DAS 
were leased from the state-operated permit bank, including the number of 
DAS leased to each common pool vessel.
    (2) Eligibility. If a state is issued a permit that meets sector 
eligibility requirements, as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, such permit may be held by a state-operated permit bank.
    (3) Allocation and utilization of ACE--(i) Allocation of ACE. The 
amount of ACE allocated to a state-operated permit bank shall be derived 
from the permits appropriately declared by the state to be ``ACE 
permits,'' pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)(i)(v) of this section, for the 
fishing year and allocated on a stock-by-stock basis pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
    (ii) Acquiring ACE. Except as provided in this paragraph, a state-
operated permit bank may not acquire ACE for a fishing year through a 
transfer from a sector. If ACE is transferred to a sector from a state-
operated permit bank, NMFS may authorize the return of the unused 
portion of such ACE (up to the total originally transferred) to the 
state-operated permit bank upon written agreement by both parties. The 
state-operated permit bank may then redistribute the available ACE to 
another qualifying sector during that fishing year.
    (iii) Transferring ACE. Subject to the terms and conditions of the 
state-operated permit bank's MOAs with NMFS, as well as ACE transfer 
restrictions described in paragraph (b)(1)(viii) of this section, a 
state-operated permit bank may transfer ACE, on a stock-by-stock basis, 
to other state-operated permit banks.
    (4) Allocation and utilization of days-at-sea--(i) Allocation of 
DAS. The number of DAS available for a state-operated permit bank to 
provide to sector or common pool vessels shall be the accumulated NE 
Multispecies Category A DAS assigned to the fishing vessel permits held 
by the state and appropriately declared by the state pursuant to 
paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section to be either ``ACE permits'' or 
``common pool permits'' for that fishing year, consistent with the terms 
of the state's permit bank MOA.
    (ii) Acquiring DAS. A state-operated permit bank may not acquire DAS 
through a lease from a vessel permit (including permits held by other 
state-operated permit banks), as described in Sec. 684.82(k). If a 
vessel leases DAS from a state-operated permit bank, NMFS may authorize 
the return of the unused portion of such DAS to the state-operated 
permit bank upon written agreement by both parties, provided none of the 
DAS had been used. The state-operated permit bank may then redistribute 
the available DAS to another vessel during the same fishing year.
    (5) Annual report. A state-operated permit bank shall report to the 
Council annually on the performance of the state-operated permit bank. 
Such reports shall include at a minimum and to the extent that the 
information does not conflict with any regulations regarding the 
protection of personal and/or proprietary information, all elements 
listed in paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section.

[[Page 739]]

    (6) Use of additional funds. If additional funds from any source 
become available to a state-operated permit bank, the state-operated 
permit bank may not allocate or transfer any ACE that may be associated 
with any new permit purchased with those funds, until the state-operated 
permit bank provides the Council the opportunity to review the 
implications of the expanded state-operated permit bank to the goals and 
objectives of the NE Multispecies FMP.
    (7) Violation of the terms and conditions applicable to a state-
operated permit bank. If a state or state-operated permit bank violates 
or fails to comply with any of the requirements and conditions specified 
in this section or in the MOA referenced in paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section, the state or state-operated permit bank is subject to the 
actions and penalties specified in Sec. 648.4(n) or the MOA.

Sec. 648.88  Multispecies open access permit restrictions.

    (a) Handgear permit. A vessel issued a valid open access NE 
multispecies Handgear permit is subject to the following restrictions:
    (1) The vessel may possess and land up to 75 lb (90.7 kg) of cod, 
and up to the landing and possession limit restrictions for other NE 
multispecies specified in Sec. 648.86, provided the vessel complies 
with the restrictions specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. If 
either the GOM or GB cod trip limit applicable to a vessel fishing under 
a NE multispecies DAS permit, as specified in Sec. 648.86(b)(1) and 
(2), respectively, is adjusted by NMFS, the cod trip limit specified in 
this paragraph (a)(1) shall be adjusted proportionally (rounded up to 
the nearest 25 lb (11.3 kg)). For example, if the GOM cod trip limit 
specified at Sec. 648.86(b)(1) doubled, then the cod trip limit for the 
Handgear B category fishing in the GOM Regulated Mesh Area would also 
double to 150 lb (68 kg).
    (2) Restrictions: (i) The vessel may not use or possess on board 
gear other than handgear while in possession of, fishing for, or landing 
NE multispecies, and must have at least one standard tote on board;
    (ii) The vessel may not fish for, possess, or land regulated species 
from March 1 through March 20 of each year; and
    (iii) The vessel, if fishing with tub-trawl gear, may not fish with 
more than a maximum of 250 hooks.
    (iv) Declaration. To fish for GB cod south of the GOM Regulated Mesh 
Area, as defined at Sec. 648.80(a)(1), a vessel owner or operator must 
obtain, and retain on board, a letter of authorization from the Regional 
Administrator declaring an intent to fish south of the GOM Regulated 
Mesh Area, and may not fish in any other area for a minimum of 7 
consecutive days from the effective date of the letter of authorization. 
Such a vessel may transit the GOM Regulated Mesh Area, provided that 
their gear is stowed in accordance with the provisions at Sec. 
648.23(b).
    (b) Charter/party permit. A vessel that has been issued a valid open 
access NE multispecies charter/party permit is subject to the additional 
restrictions on gear, recreational minimum fish sizes, possession 
limits, and prohibitions on sale specified in Sec. 648.89, and any 
other applicable provisions of this part.
    (c) Scallop NE multispecies possession limit permit. With the 
exception of vessels fishing in the Sea Scallop Access Areas as 
specified in Sec. 648.59(b) through (d), a vessel that has been issued 
a valid open access scallop NE multispecies possession limit permit may 
possess and land up to 300 lb (136.1 kg) of regulated NE multispecies 
when fishing under a scallop DAS allocated under Sec. 648.53, provided 
the vessel does not fish for, possess, or land haddock from January 1 
through June 30, as specified under Sec. 648.86(a)(2)(i), and provided 
that the amount of regulated NE multispecies on board the vessel does 
not exceed any of the pertinent trip limits specified under Sec. 
648.86, and provided the vessel has at least one standard tote on board. 
A vessel fishing in the Sea Scallop Access Areas as specified in Sec. 
648.59(b) through (d) is subject to the possession limits specified in 
Sec. 648.60(a)(5)(ii).

[[Page 740]]

    (d) Non-regulated NE multispecies permit. A vessel issued a valid 
open access non-regulated NE multispecies permit may possess and land 
one Atlantic halibut and unlimited amounts of the other non-regulated NE 
multispecies, unless otherwise restricted by Sec. 648.86. The vessel is 
subject to restrictions on gear, area, and time of fishing specified in 
Sec. 648.80 and any other applicable provisions of this part.

whole fish at the place of landing by dividing the number of fillets by 
two. If fish are filleted into a single (butterfly) fillet, such fillet 
shall be deemed to be from one whole fish.
    (iii) Cod harvested by charter/party vessels with more than one 
person aboard may be pooled in one or more containers. Compliance with 
the possession limits will be determined by dividing the number of fish 
on board by the number of persons on board. If there is a violation of 
the possession limits on board a vessel carrying more than one person, 
the violation shall be deemed to have been committed by the owner or 
operator of the vessel.
    (iv) Cod must be stored so as to be readily available for 
inspection.

Prohibition specified under paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section, each 
person on a private recreational vessel may possess no more than 9 cod 
per day in, or harvested from, the EEZ.
    (3) Atlantic halibut. Charter and party vessels permitted under this 
part, and recreational fishing vessels fishing in the EEZ, may not 
possess, on board, more than one Atlantic halibut.
    (4) Accounting of daily trip limit. For the purposes of determining 
the per day trip limit for cod for recreational fishing vessels and 
party/charter vessels, any trip in excess of 15 hours and covering 2 
consecutive calendar days will be considered more than 1 day. Similarly, 
any trip in excess of 39 hours and covering 3 consecutive calendar days 
will be considered more than 2 days and, so on, in a similar fashion.

of authorization issued by the Regional Administrator pursuant to Sec. 
648.81(c)(2)(iii) and paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
    (3) Letters of authorization. To obtain either of the letters of 
authorization specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section, a 
vessel owner must request a letter from the Northeast Regional Office of 
NMFS, either in writing or by phone (see Table 1 to 50 CFR 600.502). As 
a condition of these letters of authorization, the vessel owner must 
agree to the following:
    (i) The letter of authorization must be carried on board the vessel 
during the period of participation;
    (ii) Fish species managed by the NEFMC or MAFMC that are harvested 
or possessed by the vessel, are not sold or intended for trade, barter 
or sale, regardless of where the fish are caught;
    (iii) The vessel has no gear other than rod and reel or handline 
gear on board; and
    (iv) For the GOM charter/party closed area exemption only, the 
vessel may not fish on a sector trip, under a NE multispecies DAS, or 
under the provisions of the NE multispecies Small Vessel Category or 
Handgear A or Handgear B permit categories, as specified at Sec. 
648.82, during the period of participation.
    (f) Recreational fishery AM--(1) Catch evaluation. As soon as 
recreational catch data are available for the entire previous fishing 
year, the Regional Administrator will evaluate whether recreational 
catches exceed any of the sub-ACLs specified for the recreational 
fishery pursuant to Sec. 648.90(a)(4). When evaluating recreational 
catch, the components of recreational catch that are used shall be the 
same as those used in the most recent assessment for that particular 
stock. To determine if the regulated species or ocean pout sub-ACL 
specified for the recreational

[[Page 743]]

fishery was exceeded, the Regional Administrator shall compare the 3-
year average of recreational catch to the 3-year average of the 
recreational sub-ACL for each stock, as follows:
    (i) For fishing year 2010, recreational catch shall be compared to 
the recreational sub-ACL for that stock for fishing year 2010.
    (ii) For fishing year 2011, the average recreational catch for 
fishing years 2010 and 2011 shall be compared to the average 
recreational sub-ACLs for that stock during fishing years 2010 and 2012.
    (iii) Starting in fishing year 2012, the 3-year average recreational 
catch shall be compared to the 3-year average of the recreational sub-
ACLs for that stock.
    (2) Measure adjustment. If it is determined that any recreational 
sub-ACL was exceeded, as specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, 
the Regional Administrator, after consultation with the New England 
Fishery Management Council, shall develop measures necessary to prevent 
the recreational fishery from exceeding the appropriate sub-ACL in 
future years. Appropriate AMs for the recreational fishery, including 
adjustments to fishing season, minimum fish size, or possession limits, 
may be implemented in a manner consistent with the Administrative 
Procedure Act, with final measures published in the Federal Register no 
later than January when possible. Separate AMs shall be developed for 
the private and charter/party components of the recreational fishery.

<R05>
Sec. 648.90  NE multispecies assessment, framework procedures and 
specifications, and flexible area action system.

    For the NE multispecies framework specification process described in 
this section, the regulated species and ocean pout biennial review is 
considered a separate process from the small-mesh species annual review, 
as described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(1), respectively, of this 
section. In addition, the process for specifying ABCs and associated 
ACLs for regulated species and ocean pout, as described in paragraph 
(a)(4) of this section, is considered a separate process from the small-
mesh species ABC and ACL process described in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (a) NE multispecies. For the purpose of this paragraph (a), the term 
``NE multispecies fishery'' is defined as common pool vessels, sector 
vessels, and private recreational and charter/party vessels, as defined 
in this part; the term ``NE multispecies commercial fishery'' is defined 
as vessels issued a limited access NE multispecies permit, or an open 
access NE multispecies Handgear B permit; and the term ``NE multispecies 
recreational fishery'' is defined as private recreational vessels and 
charter or party boats, as further defined in this part.
    (1) NE Multispecies annual SAFE Report. The NE Multispecies Plan 
Development Team (PDT) shall prepare an annual Stock Assessment and 
Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) Report for the NE multispecies fishery. The 
SAFE Report shall be the primary vehicle for the presentation of all 
updated biological and socio-economic information regarding the NE 
multispecies complex and its associated fisheries. The SAFE report shall 
provide source data for any adjustments to the management measures that 
may be needed to continue to meet the goals and objectives of the FMP.
    (2) Biennial review. (i) The NE multispecies PDT shall meet on or 
before September 30 every other year, unless otherwise specified in 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section, under the conditions specified in that 
paragraph, to perform a review of the fishery, using the most

[[Page 744]]

current scientific information available provided primarily from the 
NEFSC. Data provided by states, ASMFC, the USCG, and other sources may 
also be considered by the PDT. Based on this review, the PDT will 
develop ACLs for the upcoming fishing year(s) as described in paragraph 
(a)(4) of this section and develop options for consideration by the 
Council if necessary, on any changes, adjustments, or additions to DAS 
allocations, closed areas, or other measures necessary to rebuild 
overfished stocks and achieve the FMP goals and objectives.
    (ii) The PDT shall review available data pertaining to: Catch and 
landings, discards, DAS allocations, DAS use, sector operations, and 
other measures of fishing effort; survey results; stock status; current 
estimates of fishing mortality and overfishing levels; social and 
economic impacts; enforcement issues; and any other relevant 
information.
    (iii) Based on this review, the PDT shall recommend ACLs and develop 
options necessary to achieve the FMP goals and objectives, which may 
include a preferred option. The PDT must demonstrate through analyses 
and documentation that the options they develop are expected to meet the 
FMP goals and objectives. The PDT may review the performance of 
different user groups or fleet sectors in developing options. The range 
of options developed by the PDT may include any of the management 
measures in the FMP, including, but not limited to: ACLs, which must be 
based on the projected fishing mortality levels required to meet the 
goals and objectives outlined in the FMP for the 12 regulated species 
and ocean pout if able to be determined; identifying and distributing 
ACLs and other sub-components of the ACLs among various segments of the 
fishery; AMs; DAS changes; possession limits; gear restrictions; closed 
areas; permitting restrictions; minimum fish sizes; recreational fishing 
measures; describing and identifying EFH; fishing gear management 
measures to protect EFH; and designating habitat areas of particular 
concern within EFH. In addition, the following conditions and measures 
may be adjusted through future framework adjustments: Revisions to DAS 
measures, including DAS allocations (such as the distribution of DAS 
among the four categories of DAS), future uses for Category C DAS, and 
DAS baselines, adjustments for steaming time, etc.; modifications to 
capacity measures, such as changes to the DAS transfer or DAS leasing 
measures; calculation of area-specific ACLs, area management boundaries, 
and adoption of area-specific management measures; sector allocation 
requirements and specifications, including the establishment of a new 
sector, the disapproval of an existing sector, the allowable percent of 
ACL available to a sector through a sector allocation, and the 
calculation of PSCs; sector administration provisions, including at-sea 
and dockside monitoring measures; sector reporting requirements; state-
operated permit bank administrative provisions; measures to implement 
the U.S./Canada Resource Sharing Understanding, including any specified 
TACs (hard or target); changes to administrative measures; additional 
uses for Regular B DAS; reporting requirements; the GOM Inshore 
Conservation and Management Stewardship Plan; adjustments to the 
Handgear A or B permits; gear requirements to improve selectivity, 
reduce bycatch, and/or reduce impacts of the fishery on EFH; SAP 
modifications; revisions to the ABC control rule and status 
determination criteria, including, but not limited to, changes in the 
target fishing mortality rates, minimum biomass thresholds, numerical 
estimates of parameter values, and the use of a proxy for biomass may be 
made either through a biennial adjustment or framework adjustment; and 
any other measures currently included in the FMP.
    (iv) The Council shall review the ACLs recommended by the PDT and 
all of the options developed by the PDT and other relevant information; 
consider public comment; and develop a recommendation to meet the FMP 
objectives pertaining to regulated species or ocean pout that is 
consistent with applicable law. If the Council does not submit a 
recommendation that meets the FMP objectives and is consistent

[[Page 745]]

with applicable law, the Regional Administrator may adopt any option 
developed by the PDT, unless rejected by the Council, as specified in 
paragraph (a)(2)(vii) of this section, provided the option meets the FMP 
objectives and is consistent with applicable law.
    (v) Based on this review, the Council shall submit a recommendation 
to the Regional Administrator of any changes, adjustments or additions 
to DAS allocations, closed areas or other measures necessary to achieve 
the FMP's goals and objectives. The Council shall include in its 
recommendation supporting documents, as appropriate, concerning the 
environmental and economic impacts of the proposed action and the other 
options considered by the Council.
    (vi) If the Council submits, on or before December 1, a 
recommendation to the Regional Administrator after one Council meeting, 
and the Regional Administrator concurs with the recommendation, the 
Regional Administrator shall publish the Council's recommendation in the 
Federal Register as a proposed rule with a 30-day public comment period. 
The Council may instead submit its recommendation on or before February 
1, if it chooses to follow the framework process outlined in paragraph 
(c) of this section, and requests that the Regional Administrator 
publish the recommendation as a final rule, in a manner consistent with 
the Administrative Procedure Act. If the Regional Administrator concurs 
that the Council's recommendation meets the FMP objectives and is 
consistent with other applicable law, and determines that the 
recommended management measures should be published as a final rule, the 
action will be published as a final rule in the Federal Register, in a 
manner consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act. If the Regional 
Administrator concurs that the recommendation meets the FMP objectives 
and is consistent with other applicable law and determines that a 
proposed rule is warranted, and, as a result, the effective date of a 
final rule falls after the start of the fishing year on May 1, fishing 
may continue. However, DAS used or regulated species or ocean pout 
landed by a vessel on or after May 1 will be counted against any DAS or 
sector ACE allocation the vessel or sector ultimately receives for that 
year, as appropriate.
    (vii) If the Regional Administrator concurs in the Council's 
recommendation, a final rule shall be published in the Federal Register 
on or about April 1 of each year, with the exception noted in paragraph 
(a)(2)(vi) of this section. If the Council fails to submit a 
recommendation to the Regional Administrator by February 1 that meets 
the FMP goals and objectives, the Regional Administrator may publish as 
a proposed rule one of the options reviewed and not rejected by the 
Council, provided that the option meets the FMP objectives and is 
consistent with other applicable law. If, after considering public 
comment, the Regional Administrator decides to approve the option 
published as a proposed rule, the action will be published as a final 
rule in the Federal Register.
    (3) Review in 2008 for the 2009 fishing year. In addition to the 
biennial review specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the PDT 
shall meet to conduct a review of the groundfish fishery by September 
2008 for the purposes of determining the need for a framework action for 
the 2009 fishing year. For the 2008 review, a benchmark assessment, 
peer-reviewed by independent scientists, will be completed for each of 
the regulated multispecies stocks and for Atlantic halibut and ocean 
pout. The interim biomass targets specified in the FMP will be evaluated 
during this benchmark assessment to evaluate the efficacy of the 
rebuilding program. Based on findings from the benchmark assessment, a 
determination will be made as to whether the FMP biomass targets appear 
to be appropriate, or whether they should be increased or decreased, in 
conformance with the best scientific information available.
    (4) Process for setting ABCs and ACLs--(i) ABC/ACL recommendations. 
As described in this paragraph (a)(4), with the exception of stocks 
managed by the Understanding, the PDT shall develop recommendations for 
setting an ABC, ACL, and OFL for each NE multispecies stock for each of 
the next 3 years as part of the biennial review process

[[Page 746]]

specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. ACLs can also be 
specified based upon updated information in the annual SAFE report, as 
described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and other available 
information as part of a specification package, as described in 
paragraph (a)(6) of this section. For NE multispecies stocks or stock 
components managed under both the NE Multispecies FMP and the 
Understanding, the PDT shall develop recommendations for ABCs, ACLs, and 
OFLs for the pertinent stock or stock components annually, as described 
in this paragraph (a)(4) and Sec. 648.85(a)(2).
    (ii) Timing. The PDT recommendations for setting ABCs and ACLs shall 
be provided to the SSC prior to the September Council meeting, to the 
extent possible. The Council shall consider the ABC recommendations of 
the SSC and the ACL recommendations of the PDT (and TMGC) and shall make 
a decision on those recommendations prior to December 1, to the extent 
possible. Once the Council has approved its recommended ACLs, they shall 
be submitted to NMFS prior to December 1, to the extent possible for 
approval and implementation. If the Council is submitting a management 
action as part of the biennial adjustment process, the ACLs can be 
included in that document along with any necessary analysis required by 
applicable law. After receipt of the Council recommendation for ACLs, 
either as part of a new management action or as part of a specification 
package, as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, NMFS shall 
review the Council's decision and, if consistent with applicable law, 
implement the ACL in a manner consistent with the Administrative 
Procedure Act.
    (iii) ABC/ACL distribution. The ABCs/ACLs adopted by the Council for 
each regulated species or ocean pout stock pursuant to this paragraph 
(a)(4) shall be subdivided among the various sub-components of the 
fishery, as specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(iii)(A) through (E) of this 
section. For transboundary stocks managed by the Understanding, pursuant 
to Sec. 648.85(a), the distribution of ABC/ACLs described in paragraphs 
(a)(4)(iii)(A) through (E) of this section shall be based upon the catch 
available to U.S. fishermen. The Council may revise its recommendations 
for the distribution of ABCs and ACLs among these and other sub-
components through the process to specify ABCs and ACLs, as described in 
this paragraph (a)(4).
    (A) Regulated species or ocean pout catch by vessels outside of the 
FMP. The catch of regulated species or ocean pout that is expected to be 
harvested by vessels operating in state waters that have not been issued 
a Federal NE multispecies permit and are not subject to the regulations 
specified in this part shall be deducted from the ABC/ACL of each 
regulated species or ocean pout stock pursuant to the process for 
specifying ABCs and ACLs, as described in this paragraph (a)(4).
    (B) Regulated species or ocean pout catch by exempted fisheries. 
Regulated species or ocean pout catch by other, non-specified sub-
components of the fishery, including, but not limited to, exempted 
fisheries that occur in Federal waters and fisheries harvesting exempted 
species specified in Sec. 648.80(b)(3) shall be deducted from the ABC/
ACL of each regulated species or ocean pout stock, pursuant to the 
process to specify ABCs and ACLs described in this paragraph (a)(4). The 
catch of these non-specified sub-components of the ACL shall be 
monitored using data collected pursuant to this part. If catch from such 
fisheries exceeds the amount specified in this paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(B), 
AMs shall be developed to prevent the overall ACL for each stock from 
being exceeded, pursuant to the framework adjustment process specified 
in this section.
    (C) Yellowtail flounder catch by the Atlantic sea scallop fishery. 
Yellowtail flounder catch in the Atlantic sea scallop fishery, as 
defined in subpart D, shall be deducted from the ABC/ACL for each 
yellowtail flounder stock pursuant to the restrictions specified in 
subpart D of this part and the process to specify ABCs and ACLs, as 
described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Unless otherwise 
specified in this paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(C), or subpart D of this part, 
the specific value of the sub-components of the ABC/ACL for each stock 
of yellowtail flounder distributed to the Atlantic sea scallop fishery 
shall be

[[Page 747]]

specified pursuant to the biennial adjustment process specified in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Based on information available, NMFS 
shall re-estimate the expected scallop fishery catch of GB yellowtail 
flounder for the current fishing year by January 15. If NMFS determines 
that the scallop fishery will catch less than 90 percent of its GB 
yellowtail flounder sub-ACL, the Regional Administrator may reduce the 
scallop fishery sub-ACL to the amount projected to be caught, and 
increase the groundfish fishery sub-ACL by any amount up to the amount 
reduced from the scallop fishery sub-ACL. The revised groundfish fishery 
sub-ACL shall be distributed to the common pool and sectors based on the 
process specified in paragraph (a)(4)(E)(1) of this section.
    (D) Haddock catch by the Atlantic herring fishery. One percent each 
of the GOM haddock and GB haddock ABC (U.S. share only) shall be 
allocated to the Atlantic herring fishery, pursuant to the restrictions 
in Sec. Sec. 648.85(d) and 648.86(a)(3), and pursuant to the process 
for specifying ABCs and ACLs described in paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section. An ACL based on this ABC shall be determined using the process 
described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section.
    (E) Regulated species or ocean pout catch by the NE multispecies 
commercial and recreational fisheries. Unless otherwise specified in the 
ACL recommendations developed pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) of this 
section, after all of the deductions and considerations specified in 
paragraphs (a)(4)(iii)(A) through (D) of this section, the remaining 
ABC/ACL for each regulated species or ocean pout stock shall be 
allocated to the NE multispecies commercial and recreational fisheries, 
pursuant to this paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(E).
    (1) Recreational allocation. Unless otherwise specified in paragraph 
(a)(5) of this section, recreational catches shall be compared to the 
ACLs allocated pursuant to this paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(E)(1) for the 
purposes of determining whether adjustments to recreational measures are 
necessary, pursuant to the recreational fishery AMs specified in Sec. 
648.89(f).
    (i) Stocks allocated. Unless otherwise specified in this paragraph 
(a)(4)(iii)(E)(1), the ABCs/ACLs for GOM cod and GOM haddock available 
to the NE multispecies fishery pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(E) of 
this section shall be divided between commercial and recreational 
components of the fishery, based upon the average proportional catch of 
each component for each stock during fishing years 2001 through 2006.
    (ii) Process for determining if a recreational allocation is 
necessary. A recreational allocation may not be made if it is determined 
that, based upon available information, the ACLs for these stocks are 
not being fully harvested by the NE multispecies fishery, or if the 
recreational harvest, after accounting for state waters catch pursuant 
to paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, is less than 5 percent of 
the overall catch for a particular stock of regulated species or ocean 
pout.
    (2) Commercial allocation. Unless otherwise specified in this 
paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(E)(2), the ABC/ACL for regulated species or ocean 
pout stocks available to the commercial NE multispecies fishery, after 
consideration of the recreational allocation pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(4)(iii)(E)(1) of this section, shall be divided between vessels 
operating under approved sector operations plans, as described at Sec. 
648.87(c), and vessels operating under the provisions of the common 
pool, as defined in this part, based upon the cumulative PSCs of vessels 
participating in sectors calculated pursuant to Sec. 
648.87(b)(1)(i)(E). For fishing years 2010 and 2011, the ABC/ACL of each 
regulated species or ocean pout stocks not allocated to sectors pursuant 
to Sec. 648.87(b)(1)(i)(E) (i.e., Atlantic halibut, SNE/MA winter 
flounder, ocean pout, windowpane flounder, and Atlantic wolffish) that 
is available to the commercial NE multispecies fishery shall be 
allocated entirely to the common pool. Unless otherwise specified in 
paragraph (a)(5) of this section, regulated species or ocean pout catch 
by common pool and sector vessels shall be deducted from the sub-ACL/ACE 
allocated pursuant to this paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(E)(2) for the purposes 
of determining whether adjustments to common pool measures are 
necessary, pursuant to the common pool AMs

[[Page 748]]

specified in Sec. 648.82(n), or whether sector ACE overages must be 
deducted, pursuant to Sec. 648.87(b)(1)(iii).
    (3) Revisions to commercial and recreational allocations. 
Distribution of the ACL for each stock available to the NE multispecies 
fishery between and among commercial and recreational components of the 
fishery may be implemented through a framework adjustment pursuant to 
this section. Any changes to the distribution of ACLs to the NE 
multispecies fishery shall not affect the implementation of AMs based 
upon the distribution in effect at the time of the overage that 
triggered the AM.
    (iv) ACL monitoring--(A) Landings. For the purposes of monitoring 
the catch of regulated species or ocean pout towards the harvest of ACLs 
and other, non-specified sub-components of the ACLs specified in 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the reporting requirements specified 
in this part, including dealer reports, VTRs, VMS catch reports, sector 
catch reports, and other available information shall be used to identify 
and apportion regulated species or ocean pout landings by stock area.
    (B) Discards. Unless otherwise specified in this paragraph 
(a)(4)(iv)(B), regulated species or ocean pout discards shall be 
monitored through the use of VTRs, observer data, VMS catch reports, and 
other available information, as specified in this part. Regulated 
species or ocean pout discards by vessels on a sector trip shall be 
monitored pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(v)(A) of this section.
    (v) Adjustments to ACLs. The Council may elect to revise the ACL for 
any regulated species or ocean pout stock in the second fishing year 
following a biennial review to account for any overages of an ACL in 
year one that may result in overfishing for a particular stock. Any 
adjustments to the ACLs in year two will be implemented pursuant to the 
process to specify ABCs and ACLs, as described in paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section.
    (5) AMs. Except as specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(iii)(A) and (D) of 
this section, if any of the ACLs specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section are exceeded based upon available catch information, the AMs 
specified in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section shall take 
effect in the following fishing year, or as soon as practicable, 
thereafter, once catch data for all affected fisheries are available, as 
applicable.
    (i) AMs for the NE multispecies commercial and recreational 
fisheries. If the catch of regulated species or ocean pout by a sub-
component of the NE multispecies fishery (i.e., common pool vessels, 
sector vessels, or private recreational and charter/party vessels) 
exceeds the amount allocated to each sub-component, as specified in 
paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(E) of this section, then the applicable AM for 
that sub-component of the fishery shall take effect, pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(5)(i)(A) through (C) of this section. In determining the 
applicability of AMs specified for a sub-component of the NE 
multispecies fishery in paragraphs (a)(5)(i)(A) through (C) of this 
section, the Regional Administrator shall consider available information 
regarding the catch of regulated species and ocean pout by each sub-
component of the NE multispecies fishery, plus each sub-component's 
share of any overage of the overall ACL for a particular stock caused by 
excessive catch by vessels outside of the FMP, exempted fisheries, or 
the Atlantic sea scallop fishery, as specified in this paragraph (a)(5), 
as appropriate.
    (A) Excessive catch by common pool vessels. If the catch of 
regulated species and ocean pout by common pool vessels exceeds the 
amount of the ACL specified for common pool vessels pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(E)(2) of this section, then the AMs described in 
Sec. 648.82(n) shall take effect. Pursuant to the distribution of ABCs/
ACLs specified in paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(E)(2) of this section, for the 
purposes of this paragraph (a)(5)(i)(A), the catch of each regulated 
species or ocean pout stock not allocated to sectors pursuant to Sec. 
648.87(b)(1)(i)(E) (i.e., Atlantic halibut, SNE/MA winter flounder, 
ocean pout, windowpane flounder, and Atlantic wolffish) during fishing 
years 2010 and 2011 shall be added to the catch of such stocks by common 
pool vessels to determine whether the differential DAS counting AM 
described in Sec. 648.82(n)(1)

[[Page 749]]

shall take effect. If such catch does not exceed the portion of the ACL 
specified for common pool vessels pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(4)(iii)(E)(2) of this section, then no AMs shall take effect for 
common pool vessels.
    (B) Excessive catch by sector vessels. If the catch of regulated 
species and ocean pout by sector vessels exceeds the amount of the ACL 
specified for sector vessels pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(E)(2) of 
this section, then the AMs described in Sec. 648.87(b)(1)(iii) shall 
take effect. For the purposes of this paragraph (a)(5)(i)(B), the catch 
of regulated species and ocean pout for each sector approved pursuant to 
Sec. 648.87 shall be based upon the catch of vessels participating in 
each approved sector. If such catch does not exceed the portion of the 
ACL specified for an individual sector pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(4)(iii)(E)(2) of this section, then no AMs shall take effect for 
that sector.
    (C) Excessive catch by the NE multispecies recreational fishery. If 
the catch of regulated species and ocean pout by private recreational 
and charter/party vessels exceeds the amount of the ACL specified for 
the recreational fishery pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(E)(1) of this 
section, then the AMs described in Sec. 648.89(f) shall take effect. If 
such catch does not exceed the portion of the ACL specified for the 
recreational fishery pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(E)(1) of this 
section, then no AMs shall take effect for the recreational fishery.
    (D) AMs for both stocks of windowpane flounder, ocean pout, and 
Atlantic halibut. At the end of each fishing year, NMFS shall determine 
if the overall ACL for northern windowpane flounder, southern windowpane 
flounder, ocean pout, or Atlantic halibut was exceeded. If the overall 
ACL for any of these stocks is exceeded, NMFS shall implement the 
appropriate AM, as specified in this paragraph (a)(5)(i)(D), in the 
second fishing year after the fishing year in which the overage 
occurred, consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act. For example, 
if NMFS determined the overall ACL for northern windowpane flounder was 
exceeded in fishing year 2012, the applicable AM would be implemented 
for fishing year 2014.
    (1) Windowpane flounder and ocean pout. If NMFS determines the 
overall ACL for either stock of windowpane flounder or ocean pout is 
exceeded, as described in this paragraph (a)(5)(i)(D)(1), by any amount 
between the management uncertainty buffer and up to 20 percent, the 
applicable small AM area for the stock shall be implemented, as 
specified in paragraph (a)(5)(i)(D) of this section. If the overall ACL 
is exceeded by 21 percent or more, the applicable large AM area(s) for 
the stock shall be implemented, as specified in paragraph (a)(5)(i)(D) 
of this section. The AM areas defined below are bounded by the following 
coordinates, connected in the order listed by rhumb lines, unless 
otherwise noted. Any vessel issued a limited access NE multispecies 
permit and fishing with trawl gear in these areas may only use a haddock 
separator trawl, as specified in Sec. 648.85(a)(3)(iii)(A); a Ruhle 
trawl, as specified in Sec. 648.85(b)(6)(iv)(J)(3); a rope separator 
trawl, as specified in Sec. 648.81(n)(3)(i)(A); or any other gear 
approved consistent with the process defined in Sec. 648.85(b)(6). If a 
sub-ACL for either stock of windowpane flounder or ocean pout is 
allocated to another fishery, consistent with the process specified at 
Sec. 648.90(a)(4), and AMs are developed for that fishery, the 
groundfish fishery AM shall only be implemented if the sub-ACL allocated 
to the groundfish fishery is exceeded (i.e., the sector and common pool 
catch for a particular stock, including the common pool's share of any 
overage of the overall ACL caused by excessive catch by other sub-
components of the fishery pursuant to Sec. 648.90(a)(5) exceeds the 
common pool sub-ACL) and the overall ACL is also exceeded.

    (2) Atlantic halibut. If NMFS determines the overall ACL is exceeded 
for Atlantic halibut, any vessel issued a limited access NE multispecies 
permit, an open access NE multispecies Handgear B permit, an open access 
NE multispecies Category K permit, or a limited access monkfish permit 
and fishing under the monkfish Category C or D permit provisions, may 
not fish for, possess, or land Atlantic halibut for the fishing year in 
which the AM is implemented as specified in paragraph (a)(5)(i)(D) of 
this section.
    (E) AMs for SNE/MA winter flounder and Atlantic wolffish. A vessel 
issued a limited access NE multispecies permit, an open access NE 
multispecies Handgear B permit, an open access NE multispecies charter/
party permit, or a limited access monkfish permit and fishing under the 
monkfish Category C or D permit provisions may not fish for, possess, or 
land SNE/MA winter flounder, as specified in Sec. 648.86(l), as a 
proactive AM to prevent the overall ACL for these stocks from being 
exceeded.
    (ii) AMs if the overall ACL for a regulated species or ocean pout 
stock is exceeded. If the catch of any stock of regulated species or 
ocean pout by vessels fishing outside of the NE multispecies fishery; 
vessels fishing in state waters outside of the FMP; or vessels fishing 
in exempted fisheries, as defined in this part; or the catch of 
yellowtail flounder by the Atlantic sea scallop fishery exceeds the sub-
component of the ACL for that stock specified for such fisheries 
pursuant to paragraphs (a)(4)(iii)(A) through (C) of this section, and 
the overall ACL for that stock is exceeded, then the amount of the 
overage of the overall ACL for that stock due to catch from vessels 
fishing outside of the NE multispecies fishery shall be distributed 
among components of the NE multispecies fishery based upon each 
component's share of that stock's ACL available to the NE multispecies 
fishery pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(E) of this section. Each 
component's share of the ACL overage for a particular stock would be 
then added to the catch of that stock by each component of the NE 
multispecies fishery to determine if the resulting sum of catch of that 
stock for each component of the fishery exceeds that individual 
component's share of that stock's ACL available to the NE multispecies 
fishery. If the total catch of that stock by any component of the NE 
multispecies fishery exceeds the amount of the ACL specified for that 
component of the NE

[[Page 751]]

multispecies fishery pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(E) of this 
section, then the AMs specified in paragraphs (a)(5)(i)(A) through (C) 
of this section shall take effect, as applicable. If the catch of any 
stock of regulated species or ocean pout by vessels outside of the FMP 
exceeds the sub-component of the ACL for that stock specified pursuant 
to paragraphs (a)(4)(iii)(A) through (C) of this section, but the 
overall ACL for that stock is not exceeded, even after consideration of 
the catch of that stock by other sub-components of the fishery, then the 
AMs specified in this paragraph (a)(5)(ii) shall not take effect.
    (iii) AMs if the incidental catch cap for the Atlantic herring 
fishery is exceeded. At the end of the NE. multispecies fishing year, 
NMFS shall evaluate Atlantic herring fishery catch using VTR, VMS, IVR, 
observer data, and any other available information to determine whether 
a haddock incidental catch cap has been exceeded based upon the 
cumulative catch of vessels issued an Atlantic herring permit and 
fishing with midwater trawl gear in Management Areas 1A, 1B, and/or 3. 
If the catch of haddock by all vessels issued an Atlantic herring permit 
and fishing with midwater trawl gear in Management Areas 1A, 1B, and/or 
3, exceeds the amount of the incidental catch cap specified in Sec. 
648.85(d) of this section, then the appropriate incidental catch cap 
shall be reduced by the overage on a pound-for-pound basis during the 
following fishing year. Any overage reductions shall be announced by the 
Regional Administrator in the Federal Register, accordance with the 
Administrative Procedure Act, prior to the start of the next NE. 
multispecies fishing year after which the overage occurred, if possible, 
or as soon as possible thereafter if the overage is not determined until 
after the end of the NE. multispecies fishing year in which the overage 
occurred.
    (iv) AMs if the sub-ACL for the Atlantic sea scallop fishery is 
exceeded. At the end of the scallop fishing year, NMFS shall evaluate 
Atlantic sea scallop fishery catch to determine whether a scallop 
fishery sub-ACL has been exceeded. On January 15, or when information is 
available to make an accurate projection, NMFS will also determine 
whether the overall ACL for each stock allocated to the scallop fishery 
has been exceeded. When evaluating whether the overall ACL has been 
exceeded, NMFS will add the maximum carryover available to sectors, as 
specified at Sec. 648.87(b)(1)(i)(C), to the estimate of total catch 
for the pertinent stock. If catch by scallop vessels exceeds the 
pertinent sub-ACL specified in paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(C) of this section 
by 50 percent or more, or if scallop catch exceeds the scallop fishery 
sub-ACL and the overall ACL for that stock is also exceeded, then the 
applicable scallop fishery AM shall take effect, as specified in Sec. 
648.64 of the Atlantic sea scallop regulations.
    (6) Specifications process--(i) PDT recommendations. Unless 
otherwise developed pursuant to the biennial review process specified in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the PDT shall develop recommendations 
for setting ACLs for each regulated species or ocean pout, including 
ACLs for stocks managed by the Understanding; revising rebuilding 
programs and associated management measures; or modifying AMs for 
consideration by the Council's Groundfish Oversight Committee based upon 
the SAFE report prepared pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section. 
If the Council determines, based on information provided by the PDT or 
other stock-related information, that the ACLs should be adjusted 
between biennial reviews, it can do so through the same process outlined 
in this section during the interim year.
    (ii) Guidelines. As the basis for its recommendations under 
paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, the PDT shall review available data 
pertaining to: Commercial and recreational catch data; current estimates 
of fishing mortality; discards; stock status; recent estimates of 
recruitment; virtual population analysis results and other estimates of 
stock size; sea sampling and trawl survey data or, if sea sampling data 
are unavailable, length frequency information from trawl surveys; impact 
of other fisheries on herring mortality; and any other relevant 
information.
    (iii) Groundfish Oversight Committee recommendations. Based on the 
PDT's

[[Page 752]]

recommendations and any public comment received, the Groundfish 
Oversight Committee shall recommend to the Council appropriate 
specifications a period of at least 1 year. The Council shall review 
these recommendations and, after considering public comment, shall 
recommend appropriate specifications to NMFS. NMFS shall review the 
recommendations and publish proposed specifications in a manner 
consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act. If the proposed 
specifications differ from those recommended by the Council, the reasons 
for any differences shall be clearly stated.
    (iv) Analysis. Any specifications package developed pursuant to this 
paragraph (a)(5) shall be supported by the appropriate NEPA analysis, 
which shall be made available for public comment.
    (b) Small-mesh multispecies--(1) Three-year specifications process, 
annual review, and Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation. The Council 
will specify on at least a 3-year basis the OFL, ABC, ACLs, and TALs for 
each small-mesh multispecies stock in accordance with the following 
process.
    (i) At least every 3 years, based on the annual review, described 
below in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and/or the SAFE Report 
described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, recommendations for ABC 
from the Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC), and any other 
relevant information, the Small-Mesh Multispecies PDT will recommend to 
the Whiting Oversight Committee and Council specifications including the 
OFL, ABC, ACL and TAL for each small-mesh multispecies stock the 
following specifications for a period of at least 3 years. The Small-
Mesh Multispecies PDT and the Council will follow the process in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section for setting these specifications.
    (ii) The Small-Mesh Multispecies PDT, after reviewing the available 
information on the status of the stock and the fishery, may recommend to 
the Council any measures necessary to assure that the specifications 
will not be exceeded, as well as changes to the appropriate 
specifications.
    (iii) Taking into account the annual review and/or SAFE Report 
described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the advice of the SSC, 
and any other relevant information, the Small-Mesh Multispecies PDT may 
also recommend to the Whiting Oversight Committee and Council changes to 
stock status determination criteria and associated thresholds based on 
the best scientific information available, including information from 
peer-reviewed stock assessments of small-mesh multispecies. These 
adjustments may be included in the Council's specifications for the 
small-mesh multispecies fishery.
    (iv) Council recommendation. (A) The Council will review the 
recommendations of the Small-Mesh Multispecies PDT, Whiting Oversight 
Committee, and SSC, any public comment received thereon, and any other 
relevant information, and make a recommendation to the Regional 
Administrator on appropriate specifications and any measures necessary 
to assure that the specifications will not be exceeded.
    (B) The Council's recommendation must include supporting 
documentation, as appropriate, concerning the environmental, economic, 
and social impacts of the recommendations. The Regional Administrator 
will consider the recommendations and publish a rule in the Federal 
Register proposing specifications and associated measures, consistent 
with the Administrative Procedure Act.
    (C) The Regional Administrator may propose specifications different 
than those recommended by the Council. If the specifications published 
in the Federal Register differ from those recommended by the Council, 
the reasons for any differences must be clearly stated and the revised 
specifications must satisfy the criteria set forth in this section, the 
FMP, and other applicable laws.
    (D) If the final specifications are not published in the Federal 
Register for the start of the fishing year, the previous year's 
specifications will remain in effect until superseded by the final rule 
implementing the current year's specifications, to ensure that there is 
no lapse in regulations while new specifications are completed.
    (2) Process for specifying ABCs, ACLs and TALs. The Small-Mesh 
Multispecies PDT will calculate the OFL and

[[Page 753]]

ABC values for each small-mesh multispecies stock based on the control 
rules established in the FMP. These calculations will be reviewed by the 
SSC, guided by terms of reference developed by the Council. The ACLs and 
TALs will be calculated based on the SSC's approved ABCs, as specified 
in paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(A) through (C), and (a)(2)(ii)(A) through (C) of 
this section.
    (i) Red hake--(A) ABCs. The Council's SSC will recommend an ABC to 
the Council for both the northern and southern stocks of red hake. The 
red hake ABCs are reduced from the OFLs based on an adjustment for 
scientific uncertainty as specified in the FMP; the ABCs must be less 
than or equal to the OFL.
    (B) ACLs. The red hake ACLs are equal to 95 percent of the 
corresponding ABCs.
    (C) TALs. The red hake TALs are equal to the ACLs minus a discard 
estimate based on the most recent 3 years of data. The red hake TALs are 
then reduced by 3 percent to account for red hake landings that occur in 
state waters.
    (ii) Silver and Offshore Hake--(A) ABCs. The Council's SSC will 
recommend an ABC to the Council for both the northern and southern 
stocks of silver hake. The ABC for the southern stock of silver hake 
will be increased by 4 percent to account for catch of offshore hake. 
The combined silver hake and offshore hake ABC in the southern area will 
be the southern whiting ABC. The silver hake and whiting ABCs are 
reduced from the OFLs based on an adjustment for scientific uncertainty 
as specified in the FMP; the ABCs must be less than or equal to the 
OFLs.
    (B) ACLs. The northern silver hake and southern whiting ACLs are 
equal to 95 percent of the ABCs.
    (C) TALs. The northern silver hake and southern whiting TALs are 
equal to the northern silver hake and southern whiting ACLs minus a 
discard estimate based on the most recent 3 years of data. The northern 
silver hake and southern whiting TALs are then reduced by 3 percent to 
account for silver hake and offshore hake landings that occur in state 
waters.
    (3) Annual Review. (i) The Small-Mesh Multispecies PDT will meet at 
least once annually to review the status of the stock and the fishery 
and the adequacy of the 3-year specifications. Based on such review, the 
PDT will provide a report to the Council on any changes or new 
information about the small-mesh multispecies stocks and/or fishery, and 
it will recommend whether the specifications for the upcoming year(s), 
established pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, need to be 
modified. At a minimum, this review should include a review of at least 
the following data, if available: Commercial catch data; current 
estimates of fishing mortality and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE); 
discards; stock status; recent estimates of recruitment; virtual 
population analysis results and other estimates of stock size; sea 
sampling, port sampling, and survey data or, if sea sampling data are 
unavailable, length frequency information from port sampling and/or 
surveys; impact of other fisheries on the mortality of small-mesh 
multispecies; and any other relevant information.
    (ii) If new and/or additional information becomes available, the 
Small-Mesh Multispecies PDT will consider it during this annual review. 
Based on this review, the Small-Mesh Multispecies PDT will provide 
guidance to the Whiting Oversight Committee and the Council regarding 
the need to adjust measures for the small-mesh multispecies fishery to 
better achieve the FMP's objectives. After considering this guidance, 
the Council may submit to NMFS its recommendations for changes to 
management measures, as appropriate, through the specifications process 
described in this section, the process specified in paragraph (c) of 
this section, or through an amendment to the FMP.
    (4) SAFE Report. (i) The Small-Mesh Multispecies PDT will prepare a 
SAFE Report at least every 3 years. Based on the SAFE Report, the Small-
Mesh Multispecies PDT will develop and present to the Council 
recommended specifications as defined in paragraph (a) of this section 
for up to 3 fishing years. The SAFE Report will be the primary vehicle 
for the presentation of

[[Page 754]]

all updated biological and socio-economic information regarding the 
small-mesh multispecies fishery. The SAFE Report will provide source 
data for any adjustments to the management measures that may be needed 
to continue to meet the goals and objectives of the FMP.
    (ii) In any year in which a SAFE Report is not completed by the 
Small-Mesh Multispecies PDT, the annual review process described in 
paragraph (a) of this section will be used to recommend any necessary 
adjustments to specifications and/or management measures in the FMP.
    (5) Accountability measures for the small-mesh multispecies 
fishery--(i) In-season adjustment of possession limits. If the Regional 
Administrator projects that 90 percent of a stock area TAL, as defined 
in Sec. 648.90(b)(3), has been landed, the Regional Administrator shall 
reduce the possession limit of that stock to the incidental level, as 
specified in Sec. 648.86(d)(4), for the remainder of the fishing year 
through notice consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act, unless 
such a reduction in the possession limit would be expected to prevent 
the TAL from being reached.
    (ii) Post-season adjustment for an overage. If NMFS determines that 
a small-mesh multispecies ACL was exceeded in a given fishing year, the 
exact amount of the landings overage will be deducted, as soon as is 
practicable, from a subsequent single fishing year's ACL for that stock, 
through notification consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act.
    (c) Within season management action for NE multispecies, including 
small-mesh NE multispecies. The Council may, at any time, initiate 
action to add or adjust management measures if it finds that action is 
necessary to meet or be consistent with the goals and objectives of the 
NE Multispecies FMP, to address gear conflicts, or to facilitate the 
development of aquaculture projects in the EEZ. This procedure may also 
be used to modify FMP overfishing definitions and fishing mortality 
targets that form the basis for selecting specific management measures.
    (1) Adjustment process. (i) After a management action has been 
initiated, the Council shall develop and analyze appropriate management 
actions over the span of at least two Council meetings. The Council 
shall provide the public with advance notice of the availability of both 
the proposals and the analyses and opportunity to comment on them prior 
to and at the second Council meeting. The Council's recommendation on 
adjustments or additions to management measures, other than to address 
gear conflicts, must come from one or more of the following categories: 
DAS changes, effort monitoring, data reporting, possession limits, gear 
restrictions, closed areas, permitting restrictions, crew limits, 
minimum fish sizes, onboard observers, minimum hook size and hook style, 
the use of crucifer in the hook-gear fishery, sector requirements, 
recreational fishing measures, area closures and other appropriate 
measures to mitigate marine mammal entanglements and interactions, 
description and identification of EFH, fishing gear management measures 
to protect EFH, designation of habitat areas of particular concern 
within EFH, and any other management measures currently included in the 
FMP. In addition, the Council's recommendation on adjustments or 
additions to management measures pertaining to small-mesh NE 
multispecies, other than to address gear conflicts, must come from one 
or more of the following categories: Quotas and appropriate seasonal 
adjustments for vessels fishing in experimental or exempted fisheries 
that use small mesh in combination with a separator trawl/grate (if 
applicable), modifications to separator grate (if applicable) and mesh 
configurations for fishing for small-mesh NE multispecies, adjustments 
to whiting stock boundaries for management purposes, adjustments for 
fisheries exempted from minimum mesh requirements to fish for small-mesh 
NE multispecies (if applicable), season adjustments, declarations, and 
participation requirements for the Cultivator Shoal Whiting Fishery 
Exemption Area.
    (ii) Adjustment process for whiting DAS. The Council may develop 
recommendations for a whiting DAS effort reduction program through the 
framework process outlined in paragraph (c)

[[Page 755]]

of this section only if these options are accompanied by a full set of 
public hearings that span the area affected by the proposed measures in 
order to provide adequate opportunity for public comment.
    (2) Adjustment process for gear conflicts. The Council may develop a 
recommendation on measures to address gear conflicts as defined under 50 
CFR 600.10, in accordance with the procedures specified in Sec. 648.55 
(d) and (e).
    (3) Council recommendation. After developing management actions and 
receiving public testimony, the Council shall make a recommendation to 
the Regional Administrator. The Council's recommendation must include 
supporting rationale and, if management measures are recommended, an 
analysis of impacts and a recommendation to the Regional Administrator 
on whether to issue the management measures as a final rule, consistent 
with the Administrative Procedure Act. If the Council recommends that 
the management measures should be issued as a final rule, the Council 
must consider at least the following factors and provide support and 
analysis for each factor considered:
    (i) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended 
management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a 
proposed rule, and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire 
harvest/fishing season.
    (ii) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for 
participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the 
development of the Council's recommended management measures.
    (iii) Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource.
    (iv) Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management 
measures adopted following their implementation as a final rule.
    (4) Regional Administrator action. If the Council's recommendation 
includes adjustments or additions to management measures, after 
reviewing the Council's recommendation and supporting information:
    (i) If the Regional Administrator concurs with the Council's 
recommended management measures and determines that the recommended 
management measures should be issued as a final rule, based on the 
factors specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the measures will 
be issued as a final rule in the Federal Register, consistent with the 
Administrative Procedure Act.
    (ii) If the Regional Administrator concurs with the Council's 
recommendation and determines that the recommended management measures 
should be published first as a proposed rule, the measures will be 
published as a proposed rule in the Federal Register. After additional 
public comment, if the Regional Administrator concurs with the Council's 
recommendation, the measures will be issued as a final rule in the 
Federal Register.
    (iii) If the Regional Administrator does not concur, the Council 
will be notified in writing of the reasons for the non-concurrence.
    (d) Flexible Area Action System. (1) The Chair of the Multispecies 
Oversight Committee, upon learning of the presence of discard problems 
associated with large concentrations of juvenile, sublegal, or spawning 
multispecies, shall determine if the situation warrants further 
investigation and possible action. In making this determination, the 
Committee Chair shall consider the amount of discard of regulated 
species, the species targeted, the number and types of vessels operating 
in the area, the location and size of the area, and the resource 
condition of the impacted species. If he/she determines it is necessary, 
the Committee Chair will request the Regional Administrator to initiate 
a fact finding investigation to verify the situation and publish 
notification in the Federal Register requesting public comments in 
accordance with the procedures therefore in Amendment 3 to the NE 
Multispecies FMP.
    (2) After examining the facts, the Regional Administrator shall, 
within the deadlines specified in Amendment 3, provide the technical 
analysis required by Amendment 3.
    (3) The NEFMC shall prepare an economic impact analysis of the 
potential

management options under consideration within the deadlines specified in 
Amendment 3.
    (4) Copies of the analysis and reports prepared by the Regional 
Administrator and the NEFMC shall be made available for public review at 
the NEFMC's office and the Committee shall hold a meeting/public 
hearing, at which time it shall review the analysis and reports and 
request public comments. Upon review of all available sources of 
information, the Committee shall determine what course of action is 
warranted by the facts and make a recommendation, consistent with the 
provisions of Amendment 3 to the Regional Administrator.
    (5) By the deadline set in Amendment 3 the Regional Administrator 
shall either accept or reject the Committee's recommendation. If the 
recommended action is consistent with the record established by the 
fact-finding report, impact analysis, and comments received at the 
public hearing, he/she shall accept the Committee's recommendation and 
implement it through notification in the Federal Register and by notice 
sent to all vessel owners holding multispecies permits. The Regional 
Administrator shall also use other appropriate media, including, but not 
limited to, mailings to the news media, fishing industry associations 
and radio broadcasts, to disseminate information on the action to be 
implemented.
    (6) Once implemented, the Regional Administrator shall monitor the 
affected area to determine if the action is still warranted. If the 
Regional Administrator determines that the circumstances under which the 
action was taken, based on the Regional Administrator's report, the 
NEFMC's report, and the public comments, are no longer in existence, he/
she shall terminate the action by notification in the Federal Register.
    (7) Actions taken under this section will ordinarily become 
effective upon the date of filing with the Office of the Federal 
Register. The Regional Administrator may determine that facts warrant a 
delayed effective date.
    (e) Nothing in this section is meant to derogate from the authority 
of the Secretary to take emergency action and interim measures under 
section 305(c) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.

Sec. 648.91  Monkfish regulated mesh areas and restrictions on gear and
methods of fishing.

    All vessels fishing for, possessing or landing monkfish must comply 
with the following minimum mesh size, gear, and methods of fishing 
requirements, unless otherwise exempted or prohibited:
    (a) Northern Fishery Management Area (NFMA)--Area definition. The 
NFMA (copies of a chart depicting the area are available from the 
Regional Administrator upon request) is that area defined by a line 
beginning at the intersection of 70[deg] W. longitude and the south-
facing shoreline of Cape Cod, MA (point A), then southward along 70[deg] 
W. longitude to 41[deg] N. latitude, then eastward to the U.S.-Canada 
maritime boundary, then in a northerly direction along the U.S.-Canada 
maritime boundary until it intersects the Maine shoreline, and then 
following the coastline in a southerly direction until it intersects 
with point A.
    (b) Southern Fishery Management Area (SFMA)--Area definition. The 
SFMA (copies of a chart depicting the area are available from the 
Regional Administrator upon request) is that area defined by a line 
beginning at point A, then in a southerly direction to the NC-SC border, 
then due east to the 200-mile limit, then in a northerly direction along 
the 200-mile limit to the U.S.-Canada maritime boundary, then in a 
northwesterly direction along the U.S.-Canada maritime boundary to 
41[deg] N. latitude, and then westward to 70[deg] W. longitude, and 
finally north to the shoreline at Cape Cod, MA (point A).
    (c) Gear restrictions--(1) Minimum mesh size--(i) Trawl nets while 
on a monkfish DAS. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this 
section, the minimum mesh size for any trawl net, including beam trawl 
nets, used by a vessel fishing under a monkfish DAS is 10-inch

[[Page 757]]

(25.4-cm) square or 12-inch (30.5-cm) diamond mesh throughout the codend 
for at least 45 continuous meshes forward of the terminus of the net. 
The minimum mesh size for the remainder of the trawl net is the 
regulated mesh size specified under Sec. 648.80(a)(3), (a)(4), 
(b)(2)(i), or (c)(2)(i) of the Northeast multispecies regulations, 
depending upon and consistent with the NE multispecies regulated mesh 
area being fished.
    (ii) Trawl nets while on a monkfish and NE multispecies DAS. Vessels 
issued a Category C, D, G, or H limited access monkfish permit and 
fishing with trawl gear under both a monkfish and NE multispecies DAS 
are subject to the minimum mesh size allowed under regulations governing 
mesh size at Sec. 648.80(a)(3), (a)(4), (b)(2)(i), or (c)(2)(i), 
depending upon, and consistent with, the NE multispecies regulated mesh 
area being fished, unless otherwise specified in this paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii). Trawl vessels participating in the Offshore Fishery Program, 
as described in Sec. 648.95, and that have been issued a Category F 
monkfish limited access permit, are subject to the minimum mesh size 
specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
    (iii) Gillnets while on a monkfish DAS. The minimum mesh size for 
any gillnets used by a vessel fishing under a monkfish DAS is 10-inch 
(25.4-cm) diamond mesh, unless otherwise provided for under Sec. 
648.92(b)(1)(iii)(B).
    (iv) Authorized gear while on a monkfish and scallop DAS. Vessels 
issued a Category C, D, G, or H limited access monkfish permit and 
fishing under a monkfish and scallop DAS may only fish with and use a 
trawl net with a mesh size no smaller than that specified in paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section.
    (2) Other gear restrictions. (i) A vessel may not fish with dredges 
or have dredges on board while fishing under a monkfish DAS.
    (ii) All other non-conforming gear must be stowed as specified in 
Sec. 648.23(b).
    (iii) The mesh size restrictions in paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
do not apply to nets or pieces of nets smaller than 3 ft (0.9 m) x 3 ft 
(0.9 m), (9 ft\2\ (0.81 m\2\)).
    (3) SFMA trawl roller gear restriction. The roller gear diameter on 
any vessel on a monkfish DAS in the SFMA may not exceed 6 inches (15.2 
cm) in diameter.

Sec. 648.92  Effort-control program for monkfish limited access vessels.

    (a) General. A vessel issued a limited access monkfish permit may 
not fish for, possess, retain, or land monkfish, except during a DAS as 
allocated under and in accordance with the applicable DAS program 
described in this section, except as otherwise provided in this part.
    (1) End of year carryover. With the exception of a vessel that held 
a Confirmation of Permit History, as described in Sec. 
648.4(a)(1)(i)(J), for the entire fishing year preceding the carryover 
year, a limited access monkfish vessel that has unused monkfish DAS on 
the last day of April of any year may carry over a maximum of 4 unused 
monkfish DAS into the next fishing year. A vessel whose DAS have been 
sanctioned through enforcement proceedings shall be credited with unused 
DAS based on its DAS allocation minus any DAS that have been sanctioned.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (b) Monkfish DAS program--permit categories and allocations--(1) 
Limited access monkfish permit holders--(i) General provision. Limited 
access monkfish permit holders shall be allocated 40 monkfish DAS each 
fishing year to be used in accordance with the restrictions of this 
paragraph (b), unless otherwise restricted by paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of 
this section or modified by Sec. 648.96(b)(3), or unless the vessel is 
enrolled in the Offshore Fishery Program in the SFMA, as specified in 
paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section. The annual allocation of monkfish 
DAS shall be reduced by the amount calculated in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of 
this section for the research DAS set-aside. Limited access NE 
multispecies and limited access sea scallop permit holders who also 
possess a limited access monkfish permit must use a NE multispecies or 
sea scallop DAS concurrently with each monkfish

[[Page 758]]

DAS utilized, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
unless otherwise specified under this subpart F.
    (ii) DAS restrictions for vessels fishing in the SFMA. Limited 
access monkfish vessels may only use 28 of their 31 monkfish DAS 
allocation in the SFMA. All limited access monkfish vessels fishing in 
the SFMA must declare that they are fishing in this area through the 
vessel call-in system or VMS prior to the start of every trip. In 
addition, if a vessel does not possess a valid letter of authorization 
from the Regional Administrator to fish in the NFMA as described in 
Sec. 648.94(f), NMFS shall presume that any monkfish DAS used were 
fished in the SFMA.
    (iii) DAS declaration provision for vessels fishing in the NFMA with 
a VMS unit. Any limited access NE multispecies vessel fishing on a 
sector trip or under a NE multispecies Category A DAS in the NFMA, and 
issued an LOA as specified in Sec. 648.94(f), may change its DAS 
declaration to a monkfish DAS through the vessel's VMS unit during the 
course of the trip after leaving port, but prior to crossing the VMS 
demarcation line upon its return to port or leaving the NFMA, if the 
vessel exceeds the incidental catch limit specified under Sec. 
648.94(c).
    (A) Vessels that change their DAS declaration from a NE multispecies 
Category A DAS to a monkfish DAS during the course of a trip remain 
subject to the NE multispecies DAS usage requirements (i.e., use a NE 
multispecies Category A DAS in conjunction with the monkfish DAS) 
described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
    (B) Gillnet vessels that change their DAS declaration in accordance 
with this paragraph (b)(1)(iii) are not subject to the gillnet minimum 
mesh size restrictions found at Sec. 648.91(c)(1)(iii), but are subject 
to the smaller NE multispecies minimum mesh requirements for gillnet 
vessels found under Sec. 648.80 based upon the NE Multispecies 
Regulated Mesh Area in which the vessel is fishing.
    (iv) Offshore Fishery Program DAS allocation. A vessel issued a 
Category F permit, as described in Sec. 648.95, shall be allocated a 
prorated number of monkfish DAS as specified in Sec. 648.95(g)(2).
    (v) Research DAS set-aside. A total of 500 DAS shall be set aside 
and made available for cooperative research programs as described in 
paragraph (c) of this section. These DAS shall be deducted from the 
total number of DAS allocated to all monkfish limited access permit 
holders, as specified under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. A per 
vessel deduction shall be determined as follows: Allocated DAS minus the 
quotient of 500 DAS divided by the total number of limited access 
permits issued in the previous fishing year. For example, if the DAS 
allocation equals 31 DAS and there were 750 limited access monkfish 
permits issued during FY 2006, the number of DAS allocated to each 
vessel during FY 2007 would be 31 DAS minus 0.7 (500 DAS divided by 750 
permits), or 30.3 DAS.
    (2) Category C, D, F, G, or H limited access monkfish permit 
holders. (i) Unless otherwise specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this 
section, each monkfish DAS used by a limited access NE multispecies or 
scallop DAS vessel holding a Category C, D, F, G, or H limited access 
monkfish permit shall also be counted as a NE multispecies or scallop 
DAS, as applicable, except when a Category C, D, F, G, or H vessel with 
a limited access NE multispecies DAS permit has an allocation of NE 
multispecies Category A DAS, specified under Sec. 648.82(d)(1), that is 
less than the number of monkfish DAS allocated for the fishing year May 
1 through April 30. Under this circumstance, the vessel may fish under 
the monkfish limited access Category A or B provisions, as applicable, 
for the number of DAS that equal the difference between the number of 
its allocated monkfish DAS and the number of its allocated NE 
multispecies Category A DAS. For such vessels, when the total allocation 
of NE multispecies Category A DAS has been used, a monkfish DAS may be 
used without concurrent use of a NE multispecies DAS, provided that the 
vessel fishes under the regulations pertaining to a Category B vessel 
and does not retain any regulated NE multispecies. For example, if a 
monkfish Category D vessel's NE multispecies Category A DAS allocation 
is 20, and the vessel

[[Page 759]]

fished 20 of its 31 monkfish DAS, 20 NE multispecies Category A DAS 
would also be used. However, after all 20 NE multispecies Category A DAS 
are used, the vessel may utilize its remaining 11 monkfish DAS to fish 
for monkfish, without a NE multispecies DAS being used. A vessel holding 
a Category C, D, F, G, or H limited access monkfish permit may not use a 
NE multispecies Category B Regular DAS under the NE Multispecies Regular 
B DAS Program, as specified under Sec. 648.85(b)(6), in order to 
satisfy the requirement of this paragraph (b)(2)(i) to use a NE 
multispecies DAS concurrently with a monkfish DAS.
    (ii) Category C, D, F, G, or H vessels that lease NE multispecies 
DAS. (A) A monkfish Category C, D, F, G, or H vessel that has 
``monkfish-only'' DAS, as specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this 
section, and that leases NE multispecies DAS from another vessel 
pursuant to Sec. 648.82(k), is required to fish its available 
``monkfish-only'' DAS in conjunction with its leased NE multispecies 
DAS, to the extent that the vessel has NE multispecies DAS available.
    (B) A monkfish Category C, D, F, G, or H vessel that leases DAS to 
another vessel(s), pursuant to Sec. 648.82(k), must forfeit a monkfish 
DAS for each NE multispecies DAS that the vessel leases, equal in number 
to the difference between the number of remaining NE multispecies DAS 
and the number of unused monkfish DAS at the time of the lease. For 
example, if a lessor vessel, which had 31 unused monkfish DAS and 35 
allocated NE multispecies DAS, leased 10 of its NE multispecies DAS to 
another vessel, the lessor would forfeit 6 of its monkfish DAS (10-(35 
NE multispecies DAS-31 monkfish DAS) = 6).
    (3) Accrual of DAS. Same as Sec. 648.53(f).
    (4) DAS credits--(i) Good Samaritan credit. A limited access vessels 
fishing under the DAS program and that spends time at sea assisting in a 
USCG search and rescue operation or assisting the USCG in towing a 
disabled vessel, and that can document the occurrence through the USCG, 
will not accrue DAS for the time documented.
    (ii) Canceled trip DAS credit. A limited access vessel operating 
under the DAS program and that end a fishing trip prior to setting and/
or hauling fishing gear for any reason may request a cancelled trip DAS 
credit for the trip based on the following conditions and requirements.
    (A) There is no fish onboard the vessel and no fishing operations on 
the vessel were initiated, including setting and/or hauling fishing 
gear; and
    (B) The owner or operator of the vessel fishing under a DAS program 
and required to use a VMS as specified under Sec. 648.10(b) makes an 
initial trip cancelation notification from sea, at the time the trip was 
canceled, or at the earliest opportunity prior to crossing the 
demarcation line as defined at Sec. 648.10(a). These reports are in the 
form of an email to NMFS Office of Law Enforcement and include at least 
the following information: Operator name; vessel name; vessel permit 
number; port where vessel will return; date trip started; estimated 
date/time of return to port; and a statement from the operator that no 
fish were onboard and no fishing activity occurred; and
    (C) The owner or operator of the vessel operating under the DAS 
program required to use the IVR call in as specified under Sec. 
648.10(h) makes an initial trip cancelation notification to NMFS by 
calling the IVR back at the time the trip was canceled, or at the 
earliest opportunity prior to returning to port. This request must 
include at least the following information: Operator name; vessel name; 
vessel permit number; port where vessel will return; date trip started; 
estimated date/time of return to port; and a statement from the operator 
that no fish were onboard and no fishing activity occurred; and
    (D) The owner or operator of the vessel requesting a canceled trip 
DAS credit, in addition to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(B) 
and (C) of this section, submits a written DAS credit request form to 
NMFS within 30 days of the vessel's return to port from the canceled 
trip. This application must include at least the following information: 
Date and time when the vessel canceled the fishing trip; date and time 
of trip departure and landing; operator name; owner/corporation name; 
permit number; hull identification number; vessel name; date and

[[Page 760]]

time notification requirements specified under paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(B) 
and (C) of this section were made; reason for canceling the trip; and 
owner/operator signature and date; and
    (E) The vessel trip report for the canceled trip as required under 
Sec. 648.7(b) is submitted along with the DAS credit request form; and
    (F) For DAS credits that are requested near the end of the fishing 
year as defined at Sec. 648.2, and approved by the Regional 
Administrator, the credited DAS apply to the fishing year in which the 
canceled trip occurred. Credited DAS that remain unused at the end of 
the fishing year or are not credited until the following fishing year 
and may be carried over into the next fishing year, not to exceed the 
maximum number of carryover DAS as specified under paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section.
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6) Declaring monkfish DAS. A vessel's owner or authorized 
representative shall notify the Regional Administrator of a vessel's 
participation in the monkfish DAS program using the notification 
requirements specified in Sec. 648.10.
    (7) Adjustments in annual monkfish DAS allocations. Adjustments in 
annual monkfish DAS allocations, if required to meet fishing mortality 
goals, may be implemented pursuant to the framework adjustment 
procedures of Sec. 648.96.
    (8) Gillnet restrictions--(i) Number and size of nets--(A) Category 
A and B vessels. A vessel issued a monkfish limited access Category A or 
B permit and fishing under a monkfish DAS may not fish with, haul, 
possess, or deploy more than 160 gillnets. Nets may not be longer than 
300 ft (91.44 m), or 50 fathoms, in length.
    (B) Category C, D, F, G, and H vessels that possess a limited access 
NE multispecies permit. A vessel issued a valid monkfish limited access 
Category C, D, F, G, or H permit that possesses a valid limited access 
NE multispecies permit and fishing under a monkfish DAS may not fish 
with, haul, possess, or deploy more than 150 gillnets. A vessel issued a 
NE multispecies limited access permit and a limited access monkfish 
permit, and fishing under a monkfish DAS, may fish any combination of 
monkfish, roundfish, and flatfish gillnets, up to 150 nets total, 
provided that the number of monkfish, roundfish, and flatfish gillnets 
is consistent with the limitations of Sec. 648.82. Nets may not be 
longer than 300 ft (91.4 m), or 50 fathoms, in length.
    (ii) Tagging requirements. Beginning May 1, 2000, all gillnets 
fished, hauled, possessed, or deployed by a vessel fishing for monkfish 
under a monkfish DAS must have one monkfish tag per net, with one tag 
secured to every other bridle of every net within a string of nets. Tags 
must be obtained as described in Sec. 648.4. A vessel operator must 
account for all net tags upon request by an authorized officer.
    (iii) Lost tags. A vessel owner or operator must report lost, 
destroyed, or missing tag numbers by letter or fax to the Regional 
Administrator within 24 hours after tags have been discovered lost, 
destroyed, or missing.
    (iv) Replacement tags. A vessel owner or operator seeking 
replacement of lost, destroyed, or missing tags must request replacement 
tags by letter or fax to the Regional Administrator. A check for the 
cost of the replacement tags must be received before the tags will be 
re-issued.
    (v) Method of counting DAS. A vessel fishing with gillnet gear under 
a monkfish DAS shall accrue 15 hours monkfish DAS for all trips less 
than or equal to 15 hours in duration. Such vessels shall accrue 
monkfish DAS based on actual time at sea for trips greater than 15 hours 
in duration. A vessel fishing with gillnet gear under only a monkfish 
DAS is not required to remove gillnet gear from the water upon returning 
to the dock and calling out of the DAS program, provided the vessel 
complies with the requirements and conditions of paragraphs (b)(8)(i)-
(v) of this section. A vessel fishing with gillnet gear under a joint 
monkfish and NE multispecies DAS, as required under Sec. 
648.92(b)(2)(i), that is declared as a trip gillnet vessel under the NE 
Multispecies FMP, must remove its gillnet gear from the water prior to 
calling out of the DAS program, as specified at Sec. 648.82(j)(2).
    (9) Category G and H limited access permit holders. (i) Vessels 
issued monkfish limited access Category G or H permits

[[Page 761]]

may only fish under a monkfish DAS in the area south of 38[deg]40[min] 
N. lat.
    (ii) Vessels issued valid limited access monkfish Category G or H 
permit that also possess a limited access NE multispecies or limited 
access scallop permit are subject to the same provisions as Category C 
or D vessels, respectively, unless otherwise stated under this subpart 
F.
    (10) DAS Adjustment for Trip Limit Overage. Any limited access 
monkfish vessel, required to or voluntarily using a VMS, fishing on a 
monkfish DAS may land up to the equivalent of one additional day's worth 
of its trip limit (i.e., amount of monkfish authorized per DAS) than 
would otherwise be authorized, provided the vessel, vessel owner, or 
vessel operator notifies the Regional Administrator of the overage via 
VMS prior to crossing the VMS demarcation line. If the vessel is not 
required to be, or is not equipped with an operable VMS, the vessel, 
vessel operator, or owner must notify the Regional Administrator via the 
call-in system at least 1-hr prior to landing. The monkfish DAS charged 
to the vessel will then be increased to equal a full 24-hr period plus 1 
minute to account for the trip limit overage. For example, if a vessel 
has the equivalent of two monkfish DAS trip limits (based on its permit 
category) on board, but has only been declared into the monkfish DAS 
program for 15 hr, the vessel, vessel owner, or vessel operator may land 
fish equal to the two DAS trip limits only if the Regional Administrator 
of the overage is notified via VMS or the call-in system as described 
above. In this case, the monkfish DAS charged to the vessel would be 
adjusted from 15 hr to 24 hr and 1 minute.
    (c) Monkfish Research--(1) DAS Set-Aside Program. (i) NMFS shall 
publish a Request for Proposals (RFP) in the Federal Register consistent 
with procedures and requirements established by the NOAA Grants Office 
to solicit proposals for the upcoming fishing year that are based on 
research priorities identified by the Councils.
    (ii) NMFS shall convene a review panel that may include members of 
the Councils' Monkfish Oversight Committee, the Council's Research 
Steering Committee, and other subject matter experts, to review 
proposals submitted in response to the RFP.
    (A) Each panel member shall recommend which research proposals 
should be authorized to utilize the research DAS set aside in accordance 
with paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, based on the selection 
criteria described in the RFP.
    (B) NMFS and the NOAA Grants Office shall consider each panel 
member's recommendation, and NOAA shall provide final approval of the 
projects, and notify applicants of the grant award through written 
notification to the project proponent. The Regional Administrator may 
exempt selected vessel(s) from regulations specified in each of the 
respective FMPs through the exempted fishing permit (EFP) process 
specified under Sec. 600.745(b)(2).
    (iii) The grant awards approved under the RFPs shall be for the 
upcoming fishing year. Proposals to fund research that would start prior 
to the fishing year are not eligible for consideration. Multi-year grant 
awards may be approved under an RFP for an upcoming fishing year, so 
long as the research DAS available under subsequent RFPs are adjusted to 
account for the approval of multi-year awards.
    (iv) Research projects shall be conducted in accordance with 
provisions approved and provided in an EFP issued by the Regional 
Administrator, as authorized under Sec. 600.745(b)(2).
    (v) If the Regional Administrator determines that the annual 
allocation of research DAS will not be used in its entirety once all of 
the grant awards have been approved, the Regional Administrator shall 
reallocate the unallocated research DAS as exempted DAS to be authorized 
as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and provide notice of 
the reallocation of DAS in the Federal Register. Any allocated research 
DAS that are not used during the fishing year for which they are granted 
may be carried over into the next fishing year. Any unallocated research 
DAS may not be carried over into the next fishing year.

[[Page 762]]

    (vi) For proposals that require other regulatory exemptions that 
extend beyond the scope of the analysis contained in the Monkfish FMP, 
subsequent amendments, or framework adjustments, applicants may be 
required to provide additional analysis of the impacts of the requested 
exemptions before issuance of an EFP will be considered.
    (2) DAS Exemption Program. (i) Vessels that seek to conduct monkfish 
research within the current fishing year, and that were not selected in 
the RFP process during the previous fishing year, may seek exemptions 
from monkfish DAS for the purpose of conducting exempted fishing 
activities, as authorized at Sec. 600.745(b), under the following 
conditions and restrictions:
    (A) The request for a monkfish DAS exemption must be submitted along 
with a complete application for an EFP to the Regional Administrator. 
The requirements for submitting a complete EFP application are provided 
in Sec. 600.745(b)(2);
    (B) Exempted DAS must be available for usage. Exempted DAS shall 
only be made available by the Regional Administrator if it is determined 
that the annual set-aside of research DAS will not be used in its 
entirety, as described in paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section. If 
exempted DAS are not available for usage, the applicant may continue to 
seek an exemption from monkfish DAS, but may be required to conduct an 
analysis of the impacts associated with the monkfish DAS exemption 
request before issuance of the EFP application will be considered; and
    (C) For EFP applications that require other regulatory exemptions 
that extend beyond the scope of the analysis contained in the Monkfish 
FMP, subsequent amendments, or framework adjustments, applicants may be 
required to provide additional analysis of the impacts of the requested 
exemptions before issuance of an EFP will be considered.
    (ii) Monkfish DAS exemption requests shall be reviewed and approved 
by the Regional Administrator in the order in which they are received.

Sec. 648.93  Monkfish minimum fish sizes.

    (a) General provisions. (1) All monkfish caught by vessels issued a 
valid Federal monkfish permit must meet the minimum fish size 
requirements established in this section.

                           Minimum Fish Sizes
                       (Total Length/Tail Length)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  Total Length                         Tail Length
------------------------------------------------------------------------
17 inches (43.2 cm)                                  11 inches (27.9 cm)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) The minimum fish size applies to the whole fish (total length) 
or to the tail of a fish (tail length) at the time of landing. Fish or 
parts of fish, with the exception of cheeks and livers, must have skin 
on while possessed on board a vessel and at the time of landing in order 
to meet minimum size requirements. ``Skin on'' means the entire portion 
of the skin normally attached to the portion of the fish or fish parts 
possessed. Monkfish tails are measured from the anterior portion of the 
fourth cephalic dorsal spine to the end of the caudal fin. Any tissue 
anterior to the fourth dorsal spine is ignored. If the fourth dorsal 
spine or the tail is not intact, the minimum size is measured between 
the most anterior vertebra and the most posterior portion of the tail.
    (b) Minimum fish size. The minimum fish size for all vessels is 17 
inches (43.2 cm) total length or 11 inches (27.9 cm) tail length.

Sec. 648.94  Monkfish possession and landing restrictions.

    (a) General. Monkfish may be possessed or landed either as tails 
only, tails with associated heads possessed separately, or in whole form 
(head on and gutted), or any combination of the three provided the 
weight of monkfish heads on board does not exceed 1.91 times the weight 
of monkfish tails on board. When any combination of tails, and whole 
fish are possessed or landed, the possession or landing limit shall be 
based on tail weight where all whole

[[Page 763]]

monkfish (head on and gutted) are converted to tail weight using the 
conversion factor of 2.91. For example, whole weight is converted to 
tail weight by dividing the whole weight by 2.91. Conversely, tail 
weight is converted to whole weight by multiplying the tail weight by 
2.91. If heads only are possessed in combination with tails, the 
possession or landing limit for monkfish heads may not exceed 1.91 times 
the tail weight of fish on board, excluding any whole monkfish. The 
allowed amount of head weight is determined by multiplying the tail 
weight by 1.91. For example a vessel possessing 100 lb (45 kg) of tail 
weight may possess an additional 191 lb (87 kg) of monkfish heads (100 x 
1.91 = 191). A vessel may not possess heads only without possessing the 
equivalent weight of tails allowed by using the conversion factor.
    (b) Vessels issued limited access monkfish permits--(1) Vessels 
fishing under the monkfish DAS program in the NFMA--(i) Category A and C 
vessels. Limited access monkfish Category A and C vessels that fish 
under a monkfish DAS exclusively in the NFMA may land up to 1,250 lb 
(567 kg) tail weight or 3,638 lb (1,650 kg) whole weight of monkfish per 
DAS (or any prorated combination of tail weight and whole weight based 
on the conversion factor for tail weight to whole weight of 2.91). For 
every 1 lb (0.45 kg) of tail only weight landed, the vessel may land up 
to 1.91 lb (0.87 kg) of monkfish heads only, as described in paragraph 
(a) of this section.
    (ii) Category B and D vessels. Limited access monkfish Category B 
and D vessels that fish under a monkfish DAS exclusively in the NFMA may 
land up to 600 lb (272 kg) tail weight or 1,746 lb (792 kg) whole weight 
of monkfish (gutted) per DAS (or any prorated combination of tail weight 
and whole weight based on the conversion factor for tail weight to whole 
weight of 2.91). For every 1 lb (0.45 kg) of tail only weight landed, 
the vessel may land up to 1.91 lb (0.87 kg) of monkfish heads only, as 
described in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) Vessels fishing under the monkfish DAS program in the SFMA--(i) 
Category A, C, and G vessels. Limited access monkfish Category A, C, and 
G vessels that fish under a monkfish DAS in the SFMA may land up to 550 
lb (249 kg) tail weight or 1,601 lb (726 kg) whole weight of monkfish 
per DAS (or any prorated combination of tail weight and whole weight 
based on the conversion factor for tail weight to whole weight of 2.91). 
For every 1 lb (0.45 kg) of tail only weight landed, the vessel may land 
up to 1.91 lb (0.87 kg) of monkfish heads only, as described in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (ii) Category B, D, and H vessels. Limited access monkfish Category 
B, D, and H vessels that fish under a monkfish DAS in the SFMA may land 
up to 450 lb (204 kg) tail weight or 1,310 lb (594 kg) whole weight of 
monkfish per DAS (or any prorated combination of tail weight and whole 
weight based on the conversion factor for tail weight to whole weight of 
2.91). For every 1 lb (0.45 kg)) of tail only weight landed, the vessel 
may land up to 1.91 lb (0.87) of monkfish heads only, as described in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (iii) Category F vessels. Vessels issued a Category F permit are 
subject to the possession and landing restrictions specified at Sec. 
648.95(g)(1).
    (iv) Administration of landing limits. A vessel owner or operator 
may not exceed the monkfish trip limits as specified in paragraphs 
(b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section per monkfish DAS fished, or any 
part of a monkfish DAS fished.
    (3) Category C, D, F, G, and H vessels fishing under the 
multispecies DAS program--(i) NFMA. Limited access monkfish Category C, 
D, F, G, or H vessels that are fishing under a NE multispecies DAS, and 
not a monkfish DAS, exclusively in the NFMA are subject to the 
incidental catch limit specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. 
Category C, D, F, G, and H vessels participating in the NE Multispecies 
Regular B DAS program, as specified under Sec. 648.85(b)(6), are also 
subject to the incidental catch limit specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) 
of this section.
    (ii) SFMA--(A) Category C, D, and F vessels. Limited access monkfish 
Category C, D, or F vessels that fish any portion of a trip under a NE 
multispecies DAS in the SFMA, and not a monkfish DAS, may land up to 300 
lb (136 kg) tail weight or 873 lb (396 kg)

[[Page 764]]

whole weight of monkfish per DAS if trawl gear is used exclusively 
during the trip, or 50 lb (23 kg) tail weight or 146 lb (66 kg) whole 
weight per DAS if gear other than trawl gear is used at any time during 
the trip. Category C, D, and F vessels participating in the NE 
Multispecies Regular B DAS program, as specified under Sec. 
648.85(b)(6), are also subject to the incidental catch limit specified 
in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. For the purpose of converting 
whole weight to tail weight, the amount of whole weight possessed or 
landed is divided by 2.91. For every 1 lb (0.45 kg) of tail only weight 
landed, the vessel may land up to 1.91 lb (0.87 kg) of monkfish heads 
only, as described in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (B) Category G and H vessels. Limited access monkfish Category G and 
H vessels that fish any portion of a trip under a NE multispecies DAS in 
the SFMA, and not under a monkfish DAS, are subject to the incidental 
catch limit specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. Category 
G and H vessels participating in the NE Multispecies Regular B DAS 
program, as specified under Sec. 648.85(b)(6), are also subject to the 
incidental catch limit specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this 
section.
    (iii) Transiting. A vessel that harvested monkfish in the NFMA may 
transit the SFMA and possess monkfish in excess of the SFMA landing 
limit provided such vessel complies with the provisions of Sec. 
648.94(e).
    (4) Category C, D, F, G, or H vessels fishing under the scallop DAS 
program. A Category C, D, F, G, or H vessel fishing under a scallop DAS 
may land up to 300 lb (136 kg) tail weight or 873 lb (396 kg) whole 
weight of monkfish per DAS (or any prorated combination of tail weight 
and whole weight based on the conversion factor for tail weight to whole 
weight of 2.91). For every 1 lb (0.45 kg) of tail only weight landed, 
the vessel may land up to 1.91 lb (0.87 kg) of monkfish heads only, as 
described in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (5) Category C, D, F, G, or H scallop vessels declared into the 
monkfish DAS program without a dredge on board, or not under the net 
exemption provision. Category C, D, G, or H vessels that have declared 
into the monkfish DAS program and that do not fish with or have a dredge 
on board, or that are not fishing with a net under the net exemption 
provision specified in Sec. 648.51(f), are subject to the same landing 
limits as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, or 
the landing limit specified in Sec. 648.95(g)(1), if issued a Category 
F permit. Such vessels are also subject to provisions applicable to 
Category A and B vessels fishing only under a monkfish DAS, consistent 
with the provisions of this part.
    (6) Vessels not fishing under a NE multispecies, scallop, or 
monkfish DAS. The possession limits for all limited access monkfish 
vessels when not fishing under a NE multispecies, scallop, or monkfish 
DAS are the same as those possession limits applicable to a vessel 
issued a monkfish incidental catch permit specified under paragraphs 
(c)(3) through (c)(8) of this section.
    (c) Vessels issued a monkfish incidental catch permit-- (1) Vessels 
fishing under a NE multispecies DAS--(i) NFMA. Vessels issued a valid 
monkfish incidental catch (Category E) permit or a valid limited access 
Category C, D, F, G, or H permit, fishing under a NE multispecies DAS 
exclusively in the NFMA may land up to 300 lb (136 kg) tail weight or 
873 lb (396 kg) whole weight of monkfish per DAS, or 25 percent (where 
the weight of all monkfish is converted to tail weight) of the total 
weight of fish on board, whichever is less. For the purpose of 
converting whole weight to tail weight, the amount of whole weight 
possessed or landed is divided by 2.91. For every 1 lb (0.45 kg) of tail 
only weight landed, the vessel may land up to 1.91 lb (0.87 kg) of 
monkfish heads only, as described in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (ii) SFMA. If any portion of the trip by a vessel issued a monkfish 
incidental catch (Category E) permit, or issued a valid limited access 
Category G or H permit, is fished under a NE multispecies DAS in the 
SFMA, the vessel may land up to 50 lb (23 kg) tail weight or 146 lb (66 
kg) whole weight of monkfish per DAS (or any prorated combination of 
tail weight and whole weight based on the conversion factor for tail 
weight to whole weight of 2.91). For every 1 lb (0.45 kg) of tail only 
weight landed, the vessel may land up to 1.91 lb (0.87 kg) of monkfish 
heads

a monkfish, NE multispecies, or scallop DAS, may possess, retain, and 
land monkfish (whole or tails) only up to 5 percent (where the weight of 
all monkfish is converted to tail weight) of the total weight of fish on 
board. For the purpose of converting whole weight to tail weight, the 
amount of whole weight possessed or landed is divided by 2.91. For every 
1 lb (0.45 kg) of tail only weight landed, the vessel may land up to 
1.91 lb (0.87 kg) of monkfish heads only, as described in paragraph (a) 
of this section.
    (ii) A vessel issued a valid monkfish incidental catch (Category E) 
permit or a limited access monkfish permit (Category A, B, C, D, F, G,

multispecies, or scallop DAS, may possess, retain, and land monkfish 
(whole or tails) only up to 5 percent (where the weight of all monkfish 
is converted to tail weight) of the total weight of fish on board, not 
to exceed 50 lb (23 kg) tail weight or 146 lb (66 kg) whole weight of 
monkfish per day or partial day, up to a maximum of 150 lb (68 kg) tail 
weight or 437 lb (198 kg) whole weight per trip. For the purpose of 
converting whole weight to tail weight, the amount of whole weight 
possessed or landed is divided by 2.91. For every 1 lb (0.45 kg) of tail 
only weight landed, the vessel may land up to 1.91 lb (0.87 kg) of 
monkfish heads only, as described in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (iv) A vessel issued a valid monkfish incidental catch (Category E) 
permit or a limited access monkfish permit (Category A, B, C, D, F, G, 
or H) fishing in the SNE or MA RMAs west of the MA Exemption Area 
boundary with mesh no smaller than specified at Sec. 648.108(a)(1) 
while not on a monkfish, NE multispecies, or scallop DAS, may possess, 
retain, and land monkfish (whole or tails) only up to 5 percent (where 
the weight of all monkfish is converted to tail weight) of the total 
weight of fish on board, up to a maximum of 450 lb (204 kg) tail weight 
or 1,310 lb (594 kg) whole weight of monkfish per trip, unless that 
vessel is fishing under a Skate Bait Letter of Authorization in the SNE

and fishing in one of the established Sea Scallop Access Areas specified 
under Sec. 648.59, may possess, retain, and land up to 300 lb (136 kg) 
tail weight or 873 lb (396 kg) whole weight of monkfish per day or 
partial day fished within the boundaries of the Sea Scallop Access Area. 
Time within the applicable access area, for purposes of determining the 
incidental catch limit, will be determined through the vessel's VMS 
unit. For the purpose of converting whole weight to tail weight, the 
amount of whole weight possessed or landed is divided by 2.91. For every 
1 lb (0.45 kg) of tail only weight landed, the vessel may land up to 
1.91 lb (0.87 kg) of monkfish heads only, as described in paragraph (a) 
of this section.
    (d) Monkfish liver landing restrictions. (1) A vessel authorized to 
land monkfish under this part may possess or land monkfish livers up to 
25 percent of the tail-weight of monkfish, or up to 10 percent of the 
whole weight of monkfish, per trip, except as provided under paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section.
    (2) If a vessel possesses or lands both monkfish tails and whole 
monkfish, the vessel may land monkfish livers up to 10 percent of the 
whole weight of monkfish per trip using the following weight ratio: 
(0.10) x [(tail weight x 2.91) + (whole fish x 1)].
    (e) Transiting. A vessel that has declared into the NFMA for the 
purpose of fishing for monkfish under the less restrictive measures of 
the NFMA, may transit the SFMA provided that the vessel does not harvest 
or possess monkfish, or any other fish, from the SFMA, and the vessel's 
gear is properly stowed and not available for immediate use in 
accordance with the regulations specified under Sec. 648.23(b).
    (f) Area declaration requirement for a vessel fishing exclusively in 
the NFMA. A vessel intending to fish for, or fishing for, possessing or 
landing monkfish under a multispecies, scallop, or monkfish DAS under 
the less restrictive management measures of the NFMA, must fish 
exclusively in the NFMA for the entire trip. In addition, a vessel 
fishing under a monkfish DAS must declare its intent to fish in the NFMA 
through the vessel's VMS unit. A vessel that is not required to and does 
not possess a VMS unit, such as a vessel that declares DAS through the 
call-in system, must declare its intent to fish in the NFMA by obtaining 
a letter of authorization from the Regional Administrator, for a period 
of not less than 7 days. A vessel that has not declared into the NFMA 
under this paragraph (f) shall be presumed to have fished in the SFMA 
and shall be subject to the more restrictive requirements of that area. 
A vessel that has declared into the NFMA may transit the SFMA, providing 
that it complies with the transiting and gear storage provision 
described in paragraph (e) of this section, and provided that it does 
not fish for or catch monkfish, or any other fish, in the SFMA.
    (g) Other landing restrictions. Vessels are subject to any other 
applicable landing restrictions of this part.

Sec. 648.95  Offshore Fishery Program in the SFMA.

    (a) General. Any vessel issued a valid monkfish limited access 
permit is eligible to apply for a Category F permit in order to fish in 
the Offshore Fishery Program in the SFMA.
    (1) A vessel issued a Category F permit is subject to the specific 
provisions and conditions of this section while fishing on a monkfish 
DAS.
    (2) When not fishing on a monkfish DAS, a Category F vessel may fish 
under the regulations applicable to the monkfish incidental catch 
(Category E) permit, specified under paragraph Sec. 648.94(c). When 
fishing on a NE multispecies DAS in the NFMA, a Category F vessel that 
also possesses a NE

[[Page 768]]

multispecies limited access permit is subject to the possession limits 
applicable to vessels issued an incidental catch permit as described in 
Sec. 648.94(c)(1)(i).
    (3) Limited access Category C or D vessels that apply for and are 
issued a Category F permit remain subject to the provisions specific to 
Category C and D vessels, unless otherwise specified under this subpart 
F.
    (b) Declaration. To fish in the Offshore Fishery Program, a vessel 
must obtain a monkfish limited access Category F permit and fish under 
this permit for the entire fishing year, subject to the conditions and 
restrictions specified under this part. The owner of a vessel, or 
authorized representative, may change the vessel's limited access 
monkfish permit category within 45 days of the effective date of the 
vessel's permit, provided the vessel has not fished under the monkfish 
DAS program during that fishing year. If such a request is not received 
within 45 days, the vessel owner may not request a change in permit 
category and the vessel's permit category will remain unchanged for the 
duration of the fishing year.
    (c) Offshore Fishery Program Area. The Offshore Fishery Program Area 
is bounded on the south by 38[deg]00[min] N. lat., and on the north, 
west, and east by the area coordinates specified in Sec. 648.23(a).
    (d) Season. October 1 through April 30 each year.
    (e) Restrictions. (1) Except for the transit provisions provided for 
in paragraph (f) of this section, a vessel issued a valid Category F 
permit may only fish for, possess, and land monkfish in or from the 
Offshore Fishery Program Area while on a monkfish DAS.
    (2) A vessel enrolled in the Offshore Fishery Program is restricted 
to fishing under its monkfish DAS during the season in paragraph (d) of 
this section.
    (3) A vessel issued a Category F permit that is fishing on a 
monkfish DAS is subject to the minimum mesh size requirements applicable 
to limited access monkfish Category A and B vessels, as specified under 
Sec. 648.91(c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(iii), as well as the other gear 
requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3).
    (4) A vessel issued a Category F permit must have installed on board 
an operational VMS unit that meets the minimum performance criteria 
specified in Sec. Sec. 648.9 and 648.10 during the entire season 
established under paragraph (d) of this section. Unless otherwise 
required to maintain an operational VMS unit under the VMS notification 
requirements specified at Sec. 648.10(b), a vessel issued a Category F 
permit may turn off its VMS unit outside of that season.
    (f) Transiting. A vessel issued a Category F permit and fishing 
under a monkfish DAS that is transiting to or from the Offshore Fishery 
Program Area, described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, shall have 
all gear stowed and not available for immediate use in accordance with 
the gear stowage provisions specified under Sec. 648.23(b).
    (g) Monkfish possession limits and DAS allocations. (1) A vessel 
issued a Category F permit may land up to 1,600 lb (726 kg) tail weight 
or 5,312 lb (2,409 kg) whole weight of monkfish per monkfish DAS (or any 
prorated combination of tail weight and whole weight based on the 
conversion factor of 3.32).
    (2) The monkfish DAS allocation for vessels issued a Category F 
permit shall be equal to the trip limit applicable to the vessel's 
monkfish limited access permit category divided by the fixed daily 
possession limit specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, and then 
multiplied by the DAS allocation for limited access monkfish vessels not 
issued Category F permits, specified under Sec. 648.92(b)(1). For 
example, if a vessel has a limited access monkfish Category C permit, 
and the applicable trip limit is 800 lb (363 kg) for this category, and 
the vessel has an annual allocation of 40 monkfish DAS, then the 
monkfish DAS allocated to that vessel when issued a Category F permit 
would be 20 monkfish DAS (800 lb divided by 1,600 lb, multiplied by 40 
monkfish DAS equals 20 DAS). Any carryover monkfish DAS will be included 
in the calculation of monkfish DAS for Category F vessels.
    (3) Vessels issued a Category F permit that are fishing under a NE 
multispecies DAS in the NFMA are subject to the incidental catch limit 
specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.

[[Page 769]]

    (h) DAS usage by NE multispecies or sea scallop limited access 
permit holders. A vessel issued a Category F permit that also has been 
issued either a NE multispecies or sea scallop limited access permit, 
and is fishing on a monkfish DAS, is subject to the DAS usage 
requirements specified in Sec. 648.92(b)(2).

Sec. 648.96  FMP review, specification, and framework adjustment process.

    (a) Annual review and adjustment process. The NEFMC and MAFMC, the 
Monkfish Plan Development Team (PDT), and the Monkfish Advisory Panel 
shall monitor the status of the monkfish fishery and resource.
    (1) Monkfish annual SAFE Report. The PDT shall prepare an annual 
Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) Report for the monkfish 
fishery. The SAFE Report shall be the primary vehicle for the 
presentation of updated biological and socio-economic information 
regarding the monkfish fishery. The SAFE report shall provide source 
data for any adjustments to the management measures that may be needed 
for the Councils to meet the goals and objectives of the FMP.
    (2) Annual review. The PDT shall meet at least annually to conduct a 
review of the monkfish fishery in relation to the goals and objectives 
specified in the Monkfish FMP, including a review of catch relative to 
the annual catch targets (ACTs) for each management area. They shall 
review available data pertaining to discards and landings; DAS and other 
measures of fishing effort; stock status and fishing mortality rate 
information, if available; enforcement of and compliance with management 
measures; and any other relevant information. Based on this review, the 
PDT shall provide guidance to the NEFMC and MAFMC regarding the need to 
adjust management measures to better achieve the FMP's goals and 
objectives. After considering the PDT's guidance, the Council may submit 
to NMFS its recommendations for changes to management measures, as 
appropriate, through the annual framework adjustment process specified 
in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the in-season framework adjustment 
process specified in paragraph (b) of this section, or through an 
amendment to the FMP.
    (3) Annual framework adjustment procedures. (i) If necessary based 
on the annual review, the Councils may develop adjustments to management 
measures to achieve the annual catch target (ACT) for the upcoming 
fishing year, and may develop other management options to better achieve 
the goals and objectives of the Monkfish FMP, which may include a 
preferred option. The Councils must demonstrate through analysis and 
documentation that any options they develop are expected to meet the 
goals and objectives of the Monkfish FMP. Additionally, if necessary 
based on the recommendation of the NEFMC's Scientific and Statistical 
Committee (SSC), the Councils may recommend measures to revise the ABCs 
and ACLs for the upcoming fishing year(s) as described in paragraph (c) 
of this section.
    (ii) The range of options developed by the Councils may include any 
of the management measures in the Monkfish FMP, including, but not 
limited to: ACTs; closed seasons or closed areas; minimum size limits; 
mesh size limits; net limits; liver-to-monkfish landings ratios; annual 
monkfish DAS allocations and monitoring; trip or possession limits; 
blocks of time out of the fishery; gear restrictions; transferability of 
permits and permit rights or administration of vessel upgrades, vessel 
replacement, or permit assignment; measures to minimize the impact of 
the monkfish fishery on protected species; gear requirements or 
restrictions that minimize bycatch or bycatch mortality; transferable 
DAS programs; changes to the Monkfish Research Set-Aside Program; and 
other frameworkable measures included in Sec. Sec. 648.55 and 648.90.
    (iii) The Councils shall review the options analyzed by the PDT and 
other relevant information, consider public comment, and submit a 
recommendation to the Regional Administrator that meets the Monkfish 
FMP's objectives, consistent with other applicable law. The Councils' 
recommendation to

[[Page 770]]

the Regional Administrator shall include supporting documents, as 
appropriate, concerning the environmental and economic impacts of the 
proposed action and the other options considered by the Councils. 
Management adjustments made to the Monkfish FMP require majority 
approval of each Council for submission to the Secretary.
    (A) The Councils may delegate authority to the Joint Monkfish 
Oversight Committee to conduct an initial review of the options analyzed 
by the PDT and any other relevant information, consider public comment, 
and make a recommendation to the Councils.
    (B) If the Councils submit a recommendation that is consistent with 
other applicable law but does not meet the Monkfish FMP's goals and 
objectives, the Regional Administrator may adopt any option developed by 
the Councils and analyzed by the PDT that has not been rejected by 
either Council, provided such option meets the Monkfish FMP's goals and 
objectives, and is consistent with other applicable law. If either the 
NEFMC or MAFMC has rejected all options, then the Regional Administrator 
may select any measure that has not been rejected by both Councils and 
that meets the Monkfish FMP's goals and objectives.
    (iv) If the Councils submit, on or before December 1, a 
recommendation to the Regional Administrator after one meeting with each 
Council, and the Regional Administrator concurs with the recommendation, 
the recommendation shall be published in the Federal Register as a 
proposed rule, or as otherwise authorized under the Administrative 
Procedure Act. The Councils may instead submit their recommendation on 
or before February 1, if they choose to follow the framework process 
outlined in paragraph (b) of this section and request that the Regional 
Administrator publish the recommendation as a final rule. If the 
Regional Administrator concurs with the Councils' recommendation the 
recommended management measures may be published as a proposed rule or a 
final rule, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. If the 
effective date of a final rule to implement the recommended measures 
falls after the start of the fishing year, fishing may continue under 
the existing regulations, but any DAS used by a vessel on or after the 
start of a fishing year shall be counted against any DAS allocation the 
vessel ultimately receives for that fishing year.
    (v) Following publication of a proposed rule and after receiving 
public comment, if the Regional Administrator concurs in the Councils' 
recommendation, a final rule, if possible, shall be published in the 
Federal Register prior to the start of the next fishing year. If the 
Councils fail to submit a recommendation to the Regional Administrator 
by February 1 that meets the goals and objectives of the Monkfish FMP, 
the Regional Administrator may implement through rulemaking in 
accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act one of the options 
reviewed and not rejected by either Council, provided the option meets 
the goals and objectives of the Monkfish FMP, and is consistent with 
other applicable law.
    (b) Within-season management action. At any time, the Councils or 
the Joint Monkfish Oversight Committee (subject to the approval of the 
Councils' Chairmen) may initiate action to add or adjust management 
measures if it is determined that action is necessary to meet or be 
consistent with the goals and objectives of the Monkfish FMP.
    (1) In-season Framework adjustment procedures. (i) Framework 
adjustments shall require at least one initial meeting of the Joint 
Monkfish Oversight Committee or one of the Councils (the agenda must 
include notification of the framework adjustment proposal) and at least 
two final Council meetings, one at each Council. The Councils shall 
provide the public with advance notice of the availability of both the 
proposals and the analysis, and opportunity to comment on them prior to 
the first of the two final Council meetings. Framework adjustments and 
amendments to the Monkfish FMP require majority approval of each Council 
for submission to the Secretary.
    (ii) Recommended adjustments to management measures must come from 
the categories specified under

[[Page 771]]

paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, including specification of ABC and 
ACLs, if necessary.
    (2) Councils' recommendation. After developing management actions 
and receiving public testimony, the Councils shall make a recommendation 
to the Regional Administrator. The Councils' recommendation must include 
supporting rationale and, if management measures are recommended, an 
analysis of impacts and a recommendation to the Regional Administrator 
on whether to issue the management measures as a final rule. If the 
Councils recommend that the management measures should be issued as a 
final rule, the Councils must consider at least the following four 
factors and provide support and analysis for each factor considered:
    (i) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended 
management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a 
proposed rule, and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire 
harvest/fishing season;
    (ii) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for 
participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the 
development of the Councils' recommended management measures;
    (iii) Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource or 
to impose management measures to resolve gear conflicts; and
    (iv) Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management 
measures adopted following their implementation as a final rule.
    (3) Adjustments for gear conflicts. The Councils may develop a 
recommendation on measures to address gear conflict as defined under 
Sec. 600.10 of this chapter, in accordance with the procedure specified 
in Sec. 648.55(g) and (h).
    (4) Action by NMFS. (i) If the Regional Administrator approves the 
Councils' recommended management measures and determines that the 
recommended management measures should be issued as a final rule based 
on the factors specified in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, the 
Secretary may, for good cause found under the standard of the 
Administrative Procedure Act, waive the requirement for a proposed rule 
and opportunity for public comment in the Federal Register. The 
Secretary, in so doing, shall publish only the final rule. Submission of 
the recommendations does not preclude the Secretary from deciding to 
provide additional opportunity for prior notice and comment in the 
Federal Register.
    (ii) If the Regional Administrator concurs with the Councils' 
recommendation and determines that the recommended management measures 
should be published first as a proposed rule, then the measures shall be 
published as a proposed rule in the Federal Register. After additional 
public comment, if NMFS concurs with the Councils' recommendation, then 
the measures shall be issued as a final rule in the Federal Register.
    (iii) If the Regional Administrator does not concur, then the 
Councils shall be notified in writing of the reasons for the non-
concurrence.
    (c) Process for setting ABCs and ACLs. (1) The Councils or the PDT 
may develop options for setting ABC, ACL, and OFL for each monkfish 
stock, as necessary, as part of the annual review and adjustment process 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section, or as otherwise deemed 
necessary following the in-season adjustment process specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section. These options shall be submitted to the 
SSC for consideration. The Councils or the PDT may recommend to the SSC 
that ABC, ACL, and OFL are specified for each monkfish stock for 
multiple years as determined necessary to best align management with the 
stock assessment process for this fishery.
    (i) ABC recommendation. The Councils or the PDT shall calculate ABC 
values for each monkfish stock based on the ABC control rule established 
in the FMP. These calculations shall be reviewed by the SSC, guided by 
terms of reference developed by the Councils. The SSC shall either 
concur with these ABC calculations, or provide alternative 
recommendations for each stock and describe the elements of scientific 
uncertainty used to develop its recommendations. If the SSC concurs with 
the ABC calculations, the revised ABC values are automatically updated 
and no action by the Councils is necessary.

[[Page 772]]

If the SSC provides an alternative recommendation for calculating the 
ABC than that currently specified in the FMP, the Councils would need to 
need to take action through the annual or in-season framework adjustment 
process specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, 
respectively, to implement the SSC's recommendation. The SSC may also 
consider other related issues specified in the terms of reference 
developed by the Councils, including, but not limited to, OFLs, ACLs, 
and management uncertainty.
    (ii) ACL recommendations. The Councils shall establish ACLs for each 
management area that are equivalent to the ABCs calculated using the 
control rule established in the FMP, and reviewed and recommended by the 
SSC.
    (iii) Timing. If determined necessary under the annual review 
process, the Councils shall develop and approve any recommendations for 
ABCs and ACLs prior to December 31, to the extent possible. Once the 
Councils have approved the recommended ABCs and ACLs, only if they 
require adjustments to the ACTs described in paragraph (d) shall they be 
submitted to NMFS as part of an annual framework adjustment or in-season 
framework adjustment, as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section, along with any necessary analysis required by applicable law. 
After receipt of the Councils' recommendation for ACLs, NMFS shall 
review the Councils' decision and, if consistent with applicable law, 
implement the ACLs in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.
    (d) Accountability Measures (AMs). (1) Specification of ACTs. 
Through the annual review process described in paragraph (a) of this 
section, or as otherwise determined necessary, the Councils shall 
specify ACTs for each management area that are set sufficiently below 
the ACL to account for management uncertainty and prevent the ACL from 
being exceeded. The ACTs established for each management area shall be 
the basis for setting management measures (DAS and trip limits), after 
accounting for incidental catch in non-directed fisheries and discards 
in all fisheries.
    (2) ACL overages and adjustments-- (i) Council action. The Councils 
shall revise the ACT for a monkfish stock if it is determined that the 
ACL was exceeded in any given year, based upon, but not limited to, 
available landings and discard information. The amount of an ACL overage 
shall be deducted from the ACT for the corresponding monkfish stock on a 
pound-for-pound basis. The revised ACT and corresponding management 
measures (DAS and trip limits) shall be implemented through either the 
annual or in-season framework adjustment process, specified in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, in the second fishing year 
following the fishing year in which the ACL overage occurred.
    (ii) NMFS action. If the Councils fail to take appropriate action to 
correct an ACL overage consistent with paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this 
section, the Regional Administrator shall implement the required 
adjustment, as described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, 
including the specification of DAS and trip limits using a formulaic 
approach developed by the PDT, in accordance with the Administrative 
Procedure Act and other applicable law. Notification of the proposed ACL 
revision and DAS and/or trip limit adjustments shall be published in the 
Federal Register no later than January 1, if possible, for 
implementation on May 1 of the second fishing year following the fishing 
year in which the ACL overage occurred.
    (e) Emergency action. Nothing in this section is meant to derogate 
from the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under 
section 305(c) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.

     Subpart G_Management Measures for the Summer Flounder Fisheries


<R05>
Sec. 648.100  Summer flounder Annual Catch Limit (ACL).

    (a) The Summer Flounder Monitoring Committee shall recommend to the 
MAFMC separate ACLs for the commercial and recreational summer flounder 
fisheries, the sum total of which shall be equal to the ABC recommended 
by the SSC.
    (1) Sector allocations. The commercial and recreational fishing 
sector ACLs will be established consistent with the allocation 
guidelines contained in the Summer Flounder, Scup, and Black Sea Bass 
Fishery Management Plan (FMP).
    (2) Periodicity. The summer flounder commercial and recreational 
sector ACLs may be established on an annual basis for up to 3 years at a 
time, dependent on whether the SSC provides single or multiple year ABC 
recommendations.
    (b) Performance review. The Summer Flounder Monitoring Committee 
shall conduct a detailed review of fishery performance relative to the 
sector ACLs at least every 5 years.
    (1) If one or both of the sector-specific ACLs is exceeded with a 
frequency greater than 25 percent (i.e., more than once in 4 years or 
any 2 consecutive years), the Summer Flounder Monitoring Committee will 
review fishery performance information and make recommendations to the 
MAFMC for changes in measures intended to ensure ACLs are not exceeded 
as frequently.
    (2) The MAFMC may specify more frequent or more specific ACL 
performance review criteria as part of a stock rebuilding plan following 
a determination that the summer flounder stock has become overfished.
    (3) Performance reviews shall not substitute for annual reviews that 
occur to ascertain if prior year ACLs have been exceeded but may be 
conducted in conjunction with such reviews.

<R05>
Sec. 648.101  Summer flounder Annual Catch Target (ACT).

    (a) The Summer Flounder Monitoring Committee shall identify and 
review the relevant sources of management uncertainty to recommend ACTs 
for the commercial and recreational fishing sectors as part of the 
summer flounder specification process. The Summer Flounder Monitoring 
Committee recommendations shall identify the specific sources of 
management uncertainty that were considered, technical approaches to 
mitigating these sources of uncertainty, and any additional relevant 
information considered in the ACT recommendation process.
    (1) Sectors. Commercial and recreational specific ACTs shall be less 
than or equal to the sector-specific ACLs. The Summer Flounder 
Monitoring Committee shall recommend any reduction in catch necessary to 
address sector-specific management uncertainty, consistent with 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) Periodicity. ACTs may be established on an annual basis for up 
to 3 years at a time, dependent on whether the SSC provides single or 
multiple year ABC recommendations.

[[Page 774]]

    (b) Performance review. The Summer Flounder Monitoring Committee 
shall conduct a detailed review of fishery performance relative to ACTs 
in conjunction with any ACL performance review, as outlined in Sec. 
648.100(b)(1) through (3).

Sec. 648.102  Summer flounder specifications.

    (a) Commercial quota, recreational landing limits, research set-
asides, and other specification measures. The Summer Flounder Monitoring 
Committee shall recommend to the MAFMC, through the specifications 
process, for use in conjunction with each ACL and ACT, a sector-specific 
research set-aside, estimates of sector-related discards, recreational 
harvest limit, and commercial quota, along with other measures, as 
needed, that are projected to ensure the sector-specific ACL for an 
upcoming fishing year or years will not be exceeded. The measures to be 
considered by the Summer Flounder Monitoring Committee are:
    (1) Research quota set from a range of 0 to 3 percent of the 
allowable landings level for both the commercial and recreational 
sectors.
    (2) Commercial minimum fish size.
    (3) Minimum mesh size.
    (4) Restrictions on gear other than otter trawls.
    (5) Adjustments to the exempted area boundary and season specified 
in Sec. 648.108(b)(1) by 30-minute intervals of latitude and longitude 
and 2-week intervals, respectively, based on data reviewed by Summer 
Flounder Monitoring Committee during the specification process, to 
prevent discarding of sublegal sized summer flounder in excess of 10 
percent, by weight.
    (6) Recreational possession limit set from a range of 0 to 15 summer 
flounder to achieve the recreational harvest limit, set after reductions 
for research quota.
    (7) Recreational minimum fish size.
    (8) Recreational season.
    (9) Recreational state conservation equivalent and precautionary 
default measures utilizing possession limits, minimum fish sizes, and/or 
seasons set after reductions for research quota.
    (10) [Reserved]
    (11) Modification of existing AM measures and ACT control rules 
utilized by the Summer Flounder Monitoring Committee.
    (b) Specification fishing measures. The Demersal Species Committee 
shall review the recommendations of the Summer Flounder Monitoring 
Committee. Based on these recommendations and any public comment, the 
Demersal Species Committee shall recommend to the MAFMC measures 
necessary that are projected to ensure the sector-specific ACLs for an 
upcoming fishing year or years will not be exceeded. The MAFMC shall 
review these recommendations and, based on the recommendations and any 
public comment, recommend to the Regional Administrator measures that 
are projected to ensure the sector-specific ACL for an upcoming fishing 
year or years will not be exceeded. The MAFMC's recommendations must 
include supporting documentation, as appropriate, concerning the 
environmental and economic impacts of the recommendations. The Regional 
Administrator shall review these recommendations and any recommendations 
of the ASMFC.
    (c) After such review, the Regional Administrator will publish a 
proposed rule in the Federal Register to implement a coastwide 
commercial quota, a recreational harvest limit, research set-aside, 
adjustments to ACL or ACT resulting from AMs, and additional management 
measures for the commercial fishery. After considering public comment, 
NMFS will publish a final rule in the Federal Register.
    (1) Distribution of annual commercial quota. (i) The annual 
commercial quota will be distributed to the states, based upon the 
following percentages; state followed by percent share in parenthesis: 
Maine (0.04756); New Hampshire (0.00046); Massachusetts (6.82046); Rhode 
Island (15.68298); Connecticut (2.25708); New York (7.64699); New Jersey 
(16.72499); Delaware (0.01779); Maryland (2.03910); Virginia (21.31676); 
North Carolina (27.44584).
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (2) Quota transfers and combinations. Any state implementing a state 
commercial quota for summer flounder

[[Page 775]]

may request approval from the Regional Administrator to transfer part or 
its entire annual quota to one or more states. Two or more states 
implementing a state commercial quota for summer flounder may request 
approval from the Regional Administrator to combine their quotas, or 
part of their quotas, into an overall regional quota. Requests for 
transfer or combination of commercial quotas for summer flounder must be 
made by individual or joint letter(s) signed by the principal state 
official with marine fishery management responsibility and expertise, or 
his/her previously named designee, for each state involved. The 
letter(s) must certify that all pertinent state requirements have been 
met and identify the states involved and the amount of quota to be 
transferred or combined.
    (i) Within 10 working days following the receipt of the letter(s) 
from the states involved, the Regional Administrator shall notify the 
appropriate state officials of the disposition of the request. In 
evaluating requests to transfer a quota or combine quotas, the Regional 
Administrator shall consider whether:
    (A) The transfer or combination would preclude the overall annual 
quota from being fully harvested;
    (B) The transfer addresses an unforeseen variation or contingency in 
the fishery; and
    (C) The transfer is consistent with the objectives of the FMP and 
the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (ii) The transfer of quota or the combination of quotas will be 
valid only for the calendar year for which the request was made;
    (iii) A state may not submit a request to transfer quota or combine 
quotas if a request to which it is party is pending before the Regional 
Administrator. A state may submit a new request when it receives notice 
that the Regional Administrator has disapproved the previous request or 
when notice of the approval of the transfer or combination has been 
filed at the Office of the Federal Register.
    (iv) If there is a quota overage among states involved in the 
combination of quotas at the end of the fishing year, the overage will 
be deducted from the following year's quota for each of the states 
involved in the combined quota. The deduction will be proportional, 
based on each state's relative share of the combined quota for the 
previous year. A transfer of quota or combination of quotas does not 
alter any state's percentage share of the overall quota specified in 
paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section.
    (d) Recreational specification measures. The Demersal Species 
Committee shall review the recommendations of the Summer Flounder 
Monitoring Committee. Based on these recommendations and any public 
comment, the Demersal Species Committee shall recommend to the MAFMC and 
ASMFC measures that are projected to ensure the sector-specific ACL for 
an upcoming fishing year or years will not be exceeded. The MAFMC shall 
review these recommendations and, based on the recommendations and any 
public comment, recommend to the Regional Administrator measures that 
are projected to ensure the sector-specific ACL for an upcoming fishing 
year or years will not be exceeded. The MAFMC's recommendations must 
include supporting documentation, as appropriate, concerning the 
environmental and economic impacts of the recommendations. The MAFMC and 
the ASMFC will recommend that the Regional Administrator implement 
either:
    (1) Coastwide measures. Annual coastwide management measures that 
constrain the recreational summer flounder fishery to the recreational 
harvest limit, or
    (2) Conservation equivalent measures. Individual states, or regions 
formed voluntarily by adjacent states (i.e., multi-state conservation 
equivalency regions), may implement different combinations of minimum 
fish sizes, possession limits, and closed seasons that achieve 
equivalent conservation as the coastwide measures established under 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Each state or multi-state conservation 
equivalency region may implement measures by mode or area only if the 
proportional standard error of recreational landing estimates by mode or 
area for that state is less than 30 percent.

[[Page 776]]

    (i) After review of the recommendations, the Regional Administrator 
will publish a proposed rule in the Federal Register as soon as possible 
to implement the overall percent adjustment in recreational landings 
required for the fishing year, and the ASMFC's recommendation concerning 
conservation equivalency, the precautionary default measures, and 
coastwide measures.
    (ii) The ASMFC will review conservation equivalency proposals and 
determine whether or not they achieve the necessary adjustment to 
recreational landings. The ASMFC will provide the Regional Administrator 
with the individual state and/or multi-state region conservation 
measures for the approved state and/or multi-state region proposals and, 
in the case of disapproved state and/or multi-state region proposals, 
the precautionary default measures.
    (iii) The ASMFC may allow states assigned the precautionary default 
measures to resubmit revised management measures. The ASMFC will detail 
the procedures by which the state can develop alternate measures. The 
ASMFC will notify the Regional Administrator of any resubmitted state 
proposals approved subsequent to publication of the final rule and the 
Regional Administrator will publish a notice in the Federal Register to 
notify the public.
    (iv) After considering public comment, the Regional Administrator 
will publish a final rule in the Federal Register to implement either 
the state specific conservation equivalency measures or coastwide 
measures to ensure that the applicable specified target is not exceeded.
    (e) Research quota. See Sec. 648.22(g).

Sec. 648.103  Summer flounder accountability measures.

    (a) Commercial sector EEZ closure. The Regional Administrator shall 
close the EEZ to fishing for summer flounder by commercial vessels for 
the remainder of the calendar year by publishing notification in the 
Federal Register if he/she determines that the inaction of one or more 
states will cause the commercial sector ACL to be exceeded, or if the 
commercial fisheries in all states have been closed. The Regional 
Administrator may reopen the EEZ if earlier inaction by a state has been 
remedied by that state, or if commercial fisheries in one or more states 
have been reopened without causing the sector ACL to be exceeded.
    (b) State commercial landing quotas. The Regional Administrator will 
monitor state commercial quotas based on dealer reports and other 
available information and shall determine the date when a state 
commercial quota will be harvested. The Regional Administrator shall 
publish notification in the Federal Register advising a state that, 
effective upon a specific date, its commercial quota has been harvested 
and notifying vessel and dealer permit holders that no commercial quota 
is available for landing summer flounder in that state.
    (1) Commercial ACL overage evaluation. The commercial sector ACL 
will be evaluated based on a single-year examination of total catch 
(landings and dead discards). Both landings and dead discards will be 
evaluated in determining if the commercial sector ACL has been exceeded.
    (2) Commercial landings overage repayment. All summer flounder 
landed for sale in a state shall be applied against that state's annual 
commercial quota, regardless of where the summer flounder were 
harvested. Any landings in excess of the commercial quota in any state, 
inclusive of any state-to-state transfers, will be deducted from that 
state's annual quota for the following year in the final rule that 
establishes the annual state-by-state quotas, irrespective of whether 
the commercial sector ACL is exceeded. The overage deduction will be 
based on landings for the current year through October 31 and on 
landings for the previous calendar year that were not included when the 
overage deduction was made in the final rule that established the annual 
quota for the current year. If the Regional Administrator determines 
during the fishing year that any part of an overage deduction was based 
on erroneous landings data that were in excess of actual landings for 
the period concerned, he/she will restore the overage that was deducted 
in error to the

[[Page 777]]

appropriate quota allocation. The Regional Administrator will publish 
notification in the Federal Register announcing such restoration.
    (c) Recreational landings sector closure. The Regional Administrator 
will monitor recreational landings based on the best available data and 
shall determine if the recreational harvest limit has been met or 
exceeded. The determination will be based on observed landings and will 
not utilize projections of future landings. At such time that the 
available data indicate that the recreational harvest limit has been met 
or exceeded, the Regional Administrator shall publish notification in 
the Federal Register advising that, effective on a specific date, the 
summer flounder recreational fishery in the EEZ shall be closed for 
remainder of the calendar year.
    (1) Recreational ACL overage evaluation. The recreational sector ACL 
will be evaluated based on a 3-year moving average comparison of total 
catch (landings and dead discards). Both landings and dead discards will 
be evaluated in determining if the 3-year average recreational sector 
ACL has been exceeded. The 3-year moving average will be phased in over 
the first 3 years, beginning with 2012: Total recreational catch from 
2012 will be compared to the 2012 recreational sector ACL; the average 
total catch from both 2012 and 2013 will be compared to the average of 
the 2012 and 2013 recreational sector ACLs; the average total catch from 
2012, 2013, and 2014 will be compared to the average of the 2012, 2013, 
and 2014 recreational sector ACLs; and for all subsequent years, the 
preceding 3-year average recreational total catch will be compared to 
the preceding 3-year average recreational sector ACL.
    (2) Recreational landing overage repayment. If available data 
indicate that the recreational sector ACL has been exceeded and the 
landings have exceeded the RHL, the exact poundage of the landings 
overage will be deducted, as soon as possible, from a subsequent single 
fishing year recreational sector ACT.
    (d) Non-landing accountability measures, by sector. In the event 
that a sector ACL has been exceeded and the overage has not been 
accommodated through landing-based AMs, then the exact amount by which 
the sector ACL was exceeded, in pounds, will be deducted, as soon as 
possible, from the applicable subsequent single fishing year sector ACL.
    (e) State/Federal disconnect AM. If the total catch, allowable 
landing, commercial quotas and/or RHL measures adopted by the ASMFC 
Summer Flounder Management Board and the MAFMC differ for a given 
fishing year, administrative action will be taken as soon as possible to 
revisit the respective recommendations of the two groups. The intent of 
this action shall be to achieve alignment through consistent state and 
Federal measures so no differential effects occur on Federal permit 
holders.

Sec. 648.104  Summer flounder minimum fish sizes.

    (a) Moratorium (commercial) permitted vessels. The minimum size for 
summer flounder is 14 inches (35.6 cm) TL for all vessels issued a 
moratorium permit under Sec. 648.4(a)(3), except on board party and 
charter boats carrying passengers for hire or carrying more than three 
crew members, if a charter boat, or more than five crew members, if a 
party boat.
    (b) Party/charter permitted vessels and recreational fishery 
participants. Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Sec. 648.107, the 
minimum size for summer flounder is 18.5 inches (46.99 cm) TL for all 
vessels that do not qualify for a moratorium permit under Sec. 
648.4(a)(3), and charter boats holding a moratorium permit if fishing 
with more than three crew members, or party boats holding a moratorium 
permit if fishing with passengers for hire or carrying more than five 
crew members.
    (c) The minimum sizes in this section apply to whole fish or to any 
part of a fish found in possession, e.g., fillets, except that party and 
charter vessels possessing valid state permits authorizing filleting at 
sea may possess fillets smaller than the size specified if all state 
requirements are met.

Sec. 648.105  Summer flounder recreational fishing season.

    Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Sec. 648.107, vessels that 
are not eligible for a moratorium permit under Sec. 648.4(a)(3), and 
fishermen subject to the possession limit, may fish for summer flounder 
from May 1 through September 30. This time period may be adjusted 
pursuant to the procedures in Sec. 648.102.

[76 FR 60629, Sept. 29, 2011]


<R05>
Sec. 648.106  Summer flounder possession restrictions.

    (a) Party/charter and recreational possession limits. Unless 
otherwise specified pursuant to Sec. 648.107, no person shall possess 
more than two summer flounder in, or harvested from, the EEZ, unless 
that person is the owner or operator of a fishing vessel issued a summer 
flounder moratorium permit, or is issued a summer flounder dealer 
permit. Persons aboard a commercial vessel that is not eligible for a 
summer flounder moratorium permit are subject to this possession limit. 
The owner, operator, and crew of a charter or party boat issued a summer 
flounder moratorium permit are subject to the possession limit when 
carrying passengers for hire or when carrying more than five crew 
members for a party boat, or more than three crew members for a charter 
boat. This possession limit may be adjusted pursuant to the procedures 
in Sec. 648.102.
    (b) If whole summer flounder are processed into fillets, the number 
of fillets will be converted to whole summer flounder at the place of 
landing by dividing the fillet number by two. If summer flounder are 
filleted into single (butterfly) fillets, each fillet is deemed to be 
from one whole summer flounder.
    (c) Summer flounder harvested by vessels subject to the possession 
limit with more than one person on board may be pooled in one or more 
containers. Compliance with the daily possession limit will be 
determined by dividing the number of summer flounder on board by the 
number of persons on board, other than the captain and the crew. If 
there is a violation of the possession limit on board a vessel carrying 
more than one person, the violation shall be deemed to have been 
committed by the owner and operator of the vessel.
    (d) Commercially permitted vessel possession limits. Owners and 
operators of otter trawl vessels issued a permit under Sec. 648.4(a)(3) 
that fish with or possess nets or pieces of net on board that do not 
meet the minimum mesh requirements and that are not stowed in accordance 
with Sec. 648.108(e), may not retain 100 lb (45.4 kg) or more of summer 
flounder from May 1 through October 31, or 200 lb (90.7 kg) or more of 
summer flounder from November 1 through April 30, unless the vessel 
possesses a valid summer flounder small-mesh exemption LOA and is 
fishing in the exemption area as specified in Sec. 648.108(b). Summer 
flounder on board these vessels must be stored so as to be readily 
available for inspection in standard 100-lb (45.3-kg) totes or fish 
boxes having a liquid capacity of 18.2 gal (70 L), or a volume of not 
more than 4,320 in\3\ (2.5 ft\3\ or 70.79 cm\3\).

Sec. 648.107  Conservation equivalent measures for the summer flounder 
party/charter and recreational fishery.

    (a) The Regional Administrator has determined that the recreational 
fishing measures proposed to be implemented by Massachusetts through 
North Carolina for 2012 are the conservation equivalent of the minimum 
fish size, season, and possession limit prescribed in Sec. Sec. 
648.104(b), 648.105, and 648.106(a), respectively. This determination is 
based on a recommendation from the Summer Flounder Board of the Atlantic 
States Marine Fisheries Commission.
    (1) Federally permitted party and charter vessels subject to the 
recreational fishing measures of this part, and other recreational 
fishing vessels harvesting summer flounder in or from the EEZ and 
subject to the recreational fishing measures of this part, landing 
summer flounder in a state whose fishery management measures are 
determined by the Regional Administrator to be conservation equivalent 
shall not be subject to the more restrictive Federal measures, pursuant 
to

[[Page 779]]

the provisions of Sec. 648.4(b). Those vessels shall be subject to the 
recreational fishing measures implemented by the state in which they 
land.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (b) Federally permitted vessels subject to the recreational fishing 
measures of this part, and other recreational fishing vessels subject to 
the recreational fishing measures of this part and registered in states 
whose fishery management measures are not determined by the Regional 
Administrator to be the conservation equivalent of the minimum size, 
season, and possession limit prescribed in Sec. Sec. 648.104(b), 
648.105, and 648.106(a), respectively, due to the lack of, or the 
reversal of, a conservation equivalent recommendation from the Summer 
Flounder Board of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, shall 
be subject to the following precautionary default measures: Season--May 
1 through September 30; minimum size--20.0 inches (50.80 cm); and 
possession limit--two fish.

[76 FR 60629, Sept. 29, 2011, as amended at 77 FR 30431, May 23, 2012]


<R05>
Sec. 648.108  Summer flounder gear restrictions.

    (a) General. (1) Otter trawlers whose owners are issued a summer 
flounder permit and that land or possess 100 lb (45.4 kg) or more of 
summer flounder from May 1 through October 31, or 200 lb (90.7 kg) or 
more of summer flounder from November 1 through April 30, per trip, must 
fish with nets that have a minimum mesh size of 5.5-inch (14.0-cm) 
diamond or 6.0-inch (15.2-cm) square mesh applied throughout the body, 
extension(s), and codend portion of the net.
    (2) Mesh size is measured by using a wedge-shaped gauge having a 
taper of 2 cm (0.79 inches) in 8 cm (3.15 inches), and a thickness of 
2.3 mm (0.09 inches), inserted into the meshes under a pressure or pull 
of 5 kg (11.02 lb) for mesh size less than 120 mm (4.72 inches) and 
under a pressure or pull of 8 kg (17.64 lb) for mesh size at, or greater 
than, 120 mm (4.72 inches). The mesh size is the average of the 
measurements of any series of 20 consecutive meshes for nets having 75 
or more meshes, and 10 consecutive meshes for nets having fewer than 75 
meshes. The mesh in the regulated portion of the net is measured at 
least five meshes away from the lacings, running parallel to the long 
axis of the net.
    (b) Exemptions. Unless otherwise restricted by this part, the 
minimum mesh-size requirements specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section do not apply to:
    (1) Vessels issued a summer flounder moratorium permit, a Summer 
Flounder Small-Mesh Exemption Area letter of authorization (LOA), 
required under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, and fishing from 
November 1 through April 30 in the exemption area, which is east of the 
line that follows 72[deg]30.0[min] W. long. until it intersects the 
outer boundary of the EEZ (copies of a map depicting the area are 
available upon request from the Regional Administrator). Vessels fishing 
under the LOA shall not fish west of the line. Vessels issued a permit 
under Sec. 648.4(a)(3)(iii) may transit the area west or south of the 
line, if the vessel's fishing gear is stowed in a manner prescribed 
under Sec. 648.108(e), so that it is not ``available for immediate 
use'' outside the exempted area. The Regional Administrator may 
terminate this exemption if he/she determines, after a review of sea 
sampling data, that vessels fishing under the exemption are discarding 
more than 10 percent, by weight, of their entire catch of summer 
flounder per trip. If the Regional Administrator makes such a 
determination, he/she shall publish notification in the Federal Register 
terminating the exemption for the remainder of the exemption season.
    (i) Requirements. (A) A vessel fishing in the Summer Flounder Small-
Mesh Exemption Area under this exemption must have on board a valid LOA 
issued by the Regional Administrator.
    (B) The vessel must be in enrolled in the exemption program for a 
minimum of 7 days.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (2) Vessels fishing with a two-seam otter trawl fly net with the 
following configuration, provided that no other nets or netting with 
mesh smaller than 5.5 inches (14.0 cm) are on board:
    (i) The net has large mesh in the wings that measures 8 inches (20.3 
cm) to 64 inches (162.6 cm).

[[Page 780]]

    (ii) The first body section (belly) of the net has 35 or more meshes 
that are at least 8 inches (20.3 cm).
    (iii) The mesh decreases in size throughout the body of the net to 2 
inches (5 cm) or smaller towards the terminus of the net.
    (3) The Regional Administrator may terminate this exemption if he/
she determines, after a review of sea sampling data, that vessels 
fishing under the exemption, on average, are discarding more than 1 
percent of their entire catch of summer flounder per trip. If the 
Regional Administrator makes such a determination, he/she shall publish 
notification in the Federal Register terminating the exemption for the 
remainder of the calendar year.
    (c) Net modifications. No vessel subject to this part shall use any 
device, gear, or material, including, but not limited to, nets, net 
strengtheners, ropes, lines, or chafing gear, on the top of the 
regulated portion of a trawl net; except that, one splitting strap and 
one bull rope (if present) consisting of line or rope no more than 3 
inches (7.2 cm) in diameter may be used if such splitting strap and/or 
bull rope does not constrict, in any manner, the top of the regulated 
portion of the net, and one rope no greater than 0.75 inches (1.9 cm) in 
diameter extending the length of the net from the belly to the terminus 
of the codend along the top, bottom, and each side of the net. ``Top of 
the regulated portion of the net'' means the 50 percent of the entire 
regulated portion of the net that (in a hypothetical situation) will not 
be in contact with the ocean bottom during a tow if the regulated 
portion of the net were laid flat on the ocean floor. For the purpose of 
this paragraph (c), head ropes shall not be considered part of the top 
of the regulated portion of a trawl net. A vessel shall not use any 
means or mesh configuration on the top of the regulated portion of the 
net, as defined paragraph (c) of this section, if it obstructs the 
meshes of the net or otherwise causes the size of the meshes of the net 
while in use to diminish to a size smaller than the minimum specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) Mesh obstruction or constriction. (1) A fishing vessel may not 
use any mesh configuration, mesh construction, or other means on or in 
the top of the net, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, that 
obstructs the meshes of the net in any manner.
    (2) No person on any vessel may possess or fish with a net capable 
of catching summer flounder in which the bars entering or exiting the 
knots twist around each other.
    (e) Stowage of nets. Otter trawl vessels retaining 100 lb (45.3 kg) 
or more of summer flounder from May 1 through October 31, or 200 lb 
(90.6 kg) or more of summer flounder from November 1 through April 30, 
and subject to the minimum mesh size requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section may not have ``available for immediate use'' any net or any 
piece of net that does not meet the minimum mesh size requirement, or 
any net, or any piece of net, with mesh that is rigged in a manner that 
is inconsistent with the minimum mesh size requirement. A net that is 
stowed in conformance with one of the methods specified in Sec. 
648.23(b) and that can be shown not to have been in recent use is 
considered to be not ``available for immediate use.''
    (f) The minimum net mesh requirement may apply to any portion of the 
net. The minimum mesh size and the portion of the net regulated by the 
minimum mesh size may be adjusted pursuant to the procedures in Sec. 
648.102.

Sec. 648.110  Summer flounder framework adjustments to management
measures.

    (a) Within season management action. The MAFMC may, at any time, 
initiate action to add or adjust management measures within the Summer 
Flounder, Scup, and Black Sea Bass FMP if it finds that action is 
necessary to meet or be consistent with the goals and objectives of the 
FMP.
    (1) Adjustment process. The MAFMC shall develop and analyze 
appropriate management actions over the span of at least two MAFMC 
meetings. The

[[Page 781]]

MAFMC must provide the public with advance notice of the availability of 
the recommendation(s), appropriate justification(s) and economic and 
biological analyses, and the opportunity to comment on the proposed 
adjustment(s) at the first meeting and prior to and at the second MAFMC 
meeting. The MAFMC's recommendations on adjustments or additions to 
management measures must come from one or more of the following 
categories: Adjustments within existing ABC control rule levels; 
adjustments to the existing MAFMC risk policy; introduction of new AMs, 
including sub-ACTs; minimum fish size; maximum fish size; gear 
restrictions; gear requirements or prohibitions; permitting 
restrictions; recreational possession limit; recreational seasons; 
closed areas; commercial seasons; commercial trip limits; commercial 
quota system including commercial quota allocation procedure and 
possible quota set asides to mitigate bycatch; recreational harvest 
limit; specification quota setting process; FMP Monitoring Committee 
composition and process; description and identification of essential 
fish habitat (and fishing gear management measures that impact EFH); 
description and identification of habitat areas of particular concern; 
regional gear restrictions; regional season restrictions (including 
option to split seasons); restrictions on vessel size (LOA and GRT) or 
shaft horsepower; operator permits; any other commercial or recreational 
management measures; any other management measures currently included in 
the FMP; and set aside quota for scientific research. Issues that 
require significant departures from previously contemplated measures or 
that are otherwise introducing new concepts may require an amendment of 
the FMP instead of a framework adjustment.
    (2) MAFMC recommendation. After developing management actions and 
receiving public testimony, the MAFMC shall make a recommendation to the 
Regional Administrator. The MAFMC's recommendation must include 
supporting rationale, if management measures are recommended, an 
analysis of impacts, and a recommendation to the Regional Administrator 
on whether to issue the management measures as a final rule. If the 
MAFMC recommends that the management measures should be issued as a 
final rule, it must consider at least the following factors and provide 
support and analysis for each factor considered:
    (i) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended 
management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a 
proposed rule, and whether the regulations would have to be in place for 
an entire harvest/fishing season;
    (ii) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for 
participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the 
development of recommended management measures;
    (iii) Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource; 
and
    (iv) Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management 
measures adopted following their implementation as a final rule.
    (3) NMFS action. If the MAFMC's recommendation includes adjustments 
or additions to management measures and, if after reviewing the MAFMC's 
recommendation and supporting information:
    (i) NMFS concurs with the MAFMC's recommended management measures 
and determines that the recommended management measures should be issued 
as a final rule based on the factors in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, the measures will be issued as a final rule in the Federal 
Register.
    (ii) If NMFS concurs with the MAFMC's recommended management 
measures and determines that the recommended management measures should 
be published first as a proposed rule, the measures will be published as 
a proposed rule in the Federal Register. After additional public 
comment, if NMFS concurs with the MAFMC recommendation, the measures 
will be published as a final rule in the Federal Register.
    (iii) If NMFS does not concur, the MAFMC will be notified in writing 
of the reasons for the non-concurrence.
    (4) Emergency actions. Nothing in this section is meant to derogate 
from the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under 
section 305(e) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.

           Subpart H_Management Measures for the Scup Fishery

    Source: 61 FR 43426, Aug. 23, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 648.120  Scup Annual Catch Limit (ACL).

    (a) The Scup Monitoring Committee shall recommend to the MAFMC 
separate ACLs for the commercial and recreational scup fisheries, the 
sum total of which shall be equal to the ABC recommended by the SSC.
    (1) Sector allocations. The commercial and recreational fishing 
sector ACLs will be established consistent with the allocation 
guidelines contained in the Summer Flounder, Scup, and Black Sea Bass 
FMP.
    (2) Periodicity. The scup commercial and recreational sector ACLs 
may be established on an annual basis for up to 3 years at a time, 
dependent on whether the SSC provides single or multiple year ABC 
recommendations.
    (b) Performance review. The Scup Monitoring Committee shall conduct 
a detailed review of fishery performance relative to the sector ACLs at 
least every 5 years.
    (1) If one or both of the sector-specific ACLs is exceeded with a 
frequency greater than 25 percent (i.e., more than once in 4 years or 
any 2 consecutive years), the Scup Monitoring Committee will review 
fishery performance information and make recommendations to the MAFMC 
for changes in measures intended to ensure ACLs are not as frequently 
exceeded.
    (2) The MAFMC may specify more frequent or more specific ACL 
performance review criteria as part of a stock rebuilding plan following 
a determination that the scup stock has become overfished.
    (3) Performance reviews shall not substitute for annual reviews that 
occur to ascertain if prior year ACLs have been exceeded but may be 
conducted in conjunction with such reviews.

[76 FR 60631, Sept. 29, 2011]


<R05>
Sec. 648.121  Scup Annual Catch Target (ACT).

    (a) The Scup Monitoring Committee shall identify and review the 
relevant sources of management uncertainty to recommend ACTs for the 
commercial and recreational fishing sectors as part of the scup 
specification process. The Scup Monitoring Committee recommendations 
shall identify the specific sources of management uncertainty that were 
considered, technical approaches to mitigating these sources of 
uncertainty, and any additional relevant information considered in the 
ACT recommendation process.
    (1) Sectors. Commercial and recreational specific ACTs shall be less 
than or equal to the sector-specific ACLs. The Scup Monitoring Committee 
shall recommend any reduction in catch necessary to address sector-
specific management uncertainty, consistent with paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (2) Periodicity. ACTs may be established on an annual basis for up 
to 3 years at a time, dependent on whether the SSC provides single or 
multiple year ABC recommendations.
    (b) Performance review. The Scup Monitoring Committee shall conduct 
a detailed review of fishery performance relative to ACTs in conjunction 
with any ACL performance review, as outlined in Sec. 648.120(b)(1) 
through (3).

[76 FR 60631, Sept. 29, 2011]


<R05>
Sec. 648.122  Scup specifications.

    (a) Commercial quota, recreational landing limits, research set-
asides, and other specification measures. The Scup Monitoring Committee 
shall recommend to the Demersal Species Committee of the MAFMC and the 
ASMFC through the specifications process, for use in conjunction with 
each ACL and ACT, a sector specific research set-aside, estimates of 
sector-related discards, recreational harvest limit, and commercial 
quota, along with other measures, as needed, that are projected to 
ensure the sector-specific ACL for an upcoming fishing year or years 
will not be exceeded. The measures to be considered by the Scup 
Monitoring Committee are as follows:

[[Page 783]]

    (1) Research quota set from a range of 0 to 3 percent of the maximum 
allowed to achieve the specified exploitation rate.
    (2) The commercial quota for each of the three periods specified in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section for research quota.
    (3) Possession limits for the Winter I and Winter II periods, 
including possession limits that result from potential rollover of quota 
from Winter I to Winter II. The possession limit is the maximum quantity 
of scup that is allowed to be landed within a 24-hour period (calendar 
day).
    (4) Percent of landings attained at which the landing limit for the 
Winter I period will be reduced.
    (5) All scup landed for sale in any state during a quota period 
shall be applied against the coastwide commercial quota for that period, 
regardless of where the scup were harvested, except as provided in 
paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
    (6) Minimum mesh size.
    (7) Recreational possession limit set from a range of 0 to 50 scup 
to achieve the recreational harvest limit, set after the reduction for 
research quota.
    (8) Recreational minimum fish size.
    (9) Recreational season.
    (10) Restrictions on gear.
    (11) Season and area closures in the commercial fishery.
    (12) Total allowable landings on an annual basis for a period not to 
exceed 3 years.
    (13) [Reserved]
    (14) Modification of existing AM measures and ACT control rules 
utilized by the Scup Monitoring Committee.
    (b) Specification of fishing measures. The Demersal Species 
Committee shall review the recommendations of the Scup Monitoring 
Committee. Based on these recommendations and any public comment, the 
Demersal Species Committee shall recommend to the MAFMC measures 
necessary to assure that the specified ACLs will not be exceeded. The 
MAFMC's recommendation must include supporting documentation, as 
appropriate, concerning the environmental and economic impacts of the 
recommendations. The Regional Administrator shall review these 
recommendations and any recommendations of the ASMFC. After such review, 
NMFS will publish a proposed rule in the Federal Register to implement a 
commercial quota, specifying the amount of quota allocated to each of 
the three periods, possession limits for the Winter I and Winter II 
periods, including possession limits that result from potential rollover 
of quota from Winter I to Winter II, the percentage of landings attained 
during the Winter I fishery at which the possession limits will be 
reduced, a recreational harvest limit, and additional management 
measures for the commercial fishery. If the Regional Administrator 
determines that additional recreational measures are necessary to ensure 
that the sector ACL will not be exceeded, he or she will publish a 
proposed rule in the Federal Register to implement additional management 
measures for the recreational fishery. After considering public comment, 
the Regional Administrator will publish a final rule in the Federal 
Register to implement annual measures.
    (c) Distribution of commercial quota. (1) The annual commercial 
quota will be allocated into three periods, based on the following 
percentages:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            Period                               Percent
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Winter I--January-April.......................................     45.11
Summer--May-October...........................................     38.95
Winter II--November-December..................................     15.94
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) The commercial quotas for each period will each be distributed 
to the coastal states from Maine through North Carolina on a coastwide 
basis.
    (d) Winter I and II commercial quota adjustment procedures. The 
Regional Administrator will monitor the harvest of commercial quota for 
the Winter I period based on dealer reports, state data, and other 
available information and shall determine the total amount of scup 
landed during the Winter I period. In any year that the Regional 
Administrator determines that the landings of scup during Winter I are 
less than the Winter I quota for that year, he/she shall increase, 
through publication of a notification in the Federal Register, provided 
such rule complies with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure 
Act, the Winter II quota for that year by the amount of

[[Page 784]]

the Winter I under-harvest. The Regional Administrator shall also 
adjust, through publication of a notification in the Federal Register, 
the Winter II possession limits consistent with the amount of the quota 
increase, based on the possession limits established through the annual 
specifications-setting process.
    (e) Research quota. See Sec. 648.21(g).

<R05>
Sec. 648.123  Scup accountability measures.

    (a) Commercial sector period closures. The Regional Administrator 
will monitor the harvest of commercial quota for each quota period based 
on dealer reports, state data, and other available information and shall 
determine the date when the commercial quota for a period will be 
harvested. NMFS shall close the EEZ to fishing for scup by commercial 
vessels for the remainder of the indicated period by publishing 
notification in the Federal Register advising that, effective upon a 
specific date, the commercial quota for that period has been harvested, 
and notifying vessel and dealer permit holders that no commercial quota 
is available for landing scup for the remainder of the period.
    (1) Commercial ACL overage evaluation. The commercial sector ACL 
will be evaluated based on a single-year examination of total catch 
(landings and dead discards). Both landings and dead discards will be 
evaluated in determining if the commercial sector ACL has been exceeded.
    (2) Commercial landings overage repayment by quota period. (i) All 
scup landed for sale in any state during a quota period shall be applied 
against the coastwide commercial quota for that period, regardless of 
where the scup were harvested, except as provided in paragraph 
(a)(2)(iv) of this section, and irrespective of whether the commercial 
sector ACL is exceeded. Any current year landings in excess of the 
commercial quota in any quota period will be deducted from that quota 
period's annual quota in the following year as prescribed in paragraphs 
(a)(2)(ii) through (iii) of this section:
    (ii) For the Winter I and Summer quota periods, landings in excess 
of the allocation will be deducted from the appropriate quota period for 
the following year in the final rule that establishes the annual quota. 
The overage deduction will be based on landings for the current year 
through October 31 and on landings for the previous calendar year that 
were not included when the overage deduction was made in the final rule 
that established the period quotas for the current year. If the Regional 
Administrator determines during the fishing year that any part of an 
overage deduction was based on erroneous landings data that were in 
excess of actual landings for the period concerned, he/she will restore 
the overage that was deducted in error to the appropriate quota 
allocation. The Regional Administrator will publish notification in the 
Federal Register announcing the restoration.
    (iii) For the Winter II quota period, landings in excess of the 
allocation will be deducted from the Winter II period for the following 
year through notification in the Federal Register during July of the 
following year. The overage deduction will be based on landings 
information available for the Winter II period as of June 30 of the 
following year. If the Regional Administrator determines during the 
fishing year that any part of an overage deduction was based on 
erroneous landings data that were in excess of actual landings for the 
period concerned, he/she will restore the overage that was deducted in 
error to the appropriate quota allocation. The Regional Administrator 
will publish notification in the Federal Register announcing the 
restoration.
    (iv) During a fishing year in which the Winter I quota period is 
closed prior to April 15, a state may apply to the Regional 
Administrator for authorization to count scup landed for sale in that 
state from April 15 through April 30 by state-only permitted vessels 
fishing exclusively in waters under the jurisdiction of that state 
against the Summer period quota. Requests to the Regional Administrator 
to count scup landings in a state from April 15 through April 30 against 
the Summer period quota must be made by letter signed by the principal 
state official

[[Page 785]]

with marine fishery management responsibility and expertise, or his/her 
designee, and must be received by the Regional Administrator no later 
than April 15. Within 10 working days following receipt of the letter, 
the Regional Administrator shall notify the appropriate state official 
of the disposition of the request.
    (b) Recreational landings sector closure. The Regional Administrator 
will monitor recreational landings based on the best available data and 
shall determine if the recreational harvest limit has been met or 
exceeded. The determination will be based on observed landings and will 
not utilize projections of future landings. At such time that the 
available data indicate that the recreational harvest limit has been met 
or exceeded, the Regional Administrator shall publish notification in 
the Federal Register advising that, effective on a specific date, the 
scup recreational fishery in the EEZ shall be closed for remainder of 
the calendar year.
    (1) Recreational ACL overage evaluation. The recreational sector ACL 
will be evaluated based on a 3-year moving average comparison of total 
catch (landings and dead discards). Both landings and dead discards will 
be evaluated in determining if the 3-year average recreational sector 
ACL has been exceeded. The 3-year moving average will be phased in over 
the first 3 years, beginning with 2012: Total recreational total catch 
from 2012 will be compared to the 2012 recreational sector ACL; the 
average total catch from both 2012 and 2013 will be compared to the 
average of the 2012 and 2013 recreational sector ACLs; the average total 
catch from 2012, 2013, and 2014 will be compared to the average of 2012, 
2013, and 2014 recreational sector ACLs; and for all subsequent years, 
the preceding 3-year average recreational total catch will be compared 
to the preceding 3-year average recreational sector ACL.
    (2) Recreational landing overage repayment. If available data 
indicate that the recreational sector ACL has been exceeded and the 
landings have exceeded RHL, the exact amount of the landings overage in 
pounds will be deducted, as soon as possible, from a subsequent single 
fishing year recreational sector ACT.
    (c) Non-landing accountability measures, by sector. In the event 
that a sector ACL has been exceeded and the overage has not been 
accommodated through landing-based AMs, then the exact amount by which 
the sector ACL was exceeded will be deducted, as soon as practicable, 
from a subsequent single fishing year applicable sector ACL through the 
specification process.
    (d) State/Federal disconnect AM. If the total catch, allowable 
landing, commercial quotas and/or RHL measures adopted by the ASMFC Scup 
Management Board and the MAFMC differ for a given fishing year, 
administrative action will be taken as soon as is practicable to revisit 
the respective recommendations of the two groups. The intent of this 
action shall be to achieve alignment through consistent state and 
Federal measures so no differential effects occur on Federal permit 
holders.

    (2) Non-exempt species. Unless otherwise specified in paragraph (d) 
of this section, the restrictions specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section apply only to vessels in the Southern Gear Restricted Area that 
are fishing for or in possession of the following non-exempt species: 
Longfin squid; black sea bass; and silver hake (whiting).
    (b) Northern Gear Restricted Area 1--(1) Restrictions. From November 
1 through December 31, all trawl vessels in the Northern Gear Restricted 
Area 1 that fish for or possess non-exempt species as specified in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section must fish with nets of 5.0-inch (12.7-
cm) diamond mesh, applied throughout the codend for at least 75 
continuous meshes forward of the terminus of the net. For trawl nets 
with codends (including an extension) of fewer than 75 meshes, the 
entire trawl net must have a minimum mesh size of 5.0 inches (12.7 cm) 
throughout the net. The Northern Gear Restricted Area 1 is an area 
bounded by straight lines connecting the following points in the order 
stated (copies of a chart depicting the area are available from the 
Regional Administrator upon request):

    (2) Non-exempt species. Unless otherwise specified in paragraph (d) 
of this section, the restrictions specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section apply only to vessels in the Northern Gear Restricted Area 1 
that are fishing for, or in possession of, the following non-exempt 
species: Longfin squid squid; black sea bass; and silver hake (whiting).
    (c) Transiting. Vessels that are subject to the provisions of the 
Southern and Northern GRAs, as specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section, respectively, may transit these areas provided that trawl 
net codends on board of mesh size less than that specified in paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section are not available for immediate use and are 
stowed in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 648.23(b).
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) Addition or deletion of exemptions. The MAFMC may recommend to 
the Regional Administrator, through the framework procedure specified in 
Sec. 648.130(a), additions or deletions to exemptions for fisheries 
other than scup. A fishery may be restricted or exempted by area, gear, 
season, or other means determined to be appropriate to reduce bycatch of 
scup.
    (f) Exempted experimental fishing. The Regional Administrator may 
issue an exempted experimental fishing permit (EFP) under the provisions 
of Sec. 600.745(b), consistent with paragraph (d)(2) of this section, 
to allow any vessel participating in a scup discard mitigation research 
project to engage in any of the following activities: Fish in the 
applicable gear restriction area; use fishing gear that does not conform 
to the regulations; possess non-exempt species specified in paragraphs 
(a)(2) and (b)(2) of this section; or engage in any other activity 
necessary to project operations for which an exemption from regulatory 
provision is required. Vessels issued an EFP must comply with all 
conditions and restrictions specified in the EFP.
    (1) A vessel participating in an exempted experimental fishery in 
the Scup Gear Restriction Area(s) must carry an EFP authorizing the 
activity and any required Federal fishery permit on board.
    (2) The Regional Administrator may not issue an EFP unless s/he 
determines that issuance is consistent with the objectives of the FMP, 
the provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and other applicable law and 
will not:
    (i) Have a detrimental effect on the scup resource and fishery;
    (ii) Cause the quotas for any species of fish for any quota period 
to be exceeded;

[[Page 787]]

    (iii) Create significant enforcement problems; or
    (iv) Have a detrimental effect on the scup discard mitigation 
research project.

<R05>
Sec. 648.125  Scup gear restrictions.

    (a) Trawl vessel gear restrictions--(1) Minimum mesh size. No owner 
or operator of an otter trawl vessel that is issued a scup moratorium 
permit may possess 500 lb (226.8 kg) or more of scup from November 1 
through April 30, or 200 lb (90.7 kg) or more of scup from May 1 through 
October 31, unless fishing with nets that have a minimum mesh size of 
5.0-inch (12.7-cm) diamond mesh, applied throughout the codend for at 
least 75 continuous meshes forward of the terminus of the net, and all 
other nets are stowed in accordance with Sec. 648.23(b)(1). For trawl 
nets with codends (including an extension) of fewer than 75 meshes, the 
entire trawl net must have a minimum mesh size of 5.0 inches (12.7 cm) 
throughout the net. Scup on board these vessels must be stowed 
separately and kept readily available for inspection. Measurement of 
nets will conform with Sec. 648.80(f).
    (2) Mesh-size measurement. Mesh sizes will be measured according to 
the procedure specified in Sec. 648.104(a)(2).
    (3) Net modification. The owner or operator of a fishing vessel 
subject to the minimum mesh requirements in Sec. 648.124 and paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section shall not use any device, gear, or material, 
including, but not limited to, nets, net strengtheners, ropes, lines, or 
chafing gear, on the top of the regulated portion of a trawl net. 
However, one splitting strap and one bull rope (if present), consisting 
of line or rope no more than 3 inches (7.2 cm) in diameter, may be used 
if such splitting strap and/or bull rope does not constrict in any 
manner the top of the regulated portion of the net, and one rope no 
greater that 0.75 inches (1.9 cm) in diameter extending the length of 
the net from the belly to the terminus of the codend along the top, 
bottom, and each side of the net. ``Top of the regulated portion of the 
net'' means the 50 percent of the entire regulated portion of the net 
that (in a hypothetical situation) will not be in contact with the ocean 
bottom during a tow if the regulated portion of the net were laid flat 
on the ocean floor. For the purpose of this paragraph (a)(3), head ropes 
are not considered part of the top of the regulated portion of a trawl 
net.
    (4) Mesh obstruction or constriction. (i) The owner or operator of a 
fishing vessel subject to the minimum mesh restrictions in Sec. 648.124 
and in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not use any mesh 
construction, mesh configuration, or other means on, in, or attached to 
the top of the regulated portion of the net, as defined in paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section, if it obstructs or constricts the meshes of the 
net in any manner.
    (ii) The owner or operator of a fishing vessel subject to the 
minimum mesh requirements in Sec. 648.124 and in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section may not use a net capable of catching scup if the bars 
entering or exiting the knots twist around each other.
    (5) Stowage of nets. The owner or operator of an otter trawl vessel 
retaining 500 lb (226.8 kg) or more of scup from November 1 through 
April 30, or 200 lb (90.7 kg) or more of scup from May 1 through October 
31, and subject to the minimum mesh requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section, and the owner or operator of a midwater trawl or other 
trawl vessel subject to the minimum size requirement in Sec. 648.126, 
may not have available for immediate use any net, or any piece of net, 
not meeting the minimum mesh size requirement, or mesh that is rigged in 
a manner that is inconsistent with the minimum mesh size. A net that is 
stowed in conformance with one of the methods specified in Sec. 
648.23(b), and that can be shown not to have been in recent use, is 
considered to be not available for immediate use.
    (6) Roller gear. The owner or operator of an otter trawl vessel 
issued a moratorium permit pursuant to Sec. 648.4(a)(6) shall not use 
roller rig trawl gear equipped with rollers greater than 18 inches (45.7 
cm) in diameter.
    (7) Procedures for changes. The minimum net mesh and the threshold 
catch level at which it is required set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section, and the maximum roller diameter set

[[Page 788]]

forth in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, may be changed following the 
procedures in Sec. 648.122.
    (b) Pot and trap gear restrictions. Owners or operators of vessels 
subject to this part must fish with scup pots or traps that comply with 
the following:
    (1) Degradable hinges. A scup pot or trap must have degradable 
hinges and fasteners made of one of the following degradable materials:
    (i) Untreated hemp, jute, or cotton string of \3/16\ inches (4.8 mm) 
diameter or smaller;
    (ii) Magnesium alloy, timed float releases (pop-up devices) or 
similar magnesium alloy fasteners; or
    (iii) Ungalvanized or uncoated iron wire of 0.094 inches (2.4 mm) 
diameter or smaller.
    (iv) The use of a single non-degradable retention device designed to 
prevent loss of the ghost panel after the degradable materials have 
failed is permitted provided the device does not impair the egress 
design function of the ghost panel by obstructing the opening or by 
preventing the panel from opening at such time that the degradable 
fasteners have completely deteriorated.
    (2) Escape vents. (i) All scup pots or traps that have a circular 
escape vent with a minimum of 3.1 inches (7.9 cm) in diameter, or a 
square escape vent with a minimum of 2.25 inches (5.7 cm) for each side, 
or an equivalent rectangular escape vent.
    (ii) The minimum escape vent size set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(i) 
of this section may be revised following the procedures in Sec. 
648.122.
    (3) Pot and trap identification. Pots or traps used in fishing for 
scup must be marked with a code of identification that may be the number 
assigned by the Regional Administrator and/or the identification marking 
as required by the vessel's home port state.

Sec. 648.126  Scup minimum fish sizes.

    (a) Moratorium (commercially) permitted vessels. The minimum size 
for scup is 9 inches (22.9 cm) TL for all vessels issued a moratorium 
permit under Sec. 648.4(a)(6). If such a vessel is also issued a 
charter and party boat permit and is carrying passengers for hire, or 
carrying more than three crew members if a charter boat, or more than 
five crew members if a party boat, then the minimum size specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section applies.
    (b) Party/Charter permitted vessels and recreational fishery 
participants. The minimum size for scup is 10.5 inches (26.67 cm) TL for 
all vessels that do not have a moratorium permit, or for party and 
charter vessels that are issued a moratorium permit but are fishing with 
passengers for hire, or carrying more than three crew members if a 
charter boat, or more than five crew members if a party boat.
    (c) The minimum size applies to whole fish or any part of a fish 
found in possession, e.g., fillets. These minimum sizes may be adjusted 
pursuant to the procedures in Sec. 648.122.

Sec. 648.128  Scup possession restrictions.

    (a) Party/Charter and recreational possession limits. No person 
shall possess more than 20 scup in, or harvested from, the EEZ unless 
that person is the owner or operator of a fishing vessel issued a scup 
moratorium permit, or is issued a scup dealer permit. Persons aboard a 
commercial vessel that is not eligible for a scup moratorium permit are 
subject to this possession limit. The owner, operator, and crew of a 
charter or party boat issued a scup moratorium permit are subject to the 
possession limit when carrying passengers for hire or when carrying more 
than five crew members for a party boat, or more than three crew members 
for a charter boat. This possession limit may be adjusted pursuant to 
the procedures in Sec. 648.122.

[[Page 789]]

    (b) If whole scup are processed into fillets, an authorized officer 
will convert the number of fillets to whole scup at the place of landing 
by dividing fillet number by 2. If scup are filleted into a single 
(butterfly) fillet, such fillet shall be deemed to be from one whole 
scup.
    (c) Scup harvested by vessels subject to the possession limit with 
more than one person aboard may be pooled in one or more containers. 
Compliance with the daily possession limit will be determined by 
dividing the number of scup on board by the number of persons aboard 
other than the captain and crew. If there is a violation of the 
possession limit on board a vessel carrying more than one person, the 
violation shall be deemed to have been committed by the owner and 
operator.
    (d) Scup and scup parts harvested by a vessel with a moratorium or 
charter or party boat scup permit, or in or from the EEZ north of 
35[deg]15.3[min] N. lat., may not be landed with the skin removed.

    Source: 61 FR 58467, Nov. 15, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 648.140  Black sea bass Annual Catch Limit (ACL).

    (a) The Black Sea Bass Monitoring Committee shall recommend to the

[[Page 790]]

MAFMC separate ACLs for the commercial and recreational scup fisheries, 
the sum total of which shall be equal to the ABC recommended by the SSC.
    (1) Sector allocations. The commercial and recreational fishing 
sector ACLs will be established consistent with the allocation 
guidelines contained in the Summer Flounder, Scup, and Black Sea Bass 
Fishery Management Plan.
    (2) Periodicity. The black sea bass commercial and recreational 
sector ACLs may be established on an annual basis for up to 3 years at a 
time, dependent on whether the SSC provides single or multiple year ABC 
recommendations.
    (b) Performance review. The Black Sea Bass Monitoring Committee 
shall conduct a detailed review of fishery performance relative to the 
sector ACLs at least every 5 years.
    (1) If one or both of the sector-specific ACLs is exceeded with a 
frequency greater than 25 percent (i.e., more than once in 4 years or 
any 2 consecutive years), the Black Sea Bass Monitoring Committee will 
review fishery performance information and make recommendations to the 
MAFMC for changes in measures intended to ensure ACLs are not exceeded 
as frequently.
    (2) The MAFMC may specify more frequent or more specific ACL 
performance review criteria as part of a stock rebuilding plan following 
a determination that the black sea bass stock has become overfished.
    (3) Performance reviews shall not substitute for annual reviews that 
occur to ascertain if prior year ACLs have been exceeded but may be 
conducted in conjunction with such reviews.

<R05>
Sec. 648.141  Black sea bass Annual Catch Target (ACT).

    (a) The Black Sea Bass Monitoring Committee shall identify and 
review the relevant sources of management uncertainty to recommend ACTs 
for the commercial and recreational fishing sectors as part of the black 
sea bass specification process. The Black Sea Bass Monitoring Committee 
recommendations shall identify the specific sources of management 
uncertainty that were considered, technical approaches to mitigating 
these sources of uncertainty, and any additional relevant information 
considered in the ACT recommendation process.
    (1) Sectors. Commercial and recreational specific ACTs shall be less 
than or equal to the sector-specific ACLs. The Black Sea Bass Monitoring 
Committee shall recommend any reduction in catch necessary to address 
sector-specific management uncertainty, consistent with paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (2) Periodicity. ACTs may be established on an annual basis for up 
to 3 years at a time, dependent on whether the SSC provides single or 
multiple-year ABC recommendations.
    (b) Performance review. The Black Sea Bass Monitoring Committee 
shall conduct a detailed review of fishery performance relative to ACTs 
in conjunction with any ACL performance review, as outlined in Sec. 
648.140(b)(1)-(3).

Sec. 648.142  Black sea bass specifications.

    (a) Commercial quota, recreational landing limit, research set-
aside, and other specification measures. The Black Sea Bass Monitoring 
Committee will recommend to the Demersal Species Committee of the MAFMC 
and the ASMFC, through the specification process, for use in conjunction 
with the ACL and ACT, sector-specific research set-asides, estimates of 
the sector-related discards, a recreational harvest limit, a commercial 
quota, along with other measures, as needed, that are projected to 
ensure the sector-specific ACL for an upcoming year or years will not be 
exceeded. The following measures are to be consisted by the Black Sea 
Bass Monitoring Committee:
    (1) Research quota set from a range of 0 to 3 percent of the maximum 
allowed.
    (2) A commercial quota, allocated annually.
    (3) A commercial possession limit for all moratorium vessels, with 
the provision that these quantities be the maximum allowed to be landed 
within a 24-hour period (calendar day).
    (4) Commercial minimum fish size.
    (5) Minimum mesh size in the codend or throughout the net and the 
catch

[[Page 791]]

threshold that will require compliance with the minimum mesh 
requirement.
    (6) Escape vent size.
    (7) A recreational possession limit set after the reduction for 
research quota.
    (8) Recreational minimum fish size.
    (9) Recreational season.
    (10) Restrictions on gear other than otter trawls and pots or traps.
    (11) Total allowable landings on an annual basis for a period not to 
exceed 3 years.
    (12) [Reserved]
    (13) Modification of the existing AM measures and ACT control rules 
utilized by the Black Sea Bass Monitoring Committee.
    (b) Specification fishing measures. The Demersal Species Committee 
shall review the recommendations of the Black Sea Bass Monitoring 
Committee. Based on these recommendations and any public comment, the 
Demersal Species Committee shall make its recommendations to the MAFMC 
with respect to the measures necessary to assure that the ACLs are not 
exceeded. The MAFMC shall review these recommendations and, based on the 
recommendations and public comment, make recommendations to the Regional 
Administrator with respect to the measures necessary to assure that 
sector ACLs are not exceeded. Included in the recommendation will be 
supporting documents, as appropriate, concerning the environmental and 
economic impacts of the final rule. The Regional Administrator will 
review these recommendations and any recommendations of the ASMFC. After 
such review, the Regional Administrator will publish a proposed rule in 
the Federal Register to implement a commercial quota, a recreational 
harvest limit, and additional management measures for the commercial 
fishery. If the Regional Administrator determines that additional 
recreational measures are necessary to assure that the recreational 
sector ACL is not exceeded, he or she will publish a proposed rule in 
the Federal Register to implement additional management measures for the 
recreational fishery. After considering public comment, the Regional 
Administrator will publish a final rule in the Federal Register to 
implement the measures necessary to ensure that recreational sector ACL 
is not exceeded.
    (c) Distribution of annual commercial quota. The black sea bass 
commercial quota will be allocated on a coastwide basis.
    (d) Research quota. See Sec. 648.21(g).

<R05>
Sec. 648.143  Black sea bass Accountability Measures.

    (a) Commercial sector fishery closure. The Regional Administrator 
will monitor the harvest of commercial quota based on dealer reports, 
state data, and other available information. All black sea bass landed 
for sale in the states from North Carolina through Maine by a vessel 
with a moratorium permit issued under Sec. 648.4(a)(7) shall be applied 
against the commercial annual coastwide quota, regardless of where the 
black sea bass were harvested. All black sea bass harvested north of 
35[deg]15.3[min] N. lat., and landed for sale in the states from North 
Carolina through Maine by any vessel without a moratorium permit and 
fishing exclusively in state waters, will be counted against the quota 
by the state in which it is landed, pursuant to the FMP for the black 
sea bass fishery adopted by the ASMFC. The Regional Administrator will 
determine the date on which the annual coastwide quota will have been 
harvested; beginning on that date and through the end of the calendar 
year, the EEZ north of 35[deg]15.3[min] N. lat. will be closed to the 
possession of black sea bass. The Regional Administrator will publish 
notification in the Federal Register advising that, upon, and after, 
that date, no vessel may possess black sea bass in the EEZ north of 
35[deg]15.3[min] N. lat. during a closure, nor may vessels issued a 
moratorium permit land black sea bass during the closure. Individual 
states will have the responsibility to close their ports to landings of 
black sea bass during a closure, pursuant to the FMP for the black sea 
bass fishery adopted by the ASMFC.
    (1) Commercial ACL overage evaluation. The commercial sector ACL 
will be evaluated based on a single-year examination of total catch 
(landings and dead discards). Both landings and dead

[[Page 792]]

discards will be evaluated in determining if the commercial sector ACL 
has been exceeded.
    (2) Commercial landings overage repayment. Landings in excess of the 
annual coastwide quota will be deducted from the quota allocation for 
the following year in the final rule that establishes the annual quota. 
The overage deduction will be based on landings for the current year 
through September 30, and landings for the previous calendar year were 
not included when the overage deduction was made in the final rule that 
established the annual coastwide quota for the current year. If the 
Regional Administrator determines during the fishing year that any part 
of an overage deduction was based on erroneous landings data that were 
in excess of actual landings for the period concerned, he/she will 
restore the overage that was deducted in error to the appropriate quota 
allocation. The Regional Administrator will publish notification in the 
Federal Register announcing the restoration.
    (b) Recreational landings sector closure. The Regional Administrator 
will monitor recreational landings based on the best available data and 
shall determine if the recreational harvest limit has been met or 
exceeded. The determination will be based on observed landings and will 
not utilize projections of future landings. At such time that the 
available data indicate that the recreational harvest limit has been met 
or exceeded, the Regional Administrator shall publish notification in 
the Federal Register advising that, effective on a specific date, the 
black sea bass recreational fishery in the EEZ shall be closed for 
remainder of the calendar year.
    (1) Recreational ACL overage evaluation. The recreational sector ACL 
will be evaluated based on a 3-year moving average comparison of total 
catch (landings and dead discards). Both landings and dead discards will 
be evaluated in determining if the 3-year average recreational sector 
ACL has been exceeded. The 3-year moving average will be phased in over 
the first 3 years, beginning with 2012: Total recreational total catch 
from 2012 will be compared to the 2012 recreational sector ACL; the 
average total catch from both 2012 and 2013 will be compared to the 
average of the 2012 and 2013 recreational sector ACLs; the average total 
catch from 2012, 2013, and 2014 will be compared to the average of the 
2012, 2013, and 2014 recreational sector ACLs and, for all subsequent 
years, the preceding 3-year average recreational total catch will be 
compared to the preceding 3-year average recreational sector ACL.
    (2) Recreational landing overage repayment. If available data 
indicate that the recreational sector ACL has been exceeded and the 
landings have exceeded the recreational harvest limit, the exact amount 
of the landings overage (in pounds) will be deducted, as soon as 
possible, from a subsequent single fishing year recreational sector ACT.
    (c) Non-landing accountability measures, by sector. In the event 
that a sector ACL has been exceeded and the overage has not been 
accommodated through landings-based AMs, then the exact amount of the 
overage in pounds by which the sector ACL was exceeded will be deducted, 
as soon as possible, from a subsequent single fishing year applicable 
sector ACL.
    (d) State/Federal disconnect AM. If the total catch, allowable 
landings, commercial quotas, and/or recreational harvest limit measures 
adopted by the ASMFC Black Sea Bass Management Board and the MAFMC 
differ for a given fishing year, administrative action will be taken as 
soon as is practicable to revisit the respective recommendations of the 
two groups. The intent of this action shall be to achieve alignment 
through consistent state and Federal measures so no differential effects 
occur to Federal permit holders.

Sec. 648.144  Black sea bass gear restrictions.

    (a) Trawl gear restrictions--(1) General. (i) Otter trawlers whose 
owners are issued a black sea bass moratorium permit and that land or 
possess 500 lb (226.8 kg) or more of black sea bass from January 1 
through March 31, or 100 lb (45.4 kg) or more of black sea bass from 
April 1 through December 31, must fish with nets that have a minimum 
mesh size of 4.5-inch (11.43-cm) diamond mesh applied throughout the 
codend for at least 75 continuous

[[Page 793]]

meshes forward of the terminus of the net, or for codends with less than 
75 meshes, the entire net must have a minimum mesh size of 4.5-inch 
(11.43-cm) diamond mesh throughout.
    (ii) Mesh sizes shall be measured pursuant to the procedure 
specified in Sec. 648.104(a)(2).
    (2) Net modifications. No vessel subject to this part shall use any 
device, gear, or material, including, but not limited to, nets, net 
strengtheners, ropes, lines, or chafing gear, on the top of the 
regulated portion of a trawl net except that one splitting strap and one 
bull rope (if present) consisting of line or rope no more than 3 inches 
(7.6 cm) in diameter may be used if such splitting strap and/or bull 
rope does not constrict, in any manner, the top of the regulated portion 
of the net, and one rope no greater than 0.75 inches (1.9 cm) in 
diameter extending the length of the net from the belly to the terminus 
of the codend along the top, bottom, and each side of the net. ``Top of 
the regulated portion of the net'' means the 50 percent of the entire 
regulated portion of the net that (in a hypothetical situation) will not 
be in contact with the ocean bottom during a tow if the regulated 
portion of the net were laid flat on the ocean floor. For the purpose of 
this paragraph, head ropes shall not be considered part of the top of 
the regulated portion of a trawl net.
    (3) Mesh obstruction or constriction. (i) A fishing vessel may not 
use any mesh configuration, mesh construction, or other means on or in 
the top of the net, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, that 
obstructs the meshes of the net in any manner, or otherwise causes the 
size of the meshes of the net while in use to diminish to a size smaller 
than the minimum established pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this 
section.
    (ii) No person on any vessel may possess or fish with a net capable 
of catching black sea bass in which the bars entering or exiting the 
knots twist around each other.
    (4) Stowage of nets. Otter trawl vessels subject to the minimum 
mesh-size requirement of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section may not 
have ``available for immediate use'' any net or any piece of net that 
does not meet the minimum mesh size requirement, or any net, or any 
piece of net, with mesh that is rigged in a manner that is inconsistent 
with the minimum mesh size requirement. A net that is stowed in 
conformance with one of the methods specified in Sec. 648.23(b) and 
that can be shown not to have been in recent use, is considered to be 
not ``available for immediate use.''
    (5) Roller gear. Rollers used in roller rig or rock hopper trawl 
gear shall be no larger than 18 inches (45.7 cm) in diameter.
    (b) Pot and trap gear restrictions--(1) Gear marking. The owner of a 
vessel issued a black sea bass moratorium permit must mark all black sea 
bass pots or traps with the vessel's USCG documentation number or state 
registration number.
    (2) All black sea bass traps or pots must have two escape vents 
placed in lower corners of the parlor portion of the pot or trap that 
each comply with one of the following minimum size requirements: 1.375 
inches by 5.75 inches (3.49 cm by 14.61 cm); a circular vent of 2.5 
inches (6.4 cm) in diameter; or a square vent with sides of 2 inches 
(5.1 cm), inside measure; however, black sea bass traps constructed of 
wooden laths instead may have escape vents constructed by leaving spaces 
of at least 1.375 inches (3.49 cm) between two sets of laths in the 
parlor portion of the trap. These dimensions for escape vents and lath 
spacing may be adjusted pursuant to the procedures in Sec. 648.140.
    (3) Ghost panel. (i) Black sea bass traps or pots must contain a 
ghost panel affixed to the trap or pot with degradable fasteners and 
hinges. The opening to be covered by the ghost panel must measure at 
least 3.0 inches (7.62 cm) by 6.0 inches (15.24 cm). The ghost panel 
must be affixed to the pot or trap with hinges and fasteners made of one 
of the following degradable materials:
    (A) Untreated hemp, jute, or cotton string of \3/16\ inches (4.8 mm) 
diameter or smaller; or
    (B) Magnesium alloy, timed float releases (pop-up devices) or 
similar magnesium alloy fasteners; or

[[Page 794]]

    (C) Ungalvanized or uncoated iron wire of 0.094 inches (2.4 mm) 
diameter or smaller.
    (ii) The use of a single non-degradable retention device designed to 
prevent loss of the ghost panel after the degradable materials have 
failed is permitted, provided the device does not impair the egress 
design function of the ghost panel by obstructing the opening or by 
preventing the panel from opening at such time that the degradable 
fasteners have completely deteriorated.

Sec. 648.145  Black sea bass possession limit.

    (a) From January 1 through February 28, no person shall possess more 
than 15 black sea bass in, or harvested from, the EEZ unless that person 
is the owner or operator of a fishing vessel issued a black sea bass 
moratorium permit, or is issued a black sea bass dealer permit. From May 
19 through October 14, and from November 1 through December 31, no 
person shall possess more than 25 black sea bass in, or harvested from, 
the EEZ unless that person is the owner or operator of a fishing vessel 
issued a black sea bass moratorium permit, or is issued a black sea bass 
dealer permit. Persons aboard a commercial vessel that is not eligible 
for a black sea bass moratorium permit may not retain more than 15 black 
sea bass from January 1 through February 29, or more than 25 black sea 
bass from May 19 through October 14 and from November 1 through December 
31. The owner, operator, and crew of a charter or party boat issued a 
black sea bass moratorium permit are subject to the possession limit 
when carrying passengers for hire or when carrying more than five crew 
members for a party boat, or more than three crew members for a charter 
boat. This possession limit may be adjusted pursuant to the procedures 
in Sec. 648.142.
    (b) If whole black sea bass are processed into fillets, an 
authorized officer will convert the number of fillets to whole black sea 
bass at the place of landing by dividing fillet number by two. If black 
sea bass are filleted into a single (butterfly) fillet, such fillet 
shall be deemed to be from one whole black sea bass.
    (c) Black sea bass harvested by vessels subject to the possession 
limit with more than one person aboard may be pooled in one or more 
containers. Compliance with the daily possession limit will be 
determined by dividing the number of black sea bass on board by the 
number of persons aboard, other than the captain and the crew. If there 
is a violation of the possession limit on board a vessel carrying more 
than one person, the violation shall be deemed to have been committed by 
the owner and operator of the vessel.
    (d) Owners or operators of otter trawl vessels issued a moratorium 
permit under Sec. 648.4(a)(7) and fishing with, or possessing on board, 
nets or pieces of net that do not meet the minimum mesh requirements 
specified in Sec. 648.144(a) and that are not stowed in accordance with 
Sec. 648.144(a)(4) may not retain more than 500 lb (226.8 kg) of black 
sea bass from January 1 through March 31, or more than 100 lb (45.4 kg) 
of black sea bass from April 1 through December 31. Black sea bass on 
board these vessels shall be stored so as to be readily available for 
inspection in a standard 100-lb (45.4-kg) tote.

(31.75 cm) TL for all vessels that do not qualify for a moratorium 
permit, and for party boats holding a moratorium permit, if fishing with 
passengers for hire or carrying more than five crew members, and for 
charter boats holding a moratorium permit, if fishing with more than 
three crew members.
    (c) The minimum size in this section applies to the whole fish or 
any part of a fish found in possession (e.g., fillets), except that 
party or charter vessels possessing valid state permits authorizing 
filleting at sea may possess fillets smaller than the size specified if 
skin remains on the fillet and all other state requirements are met.

Sec. 648.148  Special management zones.

    The recipient of a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit for an 
artificial reef, fish attraction device, or other modification of 
habitat for purposes of fishing may request that an area surrounding and 
including the site be designated by the MAFMC as a special management 
zone (SMZ). The MAFMC may prohibit or restrain the use of specific types 
of fishing gear that are not compatible with the intent of the 
artificial reef or fish attraction device or other habitat modification 
within the SMZ. The establishment of an SMZ will be effected by a 
regulatory amendment, pursuant to the following procedure:
    (a) A SMZ monitoring team comprised of members of staff from the 
MAFMC, NMFS Northeast Region, and NMFS Northeast Fisheries Science 
Center will evaluate the request in the form of a written report, 
considering the following criteria:
    (1) Fairness and equity;
    (2) Promotion of conservation;
    (3) Avoidance of excessive shares;
    (4) Consistency with the objectives of Amendment 9 to the Summer 
Flounder, Scup, and Black Sea Bass Fishery Management Plan, the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act, and other applicable law;
    (5) The natural bottom in and surrounding potential SMZs; and
    (6) Impacts on historical uses.
    (b) The MAFMC Chairman may schedule meetings of MAFMC's industry 
advisors and/or the SSC to review the report and associated documents 
and to advise the MAFMC. The MAFMC Chairman may also schedule public 
hearings.
    (c) The MAFMC, following review of the SMZ monitoring teams's 
report, supporting data, public comments, and other relevant 
information, may recommend to the Regional Administrator that a SMZ be 
approved. Such a recommendation will be accompanied by all relevant 
background information.
    (d) The Regional Administrator will review the MAFMC's 
recommendation. If the Regional Administrator concurs in the 
recommendation, he or she will publish a proposed rule in the Federal 
Register in accordance with the recommendations. If the Regional 
Administrator rejects the MAFMC's recommendation, he or she shall advise 
the MAFMC in writing of the basis for the rejection.
    (e) The proposed rule to establish a SMZ shall afford a reasonable 
period for public comment. Following a review of public comments and any 
information or data not previously available, the Regional Administrator 
will publish a final rule if he or she determines that the establishment 
of the SMZ is supported by the substantial weight of evidence in the 
record and consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Act and other applicable 
law.

Sec. 648.160  Bluefish Annual Catch Limit (ACL).

    (a) The Bluefish Monitoring Committee shall recommend to the MAFMC 
an ACL for the bluefish fishery, which shall be equal to the ABC 
recommended by the SSC.
    (1) Periodicity. The bluefish fishery ACL may be established on an 
annual basis for up to 3 years at a time, dependent on whether the SSC 
provides single or multiple-year ABC recommendations.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (b) Performance review. The Bluefish Monitoring Committee shall 
conduct a detailed review of fishery performance relative to the ACL at 
least every 5 years.
    (1) If the ACL is exceeded with a frequency greater than 25 percent 
(i.e., more than once in 4 years or any 2 consecutive years), the 
Bluefish Monitoring Committee will review fishery performance 
information and make recommendations to the MAFMC for changes in 
measures intended to ensure the ACL is not exceeded as frequently.
    (2) The MAFMC may specify more frequent or more specific ACL 
performance review criteria as part of a stock rebuilding plan following 
the determination that the bluefish stock has become overfished.
    (3) Performance reviews shall not substitute for annual reviews that 
occur to ascertain if prior year ACLs have been exceeded, but may be 
conducted in conjunction with such reviews.

Sec. 648.161  Bluefish Annual Catch Targets (ACTs).

    (a) The Bluefish Monitoring Committee shall identify and review the 
relevant sources of management uncertainty to recommend ACTs for the 
commercial and recreational fishing sectors as part of the bluefish 
specification process. The Bluefish Monitoring Committee recommendations 
shall identify the specific sources of management uncertainty that were 
considered, technical approaches to mitigating these sources of 
uncertainty, and any additional relevant information considered in the 
ACT recommendation process.
    (1) Sectors. The sum of the commercial and recreational sector-
specific ACTs shall be less than or equal to the fishery level ACL. The 
Bluefish Monitoring Committee shall recommend any reduction in catch 
necessary to address management uncertainty, consistent with paragraph 
(a) of this section. A total of 83 percent of the fishery-level ACT will 
be allocated to the recreational fishery. A total of 17 percent of the 
fishery-level ACT will be allocated to the commercial fishery.
    (2) Periodicity. ACTs may be established on an annual basis for up 
to 3 years at a time, dependent on whether the SSC provides single or 
multiple-year ABC recommendations.
    (b) Performance review. The Bluefish Monitoring Committee shall 
conduct a detailed review of fishery performance relative to ACTs in 
conjunction with any ACL performance review, as outlined in Sec. 
648.160(b)(1) through (3).

Sec. 648.162  Bluefish specifications.

    (a) Recommended measures. Based on the annual review and requests 
for research quota as described in paragraph (h) of this section, the 
Bluefish Monitoring Committee shall recommend to the Coastal Migratory 
Committee of the MAFMC and the ASMFC the following measures to ensure 
that the ACL specified by the process outlined in Sec. 648.160(a) will 
not be exceeded:
    (1) A fishery-level ACT;
    (2) Research quota set from a range of 0 to 3 percent of TALs;
    (3) Commercial minimum fish size;
    (4) Minimum mesh size;
    (5) Recreational possession limit set from a range of 0 to 20 
bluefish;
    (6) Recreational minimum fish size;
    (7) Recreational season;

[[Page 797]]

    (8) Restrictions on gear other than otter trawls and gill nets;
    (9) [Reserved]
    (10) Modification of existing AM measures and ACT control rules 
utilized by the Bluefish Monitoring Committee.
    (b) TAL--(1) Recreational harvest limit. If research quota is 
specified as described in paragraph (g) of this section, the 
recreational harvest limit will be based on the TAL remaining after the 
deduction of the research quota.
    (2) Commercial quota. If 17 percent of the TAL is less than 10.5 
million lb (4.8 million kg) and the recreational fishery is not 
projected to land its harvest limit for the upcoming year, the 
commercial fishery may be allocated up to 10.5 million lb (4.8 million 
kg) as its quota, provided that the combination of the projected 
recreational landings and the commercial quota does not exceed the TAL. 
If research quota is specified as described in paragraph (g) of this 
section, the commercial quota will be based on the TAL remaining after 
the deduction of the research quota.
    (c) Annual fishing measures. The MAFMC's Coastal Migratory Committee 
shall review the recommendations of the Bluefish Monitoring Committee. 
Based on these recommendations and any public comment, the Coastal 
Migratory Committee shall recommend to the MAFMC measures necessary to 
ensure that the ACL will not be exceeded. The MAFMC shall review these 
recommendations and, based on the recommendations and any public 
comment, recommend to the Regional Administrator by September 1 measures 
necessary to ensure that the applicable ACL will not be exceeded. The 
MAFMC's recommendations must include supporting documentation, as 
appropriate, concerning the environmental, economic, and social impacts 
of the recommendations. The Regional Administrator shall review these 
recommendations and any recommendations of the ASMFC. After such review, 
NMFS will publish a proposed rule in the Federal Register as soon as 
practicable, to implement an ACL, ACTs, research quota, a coastwide 
commercial quota, individual state commercial quotas, a recreational 
harvest limit, and additional management measures for the commercial and 
recreational fisheries to ensure that the ACL will not be exceeded. 
After considering public comment, NMFS will publish a final rule in the 
Federal Register.
    (d) Distribution of annual commercial quota.--(1) The annual 
commercial quota will be distributed to the states, based upon the 
following percentages; state each followed by its allocation in 
parentheses: ME (0.6685); NH (0.4145); MA (6.7167); RI (6.8081); CT 
(1.2663); NY (10.3851); NJ (14.8162) DE (1.8782); MD (3.0018); VA 
(11.8795); NC (32.0608); SC (0.0352); GA (0.0095); and FL (10.0597). 
Note: The sum of all state allocations does not add to 100 because of 
rounding.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (e) Quota transfers and combinations. Any state implementing a state 
commercial quota for bluefish may request approval from the Regional 
Administrator to transfer part or all of its annual quota to one or more 
states. Two or more states implementing a state commercial quota for 
bluefish may request approval from the Regional Administrator to combine 
their quotas, or part of their quotas, into an overall regional quota. 
Requests for transfer or combination of commercial quotas for bluefish 
must be made by individual or joint letter(s) signed by the principal 
state official with marine fishery management responsibility and 
expertise, or his/her previously named designee, for each state 
involved. The letter(s) must certify that all pertinent state 
requirements have been met and identify the states involved and the 
amount of quota to be transferred or combined.
    (1) Within 10 working days following the receipt of the letter(s) 
from the states involved, the Regional Administrator shall notify the 
appropriate state officials of the disposition of the request. In 
evaluating requests to transfer a quota or combine quotas, the Regional 
Administrator shall consider whether:
    (i) The transfer or combination would preclude the overall annual 
quota from being fully harvested;
    (ii) The transfer addresses an unforeseen variation or contingency 
in the fishery; and

[[Page 798]]

    (iii) The transfer is consistent with the objectives of the Bluefish 
FMP and Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (2) The transfer of quota or the combination of quotas will be valid 
only for the calendar year for which the request was made.
    (3) A state may not submit a request to transfer quota or combine 
quotas if a request to which it is party is pending before the Regional 
Administrator. A state may submit a new request when it receives 
notification that the Regional Administrator has disapproved the 
previous request or when notification of the approval of the transfer or 
combination has been published in the Federal Register.
    (f) Based upon any changes in the landings data available from the 
states for the base years 1981-89, the ASMFC and the MAFMC may recommend 
to the Regional Administrator that the states' shares specified in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section be revised. The MAFMC's and the ASMFC's 
recommendation must include supporting documentation, as appropriate, 
concerning the environmental and economic impacts of the recommendation. 
The Regional Administrator shall review the recommendation of the ASMFC 
and the MAFMC. After such review, NMFS will publish a proposed rule in 
the Federal Register to implement a revision in the state shares. After 
considering public comment, NMFS will publish a final rule in the 
Federal Register to implement the changes in allocation.
    (g) Research quota. See Sec. 648.21(g).

Sec. 648.163  Bluefish Accountability Measures (AMs).

    (a) ACL overage evaluation. The ACL will be evaluated based on a 
single-year examination of total catch (landings and dead discards). 
Both landings and dead discards will be evaluated in determining if the 
ACL has been exceeded.
    (b) Commercial sector EEZ closure. NMFS shall close the EEZ to 
fishing for bluefish by commercial vessels for the remainder of the 
calendar year by publishing notification in the Federal Register if the 
Regional Administrator determines that the inaction of one or more 
states will cause the ACL specified in Sec. 648.160(a) to be exceeded, 
or if the commercial fisheries in all states have been closed. NMFS may 
reopen the EEZ if earlier inaction by a state has been remedied by that 
state, or if commercial fisheries in one or more states have been 
reopened without causing the ACL to be exceeded.
    (c) State commercial landing quotas. The Regional Administrator will 
monitor state commercial quotas based on dealer reports and other 
available information and shall determine the date when a state 
commercial quota will be harvested. NMFS shall publish notification in 
the Federal Register advising a state that, effective upon a specific 
date, its commercial quota has been harvested and notifying vessel and 
dealer permit holders that no commercial quota is available for landing 
bluefish in that state.
    (1) Commercial landings overage repayment. All bluefish landed for 
sale in a state shall be applied against that state's annual commercial 
quota, regardless of where the bluefish were harvested. Any overages of 
the commercial quota landed in any state will be deducted from that 
state's annual quota for the following year, irrespective of whether the 
fishery-level ACL is exceeded. If a state has increased or reduced quota 
through the transfer process described in Sec. 648.162, then any 
overage will be measured against that state's final adjusted quota.
    (2) If there is a quota overage at the end of the fishing year among 
states involved in the combination of quotas, the overage will be 
deducted from the following year's quota for each of the states involved 
in the combined quota, irrespective of whether the fishery-level ACL is 
exceeded. The deduction will be proportional, based on each state's 
relative share of the combined quota for the previous year. A transfer 
of quota or combination of quotas does not alter any state's percentage 
share of the overall quota specified in Sec. 648.162(d)(1).
    (d) Recreational landings AM when the ACL is exceeded and no sector-
to-sector

[[Page 799]]

transfer of allowable landings has occurred. If the fishery-level ACL is 
exceeded and landings from the recreational fishery are determined to be 
the sole cause of the overage, and no transfer between the commercial 
and recreational sector was made for the fishing year, as outlined in 
Sec. 648.162(b)(2), then the exact amount, in pounds, by which the ACL 
was exceeded will be deducted, as soon as possible, from a subsequent 
single fishing year recreational ACT.
    (e) AM for when the ACL is exceeded and a sector-to-sector transfer 
of allowable landings has occurred. If the fishery-level ACL is exceeded 
and landings from the recreational fishery and/or the commercial fishery 
are determined to have caused the overage, and a transfer between the 
commercial and recreational sector has occurred for the fishing year, as 
outlined in Sec. 648.162(b)(2), then the amount transferred between the 
recreational and commercial sectors may be reduced by the ACL overage 
amount (pound-for-pound repayment) in a subsequent, single fishing year 
if the Bluefish Monitoring Committee determines that the ACL overage was 
the result of too liberal a landings transfer between the two sectors.
    (f) Non-landing AMs. In the event that the ACL has been exceeded and 
the overage has not been accommodated through the AM measures in 
paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, then the exact amount, in 
pounds, by which the ACL was exceeded shall be deducted, as soon as 
possible, from a subsequent, single fishing year ACL.
    (g) State/Federal disconnect AM. If the total catch, allowable 
landings, commercial quotas, and/or recreational harvest limit measures 
adopted by the ASMFC Bluefish Management Board and the MAFMC differ for 
a given fishing year, administrative action will be taken as soon as is 
practicable to revisit the respective recommendations of the two groups. 
The intent of this action shall be to achieve alignment through 
consistent state and Federal measures so no differential effects occur 
to Federal permit holders.

<R05>
Sec. 648.164  Bluefish possession restrictions.

    (a) No person shall possess more than 15 bluefish in, or harvested 
from, the EEZ unless that person is the owner or operator of a fishing 
vessel issued a bluefish commercial permit or is issued a bluefish 
dealer permit. Persons aboard a vessel that is not issued a bluefish 
commercial permit are subject to this possession limit. The owner, 
operator, and crew of a charter or party boat issued a bluefish 
commercial permit are not subject to the possession limit when not 
carrying passengers for hire and when the crew size does not exceed five 
for a party boat and three for a charter boat.
    (b) Bluefish harvested by vessels subject to the possession limit 
with more than one person on board may be pooled in one or more 
containers. Compliance with the daily possession limit will be 
determined by dividing the number of bluefish on board by the number of 
persons on board, other than the captain and the crew. If there is a 
violation of the possession limit on board a vessel carrying more than 
one person, the violation shall be deemed to have been committed by the 
owner and operator of the vessel.

objectives, such measures will be enacted through the procedure 
specified in Sec. 648.162(c) or 648.167.

measures, subject to the gear other than trawls and gillnets 
restrictions in Sec. 648.162 regarding specifications, will be enacted 
through the

<R05>
Sec. 648.167  Bluefish framework adjustment to management measures.

    (a) Within-season management action. The MAFMC may, at any time, 
initiate action to add or adjust management measures if it finds that 
action is necessary to meet or be consistent with the goals and 
objectives of the Bluefish FMP.
    (1) Adjustment process. After a management action has been 
initiated, the MAFMC shall develop and analyze appropriate management 
actions over the span of at least two MAFMC meetings. The MAFMC shall 
provide the public with advance notice of the availability of both the 
proposals and the analysis and the opportunity to comment on them prior 
to and at the second MAFMC meeting. The MAFMC's recommendation on 
adjustments or additions to management measures must come from one or 
more of the following categories: Adjustments within existing ABC 
control rule levels; adjustments to the existing MAFMC risk policy; 
introduction of new AMs, including sub-ACTs; minimum fish size; maximum 
fish size; gear restrictions; gear requirements or prohibitions; 
permitting restrictions; recreational possession limit; recreational 
season; closed areas; commercial season; description and identification 
of EFH; fishing gear management measures to protect EFH; designation of 
habitat areas of particular concern within EFH; and any other management 
measures currently included in the FMP. Measures that require 
significant departures from previously contemplated measures or that are 
otherwise introducing new concepts may require an amendment of the FMP 
instead of a framework adjustment.
    (2) MAFMC recommendation. After developing management actions and 
receiving public testimony, the MAFMC shall make a recommendation to the 
Regional Administrator. The MAFMC's recommendation must include 
supporting rationale and, if management measures are recommended, an 
analysis of impacts and a recommendation to the Regional Administrator 
on whether to issue the management measures as a final rule. If the 
MAFMC recommends that the management measures should be issued as a 
final rule, the MAFMC must consider at least the following factors and 
provide support and analysis for each factor considered:
    (i) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended 
management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a 
proposed rule, and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire 
harvest/fishing season;
    (ii) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for 
participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the 
development of the MAFMC's recommended management measures;
    (iii) Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource; 
and
    (iv) Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management 
measures adopted following their implementation as a final rule.
    (3) Action by NMFS. If the MAFMC's recommendation includes 
adjustments or additions to management measures and, after reviewing the 
MAFMC's recommendation and supporting information:
    (i) If NMFS concurs with the MAFMC's recommended management measures 
and determines that the recommended management measures should be issued 
as a final rule based on the factors specified in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section, the measures will be issued as a final rule in the Federal 
Register.
    (ii) If NMFS concurs with the MAFMC's recommendation and determines 
that the recommended management measures should be published first as a 
proposed rule, the measures will be published as a proposed rule in the 
Federal Register. After additional public comment, if NMFS concurs with 
the MAFMC's recommendation, the measures will be issued as a final rule 
in the Federal Register.
    (iii) If NMFS does not concur, the MAFMC will be notified in writing 
of the reasons for the non-concurrence.
    (b) Emergency action. Nothing in this section is meant to derogate 
from the authority of the Secretary to take

[[Page 801]]

emergency action under section 305(e) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.

    Source: 72 FR 11277, Mar. 12, 2007, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 648.200  Specifications.

    (a) The Atlantic Herring Plan Development Team (PDT) shall meet at 
least every 3 years, but no later than July of the year before new 
specifications are implemented, with the Atlantic States Marine 
Fisheries Commission's (Commission) Atlantic Herring Plan Review Team 
(PRT) to develop and recommend the following specifications for a period 
of 3 years for consideration by the New England Fishery Management 
Council's Atlantic Herring Oversight Committee: Overfishing Limit (OFL), 
Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC), Annual Catch Limit (ACL), Optimum 
yield (OY), domestic annual harvest (DAH), domestic annual processing 
(DAP), U.S. at-sea processing (USAP), border transfer (BT), the sub-ACL 
for each management area, including seasonal periods as specified at 
Sec. 648.201(d) and modifications to sub-ACLs as specified at Sec. 
648.201(f), and the amount to be set aside for the RSA (from 0 to 3 
percent of the sub-ACL from any management area). Recommended 
specifications shall be presented to the New England Fishery Management 
Council (Council).
    (1) The PDT shall meet with the Commission's PRT to review the 
status of the stock and the fishery and prepare a Stock Assessment and 
Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) report at least every 3 years. The Herring PDT 
will meet at least once during interim years to review the status of the 
stock relative to the overfishing definition if information is available 
to do so. When conducting a 3-year review and preparing a SAFE Report, 
the PDT/PRT will recommend to the Council/Commission any necessary 
adjustments to the specifications for the upcoming 3 years.
    (2) If the Council determines, based on information provided by the 
PDT/PRT or other stock-related information, that the specifications 
should be adjusted during the 3-year time period, it can do so through 
the same process outlined in this section during one or both of the 
interim years.
    (b) Guidelines. As the basis for its recommendations under paragraph 
(a) of this section, the PDT shall review available data pertaining to: 
Commercial and recreational catch data; current estimates of fishing 
mortality; stock status; recent estimates of recruitment; virtual 
population analysis results and other estimates of stock size; sea 
sampling and trawl survey data or, if sea sampling data are unavailable, 
length frequency information from trawl surveys; impact of other 
fisheries on herring mortality; and any other relevant information. The 
specifications recommended pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section 
must be consistent with the following:
    (1) OFL must be equal to catch resulting from applying the maximum 
fishing mortality threshold to a current or projected estimate of stock 
size. When the stock is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring, 
this is usually the fishing rate supporting maximum sustainable yield 
(F<INF>MSY</INF>). Catch that exceeds this amount would result in 
overfishing.
    (2) ABC must be equal to or less than the OFL. The Council's 
Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) shall recommend ABC to the 
Council. Scientific uncertainty, including, but not limited to, 
uncertainty around stock size estimates, variability around estimates of 
recruitment, and consideration of ecosystem issues, shall be considered 
when setting ABC. If the stock is not overfished and overfishing is not 
occurring, then ABC may be based on F<INF>MSY</INF> or its proxy, recent 
catch, or any other factor the SSC determines appropriate. If the stock 
is overfished, then ABC may be based on the rebuilding fishing mortality 
rate for the stock (F<INF>REB</INF>), or any other factor the SSC 
determines appropriate.
    (3) ACL must be equal to or less than the ABC. Management 
uncertainty, which includes, but is not limited to, expected catch of 
herring in the New

[[Page 802]]

Brunswick weir fishery and the uncertainty around discard estimates of 
herring caught in Federal and state waters, shall be considered when 
setting the ACL. Catch in excess of the ACL shall trigger accountability 
measures (AMs), as described at Sec. 648.201(a).
    (4) OY may not exceed OFL (i.e., MSY) and must take into account the 
need to prevent overfishing while allowing the fishery to achieve OY on 
a continuing basis. OY is prescribed on the basis of MSY, as reduced by 
social, economic, and ecological factors. OY may equal DAH.
    (5) DAH is comprised of DAP and BT.
    (c) The Atlantic Herring Oversight Committee shall review the 
recommendations of the PDT and shall consult with the Commission's 
Herring Section. Based on these recommendations and any public comment 
received, the Herring Oversight Committee shall recommend to the Council 
appropriate specifications for a 3-year period. The Council shall review 
these recommendations and, after considering public comment, shall 
recommend appropriate 3-year specifications to NMFS. NMFS shall review 
the recommendations, consider any comments received from the Commission, 
and publish notification in the Federal Register proposing 3-year 
specifications. If the proposed specifications differ from those 
recommended by the Council, the reasons for any differences shall be 
clearly stated and the revised specifications must satisfy the criteria 
set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) NMFS shall make a final determination concerning the 
specifications for Atlantic herring. Notification of the final 
specifications and responses to public comments shall be published in 
the Federal Register. If the final specification amounts differ from 
those recommended by the Council, the reason(s) for the difference(s) 
must be clearly stated and the revised specifications must be consistent 
with the criteria set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. The 
previous year's specifications shall remain effective until they are 
revised through the specification process.
    (e) In-season adjustments. The specifications and sub-ACLs 
established pursuant to this section may be adjusted by NMFS to achieve 
conservation and management objectives, after consulting with the 
Council, during the fishing year in accordance with the Administrative 
Procedure Act (APA). Any adjustments must be consistent with the 
Atlantic Herring FMP objectives and other FMP provisions.
    (f) Management areas. The specifications process establishes sub-
ACLs and other management measures for the three management areas, which 
may have different management measures. Management Area 1 is subdivided 
into inshore and offshore sub-areas. The management areas are defined as 
follows:
    (1) Management Area 1 (Gulf of Maine): All U.S. waters of the Gulf 
of Maine (GOM) north of a line extending from a point at 70[deg]00[min] 
W. long. and 41[deg]39[min] N. to 42[deg]53[min]14[sec] N. lat., 67[deg] 
44[min]35[sec] W. long., thence northerly along the Hague Line to the 
U.S.-Canadian border, to include state and Federal waters adjacent to 
the States of Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts. Management Area 1 
is divided into Area 1A (inshore) and Area 1B (offshore). The line 
dividing these areas is described by the following coordinates:

<R05>
Sec. 648.201  AMs and harvest controls.

    (a) AMs. (1) Management area closure. If NMFS projects that catch 
will reach 95 percent of the annual sub-ACL allocated to a management 
area before the end of the fishing year, or 95 percent of the Area 1A 
sub-ACL allocated to the first seasonal period as set forth in paragraph 
(d) of this section, NMFS shall prohibit vessels, beginning the date the 
catch is projected to reach 95 percent of the sub-ACL, from fishing for, 
possessing, catching, transferring, or landing <ls-thn-eq>2,000 lb 
(907.2 kg) of Atlantic herring per trip in such an area, and from 
landing herring more than once per calendar day, except as provided in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. NMFS shall implement these 
restrictions in accordance with the APA.
    (2) If NMFS determines that the GOM and/or GB incidental catch cap 
for haddock in Sec. 648.85(d) has been caught, a vessel issued a 
Federal Atlantic herring permit and fishing with midwater trawl gear in 
Management Areas 1A, 1B, and/or 3, as defined at Sec. 648.200(f)(1) and 
(3), may not fish for, possess, or land herring in excess of 2,000 lb 
(907.2 kg) per trip in or from the applicable AM Area, unless all 
herring possessed and landed by a vessel were caught outside the 
applicable AM Area and the vessel complies with the gear stowage 
provisions specified in Sec. 648.23(b) while transiting the applicable 
AM Area. Upon determination that a haddock incidental catch cap has been 
reached, the haddock possession limit shall be reduced to 0 lb (0 kg) 
for any vessel issued an All Areas Limited Access Herring Permit and/or 
an Areas 2 and 3 Limited Access Herring Permit fishing on a declared 
herring trip, regardless of area fished or gear used, or a vessel issued 
a Limited Access Incidental Catch Herring Permit and/or an Open Access 
Herring Permit and fishing with midwater trawl gear pursuant to Sec. 
648.80(d), unless the vessel also possesses a Northeast multispecies 
permit and is operating on a declared (consistent with Sec. 648.10(g)) 
Northeast multispecies trip.
    (3) ACL overage deduction. If NMFS determines that total catch 
exceeded any ACL or sub-ACL for a fishing year, then the amount of the 
overage shall be subtracted from that ACL or sub-ACL for the fishing 
year following total catch determination. NMFS shall make such 
determinations and implement any changes to ACLs or sub-ACLs, in 
accordance with the APA, through notification in the Federal Register, 
prior to the start of the fishing year, if possible, during which the 
reduction would occur.
    (b) A vessel may transit an area that is limited to the 2,000-lb 
(907.2-kg) limit specified in paragraph (a) of this section with 
<ls-thn-eq> 2,000 lb (907.2 kg) of herring on board, provided such 
herring were caught in an area or areas not subject to the 2,000-lb 
(907.2-kg) limit specified in paragraph (a) of this section, and that 
all fishing gear is stowed and not available for immediate use as 
required by Sec. 648.23(b), and provided the vessel is issued a vessel 
permit appropriate to the amount of herring on board and the area where 
the herring was harvested.
    (c) A vessel may land in an area that is limited to the 2,000-lb 
(907.2-kg) limit specified in paragraph (a) of this section with 
<ls-thn-eq>2,000 lb (907.2 kg) of herring on board, provided such 
herring were caught in an area or areas not subject to the 2,000-lb 
(907.2-kg) limit specified in paragraph (a) of this section, and that 
all fishing gear is stowed and not available for immediate use as 
required by Sec. 648.23(b), and provided the vessel is issued a vessel 
permit appropriate to the amount of herring on board and the area where 
the herring was harvested.
    (d) The sub-ACL for Management Area 1A is divided into two seasonal 
periods. The first season extends from January 1 through May 31, and the 
second season extends from June 1 through December 31. Seasonal sub-ACLs 
for Area 1A, including the specification of the seasonal periods, shall 
be set through the annual specification process described in Sec. 
648.200.
    (e) Up to 500 mt of the Area 1A sub-ACL shall be allocated for the 
fixed gear fisheries in Area 1A (weirs and stop seines) that occur west 
of 44[deg] 36.2 N. Lat. and 67[deg] 16.8 W. long (Cutler,

[[Page 804]]

Maine). This set-aside shall be available for harvest by fixed gear 
within the specified area until November 1 of each fishing year. Any 
portion of this allocation that has not been utilized by November 1 
shall be restored to the sub-ACL allocation for Area 1A.
    (f) If NMFS determines that the New Brunswick weir fishery landed 
less than 9,000 mt through October 15, NMFS shall allocate an additional 
3,000 mt to the Area 1A sub-ACL in November, in accordance with the APA.

<R05>
Sec. 648.204  Possession restrictions.

    (a) A vessel must be issued and possess a valid limited access 
herring permit to fish for, possess, or land more than 6,600 lb (3 mt) 
of Atlantic herring from any herring management area in the EEZ, 
provided that the area has not been closed due to the attainment of 95 
percent of the sub-ACL allocated to the area, as specified in Sec. 
648.201.
    (1) A vessel issued an All Areas Limited Access Herring Permit may 
fish for, possess, or land Atlantic herring with no possession 
restriction from any of the herring management areas defined in Sec. 
648.200(f), provided that the area has not been closed due to the 
attainment of 95 percent of the sub-ACL allocated to the area, as 
specified in Sec. 648.201.
    (2) A vessel issued only an Areas 2 and 3 Limited Access Herring 
Permit may fish for, possess, or land Atlantic herring with no 
possession restriction only from Area 2 or Area 3 as defined in Sec. 
648.200(f), provided that the area has not been closed due to the 
attainment of 95 percent of the sub-ACL allocated to the area, as 
specified in Sec. 648.201. Such a vessel may fish in Area 1 only if 
issued an open access herring permit or a Limited Access Incidental 
Catch Herring Permit, and only as authorized by the respective permit.
    (3) A vessel issued a Limited Access Incidental Catch Herring Permit 
may fish for, possess, or land up to 55,000 lb (25 mt) of Atlantic 
herring in any calendar day, and is limited to one landing of herring 
per calendar day, from any management area defined in Sec. 648.200(f), 
provided that the area has not been closed due to the attainment of 95 
percent of the sub-ACL allocated to the area.
    (4) A vessel issued an open access herring permit may fish for, 
possess, or land up to 6,600 lb (3 mt) of Atlantic herring from any 
herring management area per trip, and is limited to one landing of 
herring per calendar day, provided that the area has not been closed due 
to the attainment of 95 percent of the sub-ACL allocated to the area, as 
specified in Sec. 648.201.
    (5) A vessel issued a herring permit may possess herring roe 
provided that the carcasses of the herring from which it came are not 
discarded at sea.
    (b) Both vessels involved in a pair trawl operation must be issued 
valid herring permits to fish for, possess, or land Atlantic herring 
harvested from any management area. Both vessels

<R05>
Sec. 648.205  VMS requirements.

    The owner or operator of any limited access herring vessel with the 
exception of fixed gear fishermen must install and operate a VMS unit 
consistent with the requirements of Sec. 648.9. The VMS unit must be 
installed on board, and must be operable before the vessel may begin 
fishing. Atlantic herring carrier vessels are not required to have VMS. 
At least 1 hr prior to leaving port, the owner or authorized 
representative of a herring vessel that is required to use VMS as 
specified in this section must notify the Regional Administrator by 
entering the appropriate VMS code that the vessel will be participating 
in the herring fishery. VMS codes and instructions are available from 
the Regional Administrator upon request.


<R05>
Sec. 648.206  Framework provisions.

    (a) Framework adjustment process. In response to the triennial 
review, or at any other time, the Council may initiate action to add or 
adjust management measures if it finds that action is necessary to meet 
or be consistent with the goals and objectives of the Atlantic Herring 
FMP, or to address gear conflicts as defined under Sec. 600.10 of this 
chapter.
    (1) Adjustment process. After a management action has been 
initiated, the Council shall develop and analyze appropriate management 
measures over the span of at least two Council meetings. The Council may 
delegate authority to the Herring Oversight Committee to conduct an 
initial review of the options being considered. The Oversight Committee 
shall review the options and relevant information, consider public 
comment, and make a recommendation to the Council.
    (2) After the first framework meeting, the Council may refer the 
issue back to the Herring Oversight Committee for further consideration, 
make adjustments to the measures that were proposed, or approve of the 
measures and begin developing the necessary documents to support the 
framework adjustments. If the Council approves the proposed framework 
adjustments, the Council shall identify, at this meeting, a preferred 
alternative and/or identify the possible alternatives.
    (3) A framework document shall be prepared that discusses and shows 
the impacts of the alternatives. It shall be available to the public 
prior to the second or final framework meeting.
    (4) After developing management actions and receiving public 
testimony, the Council shall make a recommendation to NMFS. The 
Council's recommendation must include supporting rationale and, if 
changes to the management measures are recommended, an analysis of 
impacts and a recommendation to NMFS on whether to issue the management 
measures as a final rule. If the Council recommends that the management 
measures should be issued as a final rule, the Council must consider at 
least the following factors and provide support and analysis for each 
factor considered:
    (i) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended 
management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a 
proposed rule, and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire 
harvest/fishing season.
    (ii) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for 
participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the 
development of the Council's recommended management measures.
    (iii) Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource or 
to impose management measures to resolve gear conflicts.
    (iv) Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management 
measures adopted following their implementation as a final rule.
    (5) If the Council's recommendation to NMFS includes adjustments or 
additions to management measures, after reviewing the Council's 
recommendation and supporting information NMFS may:
    (i) Concur with the Council's recommended management measures and

[[Page 806]]

determine that the recommended management measures should be published 
as a final rule in the Federal Register based on the factors specified 
in paragraphs (c)(4)(i)-(iv) of this section.
    (ii) Concur with the Council's recommendation and determine that the 
recommended management measures should be first published as a proposed 
rule in the Federal Register. After additional public comment, if NMFS 
concurs with the Council's recommendation, the measures shall be issued 
as a final rule in the Federal Register.
    (iii) If NMFS does not concur, the Council shall be notified in 
writing of the reasons for the non-concurrence.
    (b) Possible framework adjustment measures. Measures that may be 
changed or implemented through framework action include:
    (1) Management area boundaries or additional management areas;
    (2) Size, timing, or location of new or existing spawning area 
closures;
    (3) Closed areas other than spawning closures;
    (4) Restrictions in the amount of fishing time;
    (5) A days-at-sea system;
    (6) Adjustments to specifications;
    (7) Adjustments to the Canadian catch deducted when determining 
specifications;
    (8) Distribution of the ACL;
    (9) Gear restrictions (such as mesh size, etc.) or requirements 
(such as bycatch-reduction devices, etc.);
    (10) Vessel size or horsepower restrictions;
    (11) Closed seasons;
    (12) Minimum fish size;
    (13) Trip limits;
    (14) Seasonal, area, or industry sector quotas;
    (15) Measures to describe and identify essential fish habitat (EFH), 
fishing gear management measures to protect EFH, and designation of 
habitat areas of particular concern within EFH;
    (16) Measures to facilitate aquaculture, such as minimum fish sizes, 
gear restrictions, minimum mesh sizes, possession limits, tagging 
requirements, monitoring requirements, reporting requirements, permit 
restrictions, area closures, establishment of special management areas 
or zones, and any other measures included in the FMP;
    (17) Changes to the overfishing definition;
    (18) Vessel monitoring system requirements;
    (19) Limits or restrictions on the harvest of herring for specific 
uses;
    (20) Quota monitoring tools, such as vessel, operator, or dealer 
reporting requirements;
    (21) Permit and vessel upgrading restrictions;
    (22) Implementation of measures to reduce gear conflicts, such as 
mandatory monitoring of a radio channel by fishing vessels, gear 
location reporting by fixed gear fishermen, mandatory plotting of gear 
by mobile fishermen, standards of operation when conflict occurs, fixed 
gear marking or setting practices; gear restrictions for certain areas, 
vessel monitoring systems, restrictions on the maximum number of fishing 
vessels, and special permitting conditions;
    (23) Limited entry or controlled access system;
    (24) Specification of the amount of herring to be used for roe
    (25) In-season adjustments to ACLs;
    (26) Measures to address bycatch and bycatch monitoring;
    (27) Requirements for a herring processor survey;
    (28) ACL set-aside amounts, provisions, adjustments;
    (29) [Reserved]
    (30) AMs; and
    (31) Any other measure currently included in the FMP.
    (c) Emergency action. Nothing in this section is meant to derogate 
from the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under 
section 305(e) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.

<R05>
Sec. 648.207  Herring Research Set-Aside (RSA).

    (a) NMFS shall publish a Request for Proposals (RFP) in the Federal 
Register, consistent with procedures and requirements established by 
NMFS, to solicit proposals from industry for the

[[Page 807]]

upcoming 3 fishing years, based on research priorities identified by the 
Council.
    (b) Proposals submitted in response to the RFP must include the 
following information, as well as any other specific information 
required within the RFP: A project summary that includes the project 
goals and objectives, the relationship of the proposed research to 
herring research priorities and/or management needs, project design, 
participants other than the applicant, funding needs, breakdown of 
costs, and the vessel(s) for which authorization is requested to conduct 
research activities.
    (c) NMFS shall convene a review panel, including technical experts, 
to review proposals submitted in response to the RFP. Each panel member 
shall recommend which research proposals should be authorized to utilize 
RSA, based on the selection criteria described in the RFP.
    (d) NMFS shall consider each panel member's recommendation, provide 
final approval of the projects and the Regional Administrator may, when 
appropriate, exempt selected vessel(s) from regulations specified in 
each of the respective FMPs through written notification to the project 
proponent.
    (e) The grant awards approved under the RFPs shall be for the 
upcoming 3 fishing years, unless the Council identifies new/different 
research priorities during the interim years and decides to publish a 
second RFP. Proposals to fund research that would start prior to, or 
that would end after the fishing year, are not eligible for 
consideration. The RSA must be utilized in the same fishing year in 
which it was distributed (i.e., RSA and compensation trips cannot be 
rolled over into future years). However, the money generated from the 
RSA may be rolled over into, or used to fund research in future years, 
consistent with the multi-year proposal.
    (f) Whenever possible, research proposals shall be reviewed and 
approved prior to the publication of final quota specifications for the 
upcoming fishing years. In the event that the approved proposals do not 
make use of any or all of the set-asides, the unutilized portion of the 
set-aside shall be reallocated back to its respective management area(s) 
when the final specifications are published. If there is unutilized set-
aside available, NMFS, at the request of the Council, could publish 
another RFP for either the second or third years of the 3-year 
specifications. In this case, NMFS shall release the unutilized portion 
of the RSA back to its respective management area(s) for the first year 
of the specifications and any other year that yields unutilized set-
aside after an additional RFP is published. The Council also may decide 
not to publish another RFP, in which case NMFS may release the 
unutilized portion of the set-aside back to its respective management 
area(s) for all 3 fishing years covered by the specifications.
    (g) If a proposal is approved, but a final award is not made by 
NMFS, or if NMFS determines that the allocated RSA cannot be utilized by 
a project, NMFS shall reallocate the unallocated or unused amount of the 
RSA to the respective sub-ACL, in accordance with the APA, provided that 
the RSA can be available for harvest before the end of the fishing year 
for which the RSA is specified.
    (h) Any RSA reallocated under paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section 
may not be used solely as compensation for research.
    (i) Researchers may apply for the use of more than one herring RAS 
allocation for individual research projects, and may request that the 
set-aside be collected separately from the research trip or as part of 
the research trip. The research compensation trips do not necessarily 
have to be conducted by the same vessel, but must be conducted in the 
management area from which the set-aside was derived.
    (j) No more than 50 percent of the allocated set-aside may be taken 
before the research begins. If a research project is terminated for any 
reason prior to completion, any funds collected from the catch sold to 
pay for research expenses must be refunded to U.S. Treasury.
    (k) NMFS shall provide authorization of the research activities to 
specific vessels by letter of acknowledgement, letter of authorization, 
or Exempted Fishing Permit issued by the Regional

[[Page 808]]

Administrator, which must be kept on board the vessel.
    (l) Upon completion of herring research projects approved under this 
part, researchers must provide the Council and NMFS with a report of 
research findings, which must include: A detailed description of methods 
of data collection and analysis; a discussion of results and any 
relevant conclusions presented in a format that is understandable to a 
non-technical audience; and a detailed final accounting of all funds 
used to conduct the herring research.

       Subpart L_Management Measures for the Spiny Dogfish Fishery

    Source: 65 FR 1570, Jan. 11, 2000, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 648.230  Spiny dogfish Annual Catch Limits (ACLs).

    (a) The Spiny Dogfish Monitoring Committee shall recommend to the 
Joint Spiny Dogfish Committee, an ACL for the commercial spiny dogfish 
fishery, which shall equal to the domestic ABC (i.e., the ABC minus 
Canadian catch) recommended by the SSC as specified in Sec. 648.20.
    (1) Periodicity. The spiny dogfish ACL may be established on an 
annual basis for up to 5 years at a time, dependent on whether the SSC 
provides single or multiple-year ABC recommendations.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (b) Performance review. The Spiny Dogfish Monitoring Committee shall 
conduct a detailed review of fishery performance relative to the ACL at 
least every 5 years.
    (1) If an ACL is exceeded with a frequency greater than 25 percent 
(i.e., more than once in 4 years or any 2 consecutive years), the Spiny 
Dogfish Monitoring Committee will review fishery performance information 
and make recommendations to the Councils for changes in measures 
intended to ensure ACLs are not exceeded as frequently.
    (2) The Councils may specify more frequent or more specific ACL 
performance review criteria as part of a stock rebuilding plan following

Sec. 648.231  Spiny dogfish Annual Catch Target (ACT) and Total 
Allowable Level of Landings (TAL).

    (a) The Spiny Dogfish Monitoring Committee shall identify and review 
the relevant sources of management uncertainty to recommend an ACT and a 
TAL for the fishery as part of the spiny dogfish specification process 
specified in Sec. 648.232. The Spiny Dogfish Monitoring Committee 
recommendations shall identify the specific sources of management 
uncertainty that were considered, technical approaches to mitigating 
these sources of uncertainty, domestic commercial and recreational 
discards, and any additional relevant information considered in the ACT 
and TAL recommendation process.
    (1) The ACT shall be identified as less than or equal to the ACL.
    (2) The Spiny Dogfish Monitoring Committee shall recommend a TAL to 
the Joint Spiny Dogfish Committee, which accounts for domestic 
commercial and recreational discards (ACT minus domestic dead discards). 
The TAL is equivalent to the annual coastwide commercial quota.
    (b) Periodicity. The TAL may be established on an annual basis for 
up to 5 years at a time, dependent on whether the SSC provides single or 
multiple year ABC recommendations.
    (c) Performance review. The Spiny Dogfish Monitoring Committee shall 
conduct a detailed review of fishery performance relative to TALs in 
conjunction with any ACL performance review, as outlined in Sec. 
648.230(b).

Dogfish

[[Page 809]]

Monitoring Committee shall recommend to the Joint Spiny Dogfish 
Committee a TAL (i.e., annual coastwide commercial quota) and any other 
measures, including those in paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this 
section, that are necessary to ensure that the commercial ACL will not 
be exceeded in any fishing year (May 1-April 30), for a period of 1-5 
fishing years. The measures that may be recommended include, but are not 
limited to:
    (1) Minimum or maximum fish sizes;
    (2) Seasons;
    (3) Mesh size restrictions;
    (4) Trip limits;
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6) Other gear restrictions; and
    (7) Changes to AMs and ACT control rules.
    (b) Joint Spiny Dogfish Committee recommendation. The Councils' 
Joint Spiny Dogfish Committee shall review the recommendations of the 
Spiny Dogfish Monitoring Committee. Based on these recommendations and 
any public comments, the Joint Spiny Dogfish Committee shall recommend 
to the Councils a TAL, and possibly other measures, including those 
specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section, necessary to 
ensure that the ACL specified in Sec. 648.230 will not be exceeded in 
any fishing year (May 1-April 30), for a period of 1-5 fishing years.
    (c) Council recommendations. (1) The Councils shall review these 
recommendations and, based on the recommendations and any public 
comments, recommend to the Regional Administrator a TAL and other 
measures necessary to ensure that the ACL specified in Sec. 648.230 
will not be exceeded in any fishing year, for a period of 1-5 fishing 
years. The Councils' recommendations must include supporting 
documentation, as appropriate, concerning the environmental, economic, 
and other impacts of the recommendations. The Regional Administrator 
shall initiate a review of these recommendations and may modify the 
recommended quota and other management measures to ensure that the ACL 
specified in Sec. 648.230 will not be exceeded in any fishing year, for 
a period of 1-5 fishing years. The Regional Administrator may modify the 
Councils' recommendations using any of the measures that were not 
rejected by both Councils.
    (2) After such review, NMFS shall publish a proposed rule in the 
Federal Register specifying a TAL, adjustments to ACL, ACT, and TAL 
resulting from the accountability measures specified in Sec. 648.233, 
and other measures necessary to ensure that the ACL will not be exceeded 
in any fishing year, for a period of 1-5 fishing years. After 
considering public comments, NMFS shall publish a final rule in the 
Federal Register to implement the TAL and other measures.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) Distribution of annual quota. (1) The TAL (i.e., annual 
coastwide commercial quota) specified according to the process outlined 
section Sec. 648.231 shall be allocated between two semi-annual quota 
periods as follows: May 1 through October 31 (57.9 percent); and 
November 1 through April 30 (42.1 percent).
    (2) All spiny dogfish landed for a commercial purpose in the states 
from Maine through Florida shall be applied against the applicable semi-
annual commercial quota, regardless of where the spiny dogfish were 
harvested.

Sec. 648.233  Spiny dogfish Accountability Measures (AMs).

    (a) Commercial EEZ closure. The Regional Administrator shall 
determine the date by which the quota for each semi-annual period 
described in Sec. 648.232(e)(1) will be harvested and shall close the 
EEZ to fishing for spiny dogfish on that date for the remainder of that 
semi-annual period by publishing notification in the Federal Register. 
Upon the closure date, and for the remainder of the semi-annual quota 
period, no vessel may fish for or possess spiny dogfish in the EEZ, nor 
may vessels issued a spiny dogfish permit under this part land spiny 
dogfish, nor may dealers issued a Federal permit purchase spiny dogfish 
from vessels issued a spiny dogfish permit under this part.
    (b) ACL overage evaluation. The ACL will be evaluated based on a 
single-

[[Page 810]]

year examination of total catch (including both landings and dead 
discards) to determine if the ACL has been exceeded.
    (c) Overage repayment. In the event that the ACL has been exceeded 
in a given fishing year, the exact amount in pounds by which the ACL was 
exceeded shall be deducted, as soon as possible from a subsequent single 
fishing year ACL.

Sec. 648.239  Spiny dogfish framework adjustments to management measures.

    (a) Within season management action. The Councils may, at any time, 
initiate action to add or adjust management measures if they find that 
action is necessary to meet or be consistent with the goals and 
objectives of the Spiny Dogfish FMP.
    (1) Adjustment process. After the Councils initiate a management 
action, they shall develop and analyze appropriate management actions 
over the span of at least two Council meetings. The Councils shall 
provide the public with advance notice of the availability of both the 
proposals and the analysis for comment prior to, and at, the second 
Council meeting. The Councils' recommendation on adjustments or 
additions to management measures must come from one or more of the 
following categories: Adjustments within existing ABC control rule 
levels; adjustments to the existing MAFMC risk policy; introduction of 
new AMs, including sub-ACTs; minimum fish size; maximum fish size; gear 
requirements, restrictions, or prohibitions (including, but not limited 
to, mesh size restrictions and net limits); regional gear restrictions; 
permitting restrictions, and reporting requirements; recreational 
fishery measures (including possession and size limits and season and 
area restrictions); commercial season and area restrictions; commercial 
trip or possession limits; fin weight to spiny dogfish landing weight 
restrictions; onboard observer requirements; commercial quota system 
(including commercial quota allocation procedures and possible quota 
set-asides to mitigate bycatch, conduct scientific research, or for 
other purposes); recreational harvest limit; annual quota specification 
process; FMP Monitoring Committee composition and process; description 
and identification of essential fish habitat; description and 
identification of habitat areas of particular concern; overfishing 
definition and related thresholds and targets; regional season 
restrictions (including option to split seasons); restrictions on vessel 
size (length and GRT) or shaft horsepower; target quotas; measures to 
mitigate marine mammal entanglements and interactions; regional 
management; any other management measures currently included in the 
Spiny Dogfish FMP; and measures to regulate aquaculture projects. 
Measures that require significant departures from previously 
contemplated measures or that are otherwise introducing new concepts may 
require an amendment of the FMP instead of a framework adjustment.
    (2) Councils' recommendation. After developing management actions 
and receiving public testimony, the Councils shall make a recommendation 
approved by a majority of each Council's

[[Page 811]]

members, present and voting, to the Regional Administrator. The 
Councils' recommendation must include supporting rationale, an analysis 
of impacts and, if management measures are recommended, a recommendation 
to the Regional Administrator on whether to issue the management 
measures as a final rule. If the Councils recommend that the management 
measures should be issued as a final rule, they must consider at least 
the following factors and provide support and analysis for each factor 
considered:
    (i) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended 
management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a 
proposed rule and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire 
harvest/fishing season;
    (ii) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for 
participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the 
development of the Councils' recommended management measures;
    (iii) Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource; 
and
    (iv) Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management 
measures adopted following their implementation as a final rule;
    (3) NMFS action. If the Councils' recommendation includes 
adjustments or additions to management measures, then:
    (i) If NMFS concurs with the Councils' recommended management 
measures and determines that the recommended management measures should 
be issued as a final rule based on the factors specified in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, then the measures will be issued as a final rule 
in the Federal Register.
    (ii) If NMFS concurs with the Councils' recommendation and 
determines that the recommended management measures should be published 
first as a proposed rule, then the measures will be published as a 
proposed rule in the Federal Register. After additional public comment, 
if NMFS concurs with the Councils' recommendation, then the measures 
will be issued as a final rule in the Federal Register.
    (iii) If NMFS does not concur, the Councils will be notified in 
writing of the reasons for the non-concurrence.
    (iv) Framework actions can be taken only in the case where both 
Councils approve the proposed measure.
    (b) Emergency action. Nothing in this section is meant to derogate 
from the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under 
section 305(e) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.

Sec. 648.260  Specifications.

    (a) Annual review and specifications process. The Council, the Red 
Crab Plan Development Team (PDT), and the Red Crab Advisory Panel shall 
monitor the status of the red crab fishery and resource.
    (1) The Red Crab PDT shall meet at least once annually during the 
intervening years between Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) 
Reports, described in paragraph (b) of this section, to review the 
status of the stock and the fishery. Based on such review, the PDT shall 
provide a report to the Council on any changes or new information about 
the red crab stock and/or fishery, and it shall recommend whether the 
specifications for the upcoming year(s) need to be modified. At a 
minimum, this review shall include a review of at least the following 
data, if available: Commercial catch data; current estimates of fishing 
mortality and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE); stock status; recent 
estimates of recruitment; virtual population analysis results and other 
estimates of stock size; sea sampling, port sampling, and survey data 
or, if sea sampling data are unavailable, length frequency information 
from port sampling and/or surveys; impact of other fisheries on the 
mortality of red crabs; and any other relevant information.
    (2) If new and/or additional information becomes available, the Red 
Crab

[[Page 812]]

PDT shall consider it during this annual review. Based on this review, 
the Red Crab PDT shall provide guidance to the Red Crab Committee and 
the Council regarding the need to adjust measures in the Red Crab FMP to 
better achieve the FMP's objectives. After considering guidance, the 
Council may submit to NMFS its recommendations for changes to management 
measures, as appropriate, through the specifications process described 
in this section, the framework process specified in Sec. 648.261, or 
through an amendment to the FMP.
    (3) Based on the annual review, described above, and/or the SAFE 
Report described in paragraph (b) of this section, recommendations for 
acceptable biological catch (ABC) from the Scientific and Statistical 
Committee (SSC), and any other relevant information, the Red Crab PDT 
shall recommend to the Red Crab Committee and Council the following 
specifications for harvest of red crab: an annual catch limit (ACL) set 
less than or equal to ABC; and total allowable landings (TAL) necessary 
to meet the objectives of the FMP in each red crab fishing year, 
specified for a period of up to 3 fishing years.
    (4) The PDT, after its review of the available information on the 
status of the stock and the fishery, may recommend to the Council any 
measures necessary to assure that the specifications will not be 
exceeded, as well as changes to the appropriate specifications.
    (5) Taking into account the annual review and/or SAFE Report 
described in paragraph (b) of this section, the advice of the SSC, and 
any other relevant information, the Red Crab PDT may also recommend to 
the Red Crab Committee and Council changes to stock status determination 
criteria and associated thresholds based on the best scientific 
information available, including information from peer-reviewed stock 
assessments of red crab. These adjustments may be included in the 
Council's specifications for the red crab fishery.
    (6) Council recommendation--(i) The Council shall review the 
recommendations of the Red Crab PDT, Red Crab Committee, and SSC, any 
public comment received thereon, and any other relevant information, and 
make a recommendation to the Regional Administrator on appropriate 
specifications and any measures necessary to assure that the 
specifications will not be exceeded.
    (ii) The Council's recommendation must include supporting 
documentation, as appropriate, concerning the environmental, economic, 
and social impacts of the recommendations. The Regional Administrator 
shall consider the recommendations and publish a rule in the Federal 
Register proposing specifications and associated measures, consistent 
with the Administrative Procedure Act.
    (iii) The Regional Administrator may propose specifications 
different than those recommended by the Council. If the specifications 
published in the Federal Register differ from those recommended by the 
Council, the reasons for any differences must be clearly stated and the 
revised specifications must satisfy the criteria set forth in this 
section, the FMP, and other applicable laws.
    (iv) If the final specifications are not published in the Federal 
Register for the start of the fishing year, the previous year's 
specifications shall remain in effect until superseded by the final rule 
implementing the current year's specifications, to ensure that there is 
no lapse in regulations while new specifications are completed.
    (b) SAFE Report. (1) The Red Crab PDT shall prepare a SAFE Report at 
least every 3 yr. Based on the SAFE Report, the Red Crab PDT shall 
develop and present to the Council recommended specifications as defined 
in paragraph (a) of this section for up to 3 fishing years. The SAFE 
Report shall be the primary vehicle for the presentation of all updated 
biological and socio-economic information regarding the red crab 
fishery. The SAFE Report shall provide source data for any adjustments 
to the management measures that may be needed to continue to meet the 
goals and objectives of the FMP.
    (2) In any year in which a SAFE Report is not completed by the Red 
Crab PDT, the annual review process described in paragraph (a) of this 
section

[[Page 813]]

shall be used to recommend any necessary adjustments to specifications 
and/or management measures in the FMP.

Sec. 648.261  Framework adjustment process.

    (a) To implement a framework adjustment for the Red Crab FMP, the 
Council shall develop and analyze proposed actions over the span of at 
least two Council meetings and provide advance public notice of the 
availability of both the proposals and the analyses. Opportunity to 
provide written and oral comments shall be provided throughout the 
process before the Council submits its recommendations to the Regional 
Administrator.
    (1) In response to an annual review of the status of the fishery or 
the resource by the Red Crab PDT, or at any other time, the Council may 
recommend adjustments to any of the measures proposed by the Red Crab 
FMP. The Red Crab Oversight Committee may request that the Council 
initiate a framework adjustment. Framework adjustments shall require one 
initial meeting (the agenda must include notification of the impending 
proposal for a framework adjustment) and one final Council meeting. 
After a management action has been initiated, the Council shall develop 
and analyze appropriate management actions within the scope identified 
below. The Council may refer the proposed adjustments to the Red Crab 
Committee for further deliberation and review. Upon receiving the 
recommendations of the Oversight Committee, the Council shall publish 
notice of its intent to take action and provide the public with any 
relevant analyses and opportunity to comment on any possible actions. 
After receiving public comment, the Council must take action (to 
approve, modify, disapprove, or table) on the recommendation at the 
Council meeting following the meeting at which it first received the 
recommendations. Documentation and analyses for the framework adjustment 
shall be available at least 2 weeks before the final meeting.
    (2) After developing management actions and receiving public 
testimony, the Council may make a recommendation to the Regional 
Administrator. The Council's recommendation shall include supporting 
rationale, an analysis of impacts required under paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section and a recommendation to the Regional Administrator on 
whether to issue the management measures as a final rule. If the Council 
recommends that the management measures should be issued directly as a 
final rule, the Council shall consider at least the following factors 
and provide support and analysis for each factor considered:
    (i) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended 
management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a 
proposed rule, and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire 
harvest/fishing season;
    (ii) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for 
participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the 
development of the Council's recommended management measures;
    (iii) Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource or 
to impose management measures to resolve gear conflicts;
    (iv) Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management 
measures adopted following their implementation as a final rule.
    (3) If the Regional Administrator concurs with the Council's 
recommended management measures, they shall be published in the Federal 
Register. If the Council's recommendation is first published as a 
proposed rule and the Regional Administrator concurs with the Council's 
recommendation after receiving additional public comment, the measures 
shall then be published as a final rule in the Federal Register.
    (4) If the Regional Administrator approves the Council's 
recommendations, the Secretary may, for good cause found under the 
standard of the Administrative Procedure Act, waive the requirement for 
a proposed rule and opportunity for public comment in the Federal 
Register. The Secretary, in so doing, shall publish only the final

[[Page 814]]

rule. Submission of recommendations does not preclude the Secretary from 
deciding to provide additional opportunity for prior notice and comment 
in the Federal Register.
    (5) The Regional Administrator may approve, disapprove, or partially 
disapprove the Council's recommendation. If the Regional Administrator 
does not approve the Council's specific recommendation, the Regional 
Administrator must notify the Council in writing of the reasons for the 
action prior to the first Council meeting following publication of such 
decision.

    (a) Closure authority. NMFS shall close the EEZ to fishing for red 
crab in excess of the incidental limit by commercial vessels for the 
remainder of the fishing year if the Regional Administrator determines 
that the TAL has been harvested. Upon notification of the closure, a 
vessel issued a limited access red crab permit may not fish for, catch, 
possess, transport, land, sell, trade, or barter, in excess of 500 lb 
(226.8 kg) of red crab, or its equivalent in weight as specified at 
Sec. 648.263(a)(2)(i) and (ii), per fishing trip in or from the Red 
Crab Management Unit.
    (b) Adjustment for an overage. (1) If NMFS determines that the TAL 
was exceeded in a given fishing year, the exact amount of the landings 
overage will be deducted, as soon as is practicable, from a subsequent 
single fishing year's TAL, through notification consistent with the 
Administrative Procedure Act.
    (2) If NMFS determines that the ACL was exceeded in a given fishing 
year, the exact amount of an overage that was not already deducted from 
the TAL under paragraph (b)(i) of this section will be deducted, as soon 
as is practicable, from a subsequent single fishing year's TAL, through 
notification consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act.

weight of red crab half sections multiplied by 1.56.
    (ii) For red crab that is landed in half sections, with all gills 
and other detritus removed, the recovery rate is 58 percent of a whole 
red crab, which is equal to the weight of red crab half sections 
multiplied by 1.72.
    (3) Female red crab restriction. A vessel may not fish for, catch, 
possess, transport, land, sell, trade, or barter, female red crabs in 
excess of one standard U.S. fish tote of incidentally caught female red 
crabs per trip when fishing under a red crab DAS.
    (4) Full-processing prohibition. No person may fully process at sea, 
possess, or land, fully-processed red crab.
    (5) Mutilation restriction. A vessel may not retain, possess, or 
land red crab claws and legs separate from crab bodies in excess of one 
standard U.S. fish tote per trip when fishing on a dedicated red crab 
trip.
    (b) Vessels issued red crab incidental catch permits--(1) Possession 
and landing restrictions. A vessel or operator of a vessel that has been 
issued a red crab incidental catch permit, or a vessel issued a limited 
access red crab permit not on a dedicated red crab trip, as defined in 
Sec. 648.2, may catch, possess, transport, land, sell, trade, or 
barter, up to 500 lb (226.8 kg) of red crab, or its equivalent in weight 
as specified at paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, per 
fishing trip in or from the Red Crab Management Unit.
    (2) Full-processing prohibition. No person may fully process at sea, 
possess, or land, fully-processed red crab.
    (3) Mutilation restrictions. (i) A vessel may not retain, possess,

ACLs at least every 5 years.
    (1) If the ACL is exceeded with a frequency greater than 25 percent 
(i.e., more than once in 4 years or in any 2 consecutive years), the 
Tilefish Monitoring Committee will review fishery performance 
information and make recommendations to the MAFMC for changes in 
measures intended to ensure ACLs are not as frequently exceeded.
    (2) The MAFMC may specify more frequent or more specific ACL 
performance review criteria as part of a stock rebuilding plan following 
a determination that the tilefish stock has become overfished.

[[Page 816]]

    (3) Performance reviews shall not substitute for annual reviews that 
occur to ascertain if prior year ACLs have been exceeded, but may be 
conducted in conjunction with such reviews.

Sec. 648.291  Tilefish Annual Catch Target (ACT).

    (a) The Tilefish Monitoring Committee shall identify and review the 
relevant sources of management uncertainty to recommend an ACT as part 
of the tilefish specification process. The Tilefish Monitoring Committee 
recommendations shall identify the specific sources of management 
uncertainty that were considered, technical approaches to mitigating 
these sources of uncertainty, and any additional relevant information 
considered in the ACT recommendation process.
    (1) Sectors. The ACT shall be less than or equal to the ACL. The 
Tilefish Monitoring Committee shall include the fishing mortality 
associated with the recreational fishery in its ACT recommendations only 
if this source of mortality has not already been accounted for in the 
ABC recommended by the SSC. The Tilefish Monitoring Committee shall 
recommend any reduction in catch necessary to address sector-specific 
management uncertainty, consistent with paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) Periodicity. ACTs may be established on an annual basis for up 
to 3 years at a time, dependent on whether the SSC provides single or 
multiple-year ABC recommendations.
    (b) Performance review. The Tilefish Monitoring Committee shall 
conduct a detailed review of fishery performance relative to ACTs in 
conjunction with any ACL performance review, as outlined in Sec. 
648.290(b)(1) through (3).

<R05>
Sec. 648.292  Tilefish specifications.

    The fishing year is the 12-month period beginning with November 1, 
annually.
    (a) Annual specification process. The Tilefish Monitoring Committee 
shall review the ABC recommendation of the SSC, tilefish landings and 
discards information, and any other relevant available data to determine 
if the ACL, ACT, or total allowable landings (TAL) requires modification 
to respond to any changes to the stock's biological reference points or 
to ensure that the rebuilding schedule is maintained. The Monitoring 
Committee will consider whether any additional management measures or 
revisions to existing measures are necessary to ensure that the TAL will 
not be exceeded. Based on that review, the Monitoring Committee will 
recommend ACL, ACT, and TAL to the Tilefish Committee of the MAFMC. 
Based on these recommendations and any public comment received, the 
Tilefish Committee shall recommend to the MAFMC the appropriate ACL, 
ACT, TAL, and other management measures for a single fishing year or up 
to 3 years. The MAFMC shall review these recommendations and any public 
comments received, and recommend to the Regional Administrator, at least 
120 days prior to the beginning of the next fishing year, the 
appropriate ACL, ACT, TAL, the percentage of TAL allocated to research 
quota, and any management measures to ensure that the TAL will not be 
exceeded, for the next fishing year, or up to 3 fishing years. The 
MAFMC's recommendations must include supporting documentation, as 
appropriate, concerning the environmental and economic impacts of the 
recommendations. The Regional Administrator shall review these 
recommendations, and after such review, NMFS will publish a proposed 
rule in the Federal Register specifying the annual ACL, ACT, TAL and any 
management measures to ensure that the TAL will not be exceeded for the 
upcoming fishing year or years. After considering public comments, NMFS 
will publish a final rule in the Federal Register to implement the ACL, 
ACT, TAL and any management measures. The previous year's specifications 
will remain effective unless revised through the specification process 
and/or the research quota process described in paragraph (e) of this 
section. NMFS will issue notification in the Federal Register if the 
previous year's specifications will not be changed.
    (b) TAL. (1) The TAL for each fishing year will be 1.995 million lb 
(905,172 kg)

[[Page 817]]

unless modified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) The sum of the TAL and estimated discards shall be less than or 
equal to the ACT.
    (c) TAL allocation. For each fishing year, up to 3 percent of the 
TAL may be set aside for the purpose of funding research. Once a 
research amount, if any, is set aside, the TAL will first be reduced by 
5 percent to adjust for the incidental catch. The remaining TAL will be 
allocated to the individual IFQ permit holder as described in Sec. 
648.294(a).
    (d) Adjustments to the quota. If the incidental harvest exceeds 5 
percent of the TAL for a given fishing year, the incidental trip limit 
of 500 lb (226.8 kg) may be reduced in the following fishing year. If an 
adjustment is required, a notification of adjustment of the quota will 
be published in the Federal Register.
    (e) Research quota. See Sec. 648.21(g).

Sec. 648.293  Tilefish accountability measures.

    (a) If the ACL is exceeded, the amount of the ACL overage that 
cannot be directly attributed to IFQ allocation holders having exceeded 
their IFQ allocation will be deducted from the ACL in the following 
fishing year. All overages directly attributable to IFQ allocation 
holders will be deducted from the appropriate IFQ allocation(s) in the 
subsequent fishing year, as required by Sec. 648.294(f).
    (b) [Reserved]

[76 FR 60645, Sept. 29, 2011]


<R05>
Sec. 648.294  Individual fishing quota (IFQ) program.

    (a) IFQ allocation permits. After adjustments for incidental catch, 
research set asides, and overages, as appropriate, pursuant to Sec. 
648.292(c), the Regional Administrator shall divide the remaining TAL 
among the IFQ allocation permit holders who held an IFQ permit as of 
September 1 of a giving fishing year. Allocations shall be made by 
applying the allocation percentages that exist on September 1 of a given 
fishing year to the IFQ TAL pursuant to Sec. 648.292(c), subject to any 
deductions for overages pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section. 
Amounts of IFQ of 0.5 lb (0.23 kg) or smaller created by this allocation 
shall be rounded downward to the nearest whole number, and amounts of 
IFQ greater than 0.5 lb (0.23 kg) created by this division shall be 
rounded upward to the nearest whole number, so that IFQ allocations are 
specified in whole pounds. These allocations shall be issued in the form 
of an annual IFQ allocation permit.
    (b) Application--(1) General. Applicants for a permit under this 
section must submit a completed application on an appropriate form 
obtained from NMFS. The application must be filled out completely and 
signed by the applicant. Each application must include a declaration of 
all interests in IFQ allocations, as defined in Sec. 648.2, listed by 
IFQ allocation permit number, and must list all Federal vessel permit 
numbers for all vessels that an applicant owns or leases that would be 
authorized to possess tilefish pursuant to the IFQ allocation permit. 
The Regional Administrator will notify the applicant of any deficiency 
in the application.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (ii) Renewal applications. Applications to renew an IFQ allocation 
permit must be received by September 15 to be processed in time for the 
November 1 start of the fishing year. Renewal applications received 
after this date may not be approved, and a new permit may not be issued 
before the start of the next fishing year. An IFQ allocation permit 
holder must renew his/her IFQ allocation permit on an annual basis by 
submitting an application for such permit prior to the end of the 
fishing year for which the permit is required.
    (2) Issuance. Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 904, 
and provided an application for such permit is submitted by September 
15, as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, NMFS shall 
issue annual IFQ allocation permits on or before October 31 to those who 
hold permanent allocation as of September 1 of the current fishing year. 
During the period between September 1 and October 31, transfer of IFQ is 
not permitted, as described in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. The IFQ 
allocation permit shall specify the

[[Page 818]]

allocation percentage of the IFQ TAL which the IFQ permit holder is 
authorized to harvest.
    (3) Duration. An annual IFQ allocation permit is valid until October 
31 of each fishing year unless it is suspended, modified, or revoked 
pursuant to 15 CFR part 904, or revised due to a transfer of all or part 
of the allocation percentage under paragraph (e) of this section. All 
Federal vessel permit numbers that are listed on the IFQ allocation 
permit are authorized to possess tilefish pursuant to the IFQ allocation 
permit until the end of the fishing year or until NMFS receives written 
notification from the IFQ allocation permit holder that the vessel is no 
longer authorized to possess tilefish pursuant to the subject permit. An 
IFQ allocation permit holder that wishes to authorize an additional 
vessel(s) to possess tilefish pursuant to the IFQ allocation permit must 
send written notification to NMFS that includes the vessel permit 
number, and the dates on which the IFQ allocation permit holder desires 
the vessel to be authorized to land IFQ tilefish pursuant to the IFQ 
allocation permit to be effective.
    (4) Alteration. An annual IFQ allocation permit that is altered, 
erased, or mutilated is invalid.
    (5) Replacement. The Regional Administrator may issue a replacement 
permit upon written application of the annual IFQ allocation permit 
holder.
    (6) Transfer. The annual IFQ allocation permit is valid only for the 
person to whom it is issued. All or part of the allocation specified in 
the IFQ allocation permit may be transferred in accordance with 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (7) Abandonment or voluntary relinquishment. Any IFQ Allocation 
permit that is voluntarily relinquished to the Regional Administrator, 
or deemed to have been voluntarily relinquished for failure to pay a 
recoverable cost fee, in accordance with the requirements specified in 
paragraph (h)(2) of this section, or for failure to renew in accordance 
with paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, shall not be reissued or 
renewed in a subsequent year.
    (c)-(d) [Reserved]
    (e) Transferring IFQ allocations--(1) Temporary transfers. Unless 
otherwise restricted by the provisions in paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section, the owner of an IFQ allocation may transfer the entire IFQ 
allocation, or a portion of the IFQ allocation, to any person or entity 
eligible to own a documented vessel under the terms of 46 U.S.C. 
12102(a). Temporary IFQ allocation transfers shall be effective only for 
the fishing year in which the temporary transfer is requested and 
processed, unless the applicant specifically requests that the transfer 
be processed for the subsequent fishing year. The Regional Administrator 
has final approval authority for all temporary IFQ allocation transfer 
requests. The approval of a temporary transfer may be rescinded if the 
Regional Administrator finds that an emergency has rendered the lessee 
unable to fish for the transferred IFQ allocation, but only if none of 
the transferred allocation has been landed.
    (2) Permanent transfers. Unless otherwise restricted by the 
provisions in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, an owner of an IFQ 
allocation may permanently transfer the entire IFQ allocation, or a 
portion of the IFQ allocation, to any person or entity eligible to own a 
documented vessel under the terms of 46 U.S.C. 12102(a). The Regional 
Administrator has final approval authority for all permanent IFQ 
allocation transfer requests.
    (3) IFQ allocation transfer restrictions. (i) If IFQ allocation is 
temporarily transferred to any eligible entity, it may not be 
transferred by the transferee again within the same fishing year, unless 
the transfer is rescinded due to an emergency, as described in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section.
    (ii) A transfer of IFQ will not be approved by the Regional 
Administrator if it would result in an entity owning, or having an 
interest in, a percentage of IFQ allocation exceeding 49 percent of the 
total tilefish adjusted TAL.
    (iii) If the owner of an IFQ allocation leases additional quota from 
another IFQ allocation permit holder, any landings associated with this 
transferred quota will be deducted from the total yearly landings of the 
lessee, before his/her base allocation, if any exists, for the purpose 
of calculating the appropriate cost-recovery fee. As described in 
paragraph (h) of this section,

[[Page 819]]

a tilefish IFQ allocation permit holder with a permanent allocation 
shall incur a cost-recovery fee, based on the value of landings of 
tilefish authorized under his/her tilefish IFQ allocation permit, 
including allocation that he/she leases to another IFQ allocation permit 
holder.
    (4) Application for an IFQ allocation transfer. Any IFQ allocation 
permit holder applying for either permanent or temporary transfer of IFQ 
allocation must submit a completed IFQ Allocation Transfer Form, 
available from NMFS. The IFQ Allocation Transfer Form must be submitted 
to the NMFS Northeast Regional Office at least 30 days before the date 
on which the applicant desires to have the IFQ allocation transfer 
effective. The Regional Administrator shall notify the applicants of any 
deficiency in the application pursuant to this section. Applications for 
IFQ allocation transfers must be received by September 1 to be processed 
for the current fishing year.
    (i) Application information requirements. An application to transfer 
IFQ allocation must include the following information: The type of 
transfer (either temporary or permanent); the signature of both parties 
involved; the price paid for the transfer; indicate eligibility to 
receive IFQ allocation; the amount of allocation to be transferred; and 
a declaration; by IFQ Allocation permit number, of all the IFQ 
allocations that the person or entity receiving the IFQ allocation has 
an interest. The person or entity receiving the IFQ allocation must 
indicate the permit numbers of all federally permitted vessels that will 
possess or land their IFQ allocation. Information obtained from the IFQ 
Allocation Transfer Form is confidential pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1881a.
    (ii) Approval of IFQ transfer applications. Unless an application to 
transfer IFQ is denied according to paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this 
section, the Regional Administrator shall issue confirmation of 
application approval in the form of a new or updated IFQ allocation 
permit to the parties involved in the transfer within 30 days of receipt 
of a completed application.
    (iii) Denial of transfer application. The Regional Administrator may 
reject an application to transfer IFQ allocation for the following 
reasons: The application is incomplete; the transferor does not possess 
a valid tilefish IFQ allocation permit; the transferor's or transferee's 
vessel or tilefish IFQ allocation permit has been sanctioned, pursuant 
to an enforcement proceeding under 15 CFR part 904; the transfer will 
result in the transferee having a tilefish IFQ allocation that exceeds 
49 percent of the adjusted TAL allocated to IFQ allocation permit 
holders; the transfer is to a person or entity that is not eligible to 
own a documented vessel under the terms of 46 U.S.C. 12102(a); or any 
other failure to meet the requirements of this subpart. Upon denial of 
an application to transfer IFQ allocation, the Regional Administrator 
shall send a letter to the applicant describing the reason(s) for the 
denial. The decision by the Regional Administrator is the final decision 
of the Department of Commerce; there is no opportunity for an 
administrative appeal.
    (f) IFQ allocation overages. Any IFQ allocation that is exceeded, 
including amounts of tilefish landed by a lessee in excess of a 
temporary transfer of IFQ allocation, will be reduced by the amount of 
the overage in the subsequent fishing year(s). If an IFQ allocation 
overage is not deducted from the appropriate allocation before the IFQ 
allocation permit is issued for the subsequent fishing year, a revised 
IFQ allocation permit reflecting the deduction of the overage shall be 
issued by NMFS. If the allocation cannot be reduced in the subsequent 
fishing year because the full allocation has already been landed or 
transferred, the IFQ allocation permit will indicate a reduced 
allocation for the amount of the overage in the next fishing year.
    (g) IFQ allocation acquisition restriction. No person or entity may 
acquire more than 49 percent of the annual adjusted tilefish TAL, 
specified pursuant to Sec. 648.294, at any point during a fishing year. 
For purposes of this paragraph, acquisition includes any permanent or 
temporary transfer of IFQ. The calculation of IFQ allocation for 
purposes of the restriction on acquisition includes IFQ allocation 
interests held by: A company in which the IFQ holder is a shareholder, 
officer, or partner; an

[[Page 820]]

immediate family member; or a company in which the IFQ holder is a part 
owner or partner.
    (h) IFQ cost recovery. A fee shall be determined as described in 
paragraph (h)(1) of this section, and collected to recover the 
government costs associated with management, data collection and 
analysis, and enforcement of the IFQ program. A tilefish IFQ allocation 
permit holder shall be responsible for paying the fee assessed by NMFS. 
A tilefish IFQ allocation permit holder with a permanent allocation 
shall incur a cost-recovery fee, based on the value of landings of 
tilefish authorized under his/her tilefish IFQ allocation permit, 
including allocation that he/she leases to another IFQ allocation permit 
holder. A tilefish IFQ allocation permit holder, with a permanent 
allocation, shall be responsible for submitting this payment to NMFS 
once per year, as specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. For the 
purpose of this section, the cost-recovery billing period is defined as 
the full calendar year, beginning with January 1, 2010. NMFS will create 
an annual IFQ allocation bill for each cost-recovery billing period and 
provide it to each IFQ allocation permit holder. The bill will include 
annual information regarding the amount and value of IFQ allocation 
landed during the prior cost-recovery billing period, and the associated 
cost-recovery fees. NMFS will also create a report that will detail the 
costs incurred by NMFS, for the management, enforcement, and data 
collection and analysis associated with the IFQ allocation program 
during the prior cost-recovery billing period.
    (1) NMFS determination of the total annual recoverable costs of the 
tilefish IFQ program. The Regional Administrator shall determine the 
costs associated with the management, data collection and analysis, and 
enforcement of the IFQ allocation program. The recoverable costs will be 
divided by the amount of the total ex-vessel value of all tilefish IFQ 
landings during the cost-recovery billing period to derive a percentage. 
IFQ allocation permit holders will be assessed a fee based on this 
percentage multiplied by the total ex-vessel value of all landings under 
their permanent IFQ allocation permit, including landings of allocation 
that is leased. This fee shall not exceed 3 percent of the total value 
of tilefish landings of the IFQ allocation permit holder. If NMFS 
determines that the costs associated with the management, data 
collection and analysis, and enforcement of the IFQ allocation program 
exceed 3 percent of the total value of tilefish landings, only 3 percent 
are recoverable.
    (i) Valuation of IFQ allocation. The 3-percent limitation on cost-
recovery fees shall be based on the ex-vessel value of landed 
allocation. The ex-vessel value for each pound of tilefish landed by an 
IFQ allocation holder shall be determined from Northeast Federal dealer 
reports submitted to NMFS, which include the price per pound paid to the 
vessel at the time of dealer purchase.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (2) Fee payment procedure. An IFQ allocation permit holder who has 
incurred a cost-recovery fee must pay the fee to NMFS within 45 days of 
the date of the bill. Cost-recovery payments shall be made 
electronically via the Federal Web portal, http://www.pay.gov or other 
Internet sites designated by the Regional Administrator. Instructions 
for electronic payment shall be available on both the payment Web site 
and the cost-recovery fee bill. Electronic payment options shall include 
payment via a credit card, as specified in the cost-recovery bill, or 
via direct automated clearing house (ACH) withdrawal from a designated 
checking account. Alternatively, payment by check may be authorized by 
Regional Administrator if he/she determines that electronic payment is 
not possible.
    (3) Payment compliance. If the cost-recovery payment, as determined 
by NMFS, is not made within the time specified in paragraph (h)(2) of 
this section, the Regional Administrator will deny the renewal of the 
appropriate IFQ allocation permit until full payment is received. If, 
upon preliminary review of a fee payment, the Regional Administrator 
determines that the IFQ allocation permit holder has not paid the full 
amount due, he/she shall notify the IFQ allocation permit holder in 
writing of the deficiency. NMFS shall

[[Page 821]]

explain the deficiency and provide the IFQ allocation permit holder 30 
days from the date of the notice, either to pay the amount assessed or 
to provide evidence that the amount paid was correct. If the IFQ 
allocation permit holder submits evidence in support of the 
appropriateness of his/her payment, the Regional Administrator shall 
determine whether there is a reasonable basis upon which to conclude 
that the amount of the tendered payment is correct. This determination 
shall be in set forth in a Final Administrative Determination (FAD) that 
is signed by the Regional Administrator. A FAD shall be the final 
decision of the Department of Commerce. If the Regional Administrator 
determines that the IFQ allocation permit holder has not paid the 
appropriate fee, he/she shall require payment within 30 days of the date 
of the FAD. If a FAD is not issued until after the start of the fishing 
year, the IFQ allocation permit holder may be issued a letter of 
authorization to fish until the FAD is issued, at which point the permit 
holder shall have 30 days to comply with the terms of the FAD or the 
tilefish IFQ allocation permit shall not be issued, and the letter of 
authorization shall not be valid until such terms are met. Any tilefish 
landed pursuant to the above authorization will count against the IFQ 
allocation permit, if issued. If the Regional Administrator determines 
that the IFQ allocation permit holder owes additional fees for the 
previous cost-recovery billing period, and the renewed IFQ allocation 
permit has already been issued, the Regional Administrator shall issue a 
FAD and will notify the IFQ allocation permit holder in writing. The IFQ 
allocation permit holder shall have 30 days from the date of the FAD to 
comply with the terms of the FAD. If the IFQ allocation permit holder 
does not comply with the terms of the FAD within this period, the 
Regional Administrator shall rescind the IFQ allocation permit until 
such terms are met. If an appropriate payment is not received within 30 
days of the date of a FAD, the Regional Administrator shall refer the 
matter to the appropriate authorities within the U.S. Department of the 
Treasury for purposes of collection. No permanent or temporary IFQ 
allocation transfers may be made to or from the allocation of an IFQ 
allocation permit holder who has not complied with any FAD. If the 
Regional Administrator determines that the terms of a FAD have been met, 
the IFQ allocation permit holder may renew the tilefish IFQ allocation 
permit. If NMFS does not receive full payment of a recoverable cost fee 
prior to the end of the cost-recovery billing period immediately 
following the one for which the fee was incurred, the subject IFQ 
allocation permit shall be deemed to have been voluntarily relinquished 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(7) of this section.
    (4) Periodic review of the IFQ program. A formal review of the IFQ 
program must be conducted by the MAFMC within 5 years of the effective 
date of the final regulations. Thereafter, it shall be incorporated into 
every scheduled MAFMC review of the FMP (i.e., future amendments or 
frameworks), but no less frequently than every 7 years.

    (a) Incidental trip limit for vessels not fishing under an IFQ 
allocation. Any vessel of the United States fishing under a tilefish 
permit, as described at Sec. 648.4(a)(12), is prohibited from 
possessing more than 500 lb (226.8 kg) of tilefish at any time, unless 
the vessel is fishing under a tilefish IFQ allocation permit, as 
specified at Sec. 648.294(a). Any tilefish landed by a vessel fishing 
under an IFQ allocation permit, on a given fishing trip, count as 
landings under the IFQ allocation permit.
    (b) In-season closure of the incidental fishery. The Regional 
Administrator will monitor the harvest of the tilefish incidental TAL 
based on dealer reports and other available information, and shall 
determine the date when the incidental tilefish TAL has been landed. The 
Regional Administrator shall publish a notice in the Federal Register 
notifying vessel and dealer permit holders that, effective upon a 
specific date, the incidental tilefish fishery is closed for the 
remainder of the fishing year.

Sec. 648.298  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 648.299  Tilefish framework specifications.

    (a) Within-season management action. The MAFMC may, at any time, 
initiate action to add or adjust management measures if it finds that 
action is necessary to meet or be consistent with the goals and 
objectives of the Tilefish FMP.
    (1) Specific management measures. The following specific management 
measures may be adjusted at any time through the framework adjustment 
process:
    (i) Minimum fish size;
    (ii) Minimum hook size;
    (iii) Closed seasons;
    (iv) Closed areas;
    (v) Gear restrictions or prohibitions;
    (vi) Permitting restrictions;
    (vii) Gear limits;
    (viii) Trip limits;
    (ix) Adjustments within existing ABC control rule levels;
    (x) Adjustments to the existing MAFMC risk policy;
    (xi) Introduction of new AMs, including sub ACTs;
    (xii) Annual specification quota setting process;
    (xiii) Tilefish FMP Monitoring Committee composition and process;
    (xiv) Description and identification of EFH;
    (xv) Fishing gear management measures that impact EFH;
    (xvi) Habitat areas of particular concern;
    (xvii) Set-aside quotas for scientific research;
    (xviii) [Reserved]

[[Page 823]]

    (xix) Recreational management measures, including the bag limit, 
minimum fish size limit, seasons, and gear restrictions or prohibitions; 
and
    (xx) IFQ program review components, including capacity reduction, 
safety at sea issues, transferability rules, ownership concentration 
caps, permit and reporting requirements, and fee and cost-recovery 
issues.
    (xxi) Measures that require significant departures from previously 
contemplated measures or that are otherwise introducing new concepts may 
require a formal amendment of the FMP instead of a framework adjustment.
    (2) Adjustment process. If the MAFMC determines that an adjustment 
to management measures is necessary to meet the goals and objectives of 
the FMP, it will recommend, develop, and analyze appropriate management 
actions over the span of at least two MAFMC meetings. The MAFMC will 
provide the public with advance notice of the availability of the 
recommendation, appropriate justifications and economic and biological 
analyses, and opportunity to comment on the proposed adjustments prior 
to and at the second MAFMC meeting on that framework action.
    (3) MAFMC recommendation. After developing management actions and 
receiving public testimony, the MAFMC will make a recommendation to the 
Regional Administrator. The MAFMC's recommendation must include 
supporting rationale and, if management measures are recommended, an 
analysis of impacts and a recommendation to the Regional Administrator 
on whether to issue the management measures as a final rule. If the 
MAFMC recommends that the management measures should be issued as a 
final rule, it must consider at least the following factors and provide 
support and analysis for each factor considered:
    (i) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended 
management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a 
proposed rule, and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire 
harvest/fishing season;
    (ii) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for 
participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the 
development of the MAFMC's recommended management measures;
    (iii) Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource; 
and
    (iv) Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management 
measures adopted following their implementation as a final rule.
    (4) Regional Administrator action. If the MAFMC's recommendation 
includes adjustments or additions to management measures and, after 
reviewing the MAFMC's recommendation and supporting information:
    (i) If the Regional Administrator concurs with the MAFMC's 
recommended management measures and determines that the recommended 
management measures should be issued as a final rule based on the 
factors specified in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section, the 
measures will be issued as a final rule in the Federal Register.
    (ii) If the Regional Administrator concurs with the MAFMC's 
recommendation and determines that the recommended management measures 
should be published first as a proposed rule, the measures will be 
published as a proposed rule in the Federal Register. After additional 
public comment, if the Regional Administrator concurs with the MAFMC's 
recommendation, the measures will be issued as a final rule in the 
Federal Register.
    (iii) If the Regional Administrator does not concur with the MAFMC's 
recommendation, the MAFMC will be notified in writing of the reasons for 
the non-concurrence.
    (b) Emergency action. Nothing in this section is meant to derogate 
from the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under 
section 305(e) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.

<R05>
Sec. 648.320  Skate FMP review and monitoring.

    (a) Annual review and specifications process. The Council, its Skate 
Plan Development Team (PDT), and its Skate Advisory Panel shall monitor 
the status of the fishery and the skate resources.
    (1) The Skate PDT shall meet at least annually to review the status 
of the species in the skate complex. At a minimum, this review shall 
include annual updates to survey indices, fishery landings and discards; 
a re-evaluation of stock status based on the updated survey indices and 
the FMP's overfishing definitions; and a determination of whether any of 
the accountability measures specified under Sec. 648.323 were 
triggered. The review shall also include an analysis of changes to other 
FMPs (e.g., Northeast Multispecies, Monkfish, Atlantic Scallops, etc.) 
that may impact skate stocks, and describe the anticipated impacts of 
those changes on the skate fishery.
    (2) If new and/or additional information becomes available, the 
Skate PDT shall consider it during this annual review. Based on this 
review, the Skate PDT shall provide guidance to the Skate Committee and 
the Council regarding the need to adjust measures in the Skate FMP to 
better achieve the FMP's objectives. After considering guidance, the 
Council may submit to NMFS its recommendations for changes to management 
measures, as appropriate, through the specifications process described 
in this section, the framework process specified in Sec. 648.321, or 
through an amendment to the FMP.
    (3) For overfished skate species, the Skate PDT and the Council 
shall monitor the trawl survey index as a proxy for stock biomass. As 
long as the 3-year average of the appropriate weight per tow increases 
above the average for the previous 3 years, it is assumed that the stock 
is rebuilding to target levels. If the 3-year average of the appropriate 
survey mean weight per tow declines below the average for the previous 3 
years, then the Council shall take management action to ensure that 
stock rebuilding will achieve target levels.
    (4) Based on the annual review described above and/or the Stock 
Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) Report described in paragraph 
(b) of this section, recommendations for acceptable biological catch 
(ABC) from the Scientific and Statistical Committee, and any other 
relevant information, the Skate PDT shall recommend to the Skate 
Committee and Council the following annual specifications for harvest of 
skates: An annual catch limit (ACL) for the skate complex set less than 
or equal to ABC; an annual catch target (ACT) for the skate complex set 
less than or equal to 75 percent of the ACL; and total allowable 
landings (TAL) necessary to meet the objectives of the FMP in each 
fishing year (May 1-April 30), specified for a period of up to 2 fishing 
years.
    (5) Recommended measures. The Skate PDT shall also recommend 
management measures to the Skate Committee and Council to assure that 
the specifications are not exceeded. Recommended measures should 
include, but are not limited to:
    (i) Possession limits in each fishery;
    (ii) In-season possession limit triggers for the wing and/or bait 
fisheries; and
    (iii) Required adjustments to in-season possession limit trigger 
percentages or the ACL-ACT buffer, based on the accountability measures 
specified at Sec. 648.323.
    (6) Taking into account the annual review and/or SAFE Report 
described in paragraph (b) of this section, the advice of the Scientific 
and Statistical Committee, and any other relevant information, the Skate 
PDT may also recommend to the Skate Committee and Council changes to 
stock status determination criteria and associated thresholds based on 
the best scientific information available, including information from 
peer-reviewed stock assessments of the skate complex and its component 
species. These adjustments may be included in the Council's 
specifications for the skate fisheries.
    (7) Council recommendation. The Council shall review the 
recommendations of the Skate PDT, Skate Committee, and Scientific and 
Statistical Committee, any public comment received thereon, and any 
other relevant information, and make a recommendation

[[Page 825]]

to the Regional Administrator on appropriate specifications and any 
measures necessary to assure that the specifications will not be 
exceeded. The Council's recommendation must include supporting 
documentation, as appropriate, concerning the environmental, economic, 
and social impacts of the recommendations. The Regional Administrator 
shall consider the recommendations and publish a rule in the Federal 
Register proposing specifications and associated measures, consistent 
with the Administrative Procedure Act. The Regional Administrator may 
propose specifications different than those recommended by the Council. 
If the specifications published in the Federal Register differ from 
those recommended by the Council, the reasons for any differences must 
be clearly stated and the revised specifications must satisfy the 
criteria set forth in this section, the FMP, and other applicable laws. 
If the final specifications are not published in the Federal Register 
for the start of the fishing year, the previous year's specifications 
shall remain in effect until superseded by the final rule implementing 
the current year's specifications, to ensure that there is no lapse in 
regulations while new specifications are completed.
    (b) Biennial SAFE Report--(1) The Skate PDT shall prepare a biennial 
Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) Report for the NE skate 
complex. The SAFE Report shall be the primary vehicle for the 
presentation of all updated biological and socio-economic information 
regarding the NE skate complex and its associated fisheries. The SAFE 
Report shall provide source data for any adjustments to the management 
measures that may be needed to continue to meet the goals and objectives 
of the FMP.
    (2) In any year in which a SAFE Report is not completed by the Skate 
PDT, the annual review process described in paragraph (a) of this 
section shall be used to recommend any necessary adjustments to 
specifications and/or management measures in the FMP.

[75 FR 34058, June 16, 2010]


<R05>
Sec. 648.321  Framework adjustment process.

    (a) Adjustment process. To implement a framework adjustment for the 
Skate FMP, the Council shall develop and analyze proposed actions over 
the span of at least two Council meetings (the initial meeting agenda 
must include notification of the impending proposal for a framework 
adjustment) and provide advance public notice of the availability of 
both the proposals and the analyses. Opportunity to provide written and 
oral comments shall be provided throughout the process before the 
Council submits its recommendations to the Regional Administrator.
    (1) Council review and analyses. In response to the annual review, 
or at any other time, the Council may initiate action to add or adjust 
management measures if it finds that action is necessary to meet or be 
consistent with the goals and objectives of the Skate FMP. After a 
framework action has been initiated, the Council shall develop and 
analyze appropriate management actions within the scope of measures 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The Council shall publish 
notice of its intent to take action and provide the public with any 
relevant analyses and opportunity to comment on any possible actions. 
Documentation and analyses for the framework adjustment shall be 
available at least 1 week before the final meeting.
    (2) Council recommendation. After developing management actions and 
receiving public testimony, the Council may make a recommendation to the 
Regional Administrator. The Council's recommendation shall include 
supporting rationale, an analysis of impacts required under paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, and a recommendation to the Regional 
Administrator on whether to issue the management measures as a final 
rule. If the Council recommends that the framework measures should be 
issued directly as a final rule, without opportunity for public notice 
and comment, the Council shall consider at least the following factors 
and provide support and analysis for each factor considered:
    (i) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended 
management measures are based allows for

[[Page 826]]

adequate time to publish a proposed rule, and whether regulations have 
to be in place for an entire harvest/fishing season;
    (ii) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for 
participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the 
development of the Council's recommended management measures;
    (iii) Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource or 
to impose management measures to resolve gear conflicts; and
    (iv) Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management 
measures adopted following their implementation as a final rule.
    (3) The Regional Administrator may publish the recommended framework 
measures in the Federal Register. If the Council's recommendation is 
first published as a proposed rule and the Regional Administrator 
concurs with the Council's recommendation after receiving additional 
public comment, the measures shall then be published as a final rule in 
the Federal Register.
    (4) If the Regional Administrator approves the Council's 
recommendations, the Secretary may, for good cause found under the 
standard of the Administrative Procedure Act, waive the requirement for 
a proposed rule and opportunity for public comment in the Federal 
Register. The Secretary, in so doing, shall publish only the final rule. 
Submission of recommendations does not preclude the Secretary from 
deciding to provide additional opportunity for prior notice and comment 
in the Federal Register.
    (5) The Regional Administrator may approve, disapprove, or partially 
approve the Council's recommendation. If the Regional Administrator does 
not approve the Council's specific recommendation, the Regional 
Administrator must notify the Council in writing of the reasons for the 
action prior to the first Council meeting following publication of such 
decision.
    (b) Possible framework adjustment measures. Measures that may be 
changed or implemented through framework action, provided that any 
corresponding management adjustments can also be implemented through a 
framework adjustment, include:
    (1) Skate permitting and reporting;
    (2) Skate overfishing definitions and related targets and 
thresholds;
    (3) Prohibitions on possession and/or landing of individual skate 
species;
    (4) Skate possession limits;
    (5) Skate closed areas (and consideration of exempted gears and 
fisheries);
    (6) Seasonal skate fishery restrictions and specifications;
    (7) Target TACs for individual skate species;
    (8) Hard TACs/quotas for skates, including species-specific quotas, 
fishery quotas, and/or quotas for non-directed fisheries;
    (9) Establishment of a mechanism for TAC set-asides to conduct 
scientific research, or for other reasons;
    (10) Onboard observer requirements;
    (11) Gear modifications, requirements, restrictions, and/or 
prohibitions;
    (12) Minimum and/or maximum sizes for skates;
    (13) Adjustments to exemption area requirements, area coordinates, 
and/or management lines established by the FMP;
    (14) Measures to address protected species issues, if necessary;
    (15) Description and identification of EFH;
    (16) Description and identification of habitat areas of particular 
concern;
    (17) Measures to protect EFH;
    (18) OY and/or MSY specifications;
    (19) Changes to the accountability measures described at Sec. 
648.323;
    (20) Changes to TAL allocation proportions to the skate wing and 
bait fisheries;
    (21) Changes to seasonal quotas in the skate bait or wing fisheries;
    (22) Reduction of the baseline 25-percent ACL-ACT buffer to less 
than 25 percent; and
    (23) Changes to catch monitoring procedures.
    (c) Emergency action. Nothing in this section is meant to derogate 
from the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under 
section 305(c) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.

<R05>
Sec. 648.322  Skate allocation, possession, and landing provisions.

    (a) Allocation of TAL. (1) A total of 66.5 percent of the annual 
skate complex TAL shall be allocated to the skate wing fishery. All 
skate products that are landed in wing form, for the skate wing market, 
or classified by Federal dealers as food as required under Sec. 
648.7(a)(1)(i), shall count against the skate wing fishery TAL.
    (2) A total of 33.5 percent of the annual TAL shall be allocated to 
the skate bait fishery. All skate products that are landed for the skate 
bait market, or classified by Federal dealers as bait as required under 
Sec. 648.7(a)(1)(i), shall count against the skate bait fishery TAL. 
The annual skate bait fishery TAL shall be allocated in three seasonal 
quota periods as follows:
    (i) Season 1-May 1 through July 31, 30.8 percent of the annual skate 
bait fishery TAL shall be allocated;
    (ii) Season 2-August 1 through October 31, 37.1 percent of the 
annual skate bait fishery TAL shall be allocated; and
    (iii) Season 3-November 1 through April 30, the remainder of the 
annual skate bait fishery TAL not landed in Seasons 1 or 2 shall be 
allocated.
    (b) Skate wing possession and landing limits. A vessel or operator 
of a vessel that has been issued a valid Federal skate permit under this 
part, and fishes under an Atlantic sea scallop, NE multispecies, or 
monkfish DAS as specified at Sec. Sec. 648.53, 648.82, and 648.92, 
respectively, unless otherwise exempted under Sec. 648.80 or paragraph 
(c) of this section, may fish for, possess, and/or land up to the 
allowable trip limits specified as follows:
    (1) Up to 2,600 lb (1,179 kg) of skate wings (5,902 lb (2,677 kg) 
whole weight) per trip from May 1 through August 31, and 4,100 lb (1,860 
kg) of skate wings (9,307 lb (4,222 kg) whole weight) per trip from 
September 1 through April 30, except for a vessel fishing on a declared 
NE multispecies Category B DAS described under Sec. 648.85(b), which is 
limited to no more than 220 lb (100 kg) of skate wings (500 lb (227 kg) 
whole weight) per trip (or any prorated combination of skate wings and 
whole skates based on the conversion factor for wing weight to whole 
weight of 2.27--for example, 100 lb (45.4 kg) of skate wings x 2.27 = 
227 lb (103.1 kg) of whole skates).
    (2) In-season adjustment of skate wing possession limits. When the 
Regional Administrator projects that 85 percent of the annual skate wing 
fishery TAL has been landed, the Regional Administrator shall, through a 
notice in the Federal Register consistent with the Administrative 
Procedure Act, reduce the skate wing trip limit to 500 lb (227 kg) of 
skate wings (1,135 lb (515 kg) whole weight, or any prorated combination 
of skate wings and whole skates based on the conversion factor for wing 
weight to whole weight of 2.27) for the remainder of the fishing year, 
unless such a reduction would be expected to prevent attainment of the 
annual TAL.
    (3) Incidental possession limit for vessels not under a DAS. A 
vessel issued a Federal skate permit that is not fishing under an 
Atlantic sea scallop, NE multispecies, or monkfish DAS as specified at 
Sec. Sec. 648.53, 648.82, and 648.92, respectively, or is a limited 
access multispecies vessel participating in an approved sector described 
under Sec. 648.87 but not fishing on one of the DAS specified at 
Sec. Sec. 648.53, 648.82, or 648.92, may retain up to 500 lb (227 kg) 
of skate wings or 1,135 lb (515 kg) of whole skate, or any prorated 
combination of skate wings and whole skates based on the conversion 
factor for wing weight to whole weight of 2.27, per trip.
    (4) Allowable forms of skate landings. Except for vessels fishing 
under a skate bait letter of authorization as specified at Sec. 
648.322(c), a vessel may possess and/or land skates as wings only (wings 
removed from the body of the skate and the remaining carcass discarded), 
wings with associated carcasses possessed separately (wings removed from 
the body of the skate but the associated carcass retained on board the 
vessel), or in whole (intact) form, or any combination of the three, 
provided that the weight of the skate carcasses on board the vessel does 
not exceed 1.27 times the weight of skate wings on board. When any 
combination of skate wings, carcasses, and whole skates are possessed 
and/or landed, the applicable possession or landing limit shall be based 
on the whole weight limit, in

[[Page 828]]

which any wings are converted to whole weight using the wing to whole 
weight conversion factor of 2.27. For example, if the vessel possesses 
100 lb (45.4 kg) of skate wings, the whole weight equivalent would be 
227 lb (103.0 kg) of whole skates (100 lb (45.4 kg) x 2.27), and the 
vessel could possess up to 127 lb (57.6 kg) of skate carcasses (100 lb 
(45.4 kg) of skate wings x 1.27). A vessel may not possess and/or land 
skate carcasses and only whole skates.
    (c) Bait Letter of Authorization (LOA). A skate vessel owner or 
operator under this part may request and receive from the Regional 
Administrator an exemption from the skate wing possession limit 
restrictions for a minimum of 7 consecutive days, provided that when the 
vessel is fishing pursuant to the terms of authorization at least the 
following requirements and conditions are met:
    (1) The vessel owner or operator obtains and retains onboard the 
vessel a valid LOA. LOAs are available upon request from the Regional 
Administrator.
    (2) The vessel owner or operator possesses and/or lands only whole 
skates less than 23 inches (58.42 cm) total length.
    (3) The vessel owner or operator fishes for, possesses, or lands 
skates only for use as bait.
    (4) The vessel owner or operator possesses or lands no more than 
25,000 lb (11,340 kg) of only whole skates less than 23 inches (58.42 
cm) total length, and does not possess or land any skate wings or whole 
skates greater than 23 inches (58.42 cm) total length.
    (5) Vessels that choose to possess or land skate wings during the 
participation period of this letter of authorization must comply with 
possession limit restrictions under paragraph (b) of this section for 
all skates or skate parts on board. Vessels possessing skate wings in 
compliance with the possession limit restrictions under paragraph (b) 
may fish for, possess, or land skates for uses other than bait.
    (6) The vessel owner or operator complies with the transfer at sea 
requirements at Sec. 648.13(h).
    (d) In-season adjustment of skate bait possession limits. When the 
Regional Administrator projects that 90 percent of the skate bait 
fishery seasonal quota has been landed in Seasons 1 or 2, or 90 percent 
of the annual skate bait fishery TAL has been landed, the Regional 
Administrator shall, through a notice in the Federal Register consistent 
with the Administrative Procedure Act, reduce the skate bait trip limit 
to the whole weight equivalent of the skate wing trip limit specified 
under paragraph (b) of this section for the remainder of the quota 
period, unless such a reduction would be expected to prevent attainment 
of the seasonal quota or annual TAL.
    (e) Prohibitions on possession of skates. A vessel fishing in the 
EEZ portion of the Skate Management Unit may not:
    (1) Retain, possess, or land barndoor or thorny skates taken in or 
from the EEZ portion of the Skate Management Unit.
    (2) Retain, possess, or land smooth skates taken in or from the GOM 
RMA described at Sec. 648.80(a)(1)(i).

Sec. 648.323  Accountability measures.

    (a) TAL overages. If the skate wing fishery TAL or skate bait 
fishery TAL is determined to have been exceeded by more than 5 percent 
in any given year based upon, but not limited to, available landings 
information, the Regional Administrator shall reduce the in-season 
possession limit trigger for that fishery, as specified at Sec. 
648.322(b) and (d), in the next fishing year by 1 percent for each 1 
percent of TAL overage, consistent with the Administrative Procedure 
Act.
    (b) ACL overages-(1) If the ACL is determined to have been exceeded 
in any given year, based upon, but not limited to, available landings 
and discard information, the percent buffer between ACL and ACT, 
initially specified at 25 percent, shall be increased by 1 percent for 
each 1-percent ACL overage in the second fishing year following the 
fishing year in which the ACL overage occurred, through either the 
specifications or framework adjustment process described under 
Sec. Sec. 648.320 and 648.321.
    (2) If the Council fails to initiate action to correct an ACL 
overage

[[Page 829]]

through the specifications or framework adjustment process, consistent 
with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Regional Administrator shall 
implement the required adjustment, as described under paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act.
