                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, April 1, 1997), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.

[[Page vii]]

    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

facts, arguments, offers of settlement, or proposals of adjustment, 
where time, the nature of the proceeding, and the public interest 
permit. Such submittals should be made to the district director, but may 
be made through the attorney for the Government. Where necessary, the 
date of the hearing may be postponed, pending consideration of such 
proposals, when they are made in good faith and not for the purpose of 
delay. If proposals of settlement are submitted, and they are considered 
unsatisfactory, the district director may reject the proposals and may, 
either directly or through the attorney for the Government, inform the 
permittee of any conditions on which the alleged violations may be 
settled. If the proposals of settlement are considered satisfactory to 
the district director, the permittee shall be notified thereof and the 
proceeding shall be dismissed, unless such proposals of settlement 
include a monetary offer in compromise considered satisfactory to the 
district director, in which event the proceeding shall be held in 
abeyance pending final action on such monetary offer in compromise.

    Where the district director believes that the matter may be settled 
informally, i.e., without formal administrative proceedings, he shall, 
in accordance with section 5 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 
prior to the issuance of a citation, inform the permittee of the 
contemplated issuance of an order to show cause why his permit should 
not be suspended, revoked or annulled, and that he is being given an 
opportunity for the submission and consideration of facts, arguments, 
offers of settlement, or proposals of adjustment. The notice should 
inform the permittee of the charges on which the citation would be 
based, if issued, and afford him a period of 10 days from the date of 
the notice, or such longer period as the district director deems 
necessary, in which to submit proposals of settlement to the district 
director. Where informal settlement is not reached promptly because of 
inaction of the permittee or proposals are made for the purpose of 
delay, a citation shall be issued in accordance with Secs. 200.55 and 
200.56.

such as to preclude any settlement short of suspension, revocation or 
annulment, or the violation is of a continuing character that 
necessitates immediate action to protect the public interest, or where 
the district director believes that any informal settlement of the 
alleged violation will not insure future compliance with the laws and 
regulations, or in any similar case where the circumstances are such as 
to clearly preclude informal settlement, and the district director so 
finds and states his reasons therefor as provided in Sec. 200.35, he may 
restrict settlement to that provided in Sec. 200.71.

<R05>
Sec. 200.65  Answer admitting facts.

    If the respondent desires to waive the hearing on the allegations of 
fact set forth in the order to show cause, and does not contest the 
facts, the answer may consist of a statement that the respondent admits 
all material allegations of fact charged in the citation to be true. The 
district director shall thereupon base the decision on the citation and 
such answer although such an answer shall not affect the respondent's 
right to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, or the 
right to appeal.

Sec. 200.66  Prehearing conferences.

    In any proceeding the administrative law judge may, upon his own

    (c) The possibility of obtaining stipulations, admissions of facts 
and of documents;
    (d) The limitation of the number of expert witnesses; and

administrative law judge shall issue an order which recites the action 
taken thereat, the amendments allowed to the pleadings and the 
agreements made by the parties or their qualified representatives as to 
any of the matters considered, and which limits the issues for hearing 
to those not disposed of by admission or agreement; and such order shall 
control the subsequent course of the proceedings, unless modified for 
good cause by a subsequent order.

    Where the applicant on an application for a permit has requested a 
hearing and does not appear at the appointed time and place, and

Sec. 200.69  Suspension, revocation, or annulment.

    If on the date set for the hearing respondent does not appear and no

    At any time prior to final action thereon the applicant may, by 
filing written notice with the district director, withdraw his 
application. If such a notice is filed after referral to the 
administrative law judge of a proceeding on an application for a permit 
and prior to issuance of his recommended decision or decision thereon, 
the district director shall move the administrative law judge to dismiss 
the proceedings as moot. If such a notice is filed while the proceeding 
is before the district director and prior to final action thereon, that 
is, either (a) after issuance of a notice of contemplated disapproval 
and before referral of the proceeding to the administrative law judge or 
(b) after issuance by the administrative law judge of his recommended 
decision and prior to the district director's order disapproving the 
application, the district director shall, by order, dismiss the 
proceeding.

Sec. 200.71  Adjudication based upon written submissions.

    The respondent may waive the hearing before the administrative law 
judge, and stipulate that the matter will be adjudicated by the district 
director based upon written submissions. Written submissions may include 
stipulations of law or facts, proposed findings of fact and conclusions 
of law, briefs, or any other documentary material. The pleadings 
together with the written submissions of both the attorneys for the 
Government and the respondent shall constitute the record on which the 
initial decision shall be

[[Page 15]]

based. The election to contest the citation without a hearing under this 
section does not affect the respondent's right to appeal.

<R05>
Sec. 200.72  Before citation.

    If a respondent surrenders the permit before citation, the district 
director may accept the surrender. But if the evidence, in the opinion

or annulment, the surrender shall be refused and the district director 
shall issue the citation.

<R05>
Sec. 200.73  After citation.

    If a respondent surrenders the permit after citation and prior to an 
initial decision, the district director may accept the surrender of the 
permit and dismiss the proceeding as moot. If, however, in the opinion 
of the district director, the evidence is such as to warrant suspension, 
revocation or annulment, as the case may be, the surrender of the permit 
shall be refused, and the proceeding shall continue.

    All motions shall be made and addressed to the officer before whom 
the proceeding is pending, and copies of all motion papers shall be 
served upon the other party or parties. Such officer may dispose of any 
motion without oral argument, but he may, if he so desires, set it down 
for hearing and request argument. He may dispose of such motion prior to 
the hearing on the merits or he may postpone the disposition until the 
hearing on the merits. No appeal may be taken from any ruling on a 
motion until the whole record is certified for review. Examples of 
typical motions may be found in the Rules of Civil Procedure referred to 
in Sec. 200.2.

<R05>
Sec. 200.80  Applications.

    In hearings on the contemplated disapproval of applications there 
may be incorporated in the record sufficient testimony, reports, 
affidavits and other documents to be considered only for the limited 
purpose of establishing probable cause for the issuance of the notice of 
contemplated disapproval by showing that the district director had 
reason to believe that the applicant is not entitled to a permit. The 
burden of proof shall be upon the applicant to produce evidence to show 
he is entitled to a permit. The district director may, instead of 
following the aforementioned procedure, assume the burden of going 
forward.

                                General 


<R05>
Sec. 200.82  Stipulations at hearing.

    If there has been no prehearing conference under Sec. 200.66, the 
administrative law judge shall at the beginning of the hearing, require 
that the parties attempt to arrive at such stipulations as will 
eliminate the necessity of taking evidence with respect to allegations 
of fact concerning which there is no substantial dispute. The 
administrative law judge should take similar action, where it appears 
appropriate, throughout the hearing and should call and conduct any 
conferences which he deems advisable with a view to the simplification, 
clarification, and disposition of any of the issues involved.


<R05>
Sec. 200.83  Evidence.

    Any evidence which would be admissible under the rules of evidence 
governing proceedings in matters not involving trial by jury in the 
Courts of the United States, shall be admissible and controlling as far 
as possible: Provided, That the administrative law judge may relax such 
rules in any hearing when in his judgment such relaxation would not 
impair the rights of either party and would more speedily conclude the 
hearing, or would better serve the ends of justice. Except as provided 
in Sec. 200.81, the proponent of an order shall have the burden of 
proof. Every party shall have the right to present his case or defense 
by oral or documentary evidence, depositions, duly authenticated copies 
of records and documents, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct 
such reasonable cross-examination as may be required for a full and true 
disclosure of the facts. The administrative law judge shall have the 
right in his discretion to limit the number of witnesses whose testimony 
may be merely cumulative and shall, as a matter of policy, not only 
exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence but shall 
also limit the cross-examination of witnesses to reasonable bounds so as 
not to unnecessarily prolong the hearing and unduly burden the record. 
Material and relevant evidence shall not be excluded, because it is not 
the best evidence, unless its authenticity is challenged, in which case 
reasonable time shall be given to establish its authenticity. When 
portions only of a document are to be relied upon, the offering party 
shall prepare the pertinent excerpts, adequately identified, and shall 
supply copies of such excerpts, together with a statement indicating the 
purpose for which such materials will be offered, to the administrative 
law judge and to the other parties. Only the excerpts, so prepared and 
submitted, shall be received in the record. However, the whole of the 
original document should be made available for examination and for use 
by opposing counsel for purposes of cross-examination. Compilations, 
charts, summaries

[[Page 17]]

of data and photostatic copies of documents may be admitted in evidence 
if the proceedings will thereby be expedited, and if the material upon 
which they are based is available for examination by the parties. 
Objections to the evidence shall be in short form, stating the grounds 
relied upon. The transcript shall not include argument or debate on 
objections, except as ordered by the administrative law judge, but shall 
include the rulings thereon.


<R05>
Sec. 200.84  Closing of hearings; arguments, briefs and proposed findings.

    Before closing a hearing, the administrative law judge shall inquire 
of each party whether he has any further evidence to offer, which 
inquiry and the response thereto shall be shown in the record. The 
administrative law judge may hear arguments of counsel and may limit the 
time of such arguments at his discretion, and may, in his discretion, 
allow briefs to be filed on behalf of either party but shall closely 
limit the time within which the briefs for both parties shall be filed, 
so as to avoid unreasonable delay. The administrative law judge shall 
also ascertain whether the parties desire to submit proposed findings 
and conclusions, together with supporting reasons, and if so a period of 
not more than 15 days (unless extended by the administrative law 
judge)--after the close of the hearing or receipt of a copy of the 
record, if one is requested--will be allowed for such purpose.


<R05>
Sec. 200.85  Reopening of the hearing.

    The Director, the district director or the administrative law judge, 
as the case may be, may, as to all matters pending before him, in his 
discretion reopen the hearing (a) in case of default where applicant 
failed to request a hearing or to appear after one was set, upon 
petition setting forth reasonable grounds for such failure, and (b) in 
case any party desires leave to adduce additional evidence upon petition 
summarizing such evidence, establishing its materiality and stating 
reasonable grounds why such party with due diligence was unable to 
produce such evidence at the hearing.

<R05>
Sec. 200.86  Stenographic record.

    A stenographic record shall be made of the testimony and 
proceedings, including stipulations and admissions of fact (but not 
arguments of counsel unless otherwise ordered by the administrative law 
judge) in all proceedings. A transcript of the evidence and proceedings 
at the hearing shall be made in all cases.


<R05>
Sec. 200.87  Oath of reporter.

    The reporter making the stenographic record shall subscribe an oath 
before the administrative law judge, to be filed in the record of the 
case, that he will truly and correctly report the oral testimony and 
proceedings at such hearing and accurately transcribe the same to the 
best of his ability.

the hearing is closed. Administrative law judges shall also be 
responsible for the preparation, certification and forwarding of reports

arrangement with district directors and representatives of the Chief 
Counsel, shall have access to facilities and temporary use of personnel 
at such times and places as are needed in the prompt dispatch of

    An administrative law judge shall, at any time, withdraw from any 
proceeding if he deems himself disqualified; and upon the filing in good 
faith by the applicant or respondent, or by the attorney for the 
Government, of a timely and sufficient affidavit of facts showing 
personal bias or otherwise warranting the disqualification of any 
administrative law judge, the Director shall upon appeal as provided in 
Sec. 200.115, if the administrative law judge fails to disqualify 
himself, determine the matter as a part of the record and decision in 
the proceeding. If he decides the administrative law judge should have 
declared himself disqualified, he will remand the record for hearing de 
novo before another administrative law judge. If the Director should 
decide against the disqualification of the administrative law judge, the 
proceeding will be reviewed on its merits.


<R05>
Sec. 200.97  Powers.

    Administrative law judges shall have authority to (a) administer

depositions to be taken whenever the ends of justice would be served 
thereby; (e) regulate the course of the hearing; (f) hold conferences

parties; (g) dispose of procedural requests or similar matters; (h) 
render recommended decisions in proceedings on applications for permits, 
and in suspension, revocation, or annulment proceedings against permits; 
(i) call, examine and cross-examine witnesses, including hostile or 
adverse witnesses when he deems such action to be necessary to a just 
disposition of the cause, and introduce into the record documentary or 
other evidence; and (j) take any other action authorized by rule of the 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms consistent with the 
Administrative Procedure Act.

Sec. 200.98  Separation of functions.

    Administrative law judges shall perform no duties inconsistent with 
their duties and responsibilities as such. Administrative law judges may 
be assigned duties not inconsistent with the performance of their 
functions as administrative law judges. Save to the extent required for 
the disposition of ex parte matters as required by law, no 
administrative law judge shall consult any person or party as to any 
fact in issue unless upon notice and opportunity for all parties to 
participate. The functions of the administrative law judge shall be 
entirely separated from the general investigative functions of the 
agency. No officer, employee, or agent engaged in the performance of 
investigative or prosecuting functions in any proceeding shall, in that 
or a factually related proceeding, participate or advise in the 
administrative law judge's or Director's decision, or in the agency 
review on appeal, except as a witness or counsel in the proceedings. The 
administrative law judge may not informally obtain advice or opinions 
from the parties or their counsel, or from any officer or employee of 
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, as to the facts or the 
weight or interpretation to be given to the evidence. He may, however, 
informally obtain advice on matters of law from officers or employees 
who were not engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting 
functions in that or a factually related proceeding. This limitation 
does not apply to the Director, and the administrative law judge may, at 
any time, consult with and obtain instructions from him on questions of 
law and policy.

Sec. 200.99  Conduct of hearing.

    The administrative law judge is charged with the duty of conducting 
a fair and impartial hearing and of maintaining order in form and manner 
consistent with dignity. In the event that counsel or any person or 
witness in any proceeding shall refuse to obey the orders of the 
administrative law judge, or

[[Page 19]]

be guilty of disorderly or contemptuous language or conduct in 
connection with any hearing, the administrative law judge may, for good 
cause stated in the record, suspend the hearing, and, in the case of an 
attorney, recommend that the Director report the matter to the Director 
of Practice for disciplinary action. The refusal of a witness to answer 
any question which has been ruled to be proper shall be considered by 
the administrative law judge in determining the weight to be given all 
the testimony of that witness.

Sec. 200.100  Unavailability of administrative law judge.

    In the event that the administrative law judge designated to conduct 
a hearing becomes unavailable before the filing of his findings and 
decision or recommended decision, the Director may assign the case to 
another administrative law judge for the continuance of the proceeding, 
in accordance with the regulations in this part in the same manner as if

informing the applicant of his contemplated action and affording the 
applicant not more than 10 days in which to submit proposed findings and

support thereof. If the district director, after consideration of the 
record of the hearing and of any proposed findings, conclusions or 
exceptions filed with him by the applicant, approves the findings, 
conclusions and recommended decision of the administrative law judge, he 
shall by order approve or disapprove of the application in accordance 
therewith. If, after such consideration, he disapproves of the findings, 
conclusions and recommended decision of the administrative law judge, in 
whole or in part, he shall by order make such findings and conclusions 
as in his opinion are warranted by the law and facts in the record. Any 
decision of the district director ordering the disapproval of an 
application for a permit shall state the findings and conclusions upon 
which it is based, including his ruling upon each proposed finding, 
conclusion and exception to the administrative law judge's recommended 
decision, together with a statement of his findings and conclusions, and

Sec. 200.115  Appeal on petition to the Director.

    An appeal to the Director is required prior to application to the 
Federal courts for review. An appeal may be taken by the applicant or 
respondent or by the district director. Such appeal shall be taken by 
filing a petition for review on appeal with the Director within 15 days 
of the service of the order disapproving an application for a permit or 
the initial decision suspending, revoking or annulling a permit. The 
petition must set forth facts tending to show action of an arbitrary 
nature, or action without reasonable warrant in fact, or action contrary 
to law and regulations. A copy of the petition shall be filed with the 
district director or served on the respondent or applicant as the case 
may be. In the event of such appeal, the district director shall 
immediately certify and forward the complete original record, by 
certified mail, to the Director, for his consideration and review.

Sec. 200.116  Review by Director.

    The Director, on appeal on petition for review, shall afford a 
reasonable opportunity for the submission of proposed findings, 
conclusions or exceptions with reasons in support thereof and an 
opportunity for oral argument. He may alter or modify any finding of the 
administrative law judge (or of the district director in application 
proceedings) and may affirm, reverse, or modify the decision of the 
administrative law judge (or of the district director in initial 
application proceedings), or he may remand the case for further hearing, 
but he shall not consider evidence which is not a part of the record. 
Appeals and petitions for review shall not be decided by the Director in 
any proceeding in which he has engaged in investigation or prosecution, 
and in such event he shall so state his disqualification in writing and 
refer the record to the Under Secretary for appropriate action. The 
Under Secretary may designate an Assistant Secretary or one of his 
principal aides to consider any proceeding instead of the Director. The 
original copy of the decision on review shall be placed in the official 
record of the proceeding, a signed duplicate original shall be served 
upon the applicant or respondent and a copy shall be transmitted to the 
district director. When, on appeal, the Director affirms the decision of 
the district director or the administrative law judge, as the case may 
be, disapproving an application or suspending, revoking or annulling a 
permit, such action shall not supersede the decision of the district 
director or the administrative law judge and such decision shall be 
final.

that, in the case of industrial use permits, any time after a citation 
has been issued withdrawals of tax-free spirits or specially denatured 
spirits by such permittee may, in the discretion of the district 
director or Director, be restricted to the quantity which, together with 
the quantity then on hand, is necessary to carry on legitimate 
operations under such permit. The district director may, in restricting 
the permittee to his legitimate needs, refuse to issue any withdrawal 
permit.

 Subpart Ca--Rum Imported Into the United States From Areas Other Than 
                   Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands


<R05>
Sec. 250.30  Excise taxes.

    Distilled spirits excise taxes, less the estimated amounts necessary 
for payment of refunds and drawbacks, collected on all rum imported into 
the United States (including rum from possessions other than Puerto Rico 
and the Virgin Islands), will be deposited into the Treasuries of Puerto 
Rico and the Virgin Islands according to the formula described in 
Sec. 250.31. The amount deposited into the Treasuries of Puerto Rico and 
the Virgin Islands shall be the lesser of $10.50, or the rate imposed by 
26 U.S.C. 5001(a)(1) (including adjustments to the effective tax rate 
under 26 U.S.C. 5010), on each proof gallon of rum imported into the 
United States.

[T.D. ATF-203, 50 FR 15888, Apr. 23, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 250.31  Formula.

    (a) The amount of excise taxes collected on rum that is imported 
into the United States from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin 
Islands shall be deposited into the Treasuries of Puerto Rico and the 
Virgin Islands at the rate prescribed in 26 U.S.C. 7652(f). The 
distribution of such amount between Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands 
shall be computed by using a permanent base percentage, which represents 
the excise taxes collected on rum brought into the United States from 
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands during fiscal year 1983. This base 
percentage is 87.626889 percent for Puerto Rico and 12.373111 percent 
for the Virgin Islands. The formula shall be as follows:
    (1) Multiply the total excise taxes collected on rum brought into 
the United States (including rum from Puerto Rico and the Virgin 
Islands) during the previous fiscal year (October 1-September 30) by the 
base percentages to determine the relative shares of the entire U.S. rum 
market that will be allotted to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands;
    (2) Subtract each of these shares from the excise taxes collected on 
rum transported to the United States from Puerto Rico and the Virgin 
Islands, respectively, during the previous fiscal year to determine each 
possession's loss or gain in relation to the previous fiscal year's U.S. 
rum market. Divide

[[Page 30]]

these results by the excise taxes collected on rum imported during the 
previous fiscal year from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin 
Islands.
    (b) Notwithstanding the formula prescribed in paragraph (a) above, 
the Virgin Islands' share of the excise taxes on rum imported into the 
United States from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands 
shall not exceed 49 percent nor drop below 12.373111 percent. Puerto 
Rico's share of the excise taxes on rum imported into the United States 
from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands shall not 
exceed 87.626889 percent nor drop below 51 percent.
    (c) The percentage for the distribution of the excise taxes 
collected on rum imported into the United States from areas other than 
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, that will be paid over to the 
Treasuries of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, shall be effective on 
March 1 of each year, and shall remain in effect until March 1 of the 
following year.
    (d) The method for transferring the excise tax collections on rum 
imported from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, into 
the Treasuries of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands shall be the same 
as the method used for transferring excise taxes into the Treasury of 
Puerto Rico on distilled spirits (with an alcohol content of at least 92 
percent rum) brought into the United States from Puerto Rico.
    (e) The formula prescribed in this section shall take effect on 
March 1, 1987. Prior to that date, Puerto Rico shall continue to receive 
86.4 percent of the eligible excise taxes on rum imported from areas 
other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The Virgin Islands shall 
continue to receive 13.6 percent of these eligible excise taxes until 
March 1, 1987.

   Subpart Cb--Products Coming Into the United States From Puerto Rico


<R05>
Sec. 250.35  Taxable status.

    (a) Liquors coming into the United States from Puerto Rico, except 
as provided in Sec. 250.36, are subject to a tax equal to the internal 
revenue tax imposed on the production in the United States of like 
liquors. Articles coming into the United States from Puerto Rico, except 
as provided in Sec. 250.36, are subject to tax on the liquors contained 
therein at the rates imposed in the United States on like liquors of 
domestic production.
    (b) The excise taxes collected on distilled spirits or articles 
containing distilled spirits shall be deposited into the Treasury of 
Puerto Rico only if at least 92 percent of the alcoholic content of such 
products is rum. The amount deposited into the Treasury of Puerto Rico 
shall not exceed the lesser of $10.50, or the rate imposed by 26 U.S.C. 
5001(a)(1) (including adjustments to the effective tax rate under 26 
U.S.C. 5010), on each proof gallon of such distilled spirits or 
articles, other than eligible articles, containing distilled spirits 
coming into the United States or consumed on the island. Such excise tax 
deposits will be reduced by the estimated amount necessary for payment 
of refunds and drawbacks.
    (c) Except for products described in 26 U.S.C. 7652(c), no excise 
taxes shall be deposited into the Treasury of Puerto Rico if an excise 
tax subsidy is provided by Puerto Rico that is of a kind different from, 
or in an amount per value or volume of production greater than, any 
subsidy offered by Puerto Rico to industries manufacturing products not 
subject to Federal excise tax.

imposed in the United States by 26 U.S.C. 5001.
    (b) A credit against the tax imposed on distilled spirits by 26 
U.S.C. 7652 is allowable under 26 U.S.C. 5010 on each proof gallon of 
alcohol derived from eligible wine or from eligible flavors which do not 
exceed 2\1/2\ percent of the finished product on a proof gallon basis. 
The credit is allowable at the time the tax is payable as if it 
constituted a reduction in the rate of tax.
    (c) Where credit against the tax is desired, the person liable for 
the tax shall establish an effective tax rate in accordance with 
Sec. 250.79a. The effective tax rate established will be applied to each 
withdrawal or other disposition of the distilled spirits for consumption

Sec. 250.79a  Computation of effective tax rate.

    (a) The proprietor shall compute the effective tax rate for 
distilled spirits containing eligible wine or eligible flavors as the 
ratio of the numerator and denominator as follows:
    (1) the numerator will be the sum of:
    (i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product 
(exclusive of distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors), 
multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001;
    (ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, 
multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5041(b) (1), (2), or 
(3), as applicable; and
    (iii) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits derived from 
eligible flavors used in the product, multiplied by the tax rate 
prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001, but only to the extent that such distilled 
spirits exceed 2\1/2\% of the denominator prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section.
    (2) The denominator will be the sum of:
    (i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product, 
including distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors; and
    (ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, 
multiplied by twice the percentage of alcohol by volume of each, divided 
by 100.
    (b) In determining the effective tax rate, quantities of distilled 
spirits, eligible wine, and eligible flavors will be expressed to the 
nearest tenth of a proof gallon. The effective tax rate may be rounded 
to as many decimal places as the proprietor deems appropriate, provided 
that, such rate is expressed no less exactly than the rate rounded to 
the nearest whole cent, and the effective tax rates for all products 
will be consistently expressed to the same number of decimal places. In 
such case, if the number is less than five it will be dropped; if it is 
five or over, a unit will be added.
    (c) The following is an example of the use of the formula.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Proof gallons by which distilled spirits derived from eligible 
flavors exceed 2\1/2\% of the total proof gallons in the batch 
(100.9-(2\1/2\%) x 3.371.8=16.6).

controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and 
implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except 
that the words ``at least 80 percent'' shall be replaced by the words 
``more than 50 percent'' in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 
26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the 
rules for a ``controlled group of corporations'' apply in a similar 
fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole 
proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a 
group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or 
sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one 
taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make 
remittances by EFT.
    (3) A taxpayer who is required by this section to make remittances 
by EFT, shall make a separate EFT remittance and file a separate tax 
return, for each premises from which distilled spirits, wine, or beer is 
withdrawn upon determination of tax.
    (b) Requirements. (1) On or before January 10 of each calendar year, 
except for a taxpayer already remitting the tax by EFT, each taxpayer 
who was liable for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million 
dollars in distilled spirits taxes combining tax liabilities incurred 
under this part and parts 19 and 251 of this chapter, a gross amount

[[Page 49]]

equal to or exceeding five million dollars in wine taxes combining tax 
liabilities incurred under this part and parts 240 and 251 of this 
chapter, or a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in 
beer taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 
245 and 251 of this chapter during the previous calendar year, shall 
notify, in writing, the regional director (compliance), for each region 
in which taxes are paid. The notice shall be an agreement to make 
remittances by EFT.
    (2) For each return filed in accordance with this part, the taxpayer 
shall direct the taxpayer's bank to make an electronic fund transfer in 
the amount of the taxpayment to the Treasury Account as provided in 
paragraph (e) of this section. The request shall be made to the bank 
early enough for the transfer to be made to the Treasury Account by no 
later than the close of business on the last day for filing the return, 
prescribed in Sec. 250.112 or Sec. 250.113. The request shall take into 
account any time limit established by the bank.
    (3) If a taxpayer was liable for less than five million dollars in 
distilled spirits taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this 
part and parts 19 and 251 of this chapter, less than five million 
dollars in wine taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part 
and parts 240 and 251 of this chapter, or less than five million dollars 
in beer taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and 
parts 245 and 251 of this chapter during the preceding calendar year, 
the taxpayer may choose either to continue remitting the tax as provided 
in this section or to remit the tax with the return as prescribed by 
Sec. 250.112. Upon filing the first return on which the taxpayer chooses 
to discontinue remitting the tax by EFT and to begin remitting the tax 
with the tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the regional director 
(compliance) by attaching a written notification to the tax return, 
stating that no taxes are due by EFT, because the tax liability during 
the preceding calendar year was less than five million dollars, and that 
the remittance shall be filed with the tax return.
    (c) Remittance. (1) Each taxpayer shall show on the tax return, 
information about remitting the tax for that return by EFT and shall 
file the return with the Chief, Puerto Rico Operations.
    (2) Remittances shall be considered as made when the taxpayment by 
electronic fund transfer is received by the Treasury Account. For 
purposes of this section, a taxpayment by electronic fund transfer shall 
be considered as received by the Treasury Account when it is paid to a 
Federal Reserve Bank.
    (3) When the taxpayer directs the bank to effect an electronic fund 
transfer message as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any 
transfer data record furnished to the taxpayer, through normal banking 
procedures, will serve as the record of payment, and shall be retained 
as part of required records.
    (d) Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT. The taxpayer is subject to 
a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5684, 6651, or 6656, as applicable, for 
failure to make a taxpayment by EFT on or before the close of business 
on the prescribed last day for filing.
    (e) Procedure. Upon the notification required under paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, the regional director (compliance) will issue to the 
taxpayer an ATF Procedure entitled, Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund 
Transfer. This publication outlines the procedure a taxpayer is to 
follow when preparing returns and EFT remittances in accordance with 
this part. The U.S. Customs Service will provide the taxpayer with 
instructions for preparing EFT remittances for payments to be made to 
the U.S. Customs Service.

                  Permit to Ship Liquors and Articles 


<R05>
Sec. 250.114  Permit to ship required.

    Before liquors and articles of Puerto Rican manufacture, upon which 
all internal revenue taxes have been paid or deferred as prescribed in 
this subpart, may be shipped to the United States, a permit to ship, 
Form 487B, must be obtained from the Secretary as provided in 
Secs. 250.115 and 250.116.


<R05>
Sec. 250.115  Application, Form 487B.

    Application for permit to ship to the United States liquors and 
articles of Puerto Rican manufacture on which all taxes have been paid 
or deferred as prescribed in this subpart shall be made by the shipper 
on Form 487B, in sextuple. Each Form 487B will be given a serial number, 
by the applicant, beginning with ``1'' for the first day of January of 
each year and running consecutively thereafter to December 31, 
inclusive. This serial number will be prefixed by the last two digits of 
the calendar year, e.g. ``61--1.'' All copies of the form shall be 
delivered to the revenue agent for execution of his certification 
thereon and forwarding of all copies to the Secretary within sufficient 
time to allow for the issuance of the permit and customs inspection as 
provided in Sec. 250.116.


<R05>
Sec. 250.116  Issuance of permit, Form 487B, and customs inspection.

    If the application has been properly executed and the Secretary, or 
his delegate, finds that all internal revenue taxes imposed under 26 
U.S.C. 7652(a), have been computed under the provisions of this part and 
have been paid or, pursuant to a sufficient bond, have been deferred 
under the applicable provisions of this part, he will execute his permit 
on all copies thereof, retain one copy of the form, return two copies to 
the shipper, and send three copies to the district director of customs 
in Puerto Rico. The shipper will submit the two copies of the Form 487B 
to the district director of customs at least six hours prior to the 
intended lading of the merchandise. The district director of customs 
will then inspect the merchandise covered by the Form 487B after which 
he will execute his certificate on each copy of Form 487B indicating all 
exceptions. If discrepancies appear indicating differences between the 
quantity covered by Form 487B and the quantity actually contained in the 
shipment or the improper tax payment of the merchandise, he will 
withhold release of the shipment and notify the

[[Page 51]]

Secretary of such discrepancies. Thereupon, such discrepancies must be 
corrected in the shipping documents and additional tax paid, if 
required, prior to release of the merchandise. The district director of 
customs, upon release of the merchandise for shipment, will retain one 
copy of the Form 487B, return two copies to the shipper, and send two 
copies to the district director of customs at the port of arrival in the 
United States, one of which should be mailed and the other dispatched on 
the vessel concerned for the guidance of the ATF officer who will handle 
the cargo. After the shipment has been cleared by the district director 
of customs in Puerto Rico, the shipper shall retain one copy of the Form 
487B and send one copy thereof, with other shipping documents, to the 
district director of customs at the port of arrival.

copies of Form 487B from the district director of customs in Puerto 
Rico, the district director of customs at the port of arrival shall 
inspect the merchandise to determine whether the quantity specified on

exceptions found at the time of discharge. The statement of exceptions 
should show the serial number of each case or other shipping container 
which sustained a loss, the quantity of liquor reported shipped in such

breakage. Where the statement is made on the basis of bottles missing or 
lost due to other cause, the number and size of bottles lost should be

this maximum limitation, not to exceed 0.009 gram of carbon dioxide per 
100 milliliters of wine, will be allowed where the amount of carbon 
dioxide in excess of 0.392 gram per 100 milliliters of wine was due to 
mechanical variations which could not be completely controlled under 
good commercial practices. Such tolerance will not be allowed where it 
is found that the limitation of 0.392 gram of carbon dioxide per 100 
milliliters of wine is continuously or intentionally exceeded, or where

250.262  Determination of tax on distilled spirits.

    (a) If the certificate required by Sec. 250.205 covers distilled 
spirits, and the distilled spirits are not being transferred under 
subparts 0 or Oa of this part, the tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. 7652 which 
provides for a tax equal to the tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5001 will be 
collected on each proof gallon, and fractional part thereof, contained 
in the shipment.
    (b) A credit against the tax imposed on distilled spirits by 26 
U.S.C. 7652 is allowable under 26 U.S.C. 5010 on each proof gallon of 
alcohol derived from eligible wine or from eligible flavors which do not 
exceed 2 \1/2\ percent of the finished product on a proof gallon basis. 
The credit is allowable at the time the tax is payable as if it 
constituted a reduction in the rate of tax.
    (c) Where credit against the tax is desired, the person liable for 
the tax shall establish an effective tax rate in accordance with 
Sec. 250.262a. The effective tax rate established will be applied to 
each withdrawal or other disposition of the distilled spirits within the 
United States.

<R05>
Sec. 250.262a  Computation of effective tax rate.

    (a) The proprietor shall compute the effective tax rate for 
distilled spirits containing eligible wine or eligible flavors as the 
ratio of the numerator and denominator as follows:

[[Page 65]]

    (1) The numerator will be the sum of:
    (i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product 
(exclusive of distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors), 
multipled by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001;
    (ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, 
multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5041(b) (1), (2), or 
(3), as applicable; and
    (iii) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits derived from 
eligible flavors used in the product, multiplied by the tax rate 
prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001, but only to the extent that such distilled 
spirits exceed 2\1/2\% of the denominator prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section.
    (2) The denominator will be the sum of:
    (i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product, 
including distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors; and
    (ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, 
multiplied by twice the percentage of alcohol by volume of each, divided 
by 100.
    (b) In determining the effective tax rate, quantities of distilled 
spirits, eligible wine, and eligible flavors will be expressed to the 
nearest tenth of a proof gallon. The effective tax rate may be rounded 
to as many decimal places as the proprietor deems appropriate, provided 
that, such rate is expressed no less exactly than the rate rounded to 
the nearest whole cent, and the effective tax rates for all products 
will be consistently expressed to the same number of decimal places. In 
such case, if the number is less than five it will be dropped; if it is 
five or over, a unit will be added.
    (c) The following is an example of the use of the formula.

Sec. 250.267  Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.

    (a) Each person bringing liquors and articles into the United States 
from the Virgin Islands who was liable, during a calendar year, for a 
gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in distilled 
spirits taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and 
parts 19 and 251 of this chapter, a gross amount equal to or exceeding 
five million dollars in wine taxes combining tax liabilities incurred 
under this part and parts 240 and 251 of this chapter, or a gross amount 
equal to or exceeding five million dollars in beer taxes combining tax 
liabilities incurred under this part and parts 25 and 251 of this 
chapter, shall use a commercial bank in making payment by electronic 
fund transfer (EFT), as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, of 
such taxes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment of such taxes by 
cash, check, or money order is not authorized for a person bringing 
liquors and articles into the United States from the Virgin Islands who 
is required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. For purposes 
of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is to be summarized 
separately for distilled spirits taxes, wine taxes, or beer taxes, and 
is defined as the gross tax liability on all taxable withdrawals from 
premises in the United States and importations (including products of 
the same tax class brought into the United States from Puerto Rico or 
the Virgin Islands) during the calendar year, without regard to any 
drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises from which such 
activities are conducted.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, a ``person'' includes a 
controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and 
implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except 
that the words ``at least 80 percent'' shall be replaced by the words 
``more than 50 percent'' in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 
26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the 
rules for a ``controlled group of corporations'' apply in a similar 
fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole 
proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a 
group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or 
sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one 
person for the purpose of determining who is required to make 
remittances by EFT.
    (c) Electronic fund transfer or EFT means any transfer of funds, 
other than a transaction originated by check, draft, or similar paper 
instrument, which is initiated through an electronic terminal, 
telephonic instrument, or computer of magnetic tape, so as to order, 
instruct, or authorize a financial institution to either debit or credit 
an account, in accordance with procedures established by the U.S. 
Customs Service.
    (d) Each person who is required by this section to make remittances 
by EFT shall make the EFT remittance in accordance with the requirements

provision of law, and will not result in any increase in cost to the 
Government or hinder the effective administration of this part.

equivalent to the sale of distilled spirits, every person engaged in 
business as an importer of distilled spirits, who sells, or offers for 
sale, warehouse receipts for distilled spirits stored in customs bonded 
warehouses, or elsewhere, incurs liability to special tax as a dealer in 
liquors at the place where the warehouse receipts are sold or offered 
for sale, and must file return and pay occupational tax as provided in 
Sec. 251.30.

                     Distilled Spirits and Perfumes 


<R05>
Sec. 251.40  Distilled spirits.

    (a) A tax is imposed on all distilled spirits in customs bonded 
warehouses or imported into the United States at the rate prescribed by 
26 U.S.C. 5001 on each proof gallon and a proportionate tax at a like 
rate on all fractional parts of each proof gallon. All products of 
distillation, by whatever name known, which contain distilled spirits, 
are considered to be distilled spirits and are taxed as such. The tax 
will be determined at the time of importation,

[[Page 80]]

or, if entered into bond, at the time of withdrawal therefrom.
    (b) A credit against the tax imposed on distilled spirits by 26 
U.S.C. 5001 is allowable under 26 U.S.C. 5010 on each proof gallon of 
alcohol derived from eligible wine or from eligible flavors which do not 
exceed 2\1/2\ percent of the finished product on a proof gallon basis. 
The credit is allowable at the time the tax is payable as if it 
constituted a reduction in the rate of tax.
    (c) Where credit against the tax is desired, the person liable for 
the tax shall establish an effective tax rate in accordance with 
Sec. 251.40a. The effective tax rate established will be applied to each 
entry.

<R05>
Sec. 251.40a  Computation of effective tax rate.

    (a) The proprietor shall compute the effective tax rate for 
distilled spirits containing eligible wine or eligible flavors as the 
ratio of the numerator and denominator as follows:
    (1) The numerator will be the sum of:
    (i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product 
(exclusive of distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors), 
multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001;
    (ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, 
multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5041(b)(1), (2), or 
(3), as applicable; and
    (iii) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits derived from 
eligible flavors used in the product, multiplied by the tax rate 
prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001, but only to the extent that such distilled 
spirits exceed 2\1/2\% of the denominator prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section.
    (2) The denominator will be the sum of:
    (i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product, 
including distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors; and
    (ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, 
multiplied by twice the percentage of alcohol by volume of each, divided 
by 100.
    (b) In determining the effective tax rate, quantities of distilled 
spirits, eligible wine, and eligible flavors will be expressed to the 
nearest tenth of a proof gallon. The effective tax rate may be rounded 
to as many decimal places as the proprietor deems appropriate, provided 
that, such rate is expressed no less exactly than the rate rounded to 
the nearest whole cent, and the effective tax rates for all products 
will be consistently expressed to the same number of decimal places. In 
such case, if the number is less than five it will be dropped; if it is 
five or over, a unit will be added.
    (c) The following is an example of the use of the formula.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Proof gallons by which distilled spirits derived from eligible 
flavors exceed 2\1/2\% of the total proof gallons in the batch 
(100.9-(2\1/2\%) x 3.371.8=16.6).

gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in distilled 
spirits taxes combining tax liabilities incurred

[[Page 83]]

under this part and parts 19 and 250 of this chapter, a gross amount 
equal to or exceeding five million dollars in wine taxes combining tax 
liabilities incurred under this part and parts 240 and 250 of this 
chapter, or a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in 
beer taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 
25 and 250 of this chapter, shall use a commercial bank in making 
payment by electronic fund transfer (EFT), as defined in paragraph (c) 
of this section, of such taxes during the succeeding calendar year. 
Payment of such taxes by cash, check, or money order is not authorized 
for an importer who is required, by this section, to make remittances by 
EFT. For purposes of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is 
to be summarized separately for distilled spirits taxes, wine taxes, or 
beer taxes, and is defined as the gross tax liability on all taxable 
withdrawals from premises in the United States and importations 
(including products of the same tax class brought into the United States 
from Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands) during the calendar year, 
without regard to any drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises 
from which such activities are conducted by the taxpayer.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a 
controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and 
implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except 
that the words ``at least 80 percent'' shall be replaced by the words 
``more than 50 percent'' in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 
26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the 
rules for a ``controlled group of corporations'' apply in a similar 
fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole 
proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a 
group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or 
sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one 
taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make 
remittances by EFT.
    (c) Electronic fund transfer or EFT means any transfer of funds, 
other than a transaction originated by check, draft, or similar paper 
instrument, which is initiated through an electronic terminal, 
telephonic instrument, or computer of magnetic tape, so as to order, 
instruct, or authorize a financial institution to either debit or credit 
an account, in accordance with procedures established by the U.S. 
Customs Service.
    (d) An importer who is required by this section to make remittances 
by EFT shall make the EFT remittance in accordance with the requirements 
of the U.S. Customs Service.

    (a) In lieu of preparing a certificate of effective tax rate 
computation each time distilled spirits containing eligible wine or 
eligible flavors are imported as prescribed in Sec. 251.76(c), an

shall cause to be submitted to the ATF National Laboratory, 1401 
Research Boulevard, Rockville, MD 20850, the following:
    (1) The samples prescribed in Sec. 251.76(b)(1) and an 8-ounce

previously approved standard effective tax rate shall obtain a copy of 
the approval from the person to whom it was issued and, over the 
signature of the importer or other duly authorized person, place the 
following declaration:

    I declare under the penalties of perjury that this approval has been 
examined by me and, to best of my knowledge and belief, the standard 
effective tax rate established for this product is applicable to all 
like products contained in this shipment.

    (d) A standard effective tax rate may not be employed until approved 
by the

[[Page 87]]

ATF National Laboratory. The importer shall file or furnish a copy of 
the standard effective tax rate approval in the manner prescribed in 
Sec. 251.76(d). The use of a standard effective tax rate shall not 
relieve an importer from the payment of any tax found to be due. The 
Director may at any time require an importer to immediately discontinue 
the use of a standard effective tax rate.

<R05>
Sec. 251.221  Alternate methods or procedures.

    (a) Application. An importer who desires to use an alternate method 
or procedure in lieu of a method or procedure prescribed by this part 
shall file application, in triplicate, with the regional director 
(compliance) of the region in which his place of business is located. If 
the importer has several places of business at which he desires to use 
such alternate method or procedure, a separate application shall be 
submitted for each. Each application shall:
    (1) Specify the name, address, and permit number of the importer to 
which it relates;
    (2) State the purpose for which filed; and
    (3) Specifically describe the alternate method or procedure and set 
forth the reasons therefor.

No alternate method or procedure relating to the assessment, payment, or 
collection of tax shall be authorized under this paragraph.
    (b) Approval. When an application for use of an alternate method or 
procedure is received, the regional director (compliance) shall 
determine whether approval thereof would unduly hinder the effective 
administration of this part or would result in jeopardy to the revenue. 
The regional director (compliance) shall forward two copies of the 
application to the Director, together with a report of his findings and 
his recommendation. The Director may approve the alternate method or 
procedure if he finds that:
    (1) Good cause has been shown for the use of the alternate method or 
procedure;
    (2) The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and 
consistent with the effect intended by, the specifically prescribed 
method or procedure, and affords equivalent security to the revenue; and
    (3) The alternate method or procedure will not be contrary to any 
provision of law, and will not result in an increase in cost to the 
Government or hinder the effective administration of this part.

No alternate method or procedure shall be used until approval has been 
received from the Director. Authorization for the alternate method or 
procedure may be withdrawn whenever in the judgment of the Director, the 
revenue is jeopardized or the effective administration of this part is 
hindered by the continuation of such authorization.

Sec. 252.22  Vessels employed in the fisheries.

    Liquors may be withdrawn or laden under the provisions of paragraphs 
(b) and (e) of Sec. 252.21 relating to vessels employed in the 
fisheries, only for use on vessels of the United States documented to 
engage in the fisheries and foreign fishing vessels of 5 net tons or 
over if the district director of customs is satisfied by reason of the 
quantity requested in the light of (a) whether the vessel is employed in 
substantially continuous fishing activities, and (b) the vessel's 
complement, that none of the liquors to be withdrawn or laden are 
intended to be removed from the vessel in, or otherwise returned to, the 
United States. Such withdrawal or lading shall be conditioned upon 
compliance with the applicable provisions of this part. Lading of such 
liquors for use on such vessels shall be subject to approval by the 
district director of customs of a special written application by the 
withdrawer or the vessel's master on customs Form 5125 (in duplicate) 
and a statement by the withdrawer in his application or notice on the 
required ATF Form 5100.11, 5110.30, 1582-A, 1582-B, or 1689, as the case 
may be, that the liquors are to be laden for use as supplies on a vessel 
employed in the fisheries. The original application on customs Form 
5125, after approval, shall be stamped with the serial number of the ATF 
Form 5100.11, 5110.30, 1582-A, 1582-B, or 1689, as the case may be, and 
the date thereof, and shall be returned by the district director of 
customs to the withdrawer or vessel's master for use as prescribed 
below. Approval of each such application shall be subject to the 
condition that the original shall be presented thereafter by the 
withdrawer or the vessel's master to the district director of customs 
within 24 hours (excluding Saturday, Sunday,

[[Page 101]]

and holidays) after each subsequent arrival of the vessel at a customs 
port or station and that an accounting shall be made at the time of such 
presentation of the disposition of the liquors until the district 
director of customs is satisfied that they have been consumed on board, 
or landed under customs supervision, and takes up the authorization. The 
approval of customs Form 5125 shall be subject to the further condition 
that any such liquors remaining on board while the vessel is in port 
shall be safeguarded in the manner and to such extent as the director of 
the port or place of arrival shall deem necessary. When such liquors 
have been accounted for to the satisfaction of the district director of 
customs, he shall execute his certificate of lading and use on both 
copies of the ATF Form 5100.11, 5110.30, 1582-A, 1582-B, or 1689, as the 
case may be, and forward the original of the form to the regional 
director (compliance) designated thereon. In the event of a failure on 
the part of the withdrawer or the master of the vessel to comply with 
the conditions of this section or upon receipt of evidence that the 
liquors were not lawfully used as supplies on the vessel, the district 
director of customs shall advise the regional director (compliance) of 
all the facts in the case for determination of any liability incurred. 
In the case of liquors withdrawn without payment of tax, assessment of 
tax liability found to have been incurred shall be made against the 
principal on the bond. In the case of taxpaid or tax determined liquors, 
the regional director (compliance) shall determine as to whether to make 
demand upon the principal and the surety on the bond or to disallow the 
claim as the case may be.

    Note: As used in this section, the word ``withdrawer'' shall mean 
the person executing the application or notice, ATF Form 5100.11,

    Assistant regional commissioners may approve applications relating 
to the withdrawal or lading of liquors for use on aircraft of those 
foreign countries which will allow, to aircraft registered in the United 
States and engaged in foreign trade, privileges substantially reciprocal 
to the privileges allowed herein to aircraft of a foreign country. Where 
application is made to withdraw or lade liquors for use on aircraft of 
other countries, which it is claimed reciprocate similar privileges to 
aircraft of the United States, the applicant must first establish the 
right of such withdrawal or lading. In appropriate cases, the applicant 
should request the Secretary of Commerce to find and advise the 
Secretary of the Treasury that such foreign country or countries allow, 
or will allow, substantially reciprocal privileges to aircraft of the 
United States.

    Whenever, under the provisions of this part, the claimant desires 
drawback of tax on distilled spirits or wines to be exported, laden for 
use on vessels or aircraft, or transferred to and deposited in a 
foreign-trade zone, or, in the case of distilled spirits, transferred to 
a customs bonded warehouse, as authorized in Secs. 252.171 and 252.211, 
prior to the receipt by the regional regulatory administrator of the 
certified copy of ATF Form 5110.30, or 1582-A, as the case may be, as 
prescribed by this part, he shall file bond on Form 2738 with the 
regional regulatory administrator as provided in Sec. 252.51. The penal 
sum of the bond shall be sufficient to cover the amount of drawback 
which will at any time constitute a charge against the bond:

Provided, That the maximum penal sum shall not exceed $200,000, but in 
no case shall the penal sum be less than $1,000: Provided further,  That 
where the claimant desires to remove distilled spirits to a customs 
bonded warehouse as provided in Sec. 252.171(d) and the terms of his 
bond on Form 2738, then in force, do not cover such removals, he shall 
either file a consent of surety on Form 1533 to extend the terms of such 
bond to cover such removals or file a new bond on Form 2738.

Sec. 252.66  Strengthening bonds.

    In all cases where the penal sum of any bond becomes insufficient, 
the principal shall either give a strengthening bond with the same 
surety to attain a sufficient penal sum, or give a new bond to cover the 
entire liability. Strengthening bonds will not be approved where any 
notation is made thereon which is intended, or which may be construed, 
as a release of any former bond, or as limiting the amount of any bond 
to less than its full penal sum. Strengthening bonds shall show the 
current date of execution and the effective date.

validity or impairing the efficiency of such bond. Executors, 
administrators, assignees, receivers, trustees, or other persons acting

principal, shall execute and file a new bond or obtain the consent of 
the surety or sureties on the existing bond or bonds. Where, under the 
provisions of Sec. 252.72, the surety on any bond given under this 
subpart has filed an application to be relieved of liability under said 
bond and the principal desires or intends to continue the business or 
operations to which such bond relates, he shall file a valid superseding 
bond to be effective on or before the date specified in the surety's 
notice. If the principal does not file a new or superseding bond when 
required, he shall discontinue the operations intended to

be covered by such bond forthwith. New or superseding bonds shall show 
the current date of execution and the effective date.

reports, if any) received from the officer required to certify the same 
under the provisions of subpart N of this part, the regional director 
(compliance) is of the opinion that the distilled spirits reported lost 
had been unlawfully diverted, or had been lost by theft, he will advise 
the exporter by letter:
    (a) Of the identity of the containers;
    (b) Of the amount of the loss;
    (c) Of the circumstances indicating diversion or theft;
    (d) That allowance of the loss will be subject to filing (1) proof 
that such loss is allowable under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 5008(a) 
and (f), and (2) claim for remission of the tax on the spirits so lost; 
and
    (e) That action in respect of the loss will be withheld for a period 
of not more than 30 days to afford an opportunity to file such proof and 
claim.

In any case in which distilled spirits are lost during transportation, 
as described in Sec. 252.301, whether by theft or otherwise, the 
regional director (compliance) may require the exporter to file a claim 
for relief in accordance with Sec. 252.303. When circumstances may 
warrant, extensions of additional time for submission of the proof and 
claim may be granted by the regional director (compliance). Where such 
proof and claim are not filed within the 30-day period, or such 
extensions as the regional director (compliance) may grant, the tax on 
the distilled spirits diverted or lost will be assessed, or liability 
asserted against the bond covering the shipment, as the case may be.

<R05>
Sec. 270.22  Determination of wholesale price of large cigars removed before January 1, 1991.

    (a) General rule. All cigars of the same brand, size, and packaging 
are taxed at the same rate except where otherwise specifically provided. 
When the manufacturer establishes a suggested delivered price to 
retailers

[[Page 146]]

(wholesale price), he shall do so according to the principles in the 
definition of ``wholesale price'' in Sec. 270.11 and in this section. 
``Suggested delivered price'' is the price at which the manufacturer 
intends for the cigars to be sold to retailers, and based on which the 
manufacturer's price to distributors and wholesalers is established 
through the usual trade discount. The price at which a cigar is in fact 
usually sold to retailers in transactions at arm's length from the 
manufacturer is the best evidence of whether the manufacturer's 
suggested delivered price is properly set. While it is not expected that 
a manufacturer will exercise any control over the prices actually paid 
by retailers in transactions with independent distributors, it is the 
manufacturer's responsibility to exercise reasonable care to assure that 
his suggested price to retailers (wholesale price) used as the basis for 
tax determination is consistent with prices actually paid by retailers. 
(Where there is no suggested delivered price adequately supported by 
actual sales to retailers, see paragraph (i) of this section).
    (b) Pricing for different packaging. If different bona fide 
wholesale prices are applicable to different types of packaging (e.g., 
boxes of 25 and boxes of 50), then the cigars in each type of packaging 
are taxed on the basis of their respective wholesale prices.
    (c) Pricing of seconds. If some of an otherwise identical cigar 
brand and size (1) are distinctive from other such cigars because of 
physical imperfections, (2) are offered to the consumer through clear 
labeling as ``imperfects'', ``seconds'', ``throw-outs'', or a comparable 
commonly understood term, and (3) the manufacturer has a separate 
wholesale price for such cigars, then they are taxed on the basis of 
this separate wholesale price.
    (d) Combination packages. If a manufacturer has a wholesale price 
for a combination package containing cigars of different sizes, the 
cigars are taxed based on that combination wholesale price. If there is 
no wholesale price for the combination, then the cigars are taxed based 
on their individual wholesale prices.
    (e) Promotional pricing. Special promotional pricing arrangements, 
whether applicable to all or only a part of removals, do not alter the 
taxable wholesale price of large cigars. For the purposes of applying 
this rule, any temporary reduction in price is presumed to be for 
promotional purposes.
    (f) Removals for another person. If a manufacturer makes taxable 
removals of a brand and size of cigar only for distribution by others 
who establish the suggested delivered price to retailers (wholesale 
price), then the tax is based on such wholesale price irrespective of 
the fact that it is not directly established by the manufacturer making 
the taxable removals.
    (g) Removals for sale to retailers only. If a manufacturer makes 
taxable removals of a brand and size of cigars for arm's length sales to 
retailers only, the tax is based on the manufacturer's selling price, 
applying the principles of inclusion and exclusion contained in the 
definition of ``wholesale price'' in Sec. 270.11.
    (h) Change in wholesale price. When a manufacturer decides to change 
the wholesale price of a brand and size of large cigars, there may be 
some of these cigars which were removed before the price change decision 
and were tax determined on the basis of the old wholesale price, which 
in fact are later sold to retailers under the new wholesale price. In 
this situation, the cigars will be considered to have been properly tax 
determined, unless at the time of removal the manufacturer had reason to 
believe that the cigars would be sold under the new wholesale price, 
considering all information which was or should have been available to 
him. After the price change decision, cigars may properly be removed and 
tax determined on the basis of the old wholesale price if the 
manufacturer has reason to know, at the time of removal, that they will 
be sold to retailers before the new wholesale price is effective. 
Conversely, cigars removed after a price change decision which can 
reasonably be expected to be sold to retailers under the new wholesale 
price must be tax determined on the basis of the new wholesale price, 
even if the removal takes place before the new

[[Page 147]]

wholesale price is announced or becomes effective. A price change 
decision is held to be made at the earliest time during the price change 
considerations when it might reasonably be concluded that the decision 
to change the price had in fact been reached.
    (i) Determination of wholesale price by Associate Director 
(Compliance Operations). The Associate Director (Compliance Operations) 
will determine the wholesale price for tax purposes where the 
manufacturer has no suggested delivered price to retailers as 
contemplated by the definition of ``wholesale price'' in Sec. 270.11 and 
as discussed in paragraph (a) of this section. Listings of such 
wholesale prices and their comparable retail prices will be published as 
necessary in the ATF Bulletin (see Sec. 71.41(d) of this chapter) for 
use by manufacturers in properly determining the tax on removals of 
large cigars for which there is no suggested delivered price to 
retailers. If a manufacturer has cigars which are not covered by the 
existing published listing, and for which he has no suggested delivered 
price to retailers, the manufacturer shall submit a written request to 
the Associate Director (Compliance Operations) for a determination of 
the wholesale price applicable to such cigars for tax purposes. If any 
of these cigars are removed before such determination, the manufacturer 
shall ascertain the wholesale price to the best of his ability based on 
the prices which are included in the published listing and other 
pertinent information available to him, and shall use that price for 
calculation and payment of the tax and for other tax purposes under this 
part, pending the determination by the Associate Director (Compliance 
Operations). If the wholesale price used by the manufacturer for tax 
payment differs from that subsequently determined by the Associate 
Director (Compliance Operations) to be the wholesale price for tax 
purposes, then the manufacturer shall make an adjustment in his tax 
return to correct the amount of tax paid. Any tax adjustment shall be 
made on the return covering the date on which notification of the 
wholesale price determination was received from the Associate Director 
(Compliance Operations).

<R05>



<R05>
Sec. 270.22a  Determination of sale price of large cigars removed on or after January 1, 1991.

    (a) General rule. The tax imposed on large cigars is computed based 
on the price for which the large cigars are sold by the manufacturer. 
Large cigars are taxed at a percentage of the sale price, as prescribed 
by Sec. 270.21. For example, for cigars removed during 1991 and 1992, if 
the price for which they are sold is $235.294 per thousand or less, the 
tax imposed will be 10.625% of such price. For large cigars sold for a 
price of more than $235.294 per thousand, the maximum tax is $25 per 
thousand for removals during 1991 and 1992. A similar computation, with 
the increased percent figure and maximum tax rate, is applicable for 
removals on or after January 1, 1993.
    (b) Price for which sold. The ``price'' for which cigars are sold 
includes the total consideration paid for the cigars. Any charge which 
is made incident to placing the cigars in condition ready for use is 
included in the sale price. Similar rules to 26 U.S.C. 4216(a) and the 
regulations thereunder, relating to charges to be included in the price 
and excluded from the price, shall apply.
    (c) Exclusions from price. The tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. chapter 52 
or section 7652 is excluded in determining the price for which large 
cigars are sold. The amount of any retail sales tax imposed by any state 
or political subdivision thereof or the District of Columbia is likewise 
excluded (whether the liability for such tax is imposed on the vendor or 
vendee), if the retail sales tax is stated as a separate charge.
    (d) Constructive sale price rules. Rules similar to the constructive 
sale price rules set forth in 26 U.S.C. 4216(b) and the implementing 
regulations in 26 CFR 48.4216(b)-1 through 48.4216(b)-4 shall be applied 
for purposes of determining the price for which large cigars are sold.

[[Page 148]]

    (e) Readjustments in sale price. Anticipated downward readjustments 
in sale price are not taken into account in computing the tax. The tax 
must be based upon the original price for which the cigars were sold 
unless the readjustments have actually been made prior to the close of 
the period for which the tax return is filed. However, if the price upon

    The manufacturer of tobacco products shall be liable for the taxes 
imposed on tobacco products by 26 U.S.C. 5701: Provided, That when 
tobacco products are transferred in bond pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 5704, to 
the bonded premises of another such manufacturer or an export warehouse 
proprietor, the transferee shall become liable for the tax upon receipt 
by him of such products and the transferor shall thereupon be relieved 
of his liability for the tax. When tobacco products are released in

[[Page 149]]

bond from customs custody for transfer to the bonded premises of a 
manufacturer of tobacco products, the transferee shall become liable for 
the tax on such products upon release from customs custody. Any person 
who possesses tobacco products in violation of 26 U.S.C. 5751(a)(1) or 
(2), shall be liable for a tax equal to the tax on such products.

The tax so assessed shall be in addition to the penalties imposed by law 
for failure to pay such tax when required. Except in cases where delay 
may jeopardize collection of the tax, or where the amount is nominal or 
the result of an evident mathematical error, no such assessment shall be 
made until and after notice has been afforded such person to show cause 
against assessment. The person will be allowed 45 days from the date of 
such notice to show cause, in writing, against such assessment.

noted.


<R05>
Sec. 270.31  Liability for special tax.

    (a) Manufacturer of tobacco products. Every manufacturer of tobacco 
products shall pay a special (occupational) tax at a rate specified by 
Sec. 270.32 of the part. The tax shall be paid on or before the date of 
commencing the business of manufacturing tobacco products, and 
thereafter every year on or before July 1. On commencing business, the 
tax shall be computed from the first day of the month in which liability 
is incurred, through the following June 30. Thereafter, the tax shall be 
computed for the entire year (July 1 through June 30).
    (b) Transition rule. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, 
a proprietor engaged in the business of manufacturing tobacco products 
on January 1, 1988, shall be treated as having commenced business on 
that date. The special tax imposed by this transition rule shall cover 
the period January 1, 1988, through June 30, 1988, and shall be paid on 
or before April 1, 1988.
    (c) Each place of business taxable. A manufacturer of tobacco 
products incurs special tax liability at each place of business in which 
an occupation subject to special tax is conducted. A place of business 
means the entire office, plant or area of the business in any one 
location under the same proprietorship. Passageways, streets, highways, 
rail crossings, waterways, or partitions dividing the premises are not 
sufficient separation to require additional special tax, if the 
divisions of the premises are otherwise contiguous.

(26 U.S.C. 5143, 5731)


<R05>
Sec. 270.32  Rates of special tax.

    (a) General. Title 26 U.S.C. 5731(a)(1) imposes a special tax of 
$1,000 per year on every manufacturer of tobacco products.
    (b) Reduced rate for small proprietors. Title 26 U.S.C. 5731(b) 
provides for a reduced rate of $500 per year with respect to any 
manufacturer of tobacco products whose gross receipts (for the most 
recent taxable year ending before the first day of the taxable period to 
which the special tax imposed by Sec. 270.31 relates) are less than 
$500,000. The ``taxable year'' to be used for determining gross receipts 
is the taxpayer's income tax year. All gross receipts of the taxpayer 
shall be included, not just the gross receipts of the business subject 
to

[[Page 150]]

special tax. Proprietors of new businesses that have not yet begun a 
taxable year, as well as proprietors of existing businesses that have 
not yet ended a taxable year, who commence a new activity subject to 
special tax, qualify for the reduced special (occupational) tax rate, 
unless the business is a member of a ``controlled group''; in that case, 
the rules of paragraph (c) of this section shall apply.
    (c) Controlled group. All persons treated as one taxpayer under 26 
U.S.C. 5061(e)(3) shall be treated as one taxpayer for the purpose of 
determining gross receipts under paragraph (b) of this section. 
``Controlled group'' means a controlled group of corporations, as 
defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563 and implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-
1 through 1.1563-4, except that the words ``at least 80 percent'' shall 
be replaced by the words ``more than 50 percent'' in each place they 
appear in subsection (a) of 26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the 
implementing regulations. Also, the rules for a ``controlled group of 
corporations'' apply in a similar fashion to groups which include 
partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more 
than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or 
more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of 
the controlled group are one taxpayer for the purpose of this section.
    (d) Short taxable year. Gross receipts for any taxable year of less 
than 12 months shall be annualized by multiplying the gross receipts for 
the short period by 12 and dividing the result by the number of months 
in the short period as required by 26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).
    (e) Returns and allowances. Gross receipts for any taxable year 
shall be reduced by returns and allowances made during such year under 
26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).

Sec. 270.33  Special tax returns.

    (a) General. Special tax shall be paid by return. The prescribed 
return is ATF Form 5630.5, Special Tax Registration and Return. Special 
tax returns, with payment of tax, shall be filed with ATF in accordance 
with instructions on the form.
    (b) Preparation of ATF Form 5630.5. All of the information called 
for on Form 5630.5 shall be provided, including:
    (1) The true name of the taxpayer.
    (2) The trade name(s) (if any) of the business(es) subject to 
special tax.
    (3) The employer identification number (see Sec. 270.34).
    (4) The exact location of the place of business, by name and number 
of building or street, or if these do not exist, by some description in 
addition to the post office address. In the case of one return for two 
or more locations, the address to be shown shall be the taxpayer's 
principal place of business (or principal office, in the case of a 
corporate taxpayer).
    (5) The class(es) of special tax to which the taxpayer is subject.
    (6) Ownership and control information: that is, the name, position, 
and residence address of every owner of the business and of every person 
having power to control its management and policies with respect to the 
activity subject to special tax. ``Owner of the business'' shall include 
every partner, if the taxpayer is a partnership, and every person owning 
10% or more of its stock, if the taxpayer is a corporation. However, the 
ownership and control information required by this paragraph need not be 
stated if the same information has been previously provided to ATF in 
connection with a permit application, and if the information previously 
provided is still current.
    (c) Multiple locations and/or classes of tax. A taxpayer subject to 
special tax for the same period at more than one location or for more 
than one class of tax shall--
    (1) File one special tax return, ATF Form 5630.5, with payment of 
tax, to cover all such locations and classes of tax; and
    (2) Prepare, in duplicate, a list identified with the taxpayer's 
name, address (as shown on ATF Form 5630.5), employer identification 
number, and period covered by the return. The list shall show, by 
States, the name, address, and tax class of each location for which 
special tax is being paid. The original of the list shall be filed with 
ATF in accordance with instructions on the return, and the copy shall be 
retained at the taxpayer's principal place

[[Page 151]]

of business (or principal office, in the case of a corporate taxpayer) 
for the period specified in Sec. 270.185.
    (d) Signing of ATF Forms 5630.5--(1) Ordinary returns. The return of 
an individual proprietor shall be signed by the individual. The return 
of a partnership shall be signed by a general partner. The return of a 
corporation shall be signed by any officer. In each case, the person 
signing the return shall designate his or her capacity as ``individual 
owner,'' ``member of firm,'' or, in the case of a corporation, the title 
of the officer.
    (2) Fiduciaries. Receivers, trustees, assignees, executors, 
administrators, and other legal representatives who continue the 
business of a bankrupt, insolvent, deceased person, etc., shall indicate 
the fiduciary capacity in which they act.
    (3) Agent or attorney in fact. If a return is signed by an agent or 
attorney in fact, the signature shall be preceded by the name of the 
principal and followed by the title of the agent or attorney in fact. A 
return signed by a person as agent will not be accepted unless there is 
filed, with the ATF office with which the return is required to be 
filed, a power of attorney authorizing the agent to perform the act.
    (4) Perjury statement. ATF Forms 5630.5 shall contain or be verified 
by a written declaration that the return has been executed under the 
penalties of perjury.

Sec. 270.34  Employer identification number.

    (a) Requirement. The employer identification number (defined in 26 
CFR 301.7701-12) of the taxpayer who has been assigned such a number 
shall be shown on each special tax return, including amended returns, 
filed under this subpart. Failure of the taxpayer to include the 
employer identification number may result in the imposition of the 
penalty specified in Sec. 70.113 of this chapter.
    (b) Application for employer identification number. Each taxpayer 
who files a special tax return, who has not already been assigned an 
employer identification number, shall file IRS Form SS-4 to apply for 
one. The taxpayer shall apply for and be assigned only one employer 
identification number, regardless of the number of places of business 
for which the taxpayer is required to file a special tax return. The 
employer identification number shall be applied for no later than 7 days 
after the filing of the taxpayer's first special tax return. IRS Form 
SS-4 may be obtained from the director of an IRS service center or from 
any IRS district director.
    (c) Preparation and filing of IRS Form SS-4. The taxpayer shall 
prepare and file IRS Form SS-4, together with any supplementary 
statement, in accordance with the instructions on the form or issued in 
respect to it.

Sec. 270.35  Issuance, distribution, and examination of special tax stamps.

    (a) Issuance of special tax stamps. Upon filing a properly executed 
return on ATF Form 5630.5 together with the full remittance, the 
taxpayer will be issued an appropriately designated special tax stamp. 
If the return covers multiple locations, the taxpayer will be issued one 
appropriately designated stamp for each location listed on the 
attachment required by Sec. 270.33(c)(2), but showing, as to name and 
address, only the name of the taxpayer and the address of the taxpayer's 
principal place of business (or principal office in the case of a 
corporate taxpayer).
    (b) Distribution of special tax stamps for multiple locations. On 
receipt of the special tax stamps, the taxpayer shall verify that there 
is one stamp for each location listed on the attachment to ATF Form 
5630.5. The taxpayer shall designate one stamp for each location and 
type on each stamp the address of the business conducted at the location 
for which that stamp is designated. The taxpayer shall then forward each 
stamp to the place of business designated on the stamp.
    (c) Examination of special tax stamps. All stamps denoting payment 
of special tax shall be kept available for inspection by ATF officers, 
at the location for which designated, during business hours.

Sec. 270.36  Changes in special tax stamps.

    (a) Change in name. If there is a change in the corporate or firm 
name, or in the trade name, as shown on ATF Form 5630.5, the 
manufacturer shall file an amended special tax return as soon as 
practicable after the change, covering the new corporate or firm name, 
or trade names. No new special tax is required to be paid. The 
manufacturer shall attach the special tax stamp for endorsement of the 
change in name.
    (b) Change in proprietorship--(1) General. If there is a change in 
the proprietorship of a tobacco factory, the successor shall pay a new 
special tax and obtain the required special tax stamps.
    (2) Exemption for certain successors. Persons having the right of 
succession provided for in paragraph (c) of this section may carry on 
the business for the remainder of the period for which the special tax 
was paid, without paying a new special tax, if within 30 days after the 
date on which the successor begins to carry on the business, the 
successor files a special tax return on Form 5630.5 with ATF, which 
shows the basis of succession. A person who is a successor to a business 
for which special tax has been paid and who fails to register the 
succession is liable for special tax computed from the first day of the 
calendar month in which he or she began to carry on the business.
    (c) Persons having right of succession. Under the conditions 
indicated in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the right of succession 
will pass to certain persons in the following cases:
    (1) Death. The widowed spouse or child, or executor, administrator, 
or other legal representative of the taxpayer;
    (2) Succession of spouse. A husband or wife succeeding to the 
business of his or her spouse (living);
    (3) Insolvency. A receiver or trustee in bankruptcy, or an assignee 
for benefit of creditors;
    (4) Withdrawal from firm. The partner or partners remaining after 
death or withdrawal of a member.
    (d) Change in location. If there is a change in location of a 
taxable place of business, the manufacturer shall, within 30 days after 
the change, file with ATF an amended special tax return covering the new 
location. The manufacturer shall attach the special tax stamp or stamps, 
for endorsement of the change in location. No new special tax is 
required to be paid. However, if the manufacturer does not file the 
amended return within 30 days, the manufacturer is required to pay a new 
special tax and obtain a new special tax stamp.

sold for consumption in the United States any forfeited, condemned, or 
abandoned tobacco products in his custody upon which the Federal tax has 
not been paid, if in his opinion the sale thereof will not bring a price 
equal to the tax due and payable thereon and the expenses incident to 
the sale thereof. Where the products are not sold the officer may 
deliver them to a Federal or State hospital or institution (if they are 
fit for consumption) or cause their destruction by burning completely or 
by rendering them unfit for consumption. Where such products are sold 
they shall be released by the officer having custody thereof only after 
they are properly packaged and taxpaid. A receipt from the regional 
director (compliance) evidencing payment of tax on such products shall 
be presented to the officer having custody of the products, which tax 
shall be considered part of the sales price. Where tobacco products 
which have been packaged under the provisions of Part 290 or Part 295 of 
this chapter are to be released after payment of tax, the purchaser 
shall appropriately mark each package ``Federal Tax Paid (date)'' before 
the officer having custody of the products releases them:

Provided, That if the purchaser is a qualified manufacturer of tobacco 
products, or for products packaged under part 290 a qualified export 
warehouse proprietor, the products may be released without such marking 
of the packages if the manufacturer or proprietor does not intend to 
place such products on the domestic market for taxable products but will 
dispose of them otherwise, such as by destruction or return to bond 
through claim for refund, and files a written statement to that effect, 
in original only, with the officer having custody of the products. In 
the case of products forfeited under the internal revenue laws the sale 
shall be subject to the provisions of part 172 of this chapter.

Sec. 270.45  Alternate methods or procedures.

    A manufacturer of tobacco products, on specific approval by the 
Director as provided in this section, may use an alternate method or 
procedure in lieu of a method or procedure specifically prescribed in 
this part. The Director may approve an alternate method or procedure, 
subject to stated conditions, when he finds that--

procedure,
    (b) The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and 
consistent with the effect intended by, the specifically prescribed 
method or procedure, and affords equivalent security to the revenue, and

provision of law, and will not result in an increase in cost to the 
Government or hinder the effective administration of this part.

No alternate method or procedure relating to the giving of any bond or 
to

or procedure, he shall submit a written application to do so, in 
triplicate, to the regional director (compliance) for transmittal to the 
Director. The application shall specifically describe the proposed 
alternate method or procedure, and shall set forth the reasons therefor. 
Alternate methods or procedures shall not be employed until the 
application has been approved by the Director. The manufacturer shall, 
during the period of authorization of an alternate method or procedure, 
comply with the terms of the approved application. Authorization for any 
alternate method or procedure may be withdrawn whenever in the judgment 
of the Director the revenue is jeopardized or the effective

Variations from requirements granted under this section are conditioned 
on compliance with the procedures, conditions, and limitations set forth 
in the approval of the application. Failure to comply in good faith with 
such procedures, conditions, and limitations shall automatically 
terminate the authority for such variations and the manufacturer 
thereupon shall fully comply with the prescribed requirements of 
regulations from which the variations were authorized. Authority for any 
variations may be withdrawn whenever in the judgment of the Director the 
revenue is jeopardized or the effective administration of this part is 
hindered by the continuation of such variation. Where a manufacturer

to do so, in triplicate, to the regional director (compliance) for 
transmittal to the Director. The application shall describe the proposed 
variations and set forth the reasons therefor. Variations shall not be 
employed until the application has been approved. The manufacturer shall

Where a manufacturer desires to engage in another business within the 
factory he shall submit a written application to do so, in triplicate, 
to the regional director (compliance) for the region in which the 
factory is located, for his transmittal to the Director. A manufacturer 
shall not engage in such other business until the application is 
approved by the Director. The manufacturer shall retain, as part of his

Sec. 270.164  Special rule for taxes due for the month of September (effective after December 31, 1994).

    (a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the 
second semimonthly period for the month of September shall be divided 
into two payment periods, from the 16th day through the 26th day, and 
from the 27th day through the 30th day. The manufacturer shall file a 
return on Form 5000.24, and make remittance, for the period September 
16-26, no later than September 29. The manufacturer shall file a return 
on Form 5000.24, and make remittance, for the period September 27-30, no 
later than October 14.
    (2) Taxpayment not by electronic fund transfer. In the case of taxes 
not required to be remitted by electronic fund transfer as prescribed by 
Sec. 270.165a, the second semimonthly period of September shall be 
divided into two payment periods, from the 16th day through the 25th 
day, and the 26th day through the 30th day. The manufacturer shall file 
a return on Form 5000.24, and make remittance, for the period September 
16-25, no later than September 28. The manufacturer shall file a return 
on Form 5000.24, and make remittance, for the period September 26-30, no 
later than October 14.
    (b) Amount of payment: Safe harbor rule. (1) Taxpayers are 
considered to have met the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, if the amount paid no later than September 29 is not less than 
11/15 (73.3 percent) of the tax liability incurred for the semimonthly 
period beginning on September 1 and ending on September 15, and if any 
underpayment of tax is paid by October 14.
    (2) Taxpayers are considered to have met the requirements of 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, if the amount paid no later than 
September 28 is not less than 2/3rds (66.7 percent) of the tax liability 
incurred for the semimonthly period beginning on September 1 and ending 
on September 15, and if any underpayment of tax is paid by October 14.
    (c) Last day for payment. If the required due date for taxpayment 
for the periods September 16-25 or September 16-26 as applicable, falls 
on a Saturday or legal holiday, the return and remittance shall be due 
on the immediately preceding day. If the required due date falls on a 
Sunday, the return and remittance shall be due on the immediately 
following day.
    (d) Example. Payment of tax for the month of September--(1) Facts. 
X, a manufacturer of tobacco products required to pay taxes by 
electronic fund transfer, incurred tax liability in the amount of 
$30,000 for the first semimonthly period of September. For the period 
September 16-26, X incurred tax liability in the amount of $45,000, and 
for the period September 27-30, X incurred tax liability in the amount 
of $2,000.
    (2) Payment requirement. X's payment of tax in the amount of $30,000 
for the first semimonthly period of September is due no later than 
September 29 (Sec. 270.165(a)). X's payment of tax for the period 
September 16-26 is also due no later than September 29 
(Sec. 270.164(a)(1)). X may use the safe harbor rule to determine the 
amount of payment due for the period of September 16-26 
(Sec. 270.164(b)). Under the safe harbor rule, X's payment of tax must 
equal $21,990.00, 11/15ths of the tax liability incurred during the 
first semimonthly

[[Page 164]]

period of September. Additionally, X's payment of tax in the amount of 
$2,000 for the period September 27-30 must be paid no later than October 
14 (Sec. 270.164(a)(1)). X must also pay the underpayment of tax, 
$23,010.00, for the period September 16-26, no later than October 14 
(Sec. 270.164(b)).

    (a) General. Except as provided by Sec. 270.164, and paragraph (b) 
of this section, semimonthly returns on Form 5000.24 shall be filed, for 
each return period, not later than the 14th day after the last day of 
the return period. If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal 
holiday, the return and remittance shall be due on the immediately 
preceding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, except 
as provided by Sec. 270.164(c).
    (b) Postmark. The official postmark of the U.S. Postal Service 
stamped on the cover in which the return was mailed shall be considered 
the date of delivery of the tax return and, if the return was 
accompanied by a remittance, the date of delivery of the remittance. 
When the postmark is illegible, the manufacturer shall prove when the 
postmark was made. When the proprietor sends the tax return with or 
without remittance by registered mail or by certified mail, the date of 
registry or the date of the postmark on the sender's receipt of 
certified mail, as the case may be, shall be treated as the date of 
delivery of the tax return and, if accompanied, of the remittance.

Sec. 270.165a  Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.

    (a) General. (1) Each taxpayer who was liable, during a calendar 
year, for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in 
taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes 
combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 275 and 285 
of this chapter, shall use a commercial bank in making payment by 
electronic fund transfer (EFT) of taxes on tobacco products, cigarette 
papers, and cigarette tubes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment 
of taxes on tobacco products by cash, check, or money order, as 
described in Sec. 270.168, is not authorized for a taxpayer who is 
required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. For purposes of 
this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is defined as the gross 
tax liability on all taxable withdrawals and importations (including 
tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes brought into the 
United States from Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands) during the 
calendar year, without regard to any drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for 
all premises from which such activities are conducted by the taxpayer. 
Overpayments are not taken into account in summarizing the gross tax 
liability.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a 
controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and 
implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except 
that the words ``at least 80 percent'' shall be replaced by the words 
``more than 50 percent'' in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 
26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the 
rules for a ``controlled group of corporations'' apply in a similar 
fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole 
proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a 
group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or 
sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one 
taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make 
remittances by EFT.
    (3) A taxpayer who is required by this section to make remittances 
by EFT, shall make a separate EFT remittance and file a separate return, 
Form 5000.24, for each factory from which tobacco products are withdrawn 
upon determination of tax.
    (b) Requirements. (1) On or before January 10 of each calendar year, 
except for a taxpayer already remitting the tax by EFT, each taxpayer 
who was liable for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million 
dollars in taxes on

[[Page 165]]

tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes combining tax 
liabilities incurred under this part and parts 275 and 285 of this 
chapter, during the previous calendar year, shall notify, in writing, 
the regional director (compliance), for each region in which taxes are 
paid. The notice shall be an agreement to make remittances by EFT.
    (2) For each return filed in accordance with this part, the taxpayer 
shall direct the taxpayer's bank to make an electronic fund transfer in 
the amount of the tax payment to the Treasury Account as provided in 
paragraph (e) of this section. The request shall be made to the bank 
early enough for the transfer to be made to the Treasury Account by no 
later than the close of business on the last day for filing the return, 
prescribed in Sec. 270.165 or Sec. 270.167. The request shall take into 
account any time limit established by the bank.
    (3) If a taxpayer was liable for less than five million dollars in 
taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes 
combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 275 and 285 
of this chapter during the preceding calendar year, the taxpayer may 
choose either to continue remitting the tax as provided in this section 
or to remit the tax with the return on as prescribed by Sec. 270.168. 
Upon filing the first return which the taxpayer chooses to discontinue 
remitting the tax by EFT and to begin remitting the tax with the tax 
return, the taxpayer shall notify the regional director (compliance) by 
attaching a written notification to Form 5000.24, stating that no taxes 
are due by EFT, because the tax liability during the preceding calendar 
year was less than five million dollars, and that the remittance shall 
be filed with the tax return.
    (c) Remittance. (1) Each taxpayer shall show on the return, Form 
5000.24, information about remitting the tax for that return period by 
EFT and shall file the return with the ATF, in accordance with the 
instructions on Form 5000.24.
    (2) Remittances shall be considered as made when the taxpayment by 
electronic fund transfer is received by the Treasury Account. For 
purposes of this section, a taxpayment by electronic fund transfer shall 
be considered as received by the Treasury Account when it is paid to a 
Federal Reserve Bank.
    (3) When the taxpayer directs the bank to effect an electronic fund 
transfer message as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any 
transfer data record furnished to the taxpayer, through normal banking 
procedures, will serve as the record of payment, and shall be retained 
as part of required records.
    (d) Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT. The taxpayer is subject to 
a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5761, 6651, or 6656, as applicable, for 
failure to make a tax payment by EFT on or before the close of business 
on the prescribed last day for filing.
    (e) Procedure. Upon the notification required under paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, the regional director (compliance) will issue to the 
taxpayer an ATF Procedure entitled, Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund 
Transfer. This publication outlines the procedure a taxpayer is to 
follow when preparing returns and EFT remittances in accordance with 
this part. The U.S. Customs Service will provide the taxpayer with 
instructions for preparing EFT remittances for payments to be made to 
the U.S. Customs Service.

Sec. 270.181  General.

    Every manufacturer of tobacco products shall keep records of his 
operations and transactions which shall reflect, for each day, the 
information specified in Secs. 270.182 and 270.183. For the aforesaid 
purpose ``day'' shall mean calendar day, except that the regional 
director (compliance) may, upon application of the manufacturer by 
letter, in duplicate, authorize as such day for a factory a 24-hour 
cycle of operation other than the calendar day. A day once so 
established as other than the calendar day may be changed only by like 
application approved by the regional director (compliance). A 
manufacturer who maintains commercial records from which the required 
information may be readily ascertained may utilize such records for this 
purpose. Where a manufacturer does not maintain commercial records which 
adequately reflect the information required by this part concerning 
cigars and cigarettes, he shall keep a record on Form 3065 with respect 
to large cigars and on Form 3066 with respect to small cigars and large 
and small cigarettes. The manufacturer shall keep the auxiliary and 
supplemental records from which such records are compiled and shall keep 
supporting records, as specified in Secs. 270.184 and 270.186, of cigars 
and cigarettes removed subject to tax and transferred in bond. Except as 
provided in Secs. 270.184 and 270.186 the entries in the commercial or 
form records so maintained or kept shall be made not later than the 
close of the business day next following that on which the transactions 
occur. As used in this section the term ``business day'' shall mean any 
day other than Saturday, Sunday, a legal holiday in the District

of Columbia, or a statewide legal holiday in the State wherein the 
factory to which the records relate is located.

Sec. 270.212  Mark.

    Every package of tobacco products packaged in a domestic factory 
shall, before removal subject to tax, have adequately imprinted thereon, 
or on a label securely affixed thereto, a mark as specified in this 
section. The mark may consist of the name of the manufacturer removing 
the product subject to tax and the location (by city and State) of the 
factory from which the products are to be so removed, or may consist of 
the permit number of the factory from which the products are to be so 
removed. (Any trade name of the manufacturer approved as provided in 
Sec. 270.65 may be used in the mark as the name of the manufacturer.) As 
an alternative, where tobacco products are packaged and removed subject 
to tax by the same manufacturer, either at the same or different 
factories, the mark may consist of the name of such manufacturer if the 
factory where packaged is identified on or in the package by a means 
approved by the Director. Before using the alternative, the manufacturer 
shall notify the Director in writing of the name to be used as the name 
of the manufacturer and the means to be used for identifying the factory 
where packaged. If approved by him the Director shall return approved 
copies of the notice to the manufacturer. A copy of the approved notice 
shall be retained as part of the factory records at each of the 
factories operated by the manufacturer.

Sec. 270.255  Shortages and overages in inventory.

    Whenever a manufacturer of tobacco products makes a physical 
inventory of packaged tobacco products in bond, either as part of normal 
operations or when required by an ATF officer, and such inventory 
discloses a shortage or overage in such products by kind as recorded and 
reported (i.e. small cigarettes, large cigarettes, small cigars, large 
cigars, chewing tobacco, snuff, or pipe tobacco), the manufacturer shall 
enter such shortage or overage in the records required by Sec. 270.183. 
Shortages or overages in inventories made at different times may not be 
used to offset each other, but shall be recorded and reported 
separately. Unless the manufacturer establishes that a shortage was not 
caused by a removal subject to the tax the manufacturer shall determine 
the tax on any shortage, make an adjustment in Schedule A of his next 
semimonthly tax return and pay the tax thereon. If, after paying the tax 
on a shortage, the manufacturer satisfactorily establishes that the 
shortage was not caused by a removal subject to tax, then such payment 
would be an overpayment of tax which the manufacturer may recover as 
provided in Sec. 270.286. Where the manufacturer can establish prior to 
paying the tax on a shortage, that the shortage was not the result of a 
removal subject to tax he shall submit an explanation of such shortage 
with his report for the month in which the shortage was disclosed and, 
if appropriate, he may file claim for remission of tax liability as 
provided in Sec. 270.287. When an overage is disclosed which the 
manufacturer can explain, he shall include such explanation in his 
monthly report and refund of any overpayment may be recovered as 
provided in Sec. 270.286. Whenever a physical inventory discloses a 
shortage or overage of tobacco products which have not been packaged the 
manufacturer shall appropriately enter such shortage or overage in his 
records and shall, at the time required by the Regional Director 
(Compliance), furnish an explanation in the form of a claim for 
remission of tax liability as provided in Sec. 270.287. The manufacturer 
shall pay the tax on any shortage or portion thereof for which he is 
unable to furnish an explanation acceptable to the Regional Director 
(Compliance).

satisfaction of the regional director (compliance) that the claim is 
valid, shall be filed with the regional director (compliance) for the 
region in which the tax or liability was assessed, and the duplicate of 
the claim shall be retained by the manufacturer.

Sec. 270.282  Allowance of tax.

    Relief from the payment of tax on tobacco products may be extended 
to a

[[Page 177]]

manufacturer by allowance of the tax where the tobacco products after 
removal from the factory upon determination of tax and prior to the 
payment of such tax, are lost (otherwise than by theft) or destroyed, by 
fire, casualty, or act of God, while in the possession or ownership of 
the manufacturer who removed such products, or are withdrawn by him from 
the market. Any claim for allowance under this section shall be filed on 
Form 2635, in duplicate, with the regional director (compliance) for the 
region in which the products were removed, and shall show the date the 
tobacco products were removed from the factory. A claim relating to 
products lost or destroyed shall be supported as prescribed in 
Sec. 270.301. In the case of a claim relating to tobacco 
productswithdrawn from the market the schedule prescribed in 
Sec. 270.311 shall be filed with the regional director (compliance) for 
the region in which the products are assembled. The manufacturer may not 
anticipate allowance of his claim by making the adjusting entry in a tax 
return pending consideration and action on the claim. Tobacco products 
to which such a claim relates must be shown as removed on determination 
of tax in the return covering the period during which such products were 
so removed. Upon action on the claim by the regional director 
(compliance) he will return the copy of Form 2635 to the manufacturer as 
notice of such action, which copy, with the copy of any verified 
supporting schedules, shall be retained by the manufacturer. When such 
notification of allowance of the claim or any part thereof is received 
prior to the time the return covering the tax on the tobacco products to 
which the claim relates is to be filed, the manufacturer may make an 
adjusting entry and explanatory statement in that tax return. Where the 
notice of allowance is received after the filing of the return and 
taxpayment of the tobacco products to which the claim relates, the 
manufacturer may make an adjusting entry and explanatory statement in 
the next tax return(s) to the extent necessary to take credit in the 
amount of the allowance.

Sec. 270.283  Credit or refund of tax.

    The taxes paid on tobacco products may be credited or refunded 
(without interest) to a manufacturer on proof satisfactory to the 
regional director (compliance) that the claimant manufacturer paid the 
tax on tobacco products lost (otherwise than by theft) or destroyed, by 
fire, casualty, or act of God, while in the possession or ownership of 
such manufacturer, or withdrawn by him from the market. Any claim for 
credit or refund under this section shall be prepared on Form 2635 
(5620.8), in duplicate. Claims shall include a statement that the tax 
imposed on tobacco products by 26 U.S.C. 7652 or chapter 52, was paid in 
respect to the tobacco products covered by the claim, and that the 
products were lost, destroyed, or withdrawn from the market within 6 
months preceding the date the claim is filed. A claim for credit or 
refund relating to products lost or destroyed shall be supported as 
prescribed in Sec. 270.301, and a claim relating to products withdrawn 
from the market shall be accompanied by a schedule prepared and verified 
as prescribed in Secs. 270.311 and 270.313. The original and one copy of 
Form 2635 (5620.8), claim for credit, or the original of Form 2635 
(5620.8), claim for refund, shall be filed with the regional director 
(compliance) for the region in which the tax was paid, or where the tax 
was paid in more than one region with the regional director (compliance) 
for any one of the regions in which the tax was paid. Upon action by the 
regional director (compliance) on a claim for credit he will return the 
copy of Form 2635 to the manufacturer as notification of allowance or 
disallowance of the claim or any part thereof, which copy, with the

[[Page 178]]

copy of any verified supporting schedules, shall be retained by the 
manufacturer. When the manufacturer is notified of allowance of the 
claim for credit or any part thereof he shall make an adjusting entry 
and explanatory statement in the next tax return(s) to the extent 
necessary to take credit in the amount of the allowance. Prior to 
consideration and action on his claim the manufacturer may not 
anticipate allowance of his claim by taking credit in his tax return. 
The duplicate of a claim for refund, with the copy of any verified 
supporting schedules, shall be retained by the manufacturer.

are lost (otherwise than by theft) or destroyed, by fire, casualty, or 
act of God, while in the possession or ownership of such manufacturer. 
Where tobacco products are so lost or destroyed the manufacturer shall 
report promptly such fact, and the circumstances, to the regional 
director (compliance) for the region in which the factory is located. If 
the manufacturer wishes to be relieved of the tax liability thereon he 
shall also prepare a claim on Form 2635, in duplicate, setting forth the

such error is specifically identified and supported by records, the 
manufacturer may file claim for refund or may make an adjustment in his 
semimonthly tax return as provided in Sec. 270.164. (Section 6511, 26 
U.S.C., provides that, in most cases, any adjustment of claim for refund 
of an overpayment of tax on tobacco products must be made or filed 
within three years after the tax is paid.) If the manufacturer elects to 
file a claim for refund of an overpayment resulting from such a 
computational error, he shall do so on Form 2635 (5620.8), in duplicate. 
The original shall be filed with the regional director (compliance) for 
the region in which the tax was paid, and the duplicate retained by the 
manufacturer. Where an overpayment of tax on tobacco products results 
from other than a computational error any claim for refund or credit 
shall be made in accordance with subpart A of part 296 of this chapter.

the claim shall be filed with the regional director (compliance) for the 
region in which the factory is located. The claim shall specify the 
quantities of tobacco products on which claim is made and the tax 
liability in respect thereof, and shall set forth the circumstances 
surrounding the shortage and the reason the manufacturer believes tax is 
not due or payable. The regional director (compliance) will, after such 
investigation as he deems appropriate, allow the claim to the extent he 
is satisfied the shortage was due to operating losses such as damage 
during grading, sorting, or packaging, and was not caused by theft or 
other unlawful or improper removal. Upon action on the claim by the 
regional director (compliance) he will return the copy of Form 2635 to 
the manufacturer as notice of such action, which copy shall be retained

    (a) General. Where tobacco products are withdrawn from the market 
and the manufacturer desires to file claim under the provisions of 
Sec. 270.282 or Sec. 270.283, he shall assemble the products in or 
adjacent to a factory if they are to be returned to bond or at any 
suitable place if they are to be destroyed or reduced to materials. The 
manufacturer shall group the products according to the rates of tax 
applicable to the products, and shall prepare a schedule of the 
products, on ATF Form 3069 (5200.7), in triplicate. All copies of the

amount was actually paid. For each claim involving large cigars 
withdrawn from the market the manufacturer shall include a certification 
on either Form 3069 (5200.7) or Form 2635 (5620.8) to read as follows:

    The amounts claimed relating to large cigars are based on the lowest

verify the schedule and supervise disposition of the tobacco products, 
such officer shall, upon completion of his assignment, execute a 
certificate on all copies of the schedule to show the disposition and 
the date of disposition of the products. In connection with a claim for 
allowance the officer shall return one copy of the schedule to be 
included in the manufacturers records, and in connection with a claim 
for credit or refund, the officer shall return the original and one copy 
of the schedule to the manufacturer, the original of which the 
manufacturer shall attach to the claim, Form 2635 (5620.8), filed under

chapter, shall use a commercial bank in making payment by electronic 
fund transfer (EFT) of taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and 
cigarette tubes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment of taxes on 
tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes in any other 
form of remittance, as authorized in Sec. 270.355, is not authorized for 
a taxpayer who is required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. 
For purposes of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is 
defined as the gross tax liability on all taxable withdrawals and 
importations (including tobacco products, cigarette papers, and 
cigarette tubes brought into the United States from Puerto Rico or the 
Virgin Islands) during the calendar year, without regard to any 
drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises from which such 
activities are conducted by the taxpayer. Overpayments are not taken 
into account in summarizing the gross tax liability.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a 
controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and 
implementing regulations in 26 CFR Secs. 1.563-1 through 1.1563-4. Also, 
the rules for a ``controlled group of corporations'' apply in a similar 
fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole 
proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a 
group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or 
sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one 
taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make 
remittances by EFT.
    (3) A taxpayer who is required by this section to make remittances 
by EFT shall make a separate EFT remittance and file a separate return, 
ATF Form 5000.24, for each factory from which cigarette papers or 
cigarette tubes are withdrawn upon determination of tax.
    (b) Requirements. (1) On or before January 10 of each calendar year, 
except for a taxpayer already remitting the tax by EFT, each taxpayer 
who was liable for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million 
dollars in taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette 
tubes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and part 275 of 
this chapter during the previous calendar year, shall notify, in 
writing, the regional director (compliance), for each region in which 
taxes are paid. The notice shall be an agreement to make remittances by 
EFT.
    (2) For each return filed in accordance with this part, the taxpayer 
shall direct the taxpayer's bank to make an electronic fund transfer in 
the amount of the taxpayment to the Department of the Treasury's General 
Account or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as provided in paragraph 
(e) of this section. The request shall be made to the bank early enough 
for the transfer to be made to the Treasury Account by no later than the 
close of business on the last day for filing the return, prescribed in 
Sec. 270.355. The request shall take into account any time limit 
established by the bank.
    (3) If a taxpayer was liable for less than five million dollars in 
taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes 
combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and part 275 of this 
chapter during the preceding calendar year, the taxpayer may choose 
either to continue remitting the

[[Page 184]]

tax as provided in this section or to remit the tax with the return as 
prescribed by Sec. 270.355. Upon filing the first return on which the 
taxpayer chooses to discontinue remitting the tax by EFT and to begin 
remitting the tax with the tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the 
regional director (compliance) by attaching a written notification to 
ATF Form 5000.24, stating that no taxes are due by EFT, because the tax 
liability during the preceding calendar year was less than five million 
dollars, and that the remittance shall be filed with the tax return.
    (c) Remittance. (1) Each taxpayer shall show on the return, ATF Form 
5000.24, information about remitting the tax for that return period by 
EFT and shall file the return with ATF, in accordance with the 
instructions of ATF Form 5000.24.
    (2) Remittances shall be considered as made when the taxpayment by 
EFT is received by the Treasury Account. For purposes of this section, a 
taxpayment by EFT shall be considered as received by the Treasury 
Account when it is paid to a Federal Reserve Bank.
    (3) When the taxpayer directs the bank to effect an EFT message as 
required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any transfer data record 
furnished to the taxpayer, through normal banking procedures, will serve 
as the record of payment, and shall be retained as part of required 
records.
    (d) Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT. The taxpayer is subject to 
a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5761, 6651, or 6656, as applicable, for 
failure to make a taxpayment by EFT on or before the close of business 
on the prescribed last day for filing.
    (e) Procedure. Upon the notification required under paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, the regional director (compliance) will issue to the 
taxpayer an AFT Procedure entitled Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund 
Transfer. This publication outlines the procedure a taxpayer is to 
follow when preparing returns and EFT remittances in accordance with 
this part. The U.S. Customs Service will provide the taxpayer with 
instructions for preparing EFT remittances for payments to be made to 
the U.S. Customs Service.

Sec. 270.358  Assessment.

    Whenever any person required by law to pay tax on cigarette papers 
and tubes fails to pay such tax, the tax shall be ascertained and 
assessed against such person, subject to the limitations prescribed in 
26 U.S.C. 6501. The tax so assessed shall be in addition to the 
penalties imposed by law for failure to pay such tax when required. 
Except in cases where delay may jeopardize collection of the tax, or 
where the amount is nominal or the result of an evident mathematical 
error, no such assessment shall be made until and after notice has been 
afforded such person to show cause against assessment. The person will 
be allowed 45 days from the date of such notice to show cause, in 
writing, against such assessment.

return, ATF Form 5000.24, and special tax return (including amended 
returns), ATF Form 5630.5, filed under this subpart. Failure of the 
taxpayer to include the EIN on ATF Form 5000.24 may result in assertion 
and collection of the penalty specified in Sec. 70.113 of this chapter.

center director serving the internal revenue district where the 
applicant is required to file returns under this subpart, except that 
hand-carried applications may be filed with the district director of any 
such district as provided for in 26 CFR Sec. 301.6091-1. The application 
shall be signed by:
    (a) the individual if the person is an individual;
    (b) the president, vice president, or other principal officer if the 
person is a corporation;
    c) a responsible and duly authorized member or officer having

                      Special (Occupational) Taxes


<R05>
Sec. 270.371  Liability for special tax.

    (a) Manufacturer of cigarette papers and tubes. Every manufacturer 
of cigarette papers and tubes shall pay a special (occupational) tax at 
a rate specified by Sec. 270.372 of this part. The tax shall be paid on 
or before July 1. On commencing business, the tax shall be computed from 
the first day of the month in which liability is incurred, through the 
following June 30. Thereafter, the tax shall be computed for the entire 
year (July 1 through June 30).
    (b) Each place of business taxable. A manufacturer of cigarette 
papers and tubes incurs special tax liability at each place of business 
in which an occupation subject to special tax is conducted. A place of 
business means the entire office, plant or area of the business in any 
one location under the same proprietorship. Passageways, streets, 
highways, rail crossings, waterways, or partitions dividing the premises 
are not sufficient separation to require additional special tax, if the 
divisions of the premises are otherwise contiguous.

(26 U.S.C. 5143, 5731)


<R05>
Sec. 270.372  Rate of special tax.

    (a) General. Title 26 U.S.C. 5731(a)(2) imposes a special tax of 
$1,000 per year on every manufacturer of cigarette papers and tubes.
    (b) Reduced rate for small proprietors. Title 26 U.S.C. 5731(b) 
provides for a reduced rate of $500 per year with respect to any 
manufacturer of cigarette papers and tubes whose gross receipts (for the 
most recent taxable year ending before the first day of the taxable 
period to which the special tax imposed by Sec. 270.371 relates) are 
less than $500,000. The ``taxable year'' to be used for determining 
gross receipts is the taxpayer's income tax year. All gross receipts of 
the taxpayer shall be included, not just the gross receipts of the 
business subject to special tax. Proprietors of new businesses that have 
not yet begun a taxable year, as well as proprietors of existing 
businesses that have not yet ended a taxable year, who commence a new 
activity subject to special tax, qualify for the reduced special 
(occupational) tax rate, unless the business is a member of a 
``controlled group''; in that case the rules of paragraph (c) of this 
section shall apply.
    (c) Controlled group. All persons treated as one taxpayer under 26 
U.S.C. 5061(e)(3) shall be treated as one taxpayer for the purpose of 
determining gross receipts under paragraph (b) of this section. 
``Controlled group'' means a controlled group of corporations, as 
defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563 and implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-
1 through 1.1563-4. Also, the rules for a ``controlled group of 
corporations''

[[Page 186]]

apply in a similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or 
sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over 
a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or 
sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one 
taxpayer for the purpose of this section.
    (d) Short taxable year. Gross receipts for any taxable year of less 
than 12 months shall be annualized by multiplying the gross receipts for 
the short period by 12 and dividing the result by the number of months 
in the short period as required by 26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).
    (e) Returns and allowances. Gross receipts for any taxable year 
shall be reduced by returns and allowances made during such year under 
26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).

(26 U.S.C. 448, 5061, 5731)


<R05>
Sec. 270.373  Special tax returns.

    (a) General. Special tax shall be paid by return. The prescribed 
return is ATF Form 5630.5, Special Tax Registration and Return. Special 
tax returns, with payment of tax, shall be filed with ATF in accordance 
with instructions on the form.
    (b) Preparation of ATF Form 5630.5. All of the information called 
for on ATF Form 5630.5 shall be provided including:
    (1) The true name of the taxpayer.
    (2) The trade name(s) (if any) of the business(es) subject to 
special tax.
    (3) The employer identification number (see Secs.  270.359-361).
    (4) The exact location of the place of business, by name and number 
of building or street, or if these do not exist, by some description in 
addition to the post office address. In the case of one return for two 
or more locations, the address to be shown shall be the taxpayer's 
principal place of business (or principal office, in the case of a 
corporate taxpayer).
    (5) The class(es) of special tax to which the taxpayer is subject.
    (6) Ownership and control information: That is, the name, position, 
and residence address of every owner of the business and of every person 
having power to control its management and policies with respect to the 
activity subject to special tax. ``Owner of the business'' shall include 
every partner, if the taxpayer is a partnership, and every person owning 
10% or more of its stock, if the taxpayer is a corporation. However, the 
ownership and control information required by this paragraph need not be 
stated if the same information has been previously provided to ATF in 
connection with a permit application, and if the information previously 
provided is still current.
    (c) Multiple locations and/or classes of tax.
    A taxpayer subject to special tax for the same period at more than 
one location or for more than one class of tax shall--
    (1) File one special tax return, ATF Form 5630.5, with payment of 
tax, to cover all such locations and classes of tax; and
    (2) Prepare, in duplicate, a list identified with the taxpayer's 
name, address (as shown on ATF Form 5630.5), employer identification 
number, and period covered by the return. The list shall show, by State, 
the name, address, and tax class of each location for which special tax 
is being paid. The original of the list shall be filed with ATF in 
accordance with instructions on the return, and the copy shall be 
retained at the taxpayer's principal place of business (or principal 
office, in the case of a corporate taxpayer) for the period specified in 
Sec. 270.371.
    (d) Signing of ATF Forms 5630.5.--(1) Ordinary returns. The return 
of an individual proprietor shall be signed by the individual. The 
return of a partnership shall be signed by a general partner. The return 
of a corporation shall be signed by any officer. In each case, the 
person signing the return shall designate his or her capacity as 
``individual owner,'' ``member of firm,'' or, in the case of a 
corporation, the title of the officer.
    (2) Fiduciaries. Receivers, trustees, assignees, executors, 
administrators, and other legal representatives who continue the 
business of a bankrupt, insolvent, deceased person, etc., shall indicate 
the fiduciary capacity in which they act.
    (3) Agent or attorney in fact. If a return is signed by an agent or 
attorney in fact, the signature shall be preceded

[[Page 187]]

by the name of the principal and followed by the title of the agent or 
attorney in fact. A return signed by a person as agent will not be 
accepted unless there is filed, with the ATF office with which the 
return is required to be filed, a power of attorney authorizing the 
agent to perform the act.
    (4) Perjury statement. ATF Forms 5630.5 shall contain or be verified 
by a written declaration that the return has been executed under the 
penalties of perjury.


<R05>
Sec. 270.374  Issuance, distribution, and examination of special tax stamps.

    (a) Issuance of special tax stamps. Upon filing a properly executed 
return on ATF Form 5630.5 together with the full remittance, the 
taxpayer will be issued an appropriately designated special tax stamp. 
If the return covers multiple locations, the taxpayer will be issued one 
appropriately designated stamp for each location listed on the 
attachment required by Sec. 270.373(c)(2), but showing, as to name and 
address, only the name of the taxpayer and the address of the taxpayer's 
principal place of business (or principal office in the case of a 
corporate taxpayer).
    (b) Distribution of special tax stamps for multiple locations. On 
receipt of the special tax stamps, the taxpayer shall verify that there 
is one stamp for each location listed on the attachment to ATF Form 
5630.5. The taxpayer shall designate one stamp for each location and 
type on each stamp the address of the business conducted at the location 
for which that stamp is designated. The taxpayer shall then forward each 
stamp to the place of business designated on the stamp.
    (c) Examination of special tax stamps. All stamps denoting payment 
of special tax shall be kept available for inspection by ATF officers, 
at the location for which designated, during business hours.

<R05>
Sec. 270.375  Changes in special tax stamps.

    (a) Change in name. If there is a change in the corporate or firm 
name, or in the trade name, as shown on ATF Form 5630.5, the 
manufacturer shall file an amended special tax return as soon as 
practicable after the change, covering the new corporate or firm name, 
or trade names. No new special tax is required to be paid. The 
manufacturer shall attach the special tax stamp for endorsement of the 
change in name.
    (b) Change in proprietorship.--(1) General. If there is a change in 
the proprietorship of a cigarette papers and tubes factory, the 
successor shall pay a new special tax and obtain the required special 
tax stamps.
    (2) Exemption for certain successors. Persons having the right of 
succession provided for in paragraph (c) of this section may carry on 
the business for the remainder of the period for which the special tax 
was paid, without paying a new special tax, if within 30 days after the 
date on which the successor begins to carry on the business, the 
successor files a special tax return on ATF Form 5630.5 with ATF, which 
shows the basis of succession. A person who is a successor to a business 
for which special tax has been paid and who fails to register the 
succession is liable for special tax computed from the first day of the 
calendar month in which the successor began to carry on the business.
    (c) Persons having right of succession. Under the conditions 
indicated in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the right of succession 
will pass to certain persons in the following cases:
    (1) Death. The spouse or child, or executor, administrator, or other 
legal representative of the taxpayer;
    (2) Succession of spouse. A husband or wife succeeding to the 
business of his or her spouse (living);
    (3) Insolvency. A receiver or trustee in bankruptcy, or an assignee 
for benefit of creditors;
    (4) Withdrawal from firm. The partner or partners remaining after 
death or withdrawal of a member.
    (d) Change in location. If there is a change in location of a 
taxable place of business, the manufacturer shall within 30 days after 
the change, file with ATF an amended special tax return covering the new 
location. The manufacturer shall attach the special tax stamp or stamps 
for endorsement of the change in location. No new special tax is 
required to be paid. However, if

[[Page 188]]

the manufacturer does not file the amended return within 30 days, the 
manufacturer is required to pay a new special tax and obtain a new 
special tax stamp.

Sec. 270.382  Authority of ATF officers to enter premises.

    Any ATF officer may enter in the daytime any premises where 
cigarette papers and tubes are produced or kept, so far as it may be 
necessary for the purpose of examining such articles. When such premises 
are open at night, any ATF officer may enter them, while so open, in the 
performance of his or her official duties. The owner of such premises, 
or person having the superintendence of the same, who refuses to admit 
any ATF officer or permit any AFT officer to examine such cigarette 
papers and tubes shall be liable to the penalties prescribed by law for 
the offense.

Sec. 270.384  Disposal of forfeited, condemned, and abandoned cigarette papers and tubes.

    Forfeited, condemned, or abandoned cigarette papers or tubes in the 
custody of a Federal, State, or local officer upon which the Federal tax 
has not been paid shall not be sold or caused to be sold for consumption 
in the United States if, in the opinion of the officer, the sale of such 
papers and tubes will not bring a price equal to the tax due and 
payable, and the expenses incident to the sale. Where the cigarette 
papers or tubes are not sold the officer may deliver them to a Federal 
or State institution (if they are fit for consumption) or cause their 
destruction by burning completely or by rendering them unfit for 
consumption. Where such papers or tubes are sold, release by the officer 
having custody shall be made only after such papers and tubes are 
properly packaged and taxpaid. A receipt from the regional director 
(compliance) evidencing payment of tax on such papers or tubes shall be 
presented to the officer having custody of the articles, which tax shall 
be considered part of the sales price. Where cigarette papers or tubes 
which have been packaged under the provisions of part 295 of this 
chapter are to be released after payment of tax, the purchaser shall 
appropriately mark each package ``Federal Tax Paid (date)'' before the 
officer having custody of the papers or tubes releases them. However, 
the articles may be released without such marking of the packages if the 
purchaser is a qualified manufacturer of cigarette papers and tubes and 
does not intend to place such papers or tubes on the domestic market for 
taxable articles but will otherwise dispose of them. A written statement 
of notification of disposal by destruction or return to bond through 
claim for refund, shall be filed, in original only, with the officer 
having custody of the articles. In the case of cigarette papers and 
tubes forfeited under the internal revenue laws, the sale shall be 
subject to the provisions of part 72 of this chapter.

Sec. 270.385  Alternate methods or procedures.

    A manufacturer of cigarette papers and tubes, on specific approval 
by the Director as provided in this section, may use an alternate method 
or procedure in lieu of a method or procedure specifically prescribed in 
this subpart. The Director may approve an alternate method or procedure, 
subject to stated conditions, when the Director finds that--

[[Page 189]]

    (a) Good cause has been shown for the use of the alternate method or 
procedure,
    (b) The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and 
consistent with the effect intended by, the specifically prescribed 
method or procedure, and affords equivalent security to the revenue, and
    (c) The alternate method or procedure will not be contrary to any 
provision of law, and will not result in an increase in cost to the 
Government or hinder the effective administration of this subpart.
    No alternate method or procedure relating to the giving of any bond 
or to the assessment, payment, or collection of tax, shall be authorized 
under this section. A manufacturer who desires to employ an alternate 
method or procedure shall submit a written application, in triplicate, 
to the regional director (compliance) for transmittal to the Director. 
The application shall specifically describe the proposed alternate 
method or procedure, and shall set forth the reasons therefor. Alternate 
methods or procedures shall not be employed until the application has 
been approved by the Director. The manufacturer shall, during the period 
of authorization of an alternate method or procedure, comply with the 
terms of the approved application. Authorization for any alternate 
method or procedure may be withdrawn whenever, in the judgment of the 
Director, the revenue is jeopardized or the effective administration of 
this part is hindered. Any authorization of the Director under this 
section shall be retained as part of the manufacturer's record in 
accordance with this subpart.

Sec. 270.386  Emergency variations from requirements.

    The Director may approve methods of operation other than as 
specified in this subpart, where it is determined that an emergency 
exists and the proposed variations from the specified requirements are 
necessary, and the proposed variations--
    (a) Will afford the security and protection to the revenue intended 
by the prescribed specifications;
    (b) Will not hinder the effective administration of this subpart; 
and
    (c) Will not be contrary to any provision of law. Variations from 
requirements granted under this section are conditioned on compliance 
with the procedures, conditions, and limitations set forth in the 
approval of the application. Failure to comply in good faith with such 
procedures, conditions and limitations shall automatically terminate the 
authority for such variations and the manufacturer thereupon shall fully 
comply with the prescribed requirements of regulations from which the 
variations were authorized. Authority for any variation may be withdrawn 
whenever in the judgment of the Director the revenue is jeopardized or 
the effective administration of this subpart is hindered by the 
continuation of such variation. Where a manufacturer desires to employ 
such variation, the manufacturer shall submit a written application to 
do so (in triplicate) to the regional director (compliance) for 
transmittal to the Director. The application shall describe the proposed 
variations and set forth the reasons therefor. Variations shall not be 
employed until the application has been approved. In accordance with

to file a strengthening bond in an appropriate amount with the same 
surety as that on the bond already in effect, in lieu of a superseding 
bond to cover the full liability on the basis of Sec. 270.404. The 
regional director (compliance) shall refuse to approve any strengthening 
bond where any notation is made thereon which is intended or which may 
be construed as a release of any former bond, or as limiting the amount 
of either bond to less than its full amount.

director (compliance) until liability under the bond for which they were 
pledged has been terminated. When the regional director (compliance) is 
satisfied that they may be released, the regional director (compliance) 
shall fix the date or dates on which a part or all of such securities 
may be released. At any time prior to the release of such securities,

Sec. 270.471  Abatement.

    A claim for abatement of the unpaid portion of the assessment of any 
tax on cigarette papers and tubes, or any liability in respect thereof,

amount, is assessed after the expiration of the applicable period of 
limitation, or is erroneously or illegally assessed. Any claim under 
this section shall be prepared on ATF Form 2635 (5620.8), in duplicate, 
and shall set forth the particulars under which the claim is filed. The 
original of the claim, accompanied by such evidence as is necessary to 
establish to the satisfaction of the regional director (compliance) that 
the claim is valid, shall be filed with the regional director 
(compliance) for the region in which the tax or liability was assessed.

(68A Stat. 792, 6404)


<R05>
Sec. 270.472  Allowance.

    Relief from the payment of tax on cigarette papers and tubes may be 
extended to a manufacturer by allowance of the tax where the cigarette 
papers and tubes, after removal from the factory upon determination of 
tax and prior to the payment of such tax, are lost (otherwise than by 
theft) or destroyed by fire, casualty, or act of God, while in the 
possession or ownership of the manufacturer who removed such articles, 
or are withdrawn by the manufacturer from the market. Any claim for 
allowance under this section shall be filed on ATF Form 2635 (5620.8) 
with the regional director (compliance) for the region in which the 
articles were removed, shall be executed under penalties and perjury and 
shall show the date the cigarette papers and tubes were removed from the 
factory. A claim relating to articles lost or destroyed shall be 
supported as prescribed in Sec. 270.475. In the case of a claim relating 
to cigarette papers or tubes withdrawn from the market the schedule 
prescribed in Sec. 270.476 shall be filed with the regional director 
(compliance) for the region in which the articles are assembled. The 
manufacturer may not anticipate allowance of a claim by making the 
adjusting entry in a tax return pending consideration and action on the 
claim. Cigarette papers and tubes to which such a claim relates must be 
shown as removed on determination of tax in the return covering the 
period during which such articles

[[Page 196]]

were so removed. Upon action on the claim by the regional director 
(compliance) a copy of ATF Form 2635 (5620.8) will be returned to the 
manufacturer as notice of such action. This copy of ATF Form 2635 
(5620.8), with the copy of any verified supporting schedules, shall be 
retained by the manufacturer. When such notification of allowance of the 
claim or any part thereof is received prior to the time the return 
covering the tax on the cigarette papers or tubes to which the claim 
relates is to be filed, the manufacturer may make an adjusting entry and 
explanatory statement in that tax return. Where the notice of allowance 
is received after the filing of the return and taxpayment of the 
cigarette papers or tubes to which the claim relates, the manufacturer 
may make an adjusting entry and explanatory statement in the next tax 
return(s) to the extent necessary to take credit in the amount of the 
allowance.

(72 Stat. 1419, as amended, 26 U.S.C. 5705)


<R05>
Sec. 270.473  Credit or refund.

    The taxes paid on cigarette papers and tubes may be credited or 
refunded (without interest) to a manufacturer on proof satisfactory to 
the regional director (compliance) that the claimant manufacturer paid 
the tax on cigarette papers and tubes lost (otherwise than by theft) or 
destroyed, by fire, casualty, or act of God, while in the possession or 
ownership of such manufacturer, or withdrawn by the manufacturer from 
the market. Any claim for credit or refund under this section shall be 
prepared on ATF Form 2635 (5620.8), in duplicate. Claims shall include a 
statement that the tax imposed on cigarette papers and tubes by 26 
U.S.C. 7652 or Chapter 52, was paid in respect to the cigarette papers 
or tubes covered by the claim, and that the articles were lost, 
destroyed, or withdrawn from the market within 6 months preceding the 
date the claim is filed. A claim for credit or refund relating to 
articles lost or destroyed shall be supported as prescribed in 
Sec. 270.475, and a claim relating to articles withdrawn from the market 
shall be accompanied by a schedule prepared and verified as prescribed 
in Secs. 270.476, and 270.477. The original and one copy of ATF Form 
2635 (5620.8), shall be filed with the regional director (compliance) 
for the region in which the tax was paid, or where the tax was paid in 
more than one region with the regional director (compliance) for any one 
of the regions in which the tax was paid. Upon action by the regional 
director (compliance) on a claim for credit, a copy of ATF Form 2635 
(5620.8) will be returned to the manufacturer as notification of 
allowance or disallowance of the claim or any part thereof. This copy, 
with the copy of any verified supporting schedules, shall be retained by 
the manufacturer. When the manufacturer is notified of allowance of the 
claim for credit or any part thereof, the manufacturer shall make an 
adjusting entry and explanatory statement in the next tax return(s) to 
the extent necessary to take credit in the amount of the allowance. The 
manufacturer may not anticipate allowance of a claim by taking credit on 
a tax return prior to consideration and action on such claim. The 
duplicate of a claim for refund or credit, with a copy of any verified 
supporting schedules, shall be retained by the manufacturer.

cigarette papers and tubes, or may authorize the manufacturer to dispose 
of the articles without supervision by so stating on the original and 
one copy of the schedule returned to the manufacturer.

(72 Stat. 1419; 26 U.S.C. 5705)


<R05>

Sec. 275.25  Disposal of forfeited, condemned, and abandoned tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes.

    When any Federal, State, or local officer having custody of 
forfeited, condemned, or abandoned tobacco products or cigarette papers 
or tubes, upon

[[Page 203]]

which the Federal tax has not been paid, is of the opinion that the sale 
thereof will not bring a price equal to the tax due and payable thereon, 
and the expenses incident to the sale thereof, he shall not sell, nor 
cause to be sold, such articles for consumption in the United States. 
Where the articles are not sold, the officer may deliver them to a 
Federal or State hospital or institution (if they are fit for 
consumption) or cause their destruction by burning completely or by 
rendering them unfit for consumption. Where such articles are sold, they 
shall not be released by the officer having custody thereof until they 
are properly packaged and taxpaid, which tax shall be considered as a 
portion of the sales price. Except where the tax is to be paid to 
district directors of customs in accordance with Part 20, Customs 
Regulations (19 CFR part 20), on sales of articles by customs officers, 
the payment of tax on such articles shall be evidenced by presentation, 
to the officer having custody of the articles, of a receipt from the 
district director showing such payment. In the case of such articles 
held by or for the Federal Government, the sale thereof shall be subject 
to the applicable provisions of the Regulations of the General Services

Sec. 275.26  Alternate methods or procedures.

    An importer, on specific approval by the Director as provided in 
this section, may use an alternate method or procedure in lieu of a 
method or procedure specifically prescribed in this part. The Director 
may approve an alternate method or procedure, subject to stated 
conditions, when he finds that--
    (a) Good cause has been shown for the use of the alternate method or 
procedure,
    (b) The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and 
consistent with the effect intended by, the specifically prescribed 
method or procedure, and affords equivalent security to the revenue, and
    (c) The alternate method of procedure will not be contrary to any 
provision of law, and will not result in an increase in cost to the 
Government or hinder the effective administration of this part.

No alternate method or procedure relating to the giving of any bond or 
to the assessment, payment, or collection of tax, shall be authorized 
under this section. When an importer desires to employ an alternate 
method or procedure, he shall submit a written application to do so, in 
triplicate, to the regional director (compliance) for transmittal to the 
Director. The application shall specifically describe the proposed 
alternate method or procedure, and shall set forth the reasons therefor. 
Alternate methods or procedures shall not be employed until the 
application has been approved by the Director. The importer shall, 
during the period of authorization of an alternate method or procedure, 
comply with the terms of the approved application. Authorization for any 
alternate method or procedure may be withdrawn whenever in the judgment 
of the Director the revenue is jeopardized or the effective 
administration of this part is hindered. The importer shall retain, as 
part of his records, any authorization of the Director under this 
section.

proposed variations from the specified requirements are necessary, and 
the proposed variations--
    (a) Will afford the security and protection to the revenue intended

    (b) Will not hinder the effective administration of this part, and
    (c) Will not be contrary to any provision of law.

Variations from requirements granted under this section are conditioned 
on

[[Page 204]]

compliance with the procedures, conditions, and limitations set forth in 
the approval of the application. Failure to comply in good faith and 
with such procedures, conditions, and limitations shall automatically 
terminate the authority for such variations and the importer thereupon 
shall fully comply with the prescribed requirements of regulations from 
which the variations were authorized. Authority for any variations may 
be withdrawn whenever in the judgment of the Director the revenue is 
jeopardized or the effective administration of this part is hindered by 
the continuation of such variation. Where an importer desires to employ 
such variation, he shall submit a written application to do so, in 
triplicate, to the regional director (compliance) for transmittal to the 
Director. The application shall describe the proposed variations and set 
forth the reasons therefor. Variations shall not be employed until the

The eight classes are as follows:
    (a) Class A. Large cigars with a wholesale price or sale price, as 
applicable of not more than $33.00 per thousand,
    (b) Class B. Large cigars with a wholesale price or sale price, as 
applicable of more than $33.00 per thousand but not more than $51.00 per 
thousand,
    (c) Class C. Large cigars with a wholesale price or sale price, as 
applicable of more than $51.00 per thousand but not more than $66.00 per

<R05>
Sec. 275.39  Determination of sale price of large cigars removed on or after January 1, 1991.

    (a) General rule. The tax imposed on large cigars is computed based 
on the price for which the large cigars are sold by the manufacturer. 
Large cigars are taxed at a percentage of the sale price, as prescribed 
by 270.21. For example, for cigars removed during 1991 and 1992, if the 
price for which they are sold is $235.294 per thousand or less, the tax 
imposed will be 10.625% of such price. For large cigars sold for a price 
of more than $235.294 per thousand, the minimum tax is $25 per thousand 
for removals during 1991 and 1992. A similar computation, with the 
increased percent figure and maximum tax rate, is applicable for 
removals on or after January 1, 1993.
    (b) Price for which sold. The ``price'' for which cigars are sold 
includes the total consideration paid for the cigars. Any charge which 
is made incident to placing the cigars in condition ready for use is 
included in the sale price. Similar rules to 26 U.S.C. 4216(a) and the 
regulations thereunder, relating to charges to be included in the price 
and excluded from the price, shall apply.
    (c) Exclusions from price. The tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. chapter 52 
or section 7652 is excluded in determining the price for which large 
cigars are sold. The amount of any retail sales tax imposed by any state 
or political subdivision thereof or the District of Columbia is likewise 
excluded (whether the liability for such tax is imposed on the vendor or 
vendee), if the retail sales tax is stated as a separate charge.
    (d) Constructive sale price rules. Rules similar to the constructive 
sale price

[[Page 206]]

rules set forth in 26 U.S.C. 4216(b) and the implementing regulations in 
26 CFR 48.4216(b)-1 through 48.4216(b)-4 shall be applied for purposes 
of determining the price for which large cigars are sold.
    (e) Readjustments in sale price. Anticipated downward readjustments 
in sale price are not taken into account in computing the tax. The tax 
must be based upon the original price for which the cigars were sold 
unless the readjustments have actually been made prior to the close of 
the period for which the tax return is filed. However, if the price upon 
which the tax was computed is subsequently readjusted, credit may be 
taken against the tax due on a subsequent return or a claim for refund 
filed as provided in Sec. 270.286.

Sec. 275.63  Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.

    (a) Each importer who was liable, during a calendar year, for a 
gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in taxes on 
cigars, cigarettes, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes combining tax 
liabilities incurred under this part and part 270 of this chapter, shall 
use a commercial bank in making payment by electronic fund transfer 
(EFT) of such taxes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment of such 
taxes by cash, check, or money order is not authorized for an importer 
who is required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. For 
purposes of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is defined 
as the gross tax liability on all taxable withdrawals and importations 
(including similar products brought into the United States from Puerto 
Rico or the Virgin Islands) during the calendar year, without regard to 
any drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises from which such 
activities are conducted by the taxpayer.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a 
controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and 
implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except 
that the words ``at least 80 percent'' shall be replaced by the words 
``more than 50 percent'' in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 
26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the 
rules for a ``controlled group of corporations'' apply in a similar 
fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole 
proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a 
group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or 
sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one 
taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make 
remittances by EFT.
    (c) For the purposes of this section, (1) electronic fund transfer 
or EFT means any transfer of funds, other than a transaction originated 
by check, draft, or similar paper instrument, which is initiated through 
an electronic terminal, telephonic instrument, or computer of magnetic 
tape, so as to order, instruct, or authorize a financial institution to 
either debit or credit an account, in accordance with procedures 
established by the U.S. Customs Service, and (2) electronic fund 
transfer or EFT does not have the meaning defined in Sec. 275.11 for use 
elswhere in this part.

by EFT, shall make the EFT remittance

    On receipt of the original and five copies of the Form 2987 (5210.8) 
completed and executed by the bonded manufacturer in accordance with 
Sec. 275.110, an ATF officer will inspect the tobacco products covered 
by the form, verify the tax calculation made with respect to such 
products, date and execute the certification on such form, and release 
the tobacco products for shipment to the United States. Such officer 
will then promptly distribute the certified Form 2987 by (a) mailing two 
copies to the district director of customs at the port of entry; (b) 
mailing one copy to the regional director (compliance) of the region 
wherein the customs collection headquarters is located; (c) returning 
two copies to the bonded manufacturer who will attach one copy to the 
bill of lading to accompany the shipment (in custody of the carrier) for 
presentation to the district director of customs at the port of entry; 
and (d) submitting the original to the Chief, Puerto Rico Operations. 
The ATF officer will also prepare, for each shipping container, a 
statement on Form 2989 that the tax on the tobacco products to be 
shipped to the United States has been computed and show the name and 
address of the bonded manufacturer, date of tax computation, and the 
other information required by that form. The bonded manufacturer shall 
affix the completed Form 2989 to the outside of each shipping container 
in which the products are packed. Such statement, Form 2989, shall be 
affixed to the outer container used in the shipment of freight in bulk 
(crate, packing box, van, trailer, etc.) and not on the individual 
cartons, cases, etc., included in such outer container.

Sec. 275.112  Tax return.

    The internal revenue taxes imposed by 26 U.S.C. 7652(a), with 
respect to tobacco products manufactured in Puerto Rico and shipped to 
the United States on computation of tax under the provisions of this 
subpart shall be paid on the basis of a semimonthly tax return. The 
bonded manufacturer of such products shall prepare ATF Form 5000.25 in 
duplicate, and file the original with the Chief, Puerto Rico Operations, 
and maintain one copy for the file for each semimonthly return period. 
The bonded manufacturer shall execute the return, ATF Form 5000.25, 
under the penalties of perjury. He shall file a return for each return 
period at the time specified in Sec. 275.114, regardless of whether

[[Page 215]]

tax is due for that return period. However, where the Regional Director 
(compliance), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Atlanta, GA, 
grants specific authorization, the bonded manufacturer need not file a 
tax return during the term of such authorization for any period in which 
tax liability was not incurred under the provisions of this subpart.

Sec. 275.114a  Qualification for extended deferral.

    Note: This section applies only to removals made before January 1, 
1983.

    (a) Bonded manufacturers with bonds executed before September 1, 
1973.  Bonded manufacturers with bonds on Form 2936 executed before 
September 1, 1973, who desire to file returns under this subpart with 
benefit of the extended deferral permitted by Sec. 275.114 shall file 
with the regional director (compliance) an extension of coverage of bond 
on Form 2105. Such extension of coverage shall identify the particular 
bond to which it applies and shall contain a statement of purpose as 
follows:

    To continue in effect said bond (including all extensions or 
limitations of terms and conditions previously consented to and 
approved) notwithstanding that the time for payment of the tax may be 
deferred by the extended deferral period permitted by regulations in 27 
CFR 275.114.

If the bond on Form 2986 is in an amount insufficient to cover an 
extended deferral period, according to the requirements of Sec. 275.121, 
the bonded manufacturer must either file a new bond or file a 
strengthening bond to increase the total amount of the bonds then in 
force to a sufficient amount.
    (b) Bonded manufacturers with bonds executed after September 1, 
1973.  Bonded manufacturers operating under original or superseding 
bonds executed after September 1, 1973, are automatically qualified for 
the extended deferral permitted by Sec. 275.114 (unless found in default 
as provided in Sec. 275.116). Such bonds must be executed in an amount 
sufficient to cover an extended deferral period, according to the 
requirements of Sec. 275.121.
    (c) Commencement of extended deferral.  Bonded manufacturers may 
file returns with benefit of extended deferral only after the applicable 
bonds and extensions of coverage required by this section have been 
filed with and approved by the regional director (compliance).

Chief, Puerto Rico Operations is authorized to accept under the 
provisions of Sec. 70.61 of this chapter (Payment by check or money 
order) and which is acceptable to that officer. In paying the tax, a 
fractional part of a cent shall be disregarded unless it amounts to one-
half cent or more, in which case it shall be increased to one cent.

Sec. 275.115a  Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.

    (a) General. (1) Each taxpayer who was liable, during a calendar 
year, for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in 
taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes 
combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and part 270 of this 
chapter, shall use a commercial bank in making payment by electronic 
fund transfer (EFT) of taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and 
cigarette tubes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment of taxes on 
tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes by cash, check, 
or money order, as described in Sec. 275.115, is not authorized for a 
taxpayer who is required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. 
For purposes of this

[[Page 217]]

section, the dollar amount of tax liability is defined as the gross tax 
liability of all taxes which are paid in accordance with this subpart, 
taxable withdrawals from premises in the United States, and importations 
during the calendar year, without regard to any drawbacks, credits, or 
refunds, for all premises from which such activities are conducted by 
the taxpayer. Overpayments are not taken into account in summarizing the 
gross tax liability.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a 
controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and 
implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except 
that the words ``at least 80 percent'' shall be replaced by the words 
``more than 50 percent'' in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 
26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the 
rules for a ``controlled group of corporations'' apply in a similar 
fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole 
proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a 
group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or 
sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one 
taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make 
remittances by EFT.
    (3) A taxpayer who is required by this section to make remittances 
by EFT, shall make a separate EFT remittance and file a separate tax 
return for each factory which tobacco products, or cigarette papers, or 
cigarette tubes are withdrawn upon determination of tax.
    (b) Requirements. (1) On or before January 10 of each calendar year, 
except for a taxpayer already remitting the tax by EFT, each taxpayer 
who was liable for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million 
dollars in taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette 
tubes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and part 270 of 
this chapter during the previous calender year, shall notify, in 
writing, the regional director (compliance), for each region in which 
taxes are paid. The notice shall be an agreement to make remittances by 
EFT.
    (2) For each return filed in accordance with this part, the taxpayer 
shall direct the taxpayer's bank to make an electronic fund transfer in 
the amount of the taxpayment to the Treasury Account as provided in 
paragraph (e) of this section. The request shall be made to the bank 
early enough for the transfer to be made to the Treasury Account by no 
later than the close of business on the last day for filing the return, 
prescribed in Sec. 275.105 or Sec. 275.114. The request shall take into 
account any time limit established by the bank.
    (3) If a taxpayer was liable for less than five million dollars in 
taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes during 
the preceding calendar year, the taxpayer may choose either to continue 
remitting the tax as provided in this section or to remit the tax with 
the return as prescribed by Sec. 275.115. On the first return on which 
the taxpayer chooses to discontinue remitting the tax by EFT and to 
begin remitting the tax with the tax return, the taxpayer shall notify 
the regional director (compliance) by attaching a written notification 
to the tax return, stating that no taxes are due by EFT, because the tax 
liability during the preceding calendar year was less than five million 
dollars, and that the remittance shall be filed with the tax return.
    (c) Remittance. (1) Each taxpayer shall show on the tax return, 
information about remitting the tax for that return by EFT and shall 
file the return with the Chief, Puerto Rico Operations.
    (2) Remittances shall be considered as made when the taxpayment by 
electronic fund transfer is received by the Treasury Account. For 
purposes of this section, a taxpayment by electronic fund transfer shall 
be considered as received by the Treasury Account when it is paid to a 
Federal Reserve Bank.
    (3) When the taxpayer directs the bank to effect an electronic fund 
transfer message as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any 
transfer data record furnished to the taxpayer, through normal banking 
procedures, will serve as the record of payment, and shall be retained 
as part of required records.
    (d) Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT. The taxpayer is subject to 
a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5761, 6651, or 6656, as applicable, for 
failure to make a taxpayment by EFT on or before the

[[Page 218]]

close of business on the prescribed last day for filing.
    (e) Procedure. Upon the notification required under paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, the regional director (compliance) will issue to the 
taxpayer an ATF Procedure entitled, Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund 
Transfer. This publication outlines the procedure a taxpayer is to 
follow when preparing returns and EFT remittances in accordance with 
this part. The U.S. Customs Service will provide the taxpayer with 
instructions for preparing EFT remittances for payments to be made to 
the U.S. Customs Service.

Sec. 275.117  Procedure at port of entry.

    The district director of customs at the port of entry will inspect 
the shipment to determine whether the quantity specified on the Form 
2987 is contained in the shipment. He will then execute his certificate 
on the three copies of the Form 2987 in his possession, and indicate on 
each copy any exceptions found at the time of release. The statement of 
exceptions shall identify each shipping container which sustained a 
loss, the tobacco products reported shipped in such container, and the 
tobacco products lost from such container. Losses occurring as the 
result of missing packages, cases, or shipping containers shall be 
listed separately from losses caused by damage. Where the statement is 
made on the basis of tobacco products missing or damaged, the district 
director of customs shall show (a) the numbers of small cigarettes, 
large cigarettes, and small cigars, (b) the number and total wholesale 
price of large cigars with a wholesale price of not more than $235.294 
per thousand, (c) the number of large cigars with a wholesale price of 
more than $235.294 per thousand, (d) the pounds and ounces of chewing 
tobacco and snuff, and (e) the pounds and ounces of pipe tobacco.

If the district director of customs finds that the full amount of tax 
has not been computed, he will require the difference due to be paid to 
him prior to release of the tobacco products. When the inspection of the 
shipment has been effected, and any additional tax found to be due has 
been paid to the district director of customs, the shipment may be 
released.

Sec. 275.172  Return to nontaxpaid status, action by taxpayer.

    (a) General. Where tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes 
which have been imported or brought into the United States are withdrawn 
from the market and the taxpayer desires to file a claim for refund of 
the tax on the articles and return them to a nontaxpaid status, he 
shall, in addition to the requirements of Sec. 275.163, assemble the 
articles in or adjacent to the factory in which the articles are to be 
retained or received in a nontaxpaid status. The taxpayer shall group 
the articles according to the rates of tax applicable to the articles, 
and shall prepare a schedule of the articles, on ATF Form 3069 (5200.7), 
in triplicate. All copies of the schedule shall be forwarded to the 
regional director (compliance) for the region in which the tobacco 
products and cigarette papers and tubes are assembled.
    (b) Large cigars. Refund or credit of tax on large cigars withdrawn 
from the market is limited to the minimum amount applicable to that 
brand and size of cigar during the required record retention period (see 
Sec. 275.22) except where the importer establishes that a greater amount 
was actually paid. For each claim involving large cigars withdrawn from 
the market the importer shall include a certification on either ATF Form 
3069 (5200.7) or ATF Form 2635 (5620.8) to read as follows:

    The amounts claimed relating to large cigars are based on the lowest 
(insert either ``wholesale price'' or ``sale price'', as applicable) 
applicable to the cigars during the required record retention period, 
except where specific documentation is submitted with the claim to 
establish that any greater amount of tax claimed was actually paid.

Sec. 275.173  Return to nontaxpaid status, action by regional director (compliance).

    Upon receipt of a schedule of tobacco products and cigarette papers 
and tubes which have been imported or brought into the United States and 
which are withdrawn from the market by a taxpayer who desires to return 
such articles to a nontaxpaid status, the regional director (compliance) 
may assign an ATF officer to verify the schedule and supervise 
disposition of the articles (and destruction of the stamps, if any) or 
the regional director (compliance) may authorize the receiving 
manufacturer to verify the schedule and disposition of the articles (and 
destruction of the stamps, if any) covered therein, without supervision, 
by so stating on the original and one copy of the schedule returned to 
the manufacturer. Where the receipt in a factory of tobacco products and 
cigarette papers and tubes has been verified, such articles shall be 
treated by the receiving manufacturer as nontaxpaid and

[[Page 226]]

Sec. 275.174  Disposition of tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes, and schedule.

    When an ATF officer is assigned to verify the schedule and supervise 
destruction or other disposition of tobacco products and cigarette 
papers and tubes which have been imported or brought into the United 
States, such officer shall, upon completion of his assignment, execute a 
certificate on all copies of the schedule to show the disposition and 
the date of disposition of such articles. The ATF officer shall return 
the original and one copy of the certified schedule to the taxpayer. 
When a taxpayer destroys such articles (and stamps, if any) or reduces 
tobacco products to materials, or a receiving manufacturer verifies the 
schedule and disposition of such articles (and stamps, if any), he shall 
execute a certificate on the original and the copy of the schedule 
returned to him, to show the disposition and the date of disposition of 
the articles. The taxpayer shall attach the original of the certified 
schedule to his claim for refund.

<R05>
Sec. 275.181  Records of large cigars.

    Every person who imports large cigars for sale within the United 
States shall keep the records required by this section.
    (a) Wholesale prices--(1) Basic record. The importer shall keep a 
record to show each wholesale price (suggested delivery price to 
retailers or wholesale price as determined by the Associate Director 
(compliance operations) under Sec. 275.39(i)), which is applicable to 
large cigars removed (entered or withdrawn). No later than the tenth 
business day in January of each year the importer shall prepare such a 
record to show the wholesale price in effect on the first day of that 
year for each brand and size of his large cigars. However, for the year 
1977 the record shall be prepared no later than the tenth business day 
in February, to show the prices in effect as of February 1, 1977. The 
importer shall thereafter enter in the record the wholesale price and 
its effective date for any large cigar removed (entered or withdrawn) 
which was not previously entered in the record, and any change in a 
price from that shown in the record, within ten business days after such 
removal or change in price. The record shall be a continuing one for 
each brand and size of cigar (and type of packaging, if pertinent), so 
that the taxable price on any date may be readily ascertained.
    (2) Copies of price announcements. The importer shall retain a copy 
of each general announcement which he issues within his organization or 
to the trade about establishment or change of large cigar wholesale 
prices. If the copy does not show the actual date when issued it shall 
be annotated to show this information, and it shall also be annotated to 
show the date on which a copy was submitted to the Associate Director 
(compliance operations) in accordance with Sec. 275.183.
    (3) Copies of entry and withdrawal forms. The importer shall keep a 
copy of each customs entry or withdrawal form on which internal revenue 
tax for large cigars is declared pursuant to Sec. 275.81.
    (4) Alternative record. If an importer has so few import 
transactions and/or brands and sizes of large cigars that retention of 
an appropriate copy of each entry and withdrawal form required under 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section will provide an adequate record of 
wholesale prices, then the record required under paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section need not be kept. In such case the entry and withdrawal 
forms must identify the brands and sizes of cigars covered and show the 
corresponding quantity and wholesale price for each.

[[Page 227]]

If such information was not originally entered on the form it may be 
included by annotation. Whenever the regional director (compliance) 
finds that alternative records being kept pursuant to this paragraph are 
inadequate for the intended purpose, he may so notify the importer in 
writing, after which time the importer shall keep the record required 
under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (b) Basic record of sale prices. The importer shall keep such 
records as are necessary to establish and verify the sale price which 
applies to the large cigars removed (entered or withdrawn). The record 
shall be a continuing one for each brand and size of cigar so that the 
price on which the tax is based may be readily ascertained.

Sec. 275.182  Availability of records.

    The records required under Sec. 275.181 shall be kept by the 
importer at his usual place of business unless otherwise authorized in 
writing by the regional director (compliance), and shall be made 
available for inspection by any ATF officer upon his request. (For 
retention period, see Sec. 275.22.)

noted.


<R05>
Sec. 290.31  Liability for special tax.

    (a) Export warehouse proprietor. Every export warehouse proprietor 
shall pay a special (occupational) tax at a rate specified by 
Sec. 290.32. The tax shall be paid on or before the date of commencing 
the business of an export warehouseman, and thereafter every year on or 
before July 1. On commencing business, the tax shall be computed from 
the first day of the month in which liability is incurred, through the 
following June 30. Thereafter, the tax shall be computed for the entire 
year (July 1 through June 30).

[[Page 232]]

    (b) Transition rule. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, 
a proprietor engaged in the business of an export warehouseman on 
January 1, 1988, shall be treated as having commenced business on that 
date. The special tax imposed by this transition rule shall cover the 
period January 1, 1988, through June 30, 1988, and shall be paid on or 
before April 1, 1988.
    (c) Each place of business taxable. An export warehouse proprietor 
under this part incurs special tax liability at each place of business 
in which an occupation subject to special tax is conducted. A place of 
business means the entire office, plant or area of the business in any 
one location under the same proprietorship. Passageways, streets, 
highways, rail crossings, waterways, or partitions dividing the premises 
are not sufficient separation to require additional special tax, if the 
divisions of the premises are otherwise contiguous.

(26 U.S.C. 5143, 5731)


<R05>
Sec. 290.32  Rate of special tax.

    (a) General. Title 26 U.S.C. 5731(a)(3) imposes a special tax of 
$1,000 per year on every export warehouse proprietor.
    (b) Reduced rate for small proprietors. Title 26 U.S.C. 5731(b) 
provides for a reduced rate of $500 per year with respect to any export 
warehouse proprietor whose gross receipts (for the most recent taxable 
year ending before the first day of the taxable period to which the 
special tax imposed by Sec. 290.31 relates) are less than $500,000. The 
``taxable year'' to be used for determining gross receipts is the 
taxpayer's income tax year. All gross receipts of the taxpayer shall be 
included, not just the gross receipts of the business subject to special 
tax. Proprietors of new businesses that have not yet begun a taxable 
year, as well as proprietors of existing businesses that have not yet 
ended a taxable year, who commence a new activity subject to special 
tax, qualify for the reduced special (occupational) tax rate, unless the 
business is a member of a ``controlled group''; in that case, the rules 
of paragraph (c) of this section shall apply.
    (c) Controlled group. All persons treated as one taxpayer under 26 
U.S.C. 5061(e)(3) shall be treated as one taxpayer for the purpose of 
determining gross receipts under paragraph (b) of this section. 
``Controlled group'' means a controlled group of corporations, as 
defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563 and implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-
1 through 1.1563-4, except that the words ``at least 80 percent'' shall 
be replaced by the words ``more than 50 percent'' in each place they 
appear in subsection (a) of 26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the 
implementing regulations. Also, the rules for a ``controlled group of 
corporations'' apply in a similar fashion to groups which include 
partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more 
than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or 
more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of 
the controlled group are one taxpayer for the purpose of this section.
    (d) Short taxable year. Gross receipts for any taxable year of less 
than 12 months shall be annualized by multiplying the gross receipts for 
the short period by 12 and dividing the result by the number of months 
in the short period as required by 26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).
    (e) Returns and allowances. Gross receipts for any taxable year 
shall be reduced by returns and allowances made during such year under 
26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).

(26 U.S.C. 448, 5061, 5731)


<R05>
Sec. 290.33  Special tax returns.

    (a) General. Special tax shall be paid by return. The prescribed 
return is ATF Form 5630.5, Special Tax Registration and Return. Special 
tax returns, with payment of tax, shall be filed with ATF in accordance 
with instructions on the form.
    (b) Preparation of ATF Form 5630.5. All of the information called 
for on Form 5630.5 shall be provided, including:
    (1) The true name of the taxpayer.
    (2) The trade name(s) (if any) of the business(es) subject to 
special tax.
    (3) The employer identification number (see Sec. 290.34).
    (4) The exact location of the place of business, by name and number 
of building or street, or if these do not exist, by some description in 
addition to the post office address. In the case of one return for two 
or more locations, the

[[Page 233]]

address to be shown shall be the taxpayer's principal place of business 
(or principal office, in the case of a corporate taxpayer).
    (5) The class(es) of special tax to which the taxpayer is subject.
    (6) Ownership and control information: that is, the name, position, 
and residence address of every owner of the business and of every person 
having power to control its management and policies with respect to the 
activity subject to special tax. ``Owner of the business'' shall include 
every partner, if the taxpayer is a partnership, and every person owning 
10% or more of its stock, if the taxpayer is a corporation. However, the 
ownership and control information required by this paragraph need not be 
stated if the same information has been previously provided to ATF in 
connection with a permit application, and if the information previously 
provided is still current.
    (c) Multiple locations and/or classes of tax. A taxpayer subject to 
special tax for the same period at more than one location or for more 
than one class of tax shall--
    (1) File one special tax return, ATF Form 5630.5, with payment of 
tax, to cover all such locations and classes of tax; and
    (2) Prepare, in duplicate, a list identified with the taxpayer's 
name, address (as shown on ATF Form 5630.5), employer identification 
number, and period covered by the return. The list shall show, by 
States, the name, address, and tax class of each location for which 
special tax is being paid. The original of the list shall be filed with 
ATF in accordance with instructions on the return, and the copy shall be 
retained at the taxpayer's principal place of business (or principal 
office, in the case of a corporate taxpayer) for the period specified in 
Sec. 290.142.
    (d) Signing of ATF Forms 5630.5--(1) Ordinary returns. The return of 
an individual proprietor shall be signed by the individual. The return 
of a partnership shall be signed by a general partner. The return of a 
corporation shall be signed by an officer. In each case, the person 
signing the return shall designate his or her capacity as ``individual 
owner,'' ``member of firm,'' or, in the case of a corporation, the title 
of the officer.
    (2) Fiduciaries. Receivers, trustees, assignees, executors, 
administrators, and other legal representatives who continue the 
business of a bankrupt, insolvent, deceased person, etc., shall indicate 
the fiduciary capacity in which they act.
    (3) Agent or attorney in fact. If a return is signed by an agent or 
attorney in fact, the signature shall be preceded by the name of the 
principal and followed by the title of the agent or attorney in fact. A 
return signed by a person as agent will not be accepted unless there is 
filed, with the ATF office with which the return is required to be 
filed, a power of attorney authorizing the agent to perform the act.
    (4) Perjury statement. ATF Forms 5630.5 shall contain or be verified 
by a written declaration that the return has been executed under the 
penalties of perjury.

<R05>
Sec. 290.34  Employer identification number.

    (a) Requirement. The employer identification number (defined in 26 
CFR 301.7701-12) of the taxpayer who has been assigned such a number 
shall be shown on each special tax return, including amended returns, 
filed under this subpart. Failure of the taxpayer to include the 
employer identification number may result in the imposition of the 
penalty specified in Sec. 70.113 of this chapter.
    (b) Application for employer identification number. Each taxpayer 
who files a special tax return, who has not already been assigned an 
employer identification number, shall file IRS Form SS-4 to apply for 
one. The taxpayer shall apply for and be assigned only one employer 
identification number, regardless of the number of places of business 
for which the taxpayer is required to file a special tax return. The 
employer identification number shall be applied for no later than 7 days 
after the filing of the taxpayer's first special tax return. IRS Form 
SS-4 may be obtained from the director of an IRS service center or from 
any IRS district director.
    (c) Preparation and filing of IRS Form SS-4. The taxpayer shall 
prepare and

[[Page 234]]

file IRS Form SS-4, together with any supplementary statement, in 
accordance with the instructions on the form or issued in respect to it.

<R05>
Sec. 290.35  Issuance, distribution, and examination of special tax stamps.

    (a) Issuance of special tax stamps. Upon filing a properly executed 
return on ATF Form 5630.5 together with the full remittance, the 
taxpayer will be issued an appropriately designated special tax stamp. 
If the return covers multiple locations, the taxpayer will be issued one 
appropriately designated stamp for each location listed on the 
attachment to ATF Form 5630.5 required by Sec. 290.33(c)(2), but 
showing, as to name and address, only the name of the taxpayer and the 
address of the taxpayer's principal place of business (or principal 
office in the case of a corporate taxpayer).
    (b) Distribution of special tax stamps for multiple locations. On 
receipt of the special tax stamps, the taxpayer shall verify that there 
is one stamp for each location listed on the attachment to ATF Form 
5630.5. The taxpayer shall designate one stamp for each location and 
type on each stamp the address of the business conducted at the location 
for which that stamp is designated. The taxpayer shall then forward each 
stamp to the place of business designated on the stamp.
    (c) Examination of special tax stamps. All stamps denoting payment 
of special tax shall be kept available for inspection by ATF officers, 
at the location for which designated, during business hours.

<R05>
Sec. 290.36  Changes in special tax stamps.

    (a) Change in name. If there is a change in the corporate or firm 
name, or in the trade name, as shown on ATF Form 5630.5, the export 
warehouse proprietor shall file an amended special tax return as soon as 
practicable after the change, covering the new corporate or firm name, 
or trade names. No new special tax is required to be paid. The export 
warehouse proprietor shall attach the special tax stamp for endorsement 
of the change in name.
    (b) Change in proprietorship--(1) General. If there is a change in 
the proprietorship of an export warehouse, the successor shall pay a new 
special tax and obtain the required special tax stamps.
    (2) Exemption for certain successors. Persons having the right of 
succession provided for in paragraph (c) of this section may carry on 
the business for the remainder of the period for which the special tax 
was paid, without paying a new special tax, if within 30 days after the 
date on which the successor begins to carry on the business, the 
successor files a special tax return on ATF Form 5630.5 with ATF, which 
shows the basis of succession. A person who is a successor to a business 
for which special tax has been paid and who fails to register the 
succession is liable for special tax computed from the first day of the 
calendar month in which he or she began to carry on the business.
    (c) Persons having right of succession. Under the conditions 
indicated in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the right of succession 
will pass to certain persons in the following cases:
    (1) Death. The widowed spouse or child, or executor, administrator 
or other legal representative of the taxpayer;
    (2) Succession of spouse. A husband or wife succeeding to the 
business of his or her spouse (living);
    (3) Insolvency. A receiver or trustee in bankruptcy, or an assignee 
for benefit of creditors;
    (4) Withdrawal from firm. The partner or partners remaining after 
death or withdrawal of a member.
    (d) Change in location. If there is a change in location of a 
taxable place of business, the export warehouse proprietor shall, within 
30 days after the change, file with ATF an amended special tax return 
covering the new location. The export warehouse proprietor shall attach 
the special tax stamp or stamps, for endorsement of the change in 
location. No new special tax is required to be paid. However, if the 
export warehouse proprietor does not file the amended return within 30 
days, he

[[Page 235]]

or she is required to pay a new special tax and obtain a new special tax 
stamp.

customs warehouse, without payment of tax, for delivery to vessels and 
aircraft, as supplies, for consumption beyond the jurisdiction of the

provisions of this part. Deliveries may be made to vessels actually 
engaged in foreign, intercoastal, or noncontiguous territory trade 
(i.e., vessels operating on a regular schedule in trade or actually 
transporting passengers and/or cargo (a) between a port in the United 
States and a foreign port; (b) between the Atlantic and Pacific ports of 
the United States; or (c) between a port on the mainland of the United 
States and a port in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or 
a possession of the United States; between a port in Alaska and a port

other governmental activity; or to vessels of the United States 
documented to engage in the fishing business (including the whaling 
business), and foreign fishing (including whaling) vessels of 5 net tons 
or over. Such deliveries to vessels shall be subject to lading under 
customs supervision as provided in Secs. 290.207 and 290.263. As a 
condition to the lading of the tobacco products, and cigarette papers 
and tubes, the customs authorities at the port of lading may, f they 
deem it necessary in order to protect the revenue, require assurances, 
satisfactory to them, from the master of the receiving vessel that the 
quantities to be laden are reasonable, considering the number of persons 
to be carried, the vessel's itinerary, the duration of its intended 
voyage, etc., and that such articles are to be used exclusively as 
supplies on

[[Page 236]]

the voyage. For this purpose, the customs authorities may require the 
master of the receiving vessel to submit for their approval, prior to 
lading, an application on Customs Form 5127 for permission to lade the 
articles. Where the customs authorities allow only a portion of a 
shipment to be laden, the remainder of the shipment shall be returned to 
the bonded premises of the manufacturer, export warehouse proprietor, or 
customs warehouse proprietor making the shipment, or otherwise disposed 
of as approved by the regional director (compliance) for the region from 
which the articles were shipped. Deliveries may be made to aircraft 
clearing through customs en route to a place or places beyond the 
jurisdiction of the internal revenue laws of the United States, and to

defined in the Air Commerce Regulations (19 CFR part 6) of the Bureau of 
Customs). Deliveries may not be made to a vessel or aircraft stationed 
in the United States for an indefinite period and where its schedule 
does not include operations outside such jurisdiction.

as provided in this section, may use an alternate method or procedure in 
lieu of a method or procedure specifically prescribed in this part. The

conditions, when he finds that--
    (a) Good cause has been shown for the use of the alternate method or 
procedure.
    (b) The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and 
consistent with the effect intended by, the specifically prescribed 
method or procedure, and affords equivalent security to the revenue, and
    (c) The alternate method or procedure will not be contrary to any

Government or hinder the effective administration of this part. No 
alternate method or procedure relating to the giving of any bond or to 
the assessment, payment, or collection of tax, shall be authorized under 
this section. Where a manufacturer or proprietor desires to employ an 
alternate method or procedure, he shall submit a written application to 
do so, in triplicate, to the regional director (compliance) for 
transmittal to the Director. The application shall specifically describe 
the proposed alternate method or procedure, and shall set forth the

procedures, conditions, and limitations shall automatically terminate 
the authority for such variations and the manufacturer, export warehouse 
proprietor, or customs warehouse proprietor, thereupon shall fully

[[Page 239]]

comply with the prescribed requirements of regulations from which the 
variations were authorized. Authority for any variations may be 
withdrawn whenever in the judgment of the Director the revenue is 
jeopardized or the effective administration of this part is hindered by

surety. The regional director (compliance) who is authorized to approve 
the bond may, whenever he deems it necessary, require additional 
evidence of the authority of the agent

[[Page 244]]

or officer to execute the bond or extension of coverage of bond. The 
power of attorney shall be prepared on a form provided by the surety 
company and executed under the corporate seal of the company. If the 
power of attorney submitted is other than a manually signed document, it 
shall be accompanied by a certificate of its validity.

proprietor as security in connection with bond to cover his operations, 
in lieu of the corporate surety, in accordance with the provisions of 
Treasury Department Circular No. 154, revised (31 CFR part 225). Such

    The amount of the bond filed by the export warehouse proprietor, as

Provided, That the amount of any such bond (or the total amount where 
original and strengthening bonds are filed) shall not exceed $200,000 
nor be less than $1,000. The charge against such bond shall be subject 
to increase upon receipt of tobacco products, and cigarette papers and 
tubes into the export warehouse and to decrease as satisfactory evidence 
of exportation, or satisfactory evidence of such other disposition as 
may be used as the lawful basis for crediting such bond, is received by 
the regional director (compliance) with respect to such articles 
transferred or removed. When the limit of liability under a bond given 
in less than the maximum amount has been reached, no additional 
shipments shall be received into the warehouse until a strengthening or 
superseding bond is filed, as required by Sec. 290.124 or Sec. 290.125.

Sec. 290.124  Strengthening bond.

    Where the regional director (compliance) determines that the amount 
of the bond, under which an export warehouse proprietor is currently 
carrying on business, no longer adequately protects the revenue, and 
such bond is in an amount of less than $200,000, the regional director 
(compliance) administrator may require the proprietor to file a 
strengthening bond in an appropriate amount with the same surety as that 
on the bond already in effect, in lieu of a superseding bond to cover 
the full liability on the basis of Sec. 290.123. The regional director 
(compliance) shall refuse to approve any strengthening bond where any 
notation is made thereon which is intended or which may be construed as 
a release of any former bond, or as limiting the amount of either bond 
to less than its full amount.

approves a request

[[Page 245]]

from the surety on the current bond to terminate his liability under the 
bond, (c) payment of any liability under a bond is made by the surety 
thereon, or (d) the regional director (compliance) considers such a

operations by the export warehouse proprietor, or otherwise in

Treasury Department Circular No. 154 (31 CFR Part 225--Acceptance of 
Bonds, Notes or Other Obligations Issued or Guaranteed by the United 
States as Security in Lieu of Surety or Sureties on Penal Bonds). When 
the regional director (compliance) is satisfied that it is no longer 
necessary to hold such security, he shall fix the date or dates on which 
a part or all of such security may be released. At any time prior to the 
release of such security, the regional director (compliance) may, for 
proper cause, extend the date of release of such security for such 
additional length of time as in his judgment may be appropriate.

    (a) Where tobacco products, or cigarette papers or tubes are removed 
from a factory or an export warehouse for export to a contiguous foreign 
country, the manufacturer or export warehouse proprietor making the 
shipment shall--
    (1) Furnish to the district director of Customs at the port of exit 
two copies of the notice of removal, Form 2149/2150 (5200.14), together 
with the related shipper's export declaration, Commerce Form 7525-V (if 
required); and,
    (2) If copies of the notice of removal are not filed with the 
shippers export declaration, or if a shipment is for the armed forces of 
the United States in the contiguous foreign country and a shipper's 
export declaration is not required, show all the information on the 
notice of removal when it is filed so that the Customs officer is able 
to associate the notice with the related shipper's export declaration 
(if any) or other documents filed with Customs for the shipment.
    (b) When a shipment has been cleared by Customs from the United 
States, and when the Customs officer at the port of exit is satisfied 
that the products have departed from the United States, he shall--
    (1) Complete the certificate of exportation on both copies of the 
notice of removal;
    (2) Retain one copy of the notice of removal for his records; and,
    (3) Return the other copy to the manufacturer or export warehouse 
proprietor making the shipment for filing with his regional director 
(compliance).

[[Page 255]]

    (c) The Customs officer may, when he considers it necessary to 
establish that the merchandise was actually exported, require a landing 
certificate before he completes the certificate of exportation specified 
in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If practical, the Customs officer 
will give advance notice to the manufacturer or export warehouse 
proprietor of the type of transactions for which a landing certificate 
will be required. However, failure to notify the manufacturer or 
proprietor in advance will not prevent the Customs officer from 
requiring a landing certificate for specific exportations when he 
considers it necessary to protect the revenue. In any case, the Customs 
officer will advise the manufacturer or proprietor before departure of 
the shipment from the United States as to those exports for which a 
landing certificate will be required.
    (d) The provisions of this section relating to landing certificates 
also apply when a Form 2149/2150 (5200.14) is not required for each 
transaction (for example: When multiple exportations, individually 
documented by commercial records, are consolidated on a single Form 
2149/2150 (5200.14) pursuant to an approved alternate procedure under 
Sec. 290.72). The provisions apply to each transaction, regardless of 
the manner in which it is documented, unless specifically provided 
otherwise in the alternate procedure.

himself that the articles have in fact been taxpaid and each package 
bears the label or notice required by Sec. 290.222. When the stamps have 
been properly destroyed, or the packages bear the required label or 
notice, the ATF officer will supervise the packing of such articles in

shown that no such officer can furnish such landing certificate, in 
which case the certificate of landing shall be signed by the consignee, 
or by the vessel's agent at the place of landing, and shall be sworn to 
before a notary public or other officer authorized to administer oaths 
and having an official seal. The landing certificate shall be filed with

    In case of inability to furnish the prescribed evidence of landing, 
application for relief shall be promptly made by the claimant to the 
regional director (compliance) with whom the drawback claim and bond 
were filed. Such application shall set forth the facts connected with 
the alleged exportation, and indicate the date of shipment, the kind, 
quantity, and value of tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes 
shipped, the name of the consignee, the name of the vessel, the port or 
place of destination to which the shipment was made, and the date and 
amount of the bond covering such shipment. The application shall also 
state in what particular the provisions of this subpart, respecting the 
proofs of landing, have not been complied with, and the cause of failure 
to furnish such proofs; that such failure was not occasioned by any lack 
of diligence on the part of the claimant, or that of his agents; and 
that he is unable to furnish any other or better evidence than that 
furnished with his application. Each such application shall be supported 
by the best collateral evidence the claimant may be able to submit. The 
evidence may consist of the original or verified copies of letters from 
the consignee advising the claimant of the arrival or sale of the 
tobacco products, and cigarette papers and tubes, with such other 
statements respecting the failure to furnish the prescribed evidence of 
landing as may be obtained from the consignee or other persons having 
knowledge thereof. Such letters and other documents in a foreign 
language shall be accompanied by accurate translations thereof in 
English, and, when the letters fail to identify sufficiently the tobacco 
products, and cigarette papers and tubes, the original sales account 
must be produced.

Sec. 290.242  Responsibility for tax on cigars.

    A customs warehouse proprietor who withdraws cigars for export under 
his bond, without payment of tax, in accordance with the provisions of 
this part, shall be responsible for payment of such tax until he is 
relieved of such responsibility by furnishing the regional director 
(compliance), for the region in which is located the customs warehouse 
from which the cigars were withdrawn, evidence satisfactory to the 
regional director (compliance) of exportation or proper delivery, as 
required by this subpart, or satisfactory evidence of such other 
disposition as may be used as the lawful basis for such relief. Such 
evidence shall be furnished within 90 days of the date of withdrawal of

shall, prior to making the first withdrawal, file with the regional 
director (compliance) a bond, Form 2104, conditioned upon compliance 
with the provisions of 26 U.S.C. chapter 52, and regulations thereunder, 
including, but not limited to, the timely payment of taxes imposed by

<R05>
Sec. 290.244  Amount of bond.

    The amount of the bond filed by the customs warehouse proprietor, as 
required by Sec. 290.243, shall be not less than the estimated amount of 
tax which may at any time constitute a charge against the bond: 
Provided, That the amount of any such bond (or the total amount where 
original and strengthening bonds are filed) shall not exceed $25,000 nor 
be less than $1,000. The charges against such bond shall be subject to 
increase as withdrawals are made and decrease as required evidence of 
exportation is received by the regional director (compliance) with 
respect to cigars withdrawn. When the limit of liability under a bond 
given in less than the maximum amount has been reached, further 
withdrawals shall not be made thereunder until a strengthening or 
superseding bond is filed as required by Sec. 290.245 or Sec. 290.246.


<R05>
Sec. 290.245  Strengthening bond.

    Where the regional director (compliance) determines that the amount 
of the bond, under which the customs warehouse proprietor is withdrawing 
cigars for shipment under this subpart, no longer adequately protects 
the revenue, and such bond is in an amount of less than $25,000, the 
regional director (compliance) may require the proprietor to file a 
strengthening bond in an appropriate amount with the same surety as that 
on the bond already in effect, in lieu of a superseding bond to cover 
the full liability on the basis of Sec. 290.244. The regional director 
(compliance) shall refuse to approve any strengthening bond where any 
notation is made thereon which is intended or which may be construed as 
a release of any former bond, or as limiting the amount of either bond 
to less than its full amount.


<R05>
Sec. 290.246  Superseding bond.

    The customs warehouse proprietor shall file a new bond to supersede 
his current bond, immediately when (a) the corporate surety on the 
current bond becomes insolvent, (b) the regional director (compliance) 
approves a request from the surety on the current bond to terminate his 
liability under the bond, (c) payment of any liability under a bond is 
made by the surety thereon, or (d) the regional director (compliance) 
considers such a superseding bond necessary for the protection of the 
revenue.


<R05>
Sec. 290.247  Termination of liability of surety under bond.

    The liability of a surety on any bond required by this subpart shall 
be terminated only as to operations on and after the effective date of a 
superseding bond, or the date of approval of the customs warehouse 
proprietor's request for termination, or otherwise, in accordance with 
the termination provisions of the bond. The surety shall remain bound in 
respect of any liability for unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest, not 
in excess of the amount of the bond, incurred by the proprietor while 
the bond is in force.

<R05>
Sec. 295.21  Alternate methods or procedures.

    A manufacturer, on specific approval by the Director as provided in 
this section, may use an alternate method or procedure in lieu of a 
method or procedure specifically prescribed in this part. The Director 
may approve an alternate method or procedure, subject to stated 
conditions, when he finds that:

[[Page 269]]

    (a) Good cause has been shown for the use of the alternate method or 
procedure.
    (b) The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and 
consistent with the effect intended by, the specifically prescribed 
method or procedure, and affords equivalent security to the revenue, and
    (c) The alternate method or procedure will not be contrary to any 
provision of law, and will not result in an increase in cost to the 
Government or hinder the effective administration of this part.

No alternate method or procedure relating to the giving of any bond or 
to the assessment, payment, or collection of tax, shall be authorized 
under this section. Where a manufacturer desires to employ an alternate 
method or procedure, he shall submit a written application to do so, in 
triplicate, to the regional director (compliance) for transmittal to the 
Director. The application shall specifically describe the proposed 
alternate method or procedure, and shall set forth the reasons therefor. 
Alternate methods or procedures shall not be employed until the 
application has been approved by the Director. The manufacturer shall, 
during the period of authorization of an alternate method or procedure, 
comply with the terms of the approved application. Authorization for any 
alternate method or procedure may be withdrawn whenever in the judgment 
of the Director the revenue is jeopardized or the effective 
administration of this part is hindered. The manufacturer shall retain, 
as part of his records, any authorization of the Director under this 
section for three years following the close of the calendar year in 
which the operation under such authorization is concluded.


<R05>
Sec. 295.22  Emergency variations from requirements.

    The Director may approve methods of operation other than as

proposed variations from the specified requirements are necessary, and 
the proposed variations:
    (a) Will afford the security and protection to the revenue intended 
by the prescribed specifications.
    (b) Will not hinder the effective administration of this part, and
    (c) Will not be contrary to any provision of law.

Variations from requirements granted under this section are conditioned 
on compliance with the procedures, conditions, and limitations set forth 
in the approval of the application. Failure to comply in good faith with 
such procedures, conditions, and limitations shall automatically 
terminate the authority for such variations and the manufacturer 
thereupon shall fully comply with the prescribed requirements of 
regulations from which the variations were authorized. Authority for any 
variations may be withdrawn whenever in the judgment of the Director the 
revenue is jeopardized or the effective administration of this part is 
hindered by the continuation of such variation. Where a manufacturer 
desires to employ such variation, he shall submit a written application 
to do so, in triplicate, to the regional director (compliance) for 
transmittal to the Director. The application shall describe the proposed 
variations and set forth the reasons therefor. Variations shall not be 
employed until the application has been approved. The manufacturer shall 
retain, as part of his records, any authorization of the Director under 
this section for three years following the close of the calendar year in 
which the operation under such authorization is concluded.

shifting, and

data required by Sec. 296.8. All evidence relied upon in support of such 
claim shall be clearly set forth and submitted with the claim.

accompanied by a bond on Form 2490. The bond shall be executed by the

time of filing be accompanied by a power of attorney authorizing the 
agent or officer who executed the bond to so act on behalf of the 
surety. The regional director (compliance) who is authorized to approve 
the bond may, whenever he deems it necessary, require additional 
evidence of the authority of the agent or officer to execute the bond or 
extension of coverage of bond. The power of attorney shall be prepared 
on a form provided by the surety company and executed under the 
corporate seal of the company. If the power of attorney submitted is 
other than a manually signed document, it shall be accompanied by a 
certificate of its validity.
    (c) Treasury Department Circular No. 570 (Companies Holding 
Certificates of Authority as Acceptable Sureties on Federal Bonds and as

procedure is within the purpose of, and consistent with the effect 
intended by, the prescribed method or procedure, and affords equivalent 
security to the revenue, and the alternate method or procedure is not

cost to the Government or hinder the effective administration of this 
subpart. No alternate method or procedure relating to the assessment, 
payment or collection of tax, shall be authorized under this paragraph. 
A proprietor who wishes to use an alternate method or procedure shall

Sec. 296.194  Scope of tax.

    (a) General. Subject to the exceptions set forth in this section, 
the floor stocks tax is imposed on all Federally taxpaid or tax 
determined cigarettes which are held by any person for sale at the first 
moment of the respective tax increase dates of January 1, 1991, and 
January 1, 1993. Cigarettes subject to floor stocks tax are regarded as 
held for sale by the one who owns them at the first moment of each 
respective tax-increase date, although at the time the articles may be 
in transit to the owner, or in a warehouse, storeroom or distributing 
depot, and shall be included in the return and inventory of the owner. 
If ownership does not pass to the consignee until delivery, cigarettes 
in transit at the first moment of each respective tax-increase date 
shall be regarded as owned or held by the consignor at that time.
    (b) Exception. The floor stocks tax is not imposed on cigarettes 
held for sale by any person on the first moment of any tax-increase date 
if:
    (1) The aggregate number of cigarettes held by such person on each 
such date does not exceed 30,000. If such person's inventory includes 
large cigarettes more than 6\1/2\ inches in length, each 2\3/4\ inches 
or fraction thereof of the length of each shall be counted as one 
cigarette; and
    (2) Such person complies with the inventory requirements of 
Sec. 296.198 and the tax return filing requirements of Sec. 296.197 of 
this part. A controlled group may only claim the exception if the 
aggregate number of cigarettes held by all members of the controlled 
group on

[[Page 288]]

the respective tax-increase dates does not exceed 30,000.
    (c) Credit against tax. Each person shall be allowed as a credit 
against the floor stocks tax improsed by paragraph (a) of this section 
an amount equal to $60, or the amount of floor stocks tax for which such 
person is liable, whichever is less. Controlled groups are eligible for 
one credit amount for the entire group. Dealers who are component 
members of a controlled group must apportion the $60 credit among the 
members of the group. The credit may be divided equally among the 
members or apportioned in any other manner agreeable to the members. An 
attachment shall be made to the tax returns required by Sec. 296.197 for 
the members of the controlled group showing the name, address, and 
amount of credit taken by each member of the controlled group.
    (d) Vending machines. The floor stocks tax shall not be imposed on 
cigarettes held by any person in any vending machine on the first moment 
of each respective tax-increase date. Cigarettes owned by vending 
machine operators on the first moment of each respective tax-increase 
date and held in transit or in storage facilities on those dates and not 
in the vending machines are not exempt from floor stocks tax. Vending 
machine operators are subject to the inventory requirements of 
Sec. 296.198 and the tax return filing requirements of Sec. 296.197 of 
this part if they hold any cigarettes outside of vending machines on the 
first moment of each respective tax-increase date.
    (e) Treatment of cigarettes in foreign trade zones. Notwithstanding 
the Act of June 18, 1934 (48 Stat. 998, 19 U.S.C. 81a) or any other 
provisions of law, cigarettes which are held in a foreign trade zone on 
the first moment of January 1, 1991, or the first moment of January 1, 
1993, shall be subject to floor stocks tax and shall be treated for 
purposes of this subpart as held on such date for sale if
    (1) Internal Revenue taxes have been determined, or Customs duties 
liquidated, with respect to such cigarettes before such date pursuant to 
a request made under the first proviso of section 3(a) of such Act, or
    (2) Such cigarettes are held on such date under the supervision of a 
Customs officer pursuant to the second proviso of section 3(a) of such 
Act.
    (f) Cigarettes held in bond. The floor stocks tax does not apply to 
cigarettes held in ATF or customs bond on the first moment of each 
respective tax-increase date.

    (a) General. Each person who holds for sale, at the first moment of 
the respective tax-increase dates of January 1, 1991, and January 1,

return for the cigarettes so held. The return shall be made on ATF Form 
5000.28, Floor Stocks Tax Return, in accordance with the instructions on 
the form. The returns shall be filed no later than June 30, 1991 (with 
respect to the tax increase date of January 1, 1991), and June 30, 1993 
(with respect to the tax-increase date of January 1, 1993), at the 
address indicated on the form. The provisions of 26 U.S.C. 5703(b)(2)(D) 
concerning the special rule where a return due date falls on a Saturday, 
Sunday or holiday, and of 27 CFR 70.305 concerning timely mailing apply 
to floor stocks tax.
    (b) Multiple locations. Where cigarettes subject to floor stocks tax 
are held at more than one location or place of business, the taxpayer 
shall file either a consolidated return (if all locations have the same 
employer identification number) or a separate return for each place of 
business. In either case, the taxpayer shall make and retain a list, 
showing the address of each place of business where the taxpayer held 
cigarettes subject to floor stocks tax, the name of the proprietor of 
each such place of business (if different from the taxpayer), the 
employer identification number (if different from the taxpayer's), and 
the number and tax category of cigarettes so held at each such place. 
Cigarettes which are warehoused at one or more locations shall be 
reported on a tax return representing the location from which the 
warehoused cigarettes will be offered for sale. If cigarettes held in a 
warehouse are offered for sale at several locations, the cigarettes so 
held shall either be reported on the tax return filed by any one of 
those locations, or shall be apportioned among the several locations in 
any manner and reported on the tax returns filed at those locations.
    (c) Controlled groups. A separate return must be filed by each 
member of a controlled group who has an individual employer 
identification number. The credit discussed in Sec. 296.194(c) of this 
part may be apportioned among the members of the controlled group and 
reported on the various returns. A list showing the names, addresses, 
and employer identification numbers of all members of a controlled group 
shall be retained by each member who files a separate return.

Sec. 296.198  Inventory.

    (a) General. The floor stocks tax liability required to be shown on 
the floor stocks tax return shall be established by a complete physical 
inventory, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. The 
inventory shall be the basis for establishing the quantity of all large 
and small cigarettes subject to floor stocks tax held as of the first 
moment of the respective tax-increase dates of January 1, 1991, and 
January 1, 1993. Cigarettes in transit on the first moment of January 1, 
1991, and on the first moment of January 1, 1993, shall be included in 
the inventory of the person (either consignor or consignee) who is the 
legal owner of the articles at that moment.
    (b) Source record inventory. In lieu of a physical inventory, a book 
or record inventory may be used if supported by source records which 
indicate the receipt and disposition of all cigarettes subject to floor 
stocks tax, and reflect the actual quantity of such cigarettes on hand 
as if a physical inventory had been taken as of the first moment of the 
respective tax-increase dates. The proprietor's records must include (1) 
the name and address of the consignor and consignee, (2) the date of 
receipt or disposition, (3) brand name, (4) class of cigarettes, and 
length of large cigarettes, if more than 6\1/2\ inches in length, and 
(5) the quantity of cigarettes involved.
    (c) Record of inventory. The inventory shall be recorded in writing 
as it is

[[Page 290]]

retained as prescribed in Sec. 296.199. The record of inventory shall 
show the quantities of large and small cigarettes held for sale by the 
taxpayer at the first moment of January 1, 1991, and the first moment of 
January 1, 1993. Quantities in transit shall be recorded separately from 
quantities actually on hand. Unmerchantable articles held for return to 
a supplier because of some defect are not subject to floor stocks tax, 
so such articles must be recorded separately from taxable items on the 
inventory report. (Products which are being returned because of poor 
market demand or to reduce inventory are not considered unmerchantable.) 
The record of inventory shall show the taxpayer's name and the address 
of the place of business where the cigarettes are held. The record of 
inventory shall include complete and accurate information showing the 
details of the inventory, when and by whom the inventory was taken. If 
the inventory was verified by anyone other than the person taking it, 
the name and title of that other person shall also be shown.
    (d) Time of taking inventory. The physical inventory to determine 
the amount of cigarettes held on the respective tax-increase dates of 
January 1, 1991, and January 1, 1993, may be taken no later than January 
10 immediately following the respective tax-increase date and no earlier 
than December 26 of the preceding year. If the physical inventory is not 
taken between the close of business on the last respective business day 
of 1990 and 1992 and the beginning of business on the first respective 
business day of 1991 and 1993, the records of inventory shall be 
reconciled to reflect the actual quantity of cigarettes held as of the 
first moment of January 1, 1991, and January 1, 1993, respectively; and 
shall include complete supporting records of receipt and disposition.

Sec. 296.199  Retention of records.

    Every person liable for floor stocks tax shall keep the copy of the 
floor stocks tax return at the place of business covered thereby, or, in 
the case of a consolidated return, at the principal place of business. 
The record of physical inventory shall be kept at the place of business 
to which the inventory pertains. In the case of a consolidated return, a 
copy of the record of inventory shall also be kept at the taxpayer's 
principal place of business. Such documents and records shall be 
retained for at least 3 years after the date of filing of the floor 
stocks tax return, and shall be available for inspection by ATF 
officers. The regional director (compliance) may also require these 
documents and records to be retained for an additional period of not 
more than 3 years in any case where the regional director (compliance) 
deems such retention to be necessary or advisable for the protection of 
the revenue.

Sec. 296.200  Refund of floor stocks tax.

    A claim for refund may be filed by any person who has paid a floor 
stocks tax on cigarettes and who claims that such person made an 
overpayment of that tax. Such a claim shall be filed on ATF Form 2635 
(5620.8), contain the information required by the form, and be supported 
by a statement of the facts and evidence upon which the claim is based. 
The claim shall be filed with the regional director (compliance), Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, for the region in which the inventory 
was held and on which the tax was paid. Claims filed under this section 
shall comply with the provisions of subpart A of this part.

Sec. 296.201  Penalties and interest.

    (a) Penalties. All civil and criminal penalties and forfeiture 
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (title 26 U.S.C.), which are 
applicable to excise taxes on cigarettes, are applicable also to floor 
stocks tax.
    (b) Interest. Interest shall accrue at the underpayment rate 
established by 26 U.S.C. 6621, compounded daily, on all floor stocks tax 
that is not paid on or before June 30, 1991, and/or June 30, 1993.

Sec. 296.202  Authority of ATF officers.

    (a) Entry of premises; penalties for interference. Any ATF officer 
may enter, in the performance of official duties, in the daytime, any 
premises where cigarettes subject to floor stocks tax are kept, so far 
as may be necessary for the purpose of examining such products. When 
such premises are open at night, any ATF officer may enter them, while 
so open, in the performance of official duties. If the owner or other 
person in charge of such premises refuses to admit any ATF officer, or 
to permit the ATF officer to examine such cigarettes, the owner or other 
person shall be liable to the penalty prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 7342. 
Further, if anyone corruptly, or by force or threats of force, attempts 
to intimidate or impede any ATF officer in the performance of official 
duties, such person shall be liable to the penalty prescribed by 26 
U.S.C. 7212.
    (b) Other authority. For the purpose of ascertaining, determining, 
or collecting floor stocks tax, or of inquiring into any offense 
connected with the administration or enforcement of floor stocks tax:
    (1) Any ATF officer may examine any books, papers, records, or other 
data which may be relevant or material to that inquiry, and may take any 
testimony of any person concerned, under oath, as may be relevant or 
material to the inquiry.
    (2) Any ATF officer, to whom authority has been delegated by 
Sec. 70.22 of this chapter, in any case where there is no Justice 
Department referral, may issue summonses compelling the production of 
any books of account or other data pertaining to liability for floor 
stocks tax, or the appearance of any person liable for floor stocks tax 
or having in such person's possession such books of account or data, or 
any other appropriate person, at a place and time stated in the summons.
