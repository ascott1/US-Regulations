                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, April 1, 2004), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

    An importer, on specific approval by the Director as provided in 
this section, may use an alternate method or procedure in lieu of a 
method or procedure specifically prescribed in this part. The Director 
may approve an alternate method or procedure, subject to stated 
conditions, when he finds that--
    (a) Good cause has been shown for the use of the alternate method or 
procedure,
    (b) The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and 
consistent with the effect intended by, the specifically prescribed 
method or procedure, and affords equivalent security to the revenue, and
    (c) The alternate method of procedure will not be contrary to any 
provision of law, and will not result in an increase in cost to the 
Government or hinder the effective administration of this part.

No alternate method or procedure relating to the giving of any bond or 
to the assessment, payment, or collection of tax, shall be authorized 
under this section. When an importer desires to employ an alternate 
method or procedure, he shall submit a written application to do so, in 
triplicate, to the regional director (compliance) for transmittal to the 
Director. The application shall specifically describe the proposed 
alternate method or procedure, and shall set forth the reasons therefor. 
Alternate methods or procedures shall not be employed until the 
application has been approved by the Director. The importer shall, 
during the period of authorization of an alternate method or procedure, 
comply with the terms of the approved application. Authorization for any 
alternate method or procedure may be withdrawn whenever in the judgment 
of the Director the revenue is jeopardized or the effective 
administration of this part is hindered. The importer shall retain, as 
part of his records, any authorization of the Director under this

    (c) Will not be contrary to any provision of law.

Variations from requirements granted under this section are conditioned 
on

[[Page 12]]

compliance with the procedures, conditions, and limitations set forth in 
the approval of the application. Failure to comply in good faith and 
with such procedures, conditions, and limitations shall automatically 
terminate the authority for such variations and the importer thereupon 
shall fully comply with the prescribed requirements of regulations from 
which the variations were authorized. Authority for any variations may 
be withdrawn whenever in the judgment of the Director the revenue is 
jeopardized or the effective administration of this part is hindered by 
the continuation of such variation. Where an importer desires to employ 
such variation, he shall submit a written application to do so, in 
triplicate, to the regional director (compliance) for transmittal to the 
Director. The application shall describe the proposed variations and set

    The importer of tobacco products or cigarette papers and tubes will 
be liable for the internal revenue taxes imposed thereon by 26 U.S.C. 
5701 or 7652: Provided, That tobacco products or cigarette papers or 
tubes (other than those previously exported and returned) imported or 
brought into the United States, may be released from customs custody 
without payment of tax, for delivery to the proprietor of an export 
warehouse, to a manufacturer of tobacco products, or to a manufacturer 
of cigarette papers or tubes (except for tobacco products), if such 
articles are not put up in packages (see Sec. 275.11). Under these 
circumstances the transferee will become liable for the internal revenue 
tax on such articles upon release from customs custody and the importer 
will thereupon be relieved of the liability for such tax. If the 
transferee is also the importer, then the importer will not be relieved 
of the liability for such tax.

the limitations prescribed in 26 U.S.C. 6501. The tax so assessed shall 
be in addition to the penalties imposed by law for failure to pay such 
tax when required. Except in cases where delay may jeopardize collection 
of the tax, or where the amount is nominal or the result of an evident 
mathematical error, no such assessment shall be made until and after 
notice has been afforded such person to show cause against assessment. 
The person will be allowed 45 days from the date of such notice to show 
cause, in writing, against such assessment.

Sec. 275.63  Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.

    (a) Each importer who was liable, during a calendar year, for a 
gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in taxes on 
cigars, cigarettes, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes combining tax 
liabilities incurred under this part and part 40 of this chapter, shall 
use a commercial bank in making payment by electronic fund transfer 
(EFT) of such taxes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment of such 
taxes by cash, check, or money order is not authorized for an importer 
who is required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. For 
purposes of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is defined 
as the gross tax liability on all taxable withdrawals and importations 
(including similar products brought into the United States from Puerto 
Rico or the Virgin Islands) during the calendar year, without regard to 
any drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises from which such 
activities are conducted by the taxpayer.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a 
controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and 
implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except 
that the words ``at least 80 percent'' shall be replaced by the words 
``more than 50 percent'' in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 
26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the 
rules for a ``controlled group of corporations'' apply in a similar 
fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole 
proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a 
group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or 
sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one 
taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make 
remittances by EFT.

[[Page 16]]

    (c) For the purposes of this section, (1) electronic fund transfer 
or EFT means any transfer of funds, other than a transaction originated 
by check, draft, or similar paper instrument, which is initiated through 
an electronic terminal, telephonic instrument, or computer of magnetic 
tape, so as to order, instruct, or authorize a financial institution to 
either debit or credit an account, in accordance with procedures 
established by the U.S. Customs Service, and (2) electronic fund 
transfer or EFT does not have the meaning defined in Sec. 275.11 for 
use elswhere in this part.

by EFT, shall make the EFT remittance in accordance with the 
requirements of the U.S. Customs Service.

<R05>
Sec. 275.82  Restrictions on tobacco products labeled for export.

    (a) The provisions of this section apply to tobacco products and 
cigarette papers and tubes manufactured in the United States and labeled 
for exportation under parts 44 and 270 of this chapter.
    (b) Articles described in paragraph (a) of this section may be 
transferred to or removed from the premises of a manufacturer or an 
export warehouse proprietor only if such articles are being transferred 
or removed without tax as provided in this part.
    (c) Articles described in paragraph (a) of this section may only be 
imported or brought into the United

[[Page 19]]

States, after their exportation, under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 
5704(d), by release from Customs custody for delivery to the original 
manufacturer of such tobacco products or cigarette papers or tubes or to 
the proprietor of an export warehouse authorized by such manufacturer to 
receive such articles. These products are transferred in bond and are 
released from Customs custody without payment of that part of the duty 
attributable to internal revenue tax.
    (d) Articles described in paragraph (a) of this section that are not 
put up in packages may be imported or brought into the United States 
under 26 U.S.C. 5704(c) by release from Customs custody without payment 
of tax for delivery to the original manufacturer of such articles. 
However, because such articles are also eligible for release under 26 
U.S.C. 5704(d), such articles will be treated as though released under 
section 5704(d), due to the penalty provisions in section 5761(c).
    (e) Articles described in paragraph (a) of this section may not be 
sold or held for sale for domestic consumption in the United States 
unless such articles are removed from their export packaging and 
repackaged by the original manufacturer into new packaging that does not 
contain an export label. The new packages, marks and notices must 
conform to the requirements of 27 CFR part 270.
    (f) The provisions of this section shall apply to articles labeled 
for export even if the packaging or the appearance of such packaging to 
the consumer of such articles has been modified or altered by a person 
other than the original manufacturer so as to remove or conceal or 
attempt to remove or conceal (including by placement of a sticker over) 
any export label.
    (g) For purposes of this section, an article is labeled for export 
or contains an export label if it bears the mark, label, or notice 
required by Sec. 44.185 of this chapter.
    (h) For purposes of this section, references to exportation shall be 
treated as including a reference to shipment to the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico.
    (i) The provisions of this section do not apply to any person who, 
when entering U.S. manufactured tobacco products labeled for export 
under parts 44 and 270 of this chapter, claims and is granted an 
exemption from duty and tax for such products under chapter 98 of the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. The quantity of tobacco 
products entered may not exceed the quantity limit imposed on such 
products under the applicable tariff provision. A traveler claiming an 
exemption under this subsection upon arrival at the border may 
voluntarily relinquish to the U. S. Customs Service at the time of entry 
any excess of such quantity without incurring the penalty under section 
Sec. 275.83.
    (j) For civil penalties and forfeiture provisions related to 
violations of this section, see Sec. 275.83. For a criminal penalty 
applicable to any violation of this section see 26 U.S.C. 5762(b).

    Except for the return of exported products that are specifically 
authorized under Sec. 275.82(b) and (c):
    (a) Every person who sells, relands, or receives within the 
jurisdiction of the United States any tobacco products or cigarette 
papers or tubes which have been labeled or shipped for exportation under 
parts 44 and 270 of this chapter;
    (b) Every person who sells or receives such relanded tobacco 
products or cigarette papers or tubes; and,
    (c) Every person who aids or abets in such selling, relanding, or 
receiving, shall, in addition to the tax and any other penalty provided 
for in title 26 U.S.C., be liable for a penalty equal to the greater of 
$1,000 or 5 times the amount of the tax imposed by title 26 U.S.C. All 
tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes relanded within the 
jurisdiction of the United States shall be forfeited to the United 
States and destroyed. All vessels, vehicles and aircraft used in such 
relanding or in removing such products, papers, and tubes from the place 
where relanded, shall be forfeited to the United States.
    (d) The provisions of this section do not apply to any person who, 
when entering U.S. manufactured tobacco products labeled for export, 
claims and is granted an exemption from duty and

[[Page 20]]

tax for such products under chapter 98 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule 
of the United States. The quantity of tobacco products entered may not 
exceed the quantity limit imposed on such products under the applicable 
tariff provision. A traveler claiming an exemption under this subsection 
upon arrival at the border may voluntarily relinquish to the U. S. 
Customs Service at the time of entry any excess of such quantity without

Sec. 275.85  Release from customs custody of imported tobacco articles.

    (a) The provisions of this section apply only to tobacco products, 
cigarette papers, and cigarettes tubes, which are not put up in 
packages, i.e., not placed by the manufacturer or importer in packages 
in which the products will be sold to consumers. Tobacco products 
manufactured in a foreign country, the Virgin Islands, or a possession 
of the United States may be released by the Port Director of Customs or 
authorized customs officer from customs custody, without payment of 
internal revenue tax, for transfer to the factory of any manufacturer of 
tobacco products under the internal revenue bond of the manufacturer to 
whom such articles are released. Cigarette papers and tubes manufactured 
in a foreign country, the Virgin Islands, or a possession of the United 
States may be released by the Port Director of Customs or authorized 
customs officer from customs custody, without payment of internal 
revenue tax, for transfer, under the internal revenue bond of the 
manufacturer to whom such articles are released, to the factory of a 
manufacturer of cigarette papers and tubes; or a manufacturer of tobacco 
products solely for use in the manufacture of cigarettes. Releases under 
this section must be in accordance with Sec. 275.86: Provided, however, 
that in the case of products exported from the Virgin Islands, in order 
for a manufacturer of tobacco products or a manufacturer of cigarette 
papers and tubes to remove such products from customs custody in the 
United States under the manufacturer's internal revenue bond without 
payment of internal revenue tax, the manufacturer must file an extension 
of coverage of the internal revenue bond on ATF Form 2105, and receive a 
notice of approval from the appropriate ATF officer. The extension of 
coverage must be executed by the principal and the surety and must be in 
the following form:

    ``Whereas the purpose of this extension is to bind the obligors for 
the purpose of the tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. 7652(b), on tobacco products 
and tubes exported from the Virgin Islands and removed from customs 
custody in the United States without payment of internal revenue tax, 
for delivery to the principal on said bond.''
    ``Now, therefore, the said bond is further specifically conditioned 
that the principal named therein must pay all taxes imposed by 26 U.S.C. 
7652(b) plus penalties, if any, and interest, for which he may become 
liable with respect to these products exported from the Virgin Islands 
and removed from customs custody in the United States without payment of 
internal revenue tax thereon, and must comply with all provision of law 
and regulations with respect thereto.''

    (b) Articles received into the factory of a manufacturer under the 
provision of this section are subject to the provisions of part 40 of 
this chapter.

U.S.C. 1202) exported from and returned to the United States without 
change to the product or the shipping container may be released, under 
the bond of the manufacturer or export warehouse proprietor to whom such 
articles are released, from customs custody in the United States without 
payment of that part of the duty attributable to the internal revenue 
tax for delivery to the factory of any tobacco products manufacturer or 
to the permit premises of an export warehouse proprietor.
    (b) Domestically produced cigarette papers and tubes (classifiable 
under item 9801.00.80 of the Harmonized Tariff

[[Page 21]]

Schedule of the United States, 19 U.S.C. 1202) exported from and 
returned to the United States without change to the product or the

States without payment of that part of the duty attributable to the 
internal revenue tax for delivery, under the bond of the manufacturer to 
whom such articles are released, to the factory of:
    (1) A manufacturer of cigarette papers and tubes; or
    (2) A manufacturer of tobacco products solely for use in the 
manufacture of cigarettes.
    (c) Releases under this section must be in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in Sec. 275.86. Once released, the tobacco 
products and cigarette papers and tubes will be subject to the tax and 
all other provisions of 26 U.S.C. chapter 52, and, as applicable, 
subject to the provisions of the regulations in part 40 of this chapter 
as if they had not been exported or otherwise removed from internal 
revenue bond.

Sec. 275.86  Procedure for release.

    (a) Every manufacturer of tobacco products and cigarette papers and 
tubes and every export warehouse proprietor who desires to obtain the 
release of tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes from customs 
custody, without payment of internal revenue tax, under its internal 
revenue bond, as provided in Sec. Sec. 275.85 or 275.85a, must prepare 
a notice of release, Form 5200.11, in triplicate, and file the three 
copies of the form with the appropriate ATF officer. The appropriate ATF 
officer will not certify Form 5200.11 covering the release of tobacco 
products and cigarette papers and tubes unless the manufacturer is 
authorized, under part 40 of this chapter, to receive, without payment 
of tax, the kinds of articles set forth in the form.
    (b) Importers who are either manufacturers of tobacco products and 
cigarette papers and tubes or export warehouse proprietors, or their 
authorized agents, who request the release of tobacco products or 
cigarette papers and tubes from customs custody in the United States 
under this section, using customs electronic filing procedures, must not 
request such release until they have received the ATF Form 5200.11 
certified by the appropriate ATF officer. Once Customs releases the 
tobacco products or cigarette papers and tubes in accordance with 19 CFR 
Part 143, Customs Directives, and any other applicable instructions, the 
importer will send a copy of the ATF Form 5200.11 along with a copy of 
the electronic filing and customs release to the appropriate ATF officer 
at the address shown thereon. The importer will retain one copy of the 
ATF Form 5200.11 to meet ATF recordkeeping requirements and one copy to 
meet customs recordkeeping requirements.
    (c) Importers or their authorized agents requesting release of 
tobacco products or cigarette papers and tubes from customs custody in 
the United States under any other authorized procedure will submit all 
copies of the ATF Form 5200.11 to the appropriate customs officer along 
with their request for release. The customs officer will verify that the 
ATF Form 5200.11 has been certified by the appropriate ATF officer and 
return all copies to the importer or the importer's authorized 
representative.
    (d) Once Customs releases the tobacco products or cigarette papers 
and tubes in accordance with 19 CFR Part 143, Customs Directives, and 
any other applicable instructions, the importer will send a copy of the 
ATF Form 5200.11 along with a copy of the customs release to the 
appropriate ATF office at the address shown thereon. The importer will 
retain one copy of the ATF Form 5200.11 to meet ATF recordkeeping 
requirements and one copy to meet customs recordkeeping requirements.

Sec. 275.114a  Qualification for extended deferral.

    Note: This section applies only to removals made before January 1, 
1983.
    (a) Bonded manufacturers with bonds executed before September 1, 
1973. Bonded manufacturers with bonds on Form 2936 executed before 
September 1, 1973, who desire to file returns under this subpart with 
benefit of the extended deferral permitted by Sec. 275.114 shall file 
with the regional director (compliance) an extension of coverage of bond 
on Form 2105. Such extension of coverage shall identify the particular 
bond to which it applies and shall contain a statement of purpose as 
follows:

    To continue in effect said bond (including all extensions or 
limitations of terms and conditions previously consented to and 
approved) notwithstanding that the time for payment of the tax may be 
deferred by the extended deferral period permitted by regulations in 27 
CFR 275.114.


If the bond on Form 2986 is in an amount insufficient to cover an 
extended deferral period, according to the requirements of Sec. 
275.121, the bonded manufacturer must either file a new bond or file a 
strengthening bond to increase the total amount of the bonds then in 
force to a sufficient amount.
    (b) Bonded manufacturers with bonds executed after September 1, 
1973. Bonded manufacturers operating under original or superseding bonds 
executed after September 1, 1973, are automatically qualified for the 
extended deferral permitted by Sec. 275.114 (unless found in default as 
provided in Sec. 275.116). Such bonds must be executed in an amount 
sufficient to cover an extended deferral period, according to the 
requirements of Sec. 275.121.
    (c) Commencement of extended deferral. Bonded manufacturers may file 
returns with benefit of extended deferral only after the applicable 
bonds and extensions of coverage required by this section have been 
filed with and approved by the regional director (compliance).

Sec. 275.115a  Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.

    (a) General. (1) Each taxpayer who was liable, during a calendar 
year, for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in 
taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes 
combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and part 40 of this 
chapter, shall use a commercial bank in making payment by electronic 
fund transfer (EFT) of taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and 
cigarette tubes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment of taxes on 
tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes by cash, check, 
or money order, as described in Sec. 275.115, is not authorized for a 
taxpayer who is required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. 
For purposes of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is 
defined as the gross tax liability of all taxes which are paid in 
accordance with this subpart, taxable withdrawals from premises in the 
United States, and importations during the calendar year, without regard 
to any drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises from which such 
activities are conducted by the taxpayer. Overpayments are not taken 
into account in summarizing the gross tax liability.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a 
controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and 
implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except 
that the words ``at least 80 percent'' shall be replaced by the words 
``more than 50 percent'' in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 
26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the 
rules for a ``controlled group of corporations'' apply in a similar 
fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole 
proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a 
group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or 
sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one 
taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make 
remittances by EFT.
    (3) A taxpayer who is required by this section to make remittances 
by EFT, shall make a separate EFT remittance and file a separate tax 
return for each factory which tobacco products, or cigarette papers, or 
cigarette tubes are withdrawn upon determination of tax.
    (b) Requirements. (1) On or before January 10 of each calendar year, 
except for a taxpayer already remitting the tax by EFT, each taxpayer 
who was liable for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million 
dollars in taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette 
tubes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and part 40 of 
this chapter during the previous calender year, shall notify, in 
writing, the regional director (compliance), for each region in which 
taxes are paid. The notice shall be an agreement to make remittances by 
EFT.
    (2) For each return filed in accordance with this part, the taxpayer 
shall direct the taxpayer's bank to make an electronic fund transfer in 
the amount of the taxpayment to the Treasury Account as provided in 
paragraph (e) of this section. The request shall be made to the bank 
early enough for the transfer to be made to the Treasury Account by no 
later than the close of business on the last day for filing the return, 
prescribed in Sec. 275.105 or Sec. 275.114. The request shall take 
into account any time limit established by the bank.
    (3) If a taxpayer was liable for less than five million dollars in 
taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes during 
the preceding calendar year, the taxpayer may choose either to continue 
remitting the tax as provided in this section or to remit the tax with 
the return as prescribed by Sec. 275.115. On the first return on which 
the taxpayer chooses to discontinue remitting the tax by EFT and to 
begin remitting the tax with the tax return, the taxpayer shall notify 
the regional director (compliance) by attaching a written notification 
to the tax return, stating that no taxes are due by EFT, because the tax 
liability during the preceding calendar year was less than five million 
dollars, and that the remittance shall be filed with the tax return.
    (c) Remittance. (1) Each taxpayer shall show on the tax return, 
information about remitting the tax for that return by EFT and shall 
file the return with the Chief, Puerto Rico Operations.

[[Page 27]]

    (2) Remittances shall be considered as made when the taxpayment by 
electronic fund transfer is received by the Treasury Account. For 
purposes of this section, a taxpayment by electronic fund transfer shall 
be considered as received by the Treasury Account when it is paid to a 
Federal Reserve Bank.
    (3) When the taxpayer directs the bank to effect an electronic fund 
transfer message as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any 
transfer data record furnished to the taxpayer, through normal banking 
procedures, will serve as the record of payment, and shall be retained 
as part of required records.
    (d) Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT. The taxpayer is subject to 
a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5761, 6651, or 6656, as applicable, for 
failure to make a taxpayment by EFT on or before the close of business 
on the prescribed last day for filing.
    (e) Procedure. Upon the notification required under paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, the appropriate ATF officer will issue to the taxpayer 
an ATF Procedure entitled, Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund Transfer. 
This publication outlines the procedure a taxpayer is to follow when 
preparing returns and EFT remittances in accordance with this part.

in this paragraph, the total amount of the bond or bonds for tobacco 
products or cigarette papers or tubes under the provisions of this 
subpart must be in an amount not less than the amount of unpaid tax 
chargeable at any one time against the bond. A manufacturer who will 
defer payment of tax for a shipment of tobacco products or cigarette

is less than the maximum amount prescribed in paragraph (a) of this 
section, a bonded manufacturer must maintain an account reflecting all 
outstanding taxes with which the manufacturer's bond is chargeable. A 
manufacturer must debit such account with the amount of tax that was 
agreed to be paid under Sec. 275.111 or is otherwise chargeable against 
such bond and then must credit the account for the amount paid on Form 
5000.25 or other ATF-prescribed document, at the time it is filed.

Sec. 275.181  Records of large cigars.

    Every person who imports large cigars for sale within the United 
States must keep such records as are necessary to establish and verify 
the sale price that applies to large cigars removed (entered or 
withdrawn).
    (a) Basic record. The importer must keep a record to show each sale 
price (as determined under Sec. 275.39), which is applicable to large 
cigars removed. No later than the tenth business day in January of each 
year the importer must prepare such a record to show the sale price in 
effect on the first day of that year for each brand and size of large 
cigars. The importer must note any change in a price from that shown in 
the record within ten business days after such change in price. The 
record must be a continuing one for each brand and size of cigar (and 
type of packaging, if pertinent), so that the taxable price on any date 
may be readily ascertained. If an importer removes new types of large 
cigars after the beginning of the year, the importer must enter the sale 
price and its effective date for such large cigars in the basic record 
within ten business days after such removal.
    (b) Copies of price announcements. The importer must keep a copy of 
each general announcement that is issued internally or to the trade 
about establishment or change of large cigar sale prices. If the copy 
does not show the actual date when issued it must be annotated to show 
this information.
    (c) Copies of entry and withdrawal forms. The importer must keep a 
copy of each customs entry or withdrawal form on which internal revenue 
tax for large cigars is declared pursuant to Sec. 275.81.
    (d) Alternative record. If an importer has so few import 
transactions and/or brands and sizes of large cigars that retention of 
an appropriate copy of each entry and withdrawal form required under 
paragraph (c) of this section will provide an adequate record of sale 
prices, then the record required under paragraph (a) of this section 
need not be kept. In such case the entry and withdrawal forms must 
identify the brands and sizes of cigars covered and show the 
corresponding quantity and sale price for each. If such information was 
not originally entered on the form it may be included by annotation. 
Whenever the appropriate ATF officer finds that alternative records 
being kept pursuant to this paragraph are inadequate for the intended 
purpose, he or she may so notify the importer in writing, after which 
time the importer must keep the record required under paragraph (a) of 
this section.

incumbents of which are authorized to sign documents or otherwise act in 
behalf of the corporation in matters relating to 26 U.S.C. chapter 52, 
and regulations issued thereunder. The corporation must also furnish 
evidence, in duplicate, of the identity of the officers and directors 
and each person who holds more than ten percent of the stock of such 
corporation. Where any of the information required by this section has 
previously been filed with the appropriate ATF officer, and such

    If the application for permit or any report, return, notice, 
schedule, or other document required to be executed is to be signed by 
an individual (including one of the partners for a partnership or one of 
the members of an association) as an attorney in fact for any person, or 
if an individual is to otherwise officially represent such person, power 
of attorney on Form 1534 must be furnished to the appropriate ATF 
officer. (For power of attorney in connection with conference and 
practice requirements see subpart E, part 70 of this chapter.) Such 
power of attorney is not required for persons whose authority is 
furnished with the corporate documents as required by Sec. 275.194. 
Form 1534 does not have to be filed again with the appropriate ATF 
officer if such form has previously been submitted to ATF and is still 
in effect.


<R05>
Sec. 275.197  Additional information.

    The appropriate ATF officer may require such additional information 
as may be deemed necessary to determine whether the applicant is 
entitled to a permit under the provisions of this part. The applicant 
must, when required by the appropriate ATF officer, furnish as a part of 
his application for such permit such additional information as the 
appropriate ATF officer deems necessary to determine whether the 
applicant is entitled to a permit.


<R05>
Sec. 275.198  Investigation of applicant.

    Appropriate ATF officers may inquire or investigate to verify the 
information in connection with an application for a permit. The 
investigation will ascertain whether the applicant is, by reason of his 
business experience, financial standing, and trade connections, likely 
to maintain operations in compliance with 26 U.S.C. chapter 52, and 
regulations thereunder; whether the applicant has disclosed all material 
information required, or whether the applicant has made any material 
false statement in the application for such permit.


<R05>
Sec. 275.199  Notice of contemplated disapproval.

    If the appropriate ATF officer has reason to believe that the 
applicant is not entitled to a permit, the appropriate ATF officer will 
promptly give to the applicant a notice of the contemplated disapproval 
of the application and opportunity for hearing thereon in accordance 
with part 71 of this chapter. If, after such notice and opportunity for 
hearing, the appropriate ATF officer finds that the applicant is not 
entitled to a permit, an order will be prepared stating the findings on 
which the permit request is denied.

66 FR 42734, Aug. 15, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 275.200  Issuance of permit.

    If the application for permit, together with the required supporting 
documents, is approved, the appropriate ATF officer will issue a permit 
on ATF F 5200.24 to the applicant as an importer of tobacco products.


<R05>
Sec. 275.201  Duration of permit.

    (a) Permits other than temporary permits issued under paragraph (b) 
of this section will be valid for a period of three years from the 
effective date shown on the permit, ATF F 5200.24.
    (b) Temporary permits will be issued for a one-year period to those 
applicants described in Sec. 275.192.


<R05>
Sec. 275.202  Renewal of permit.

    Importers wishing to continue operations beyond the expiration of 
their current permit must renew their permit by making application 
within 30 days of such expiration on ATF F 5200.24, in accordance with 
instructions for the form. The expiring permit will continue in effect 
until final action is taken by ATF on the application for renewal, 
provided a timely application for renewal is filed.


<R05>
Sec. 275.203  Retention of permit and supporting documents.

    The importer must retain the permit, together with the copy of the 
application and supporting documents returned with the permit, at the 
same place where the records required by

[[Page 37]]

this part are kept. The permit and supporting documents must be made 
available for inspection by any appropriate ATF officer upon request.

                      Required Records and Reports


<R05>
Sec. 275.204  General.

    Every tobacco products importer must keep such records and, when 
required by this part, submit such reports, of the physical receipt and 
disposition of tobacco products. Records and reports will not be 
required under this part with respect to tobacco products while in 
customs custody.


<R05>
Sec. 275.205  Recordkeeping requirements.

    Any owner, importer, consignee, or their agent who imports, or 
knowingly causes to be imported, any tobacco product or cigarette papers 
or tubes must make and keep records. A person purchasing a tobacco 
product from the importer in a domestic transaction and who does not 
knowingly cause merchandise to be imported is not required to make and 
keep records unless:
    (a) The terms and conditions of the importation are controlled by 
the person placing the order with the importer (e.g., the importer is 
not an independent contractor but the agent of the person placing the 
order).
    (b) The tobacco products purchased from the importer include more 
than 60,000 cigarettes, in which case the importer and the person 
placing the order with the importer must keep the records required by 27 
CFR Part 46, Subpart F, Distribution of Cigarettes. Dividing a single 
shipment of more than 60,000 cigarettes into smaller components of 
60,000 cigarettes or less does not exempt any person from the 
recordkeeping requirements of this subpart.

[T.D. ATF-422, 64 FR 71951, Dec. 22, 1999, as amended by T.D. ATF-457, 
66 FR 32220, June 14, 2001]

               Filing and Retention of Records and Reports


<R05>
Sec. 275.206  Reports.

    (a) Importers must file a monthly report on ATF F 5220.6 in 
accordance with the format and instructions for the form.
    (b) The first report(s) must be submitted by the 15th day of the 
month following the month in which the permit is issued; all previous 
months beginning January 1, 2000, must also be reported at that time.

For example:

    An importer who is issued a permit with a date of August 17, 2000, 
would be required to submit by September 15, 2000, a total of eight 
reports for the months January-August, 2000.

    (c) Reports with the notation ``No Activity'' must be made for those 
months in which no activity occurs.
    (d) When a transfer of ownership of the business of an importer of 
tobacco products described in Sec. 275.224, or when a change in control 
of a corporation described in Sec. 275.226 occurs, a concluding report 
with the notation ``Concluding Report'' must be made for the month or 
partial month during which the transfer of ownership or change in 
control becomes effective.


<R05>
Sec. 275.207  Filing.

    All records and reports required by this part will be maintained 
separately, chronologically by transaction or reporting date, at the 
importer's place of business. The appropriate ATF officer may, pursuant 
to an application, authorize files, or an individual file, to be 
maintained at another business location under the control of the 
importer, if the alternative location does not cause undue inconvenience 
to ATF or Customs officers desiring to examine the files or delay in the 
timely transmittal of any documents required to be submitted.


<R05>
Sec. 275.208  Retention.

    (a) All records and reports required by this part, documents or 
copies of documents supporting these records or reports, and file copies 
of reports required by this part to be submitted to ATF must be retained 
for not less than three years following the close of the calendar year 
in which filed or made, and during this period must be available for 
inspection and copying by ATF during business hours.
    (b) Furthermore, the appropriate ATF officer may require these 
records to be kept for an additional period of not more than three years 
in any case

[[Page 38]]

where it is determined that such record retention is necessary to 
protect the revenue. Any records, or copies thereof, containing any of 
the information required by this part to be prepared, wherever kept, 
must also be made available for inspection and copying.

<R05>
Sec. 275.223  Fiduciary successor.

    If an administrator, executor, receiver, trustee, assignee, or other

application for permit, before commencing operations as required by 
subpart K of this part, furnish certified copies, in duplicate, of the 
order of the court, or other pertinent documents, showing his

promptly files with the appropriate ATF officer a written statement to 
that effect.


<R05>
Sec. 275.224  Transfer of ownership.

    If a transfer is to be made in ownership of the business of an

which results in a person acquiring ownership or control of more than 
ten percent in aggregate of the outstanding stock of such corporation, 
the importer must, within 30 days of such action, so notify the 
appropriate ATF officer in writing, giving the identity of such person. 
In the event that the acquisition of ten or

[[Page 39]]

more percent in aggregate of the outstanding stock of such corporation 
results in a change of control of such corporation, the provisions of 
Sec. 275.226 will apply. When there is any change in the authority 
furnished under Sec. 275.196 for officers to act on behalf of the 
corporation the importer must immediately so notify the appropriate ATF 
officer in writing.


<R05>
Sec. 275.226  Change in control of a corporation.

the importer will dispose of all tobacco products on hand, in accordance 
with this part, make a concluding report, in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 275.206, and surrender his permit with such report.

and obtain, an amended permit.


<R05>
Sec. 275. 228  Change in address.

    (d) For provisions requiring the registration of persons engaged in 
the business of brokering activities with respect to the importation of

For articles in Categories I and III imported by a registered importer, 
the importer will also submit to Customs a copy of the export license

<R05>
Sec. 447.51  Import certification and delivery verification.

    Pursuant to agreement with the United States, certain foreign 
countries are entitled to request certification of legality of 
importation of articles on the U.S. Munitions Import List. Upon request 
of a foreign government, the appropriate ATF officer will certify the 
importation, on Form ITA-645P/ATF-4522/DSP53, for the U.S. importer. 
Normally, the U.S. importer will submit this form at the time he applies 
for an import permit. This document will serve as evidence to the 
government of the exporting company that the U.S. importer has complied 
with import regulations of the U.S. Government and is prohibited from 
diverting, transshipping, or reexporting the material described therein 
without the approval of the U.S. Government. Foreign governments may 
also require documentation attesting to the delivery of the material 
into the United States. When such delivery certification is requested by 
a foreign government, the U.S. importer may obtain directly from the 
U.S. District Director of Customs the authenticated Delivery 
Verification Certificate (U.S. Department of Commerce Form ITA-647P) for 
this purpose.

Sec. 447.52  Import restrictions applicable to certain countries.

    (a) It is the policy of the United States to deny licenses and other

originating in certain countries or areas. This policy applies to Cuba, 
Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mongolia, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, Vietnam, and 
some of the states that comprised the former Soviet Union (Armenia,

Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), Haiti, Liberia, 
Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, UNITA (Angola), and Zaire). It also applies when 
an import would not be in furtherance of world peace and the security 
and foreign policy of the United States.

    Note: Changes in foreign policy may result in additions to and 
deletions from the above list of countries. The ATF will publish changes 
to this list in the Federal Register. Contact the Firearms and 
Explosives Imports Branch at (202) 927-8320 for current information.

    (1) The articles were manufactured in a proscribed country or area 
prior to the date, as established by the Department of State, the 
country or area became proscribed, or, were manufactured in a non-
proscribed country or area; and
    (2) The articles have been stored for the five year period 
immediately prior to importation in a non-proscribed country or area.

[[Page 54]]

    (f) Applicants desiring to import articles claimed to meet the 
criteria specified in paragraph (e) of this section shall explain, and 
certify to, how the firearms meet the criteria. The certification 
statement will be prepared in letter form, executed under the penalties 
of perjury, and should be submitted with the application for an import 
permit. The certification statement must be accompanied by documentary 
information on the country or area of original manufacture and on the 
country or area of storage for the five year period immediately prior to 
importation. Such information may, for example, include a verifiable 
statement in the English language of a government official or any other 
person having knowledge of the date and place of manufacture and/or the 
place of storage; a warehouse receipt or other document which provides 
the required history of storage; and any other document that the 
applicant believes substantiates the place and date of manufacture and 
the place of storage. The appropriate ATF officer, however, reserves the 
right to determine whether documentation is acceptable. Applicants 
shall, when required by the appropriate ATF officer, furnish additional 
documentation as may be necessary to determine whether an import permit 
application should be approved.

    State of residence. The State in which an individual resides. An 
individual resides in a State if he or she is present in a State with 
the intention of making a home in that State. If an individual is on 
active duty as a member of the Armed Forces, the individual's State of 
residence is the State in which his or her permanent duty station is 
located. An alien who is legally in the United States shall be 
considered to be a resident of a State only if the alien is residing in 
the State and has resided in the State for a period of at least 90 days 
prior to the date of sale or delivery of a firearm. The following are 
examples that illustrate this definition:


[[Page 66]]


    Example 1. A maintains a home in State X. A travels to State Y on a 
hunting, fishing, business, or other type of trip. A does not become a 
resident of State Y by reason of such trip.
    Example 2. A is a U.S. citizen and maintains a home in State X and a 
home in State Y. A resides in State X except for weekends or the summer 
months of the year and in State Y for the weekends or the summer months 
of the year. During the time that A actually resides in State X, A is a 
resident of State X, and during the time that A actually resides in 
State Y, A is a resident of State Y.
    Example 3. A, an alien, travels on vacation or on a business trip to 
State X. Regardless of the length of time A spends in State X, A does 
not have a State of residence in State X. This is because A does not 
have a home in State X at which he has resided for at least 90 days.

    Unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance. A person 
who uses a controlled substance and has lost the power of self-control 
with reference to the use of controlled substance; and any person who is 
a current user of a controlled substance in a manner other than as 
prescribed by a licensed physician. Such use is not limited to the use 
of drugs on a particular day, or within a matter of days or weeks 
before, but rather that the unlawful use has occurred recently enough to 
indicate that the individual is actively engaged in such conduct. A 
person may be an unlawful current user of a controlled substance even 
though the substance is not being used at the precise time the person 
seeks to acquire a firearm or receives or possesses a firearm. An 
inference of current use may be drawn from evidence of a recent use or 
possession of a controlled substance or a pattern of use or possession 
that reasonably covers the present time, e.g., a conviction for use or 
possession of a controlled substance within the past year; multiple 
arrests for such offenses within the past 5 years if the most recent 
arrest occurred within the past year; or persons found through a drug 
test to use a controlled substance unlawfully, provided that the test 
was administered within the past year. For a current or former member of 
the Armed Forces, an inference of current use may be drawn from recent 
disciplinary or other administrative action based on confirmed drug use, 
e.g., court-martial conviction, nonjudicial punishment, or an 
administrative discharge based on drug use or drug rehabilitation 
failure.
    Unserviceable firearm. A firearm which is incapable of discharging a 
shot by means of an explosive and is incapable of being readily restored 
to a firing condition.
    U.S.C. The United States Code.

Sec. 478.22  Alternate methods or procedures; emergency variations 
from requirements.

    (a) Alternate methods or procedures. The licensee, on specific 
approval by the Director as provided in this paragraph, may use an 
alternate method or procedure in lieu of a method or procedure 
specifically prescribed in this part. The Director may approve an 
alternate method or procedure, subject to stated conditions, when it is 
found that:
    (1) Good cause is shown for the use of the alternate method or 
procedure;

[[Page 67]]

    (2) The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and 
consistent with the effect intended by, the specifically prescribed 
method or procedure and that the alternate method or procedure is 
substantially equivalent to that specifically prescribed method or 
procedure; and
    (3) The alternate method or procedure will not be contrary to any 
provision of law and will not result in an increase in cost to the 
Government or hinder the effective administration of this part. Where 
the licensee desires to employ an alternate method or procedure, a 
written application shall be submitted to the appropriate Director of 
Industry Operations, for transmittal to the Director. The application 
shall specifically describe the proposed alternate method or procedure 
and shall set forth the reasons for it. Alternate methods or procedures 
may not be employed until the application is approved by the Director. 
The licensee shall, during the period of authorization of an alternate 
method or procedure, comply with the terms of the approved application. 
Authorization of any alternate method or procedure may be withdrawn 
whenever, in the judgment of the Director, the effective administration 
of this part is hindered by the continuation of the authorization.
    (b) Emergency variations from requirements. The Director may approve 
a method of operation other than as specified in this part, where it is 
found that an emergency exists and the proposed variation from the 
specified requirements are necessary and the proposed variations (1) 
will not hinder the effective administration of this part, and (2) will 
not be contrary to any provisions of law. Variations from requirements 
granted under this paragraph are conditioned on compliance with the 
procedures, conditions, and limitations set forth in the approval of the 
application. Failure to comply in good faith with the procedures, 
conditions, and limitations shall automatically terminate the authority 
for the variations, and the licensee shall fully comply with the 
prescribed requirements of regulations from which the variations were 
authorized. Authority for any variation may be withdrawn whenever, in 
the judgment of the Director, the effective administration of this part 
is hindered by the continuation of the variation. Where the licensee 
desires to employ an emergency variation, a written application shall be 
submitted to the appropriate Director of Industry Operations for 
transmittal to the Director. The application shall describe the proposed 
variation and set forth the reasons for it. Variations may not be 
employed until the application is approved.
    (c) Retention of approved variations. The licensee shall retain, as 
part of the licensee's records, available for examination by ATF 
officers, any application approved by the Director under this section.

<R05>
Sec. 478.41  General.

    (a) Each person intending to engage in business as an importer or 
manufacturer of firearms or ammunition, or a dealer in firearms shall, 
before commencing such business, obtain the license required by this 
subpart for the business to be operated. Each person who desires to 
obtain a license as a collector of curios or relics may obtain such a 
license under the provisions of this subpart.
    (b) Each person intending to engage in business as a firearms or 
ammunition importer or manufacturer, or dealer in firearms shall file an 
application, with the required fee (see Sec. 478.42), with ATF in 
accordance with the instructions on the form (see Sec. 478.44), and, 
pursuant to Sec. 478.47, receive the license required for such business 
from the Chief, National Licensing Center. Except as provided in Sec. 
478.50, a license must be obtained for each business and each place at 
which the applicant is to do business. A license as an importer or 
manufacturer of firearms or ammunition, or a dealer in firearms shall, 
subject to the provisions of the Act and other applicable provisions of 
law, entitle the licensee to transport, ship, and receive firearms and 
ammunition covered by such license in interstate or foreign commerce and 
to engage in the business specified by the license, at the location 
described on the license, and for the period stated on the license. 
However, it shall not be necessary for a licensed importer or a licensed 
manufacturer to also obtain a dealer's license in order to engage in 
business on the licensed premises as a dealer in the same type of 
firearms authorized by the license to be imported or manufactured. 
Payment of the license fee as an importer or manufacturer of destructive 
devices, ammunition for destructive devices or armor piercing ammunition 
or as a dealer in destructive devices includes the privilege of 
importing or manufacturing firearms other than destructive devices and 
ammunition for other than destructive devices or ammunition other than 
armor piercing ammunition, or dealing in firearms other than destructive 
devices, as the case may be, by such a licensee at the licensed 
premises.
    (c) Each person seeking the privileges of a collector licensed under 
this part shall file an application, with the required fee (see Sec. 
478.42), with ATF in accordance with the instructions on the form (see 
Sec. 478.44), and pursuant to Sec. 478.47, receive from the Chief, 
National Licensing Center, the license covering the collection of curios 
and relics. A separate license may be obtained for each collection 
premises, and such license shall, subject to the provisions of the Act 
and other applicable provisions of law, entitle the licensee to 
transport, ship, receive, and acquire curios and relics in interstate or 
foreign commerce, and to make disposition of curios and relics in 
interstate or foreign commerce, to any other person licensed under the 
provisions of this part, for the period stated on the license.
    (d) The collector license provided by this part shall apply only to 
transactions related to a collector's activity in acquiring, holding or 
disposing of

[[Page 78]]

curios and relics. A collector's license does not authorize the 
collector to engage in a business required to be licensed under the Act 
or this part. Therefore, if the acquisitions and dispositions of curios 
and relics by a collector bring the collector within the definition of a 
manufacturer, importer, or dealer under this part, he shall qualify as 
such. (See also Sec. 478.93 of this part.)

Sec. 478.73  Notice of revocation, suspension, or imposition of civil fine.

    (a) Basis for action. Whenever the Director of Industry Operations 
has reason to believe that a licensee has willfully violated any 
provision of the Act or this part, a notice of revocation of the 
license, ATF Form 4500, may be issued. In addition, a notice of 
revocation, suspension, or imposition of a civil fine may be issued on 
ATF Form 4500 whenever the Director of Industry Operations has reason to 
believe that a licensee has knowingly transferred a firearm to an 
unlicensed person and knowingly failed to comply with the requirements 
of 18 U.S.C. 922(t)(1) with respect to the transfer and, at the time 
that the transferee most recently proposed the transfer, the national 
instant criminal background check system was operating and information 
was available to the system demonstrating that the transferee's receipt 
of a firearm would violate 18 U.S.C. 922(g) or 922(n) or State law.
    (b) Issuance of notice. The notice shall set forth the matters of 
fact constituting the violations specified, dates, places, and the 
sections of law and regulations violated. The Director of Industry 
Operations shall afford the licensee 15 days from the date of receipt of 
the notice in which to request a hearing prior to suspension or 
revocation of the license, or imposition of a civil fine. If the 
licensee does not file a timely request for a hearing, the Director of 
Industry Operations shall issue a final notice of suspension or 
revocation and/or imposition of a civil fine on ATF Form 4501, as 
provided in Sec. 478.74.

Sec. 478.74  Request for hearing after notice of suspension, 
revocation, or imposition of civil fine.

    If a licensee desires a hearing after receipt of a notice of 
suspension or revocation of a license, or imposition of a civil fine, 
the licensee shall file a request, in duplicate, with the Director of 
Industry Operations within 15 days after receipt of the notice of 
suspension or revocation of a license, or imposition of a civil fine. On 
receipt of such request, the Director of Industry Operations shall, as 
expeditiously as possible, make necessary arrangements for the hearing 
and advise the licensee of the date, time, location and the name of the 
officer before whom the hearing will be held. Such notification shall be 
made no less than 10 days in advance of the date set for the hearing. On 
conclusion of the hearing and consideration of all the relevant 
presentations made by the licensee or the licensee's representative, the 
Director of Industry Operations shall render a decision and

[[Page 85]]

shall prepare a brief summary of the findings and conclusions on which 
the decision is based. If the decision is that the license should be 
revoked, or, in actions under 18 U.S.C. 922(t)(5), that the license 
should be revoked or suspended, and/or that a civil fine should be 
imposed, a certified copy of the summary shall be furnished to the 
licensee with the final notice of revocation, suspension, or imposition 
of a civil fine on ATF Form 4501. If the decision is that the license 
should not be revoked, or in actions under 18 U.S.C. 922(t)(5), that the 
license should not be revoked or suspended, and a civil fine should not 
be imposed, the licensee shall be notified in writing.

Sec. 478.78  Operations by licensee after notice.

    In any case where denial, suspension, or revocation proceedings are 
pending before the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, or notice of 
denial, suspension, or revocation has been served on the licensee and he 
has filed timely request for a hearing, the license in the possession of 
the licensee shall remain in effect even though such license has 
expired, or the suspension or revocation date specified in the notice of 
revocation on Form 4500 served on the licensee has passed: Provided, 
That with respect to a license that has expired, the licensee has timely 
filed an application for the renewal of his license. If a licensee is 
dissatisfied with a posthearing decision revoking or suspending the 
license or denying the application or imposing a civil fine, as the case 
may be, he may, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 923(f)(3), within 60 days after 
receipt of the final notice denying the application or revoking or 
suspending the license or imposing a civil fine, file a petition for 
judicial review of such action. Such petition should be filed with the 
U.S. district court for the district in which the applicant or licensee 
resides or has his principal place of business. In such case, when the 
Director of Industry Operations finds that justice so requires, he may 
postpone

[[Page 86]]

the effective date of suspension or revocation of a license or authorize 
continued operations under the expired license, as applicable, pending 
judicial review.

Sec. 478.91  Posting of license.

    Any license issued under this part shall be kept posted and kept 
available for inspection on the premises covered by the license.


<R05>
Sec. 478.92  How must licensed manufacturers and licensed importers 

identify firearms, armor piercing ammunition, and large capacity 
ammunition feeding devices?

    (a)(1) Firearms. You, as a licensed manufacturer or licensed 
importer of firearms, must legibly identify each firearm manufactured or 
imported as follows:
    (i) By engraving, casting, stamping (impressing), or otherwise 
conspicuously placing or causing to be engraved, cast, stamped 
(impressed) or placed on the frame or receiver thereof an individual 
serial number. The serial number must be placed in a manner not 
susceptible of being readily obliterated, altered, or removed, and must 
not duplicate any serial number placed by you on any other firearm. For 
firearms manufactured or imported on and after January 30, 2002, the 
engraving, casting, or stamping (impressing) of the serial number must 
be to a minimum depth of .003 inch and in a print size no smaller than 
\1/16\ inch; and
    (ii) By engraving, casting, stamping (impressing), or otherwise 
conspicuously placing or causing to be engraved, cast, stamped 
(impressed) or placed on the frame, receiver, or barrel thereof certain 
additional information. This information must be placed in a manner not 
susceptible of being readily obliterated, altered, or removed. For 
firearms manufactured or imported on and after January 30, 2002, the 
engraving, casting, or stamping (impressing) of this information must be 
to a minimum depth of .003 inch. The additional information includes:
    (A) The model, if such designation has been made;
    (B) The caliber or gauge;
    (C) Your name (or recognized abbreviation) and also, when 
applicable, the name of the foreign manufacturer;
    (D) In the case of a domestically made firearm, the city and State 
(or recognized abbreviation thereof) where you as the manufacturer 
maintain your place of business; and
    (E) In the case of an imported firearm, the name of the country in 
which it was manufactured and the city and State (or recognized 
abbreviation thereof) where you as the importer maintain your place of 
business. For additional requirements relating to imported firearms, see 
Customs regulations at 19 CFR part 134.
    (2) Firearm frames or receivers. A firearm frame or receiver that is 
not a component part of a complete weapon at the time it is sold, 
shipped, or otherwise disposed of by you must be identified as required 
by this section.
    (3) Special markings for semiautomatic assault weapons, effective 
July 5, 1995. In the case of any semiautomatic assault weapon 
manufactured after September 13, 1994, you must mark the frame or 
receiver ``RESTRICTED LAW ENFORCEMENT/GOVERNMENT USE ONLY'' or, in the 
case of weapons manufactured for export, ``FOR EXPORT ONLY,'' in a 
manner not susceptible of being readily obliterated, altered, or 
removed. For weapons manufactured or imported on and after January 30, 
2002, the engraving, casting, or stamping (impressing) of the special 
markings prescribed in this paragraph (a)(3) must be to a minimum depth 
of .003 inch.
    (4) Exceptions. (i) Alternate means of identification. The Director 
may authorize other means of identification upon receipt of a letter 
application from you, submitted in duplicate, showing that such other 
identification is reasonable and will not hinder the effective 
administration of this part.
    (ii) Destructive devices. In the case of a destructive device, the 
Director may authorize other means of identifying that weapon upon 
receipt of a letter application from you, submitted in duplicate, 
showing that engraving, casting, or stamping (impressing) such a weapon 
would be dangerous or impracticable.

[[Page 87]]

    (iii) Machine guns, silencers, and parts. Any part defined as a 
machine gun, firearm muffler, or firearm silencer in Sec. 478.11, that 
is not a component part of a complete weapon at the time it is sold, 
shipped, or otherwise disposed of by you, must be identified as required 
by this section. The Director may authorize other means of 
identification of parts defined as machine guns other than frames or 
receivers and parts defined as mufflers or silencers upon receipt of a 
letter application from you, submitted in duplicate, showing that such 
other identification is reasonable and will not hinder the effective 
administration of this part.
    (5) Measurement of height and depth of markings. The depth of all 
markings required by this section will be measured from the flat surface 
of the metal and not the peaks or ridges. The height of serial numbers 
required by paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section will be measured as the 
distance between the latitudinal ends of the character impression 
bottoms (bases).
    (b) Armor piercing ammunition--(1) Marking of ammunition. Each 
licensed manufacturer or licensed importer of armor piercing ammunition 
shall identify such ammunition by means of painting, staining or dying 
the exterior of the projectile with an opaque black coloring. This 
coloring must completely cover the point of the projectile and at least 
50 percent of that portion of the projectile which is visible when the 
projectile is loaded into a cartridge case.
    (2) Labeling of packages. Each licensed manufacturer or licensed 
importer of armor piercing ammunition shall clearly and conspicuously 
label each package in which armor piercing ammunition is contained, 
e.g., each box, carton, case, or other container. The label shall 
include the words ``ARMOR PIERCING'' in block letters at least \1/4\ 
inch in height. The lettering shall be located on the exterior surface 
of the package which contains information concerning the caliber or 
gauge of the ammunition. There shall also be placed on the same surface 
of the package in block lettering at least \1/8\ inch in height the 
words ``FOR GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES OR EXPORTATION ONLY.'' The statements 
required by this subparagraph shall be on a contrasting background.
    (c) Large capacity ammunition feeding devices manufactured after 
September 13, 1994. (1) Each person who manufactures or imports any 
large capacity ammunition feeding device manufactured after September 
13, 1994, shall legibly identify each such device with a serial number. 
Such person may use the same serial number for all large capacity 
ammunition feeding devices produced.
    (i) Additionally, in the case of a domestically made large capacity 
ammunition feeding device, such device shall be marked with the name, 
city and State (or recognized abbreviation thereof) of the manufacturer;
    (ii) And in the case of an imported large capacity ammunition 
feeding device, such device shall be marked:
    (A) With the name of the manufacturer, country of origin, and,
    (B) Effective July 5, 1995, the name, city and State (or recognized 
abbreviation thereof) of the importer.
    (iii) Further, large capacity ammunition feeding devices 
manufactured after September 13, 1994, shall be marked ``RESTRICTED LAW 
ENFORCEMENT/GOVERNMENT USE ONLY'' or, in the case of devices 
manufactured or imported for export, effective July 5, 1995, ``FOR 
EXPORT ONLY.''
    (2) All markings required by this paragraph (c) shall be cast, 
stamped, or engraved on the exterior of the device. In the case of a 
magazine, the markings shall be placed on the magazine body.
    (3) Exceptions--(i) Metallic links. Persons who manufacture or 
import metallic links for use in the assembly of belted ammunition are 
only required to place the identification marks prescribed in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section on the containers used for the packaging of the 
links.
    (ii) Alternate means of identification. The Director may authorize 
other means of identifying large capacity ammunition feeding devices 
upon receipt of a letter application, in duplicate, from the 
manufacturer or importer showing that such other identification is 
reasonable and will not

[[Page 88]]

hinder the effective administration of this part.

Sec. 478.93  Authorized operations by a licensed collector.

    The license issued to a collector of curios or relics under the 
provisions of this part shall cover only transactions by the licensed 
collector in curios and relics. The collector's license is of no force 
or effect and a licensed collector is of the same status under the Act

disposition of firearms other than curios or relics, or any 
transportation, shipment, or receipt of firearms other than curios or 
relics in interstate or foreign commerce, and (b) any transaction with a 
nonlicensee involving any firearm other than a curio or relic. (See also 
Sec. 478.50.) A collectors license is not necessary to receive or 
dispose of ammunition, and a licensed collector is not precluded by law 
from receiving or disposing of armor piercing ammunition. However, a 
licensed collector may not dispose of any ammunition to a person 
prohibited from receiving or possessing ammunition (see Sec. 
478.99(c)). Any licensed collector who disposes of armor piercing 
ammunition must record the disposition as required by Sec. 478.125 (a) 
and (b).

shall verify the identity and licensed status of the transferee prior to 
making the transaction. Verification shall be established by the 
transferee furnishing to the transferor a certified copy of the 
transferee's license and by such other means as the transferor deems 
necessary: Provided, That it shall not be required (a) for a transferee 
who has furnished a certified copy of its license to a transferor to 
again furnish such certified copy to that transferor during the term of 
the transferee's current license, (b) for a licensee to furnish a 
certified copy of its license to another licensee if a firearm is being 
returned either directly or through another licensee to such licensee 
and (c) for licensees of multilicensed business organizations to furnish 
certified copies of their licenses to other licensed locations operated 
by such organization: Provided further, That a multilicensed business 
organization may furnish to a transferor, in lieu of a certified copy of 
each license, a list, certified to be true, correct and complete, 
containing the name, address, license number, and the date of license 
expiration of each licensed location operated by such organization, and 
the transferor may sell or otherwise dispose of firearms as provided by 
this section to any licensee appearing on such list without requiring a 
certified copy of a license therefrom. A transferor licensee who has the 
certified information required by this section may sell or dispose of 
firearms to a licensee for not more than 45 days following the 
expiration date of the transferee's license.

desires an additional copy of the license for certification (instead of 
making a reproduction of the original license), the licensee may submit 
a request, in writing, for a certified copy or copies of the license to 
the Chief, National Licensing Center. The request must set forth the

record, Form 4473, required by Sec. 478.424. The nonlicensee shall 
attach to such record a true copy of any permit or other information 
required pursuant to any statute of the State and published ordinance 
applicable to the locality in which he resides. The licensee shall prior 
to shipment or delivery of the firearm, forward by registered or 
certified mail (return receipt requested) a copy of the record, Form 
4473, to the chief law enforcement officer named on such record, and 
delay shipment or delivery of the firearm for a period of at least 7 
days following receipt by the licensee of the return receipt evidencing 
delivery of the copy of the record to such chief law enforcement 
officer, or the return of the copy of the record to him due to the 
refusal of such chief law enforcement officer to accept same in 
accordance with U.S. Postal Service regulations. The original Form 4473, 
and evidence of receipt or rejection of delivery of the copy of the Form 
4473 sent to the chief law enforcement officer shall be retained by the 
licensee as a part of the records required of him to be kept under the 
provisions of subpart H of this part.

dealer may sell or deliver a rifle or shotgun, and a licensed collector 
may sell or deliver a rifle or shotgun that is a curio or relic to a 
nonlicensed resident of a State other than the State in which the 
licensee's place of business is located if--
    (i) The purchaser meets with the licensee in person at the

manufacturer, or licensed dealer the firearms transaction record, Form 
4473, required by Sec. 478.124; and
    (iv) The sale, delivery, and receipt of the rifle or shotgun fully 
comply with the legal conditions of sale in both such States.
    (2) For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, any licensed 
manufacturer, licensed importer, or licensed dealer is presumed, in the

the licensee knows or has reasonable cause to believe does not reside in 
(or if a corporation or other business entity, does not maintain a place 
of business in) the State in which the licensee's place of business or 
activity is located: Provided, That the foregoing provisions of this 
paragraph (1) shall not apply to the sale or delivery of a rifle or 
shotgun (curio or relic, in the case of a licensed collector) to a 
resident of a State other than the State in which the licensee's place 
of business or collection premises is located if the requirements of 
Sec. 478.96(c) are fully met, and (2) shall not apply to the loan or

cause to believe is less than 18 years of age, and, if the firearm, or 
ammunition, is other than a shotgun or rifle, or ammunition for a 
shotgun or rifle, to any individual who the importer, manufacturer, 
dealer, or collector knows or has reasonable cause to believe is less 
than 21 years of age, or (2) any firearm to any person in any State 
where the purchase or possession by such person of such firearm would be 
in violation of any State law or any published ordinance applicable at 
the place of sale, delivery, or other disposition, unless the importer, 
manufacturer, dealer, or collector knows or has reasonable cause to

Sec. 478.100  Conduct of business away from licensed premises.

    (a)(1) A licensee may conduct business temporarily at a gun show or 
event as defined in paragraph (b) if the gun show or event is located in 
the same State specified on the license: Provided, That such business 
shall not be conducted from any motorized or towed vehicle. The premises 
of the gun show or event at which the licensee conducts business shall 
be considered part of the licensed premises. Accordingly, no separate 
fee or license is required for the gun show or event locations. However, 
licensees shall comply with the provisions of Sec. 478.91 relating to 
posting of licenses (or a copy thereof) while conducting business at the 
gun show or event.
    (2) A licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer may engage in the 
business of dealing in curio or relic firearms with another licensee at 
any location.
    (b) A gun show or an event is a function sponsored by any national, 
State, or local organization, devoted to the collection, competitive 
use, or other sporting use of firearms, or an organization or 
association that sponsors functions devoted to the collection,

<R05>
Sec. 478.102  Sales or deliveries of firearms on and after November 30, 1998.

    (a) Background check. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer 
(the licensee) shall not sell, deliver, or transfer a firearm to any 
other person who is not licensed under this part unless the licensee 
meets the following requirements:
    (1) Before the completion of the transfer, the licensee has 
contacted NICS;
    (2)(i) NICS informs the licensee that it has no information that 
receipt of the firearm by the transferee would be in violation of 
Federal or State law and provides the licensee with a unique 
identification number; or
    (ii) Three business days (meaning days on which State offices are 
open) have elapsed from the date the licensee contacted NICS and NICS 
has not notified the licensee that receipt of the firearm by the 
transferee would be in violation of law; and
    (3) The licensee verifies the identity of the transferee by 
examining the identification document presented in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 478.124(c).

    Example for paragraph (a). A licensee contacts NICS on Thursday, and 
gets a ``delayed'' response. The licensee does not get a further 
response from NICS. If State offices are not open on Saturday and 
Sunday, 3 business days would have elapsed on the following Tuesday. The 
licensee may transfer the firearm on the next day, Wednesday.

    (b) Transaction number. In any transaction for which a licensee 
receives a transaction number from NICS (which shall include either a 
NICS transaction number or, in States where the State is recognized as a 
point of contact for NICS checks, a State transaction number), such 
number shall be recorded on a firearms transaction record, Form 4473, 
which shall be retained in the

[[Page 93]]

records of the licensee in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 
478.129. This applies regardless of whether the transaction is approved 
or denied by NICS, and regardless of whether the firearm is actually 
transferred.
    (c) Time limitation on NICS checks. A NICS check conducted in 
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section may be relied upon by the 
licensee only for use in a single transaction, and for a period not to 
exceed 30 calendar days from the date that NICS was initially contacted. 
If the transaction is not completed within the 30-day period, the 
licensee shall initiate a new NICS check prior to completion of the 
transfer.

    Example 1 for paragraph (c). A purchaser completes the Form 4473 on 
December 15, 1998, and a NICS check is initiated by the licensee on that 
date. The licensee is informed by NICS that the information available to 
the system does not indicate that receipt of the firearm by the 
transferee would be in violation of law, and a unique identification 
number is provided. However, the State imposes a 7-day waiting period on 
all firearms transactions, and the purchaser does not return to pick up 
the firearm until January 22, 1999. The licensee must conduct another 
NICS check before transferring the firearm to the purchaser.
    Example 2 for paragraph (c). A purchaser completes the Form 4473 on 
January 25, 1999, and arranges for the purchase of a single firearm. A 
NICS check is initiated by the licensee on that date. The licensee is 
informed by NICS that the information available to the system does not 
indicate that receipt of the firearm by the transferee would be in 
violation of law, and a unique identification number is provided. The 
State imposes a 7-day waiting period on all firearms transactions, and 
the purchaser returns to pick up the firearm on February 15, 1999. 
Before the licensee executes the Form 4473, and the firearm is 
transferred, the purchaser decides to purchase an additional firearm. 
The transfer of these two firearms is considered a single transaction; 
accordingly, the licensee may add the second firearm to the Form 4473, 
and transfer that firearm without conducting another NICS check.
    Example 3 for paragraph (c). A purchaser completes a Form 4473 on 
February 15, 1999. The licensee receives a unique identification number 
from NICS on that date, the Form 4473 is executed by the licensee, and 
the firearm is transferred. On February 20, 1999, the purchaser returns 
to the licensee's premises and wishes to purchase a second firearm. The 
purchase of the second firearm is a separate transaction; thus, a new 
NICS check must be initiated by the licensee.

    (d) Exceptions to NICS check. The provisions of paragraph (a) of 
this section shall not apply if--
    (1) The transferee has presented to the licensee a valid permit or 
license that--
    (i) Allows the transferee to possess, acquire, or carry a firearm;
    (ii) Was issued not more than 5 years earlier by the State in which 
the transfer is to take place; and
    (iii) The law of the State provides that such a permit or license is 
to be issued only after an authorized government official has verified 
that the information available to such official does not indicate that 
possession of a firearm by the transferee would be in violation of 
Federal, State, or local law: Provided, That on and after November 30, 
1998, the information available to such official includes the NICS;
    (2) The firearm is subject to the provisions of the National 
Firearms Act and has been approved for transfer under 27 CFR part 479; 
or
    (3) On application of the licensee, in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 478.150, the Director has certified that compliance 
with paragraph (a)(1) of this section is impracticable.
    (e) The document referred to in paragraph (d)(1) of this section (or 
a copy thereof) shall be retained or the required information from the 
document shall be recorded on the firearms transaction record in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 478.131.

invited guest.
    (4) A handgun or ammunition, the possession of which is transferred 
to a juvenile in circumstances in which the transferor is not in 
violation of this subsection shall not be subject to permanent 
confiscation by the Government if its possession by the juvenile 
subsequently becomes unlawful because of the conduct of the juvenile, 
but shall be returned to the lawful owner when such handgun or 
ammunition is no longer required by the Government for the purposes of 
investigation or prosecution.
    (5) For purposes of this subsection, the term ``juvenile'' means a

<R05>
Sec. 478.124  Firearms transaction record.

    (a) A licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer 
shall not sell or otherwise dispose, temporarily or permanently, of any 
firearm to any person, other than another licensee, unless the licensee 
records the transaction on a firearms transaction record, Form 4473: 
Provided, That a firearms transaction record, Form 4473, shall not be 
required to record the disposition made of a firearm delivered to a 
licensee for the sole purpose of repair or customizing when such firearm 
or a replacement firearm is returned to the person from whom received.
    (b) A licensed manufacturer, licensed importer, or licensed dealer 
shall retain in alphabetical (by name of purchaser), chronological (by 
date of disposition), or numerical (by transaction serial number) order, 
and as a part of the required records, each Form 4473 obtained in the 
course of transferring custody of the firearms.
    (c)(1) Prior to making an over-the-counter transfer of a firearm to 
a nonlicensee who is a resident of the State in which the licensee's 
business premises is located, the licensed importer, licensed 
manufacturer, or licensed dealer so transferring the firearm shall 
obtain a Form 4473 from the transferee showing the transferee's name, 
sex, residence address (including county or similar political 
subdivision), date and place of birth; height, weight and race of the 
transferee; the transferee's country of citizenship; the transferee's 
INS-issued alien number or admission number; the transferee's State of 
residence; and certification by the transferee that the transferee is 
not prohibited by the Act from transporting or shipping a firearm in 
interstate or foreign commerce or receiving a firearm which has been 
shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce or possessing a 
firearm in or affecting commerce.
    (2) In order to facilitate the transfer of a firearm and enable NICS 
to verify the identity of the person acquiring the firearm, ATF Form 
4473 also requests certain optional information. This information 
includes the transferee's social security number. Such information may 
help avoid the possibility of the transferee being misidentified as a 
felon or other prohibited person.
    (3) After the transferee has executed the Form 4473, the licensee:
    (i) Shall verify the identity of the transferee by examining the 
identification document (as defined in Sec. 478.11) presented, and 
shall note on the Form 4473 the type of identification used;
    (ii) Shall, in the case of a transferee who is an alien legally in 
the United States, cause the transferee to present documentation 
establishing that the transferee is a resident of the State (as defined 
in Sec. 478.11) in which the licensee's business premises is located, 
and shall note on the form the documentation used. Examples of 
acceptable documentation include utility bills or a lease agreement 
which show that the transferee has resided in the State continuously for 
at least 90 days prior to the transfer of the firearm; and
    (iii) Must, in the case of a transferee who is a nonimmigrant alien 
who states that he or she falls within an exception to, or has a waiver 
from, the nonimmigrant alien prohibition, have the transferee present 
applicable documentation establishing the exception or waiver, note on 
the Form 4473 the type of documentation provided, and attach a copy of 
the documentation to the Form 4473.
    (iv) Shall comply with the requirements of Sec. 478.102 and record 
on the form the date on which the licensee

[[Page 108]]

contacted the NICS, as well as any response provided by the system, 
including any identification number provided by the system.
    (4) The licensee shall identify the firearm to be transferred by 
listing on the Form 4473 the name of the manufacturer, the name of the 
importer (if any), the type, model, caliber or gauge, and the serial 
number of the firearm.
    (5) The licensee shall sign and date the form if the licensee does 
not know or have reasonable cause to believe that the transferee is 
disqualified by law from receiving the firearm and transfer the firearm 
described on the Form 4473.
    (d) Prior to making an over-the-counter transfer of a shotgun or 
rifle under the provisions contained in Sec. 478.96(c) to a nonlicensee 
who is not a resident of the State in which the licensee's business 
premises is located, the licensee so transferring the shotgun or rifle, 
and such transferee, shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) 
of this section: Provided, That in the case of a transferee who is an 
alien legally in the United States, the documentation required by 
paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section need only establish that the 
transferee is a resident of any State and has resided in such State 
continuously for at least 90 days prior to the transfer of the firearm. 
Examples of acceptable documentation include utility bills or a lease 
agreement. The licensee shall note on the form the documentation used.
    (e) Prior to making a transfer of a firearm to any nonlicensee who 
is not a resident of the State in which the licensee's business premises 
is located, and such nonlicensee is acquiring the firearm by loan or 
rental from the licensee for temporary use for lawful sporting purposes, 
the licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer so 
furnishing the firearm, and such transferee, shall comply with the 
provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, except for the provisions 
of paragraph (c)(3)(ii).
    (f) Form 4473 shall be submitted, in duplicate, to a licensed 
importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer by a transferee who 
is purchasing or otherwise acquiring a firearm by other than an over-
the-counter transaction, who is not subject to the provisions of Sec. 
478.102(a), and who is a resident of the State in which the licensee's 
business premises are located. The Form 4473 shall show the name, 
address, date and place of birth, height, weight, and race of the 
transferee; and the title, name, and address of the principal law 
enforcement officer of the locality to which the firearm will be 
delivered. The transferee also must date and execute the sworn statement 
contained on the form showing, in case the firearm to be transferred is 
a firearm other than a shotgun or rifle, the transferee is 21 years or 
more of age; in case the firearm to be transferred is a shotgun or 
rifle, the transferee is 18 years or more of age; whether the transferee 
is a citizen of the United States; the transferee's State of residence, 
and in the case of a transferee who is an alien legally in the United 
States, the transferee has resided in that State continuously for at 
least 90 days prior to the transfer of the firearm; the transferee is 
not prohibited by the provisions of the Act from shipping or 
transporting a firearm in interstate or foreign commerce or receiving a 
firearm which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign 
commerce or possessing a firearm in or affecting commerce; and the 
transferee's receipt of the firearm would not be in violation of any 
statute of the State or published ordinance applicable to the locality 
in which the transferee resides. Upon receipt of such Forms 4473, the 
licensee shall identify the firearm to be transferred by listing in the 
Forms 4473 the name of the manufacturer, the name of the importer (if 
any), the type, model, caliber or gauge, and the serial number of the 
firearm to be transferred. The licensee shall prior to shipment or 
delivery of the firearm to such transferee, forward by registered or 
certified mail (return receipt requested) a copy of the Form 4473 to the 
principal law enforcement officer named in the Form 4473 by the 
transferee, and shall delay shipment or delivery of the firearm to the 
transferee for a period of at least 7 days following receipt by the 
licensee of the return receipt evidencing delivery of the copy of the 
Form 4473 to such principal law enforcement officer, or the return of 
the copy of the Form

[[Page 109]]

4473 to the licensee due to the refusal of such principal law 
enforcement officer to accept same in accordance with U.S. Postal 
Service regulations. The original Form 4473, and evidence of receipt or 
rejection of delivery of the copy of the Form 4473 sent to the principal 
law enforcement officer, shall be retained by the licensee as a part of 
the records required to be kept under this subpart.
    (g) A licensee who sells or otherwise disposes of a firearm to a 
nonlicensee who is other than an individual, shall obtain from the 
transferee the information required by this section from an individual 
authorized to act on behalf of the transferee. In addition, the licensee 
shall obtain from the individual acting on behalf of the transferee a 
written statement, executed under the penalties of perjury, that the 
firearm is being acquired for the use of and will be the property of the 
transferee, and showing the name and address of that transferee.
    (h) The requirements of this section shall be in addition to any 
other recordkeeping requirement contained in this part.
    (i) A licensee may obtain, upon request, an emergency supply of 
Forms 4473 from any Director of Industry Operations. For normal usage, a 
licensee should request a year's supply from the ATF Distribution 
Center, 7943 Angus Court, Springfield, Virginia 22153.

record of the acquisition and disposition of such firearms on a firearms 
transaction record, Form 4473(LV), Part I or II, in lieu of the records 
prescribed by Sec. 478.125. Such 12-month period shall commence from 
the date the licensed dealer first records the purchase or other 
acuisition of a firearm on Form 4473(LV) pursuant to this section. A 
licensed dealer who maintains records pursuant to this section, but 
whose firearms dispositions exceed 50 firearms within such 12-month 
period, shall make and maintain the acquisition and disposition records 
required by Sec. 478.125 with respect to each firearm exceeding 50.
    (b) Each licensed dealer maintaining firearms acquisition and

4473(LV) shall show the date of receipt, the name and address or the 
name and license number of the person from whom received, the name of 
the manufacturer and importer (if any), the model, serial number, type,

associated with the firearm in lieu of a Form 4473 and comply with the 
requirements specified in Sec. 478.124(f) prior to making a disposition 
of a firearm to a nonlicensee who is purchasing or otherwise acquiring a 
firearm by other than an over-the-counter transaction and who is a 
resident of the State in which the licensee's business premises is 
located. If the licensee's record of the acquisition of the firearm is, 
at the time of the disposition, being maintained on a Form 4473(LV), 
Part I, for over-the-counter transactions, the licensee shall transfer 
the information relative to the receipt of the firearm, as required by

importers: Provided, That the license number of the transferee may be 
recorded in lieu of the transferee's address.
    (c) Armor piercing ammunition sales by licensed dealers to 
governmental entities. A record of armor piercing ammunition disposed of 
by a licensed dealer to a governmental entity pursuant to Sec. 
478.99(e) shall be maintained by the licensed dealer on the licensed 
premises and shall show the name of the manufacturer, the caliber or 
gauge, the quantity, the name and address of the entity to which the 
armor piercing ammunition was transferred, and the date of the 
transaction. Such information shall be recorded under the format 
prescribed by Sec. 478.122(b). Each licensed dealer disposing of armor 
piercing ammunition pursuant to Sec. 478.99(e) shall also maintain a 
record showing the date of acquisition of such ammunition which shall be 
filed in an orderly manner separate from other commercial records 
maintained and be readily available for inspection. The records required 
by this paragraph shall be retained on the licensed premises of the 
licensee for a period not less than two years following the date of the 
recorded sale or disposition of the armor piercing ammunition.
    (d) Commercial records of armor piercing ammunition transactions. 
When a commercial record is made at the time of sale or other 
disposition of armor piercing ammunition, and such record contains all 
information required by the bound record prescribed by paragraph (a) of 
this section, the licensed collector transferring the armor piercing 
ammunition may, for a period not exceeding 7 days following the date of 
such transfer, delay making the required entry into such bound record: 
Provided, That the commercial record pertaining to the transfer is:
    (1) Maintained by the licensed collector separate from other 
commercial documents maintained by such licensee, and
    (2) Is readily available for inspection on the licensed premises 
until such time as the required entry into the bound record is made.
    (e) Firearms receipt and disposition by dealers. Except as provided 
in Sec. 478.124a with respect to alternate records for the receipt and 
disposition of firearms by dealers, each licensed dealer shall enter 
into a record each receipt and disposition of firearms. In addition, 
before commencing or continuing a firearms business, each licensed 
dealer shall inventory the firearms possessed for such business and 
shall record same in the record required by this paragraph. The record 
required by this paragraph shall be maintained in bound form under the 
format prescribed below. The purchase or other acquisition of a firearm 
shall, except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, be recorded 
not later than the close of the next business day following the date of 
such purchase or acquisition. The record shall show the date of receipt, 
the name and address or the name and license number of the person from 
whom received, the name of the manufacturer and importer (if any), the 
model, serial number, type, and the caliber or gauge of the firearm. The 
sale or other disposition of a firearm shall be recorded by the licensed 
dealer not later than 7 days following the date of such transaction. 
When such disposition is made to a nonlicensee, the firearms transaction 
record, Form 4473, obtained by the licensed dealer shall be retained, 
until the transaction is recorded, separate from the licensee's Form 
4473 file and be readily available for inspection. When such disposition 
is made to a licensee, the commercial record of the transaction shall be 
retained, until the transaction is recorded, separate from other 
commercial documents maintained by the licensed dealer, and be readily 
available for inspection. The record shall show the date of the sale or 
other disposition of each firearm, the name and address of the person to 
whom the firearm is transferred, or the name and license number of the 
person to whom transferred if such person is a licensee, or the firearms 
transaction record, Form 4473, serial number if the licensed dealer 
transferring the firearm serially numbers the Forms 4473 and files them 
numerically. The format required for the record of receipt and 
disposition of firearms is as follows:

licensed collector shall enter into a record each receipt and 
disposition of firearms curios or relics. The record required by this 
paragraph shall be maintained in bound form under the format prescribed 
below. The purchase or other acquisition of a curio or relic shall, 
except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, be recorded not

receipt, the name and address or the name and license number of the 
person from whom received, the name of the manufacturer and importer (if 
any), the model, serial number, type, and the caliber or gauge of the 
firearm curio or relic. The sale or other disposition of a curio or

following the date of such transaction. When such disposition is made to 
a licensee, the commercial record of the transaction shall be retained, 
until the transaction is recorded, separate from other commercial 
documents maintained by the licensee, and be readily available for 
inspection. The record shall show the date of the sale or other 
disposition of each firearm curio or relic, the name and address of the 
person to whom the firearm curio or relic is transferred, or the name 
and license number of the person to whom transferred if such person is a 
licensee, and the date of birth of the transferee if other than a

than a licensee, to be identified in any manner customarily used in 
commercial transactions (e.g., a driver's license), and shall note on 
the record the method used. In addition, the licensee shall--
    (1) Cause the transferee, if other than a licensee, to be identified 
in any manner customarily used in commercial transactions (e.g., a 
driver's license), and note on the record the method used, and
    (2) In the case of a transferee who is an alien legally in the 
United States and who is other than a licensee--
    (i) Verify the identity of the transferee by examining an 
identification document (as defined in Sec. 478.11), and

curio or relic is other than a shotgun or rifle, and note on the record 
the documentation used or is a resident of any State and has resided in 
such State continuously for at least 90 days prior to the transfer of 
the firearm if the firearm curio or relic is a shotgun or rifle and

documentation include utility bills or a lease agreement which show that 
the transferee has resided in the State continuously for at least 90 
days prior to the transfer of the firearm curio or relic.

    (g) Commercial records of firearms received. When a commercial 
record is held by a licensed dealer or licensed collector showing the

may authorize alternate records to be maintained by a licensed dealer or 
licensed collector to record the acquisition and disposition of firearms 
or curios or relics and the disposition of armor piercing ammunition 
when it is shown by the licensed dealer or the licensed collector that 
such alternate records will accurately and readily disclose the required 
information. A licensed dealer or licensed collector who proposes to use 
alternate records shall submit a letter application, in duplicate, to 
the Director of Industry Operations and shall describe the proposed 
alternate records and the need therefor. Such alternate records shall 
not be employed by the licensed dealer or licensed collector until

comply with the provisions of Sec. 478.102 or record on a firearms 
transaction record, Form 4473, the sale or other disposition of a

<R05>
Sec. 478.126a  Reporting multiple sales or other disposition of pistols 
and revolvers.

    Each licensee shall prepare a report of multiple sales or other 
disposition whenever the licensee sells or otherwise disposes of, at one 
time or during any five consecutive business days, two or more pistols, 
or revolvers, or any combination of pistols and revolvers totaling two 
or more, to an unlicensed person: Provided, That a report need not be 
made where pistols or revolvers, or any combination thereof, are 
returned to the same person from whom they were received. The report 
shall be prepared on Form 3310.4, Report of Multiple Sale or Other 
Disposition of Pistols and Revolvers. Not later than the close of 
business on the day that the multiple sale or other disposition occurs, 
the licensee shall forward two copies of Form 3310.4 to the ATF office 
specified thereon and one copy to the State police or to the local law 
enforcement agency in which the sale or other disposition took place. 
Where the State or local law enforcement officials have notified the 
licensee that a particular official has been designated to receive Forms 
3310.4, the licensee shall forward such forms to that designated 
official. The licensee shall retain one copy of Form 3310.4 and attach 
it to the firearms transaction record, Form 4473, executed upon delivery 
of the pistols or revolvers.

    Example. 1. A licensee sells a pistol and revolver in a single 
transaction to an unlicensed person. This is a multiple sale and must be 
reported not later than the close of business on the date of the 
transaction.
    Example. 2. A licensee sells a pistol on Monday and sells a revolver 
on the following Friday to the same unlicensed person. This is a 
multiple sale and must be reported not later than the close of business 
on Friday. If the licensee sells the same unlicensed person another 
pistol or revolver on the following Monday, this would constitute an 
additional multiple sale and must also be reported.
    Example 3. A licensee maintaining business hours on Monday through 
Saturday sells a revolver to an unlicensed person on Monday and sells 
another revolver to the same person on the following Saturday. This does 
not constitute a multiple sale and need not be reported since the sales 
did not occur during five consecutive business days.

    The Director shall determine in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 5845(f), 
whether a device is excluded from the definition of a destructive 
device. A person who desires to obtain a determination under that 
provision of law for any device which he believes is not likely to be 
used as a weapon shall submit a written request, in triplicate, for a 
ruling thereon to the Director. Each such request shall be executed 
under the penalties of perjury and contain a complete and accurate 
description of the device, the name and address of the manufacturer or 
importer thereof, the purpose of and use for which it is intended, and 
such photographs, diagrams, or drawings as may be necessary to enable 
the Director to make his determination. The Director may require the 
submission to him, of a sample of such device for examination and 
evaluation. If the submission of

[[Page 130]]

such device is impracticable, the person requesting the ruling shall so 
advise the Director and designate the place where the device will be 
available for examination and evaluation.

    The Director shall determine in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 5845(a), 
whether a firearm or device, which although originally designed as a 
weapon, is by reason of the date of its manufacture, value, design, and 
other characteristics primarily a collector's item and is not likely to 
be used as a weapon. A person who desires to obtain a determination 
under that provision of law shall follow the procedures prescribed in 
Sec. 479.24 relating to destructive device determinations, and shall 
include information as to date of manufacture, value, design and other 
characteristics which would sustain a finding that the firearm or device 
is primarily a collector's item and is not likely to be used as a 
weapon.

Sec. 479.26  Alternate methods or procedures; emergency variations 
from requirements.

    (a) Alternate methods or procedures. Any person subject to the 
provisions of this part, on specific approval by the Director as 
provided in this paragraph, may use an alternate method or procedure in 
lieu of a method or procedure specifically prescribed in this part. The 
Director may approve an alternate method or procedure, subject to stated 
conditions, when it is found that:
    (1) Good cause is shown for the use of the alternate method or 
procedure;
    (2) The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and 
consistent with the effect intended by, the specifically prescribed 
method or procedure and that the alternate method or procedure is 
substantially equivalent to that specifically prescribed method or 
procedure; and
    (3) The alternate method or procedure will not be contrary to any 
provision of law and will not result in an increase in cost to the 
Government or hinder the effective administration of this part. Where 
such person desires to employ an alternate method or procedure, a 
written application shall be submitted to the appropriate regional 
director (compliance), for transmittal to the Director. The application 
shall specifically describe the proposed alternate method or procedure 
and shall set forth the reasons for it. Alternate methods or procedures 
may not be employed until the application is approved by the Director. 
Such person shall, during the period of authorization of an alternate 
method or procedure, comply with the terms of the approved application. 
Authorization of any alternate method or procedure may be withdrawn 
whenever, in the judgment of the Director, the effective administration 
of this part is hindered by the continuation of the authorization.
    (b) Emergency variations from requirements. The Director may approve 
a method of operation other than as specified in this part, where it is 
found that an emergency exists and the proposed variation from the 
specified requirements are necessary and the proposed variations (1) 
will not hinder the effective administration of this part, and (2) will 
not be contrary to any provisions of law. Variations from requirements 
granted under this paragraph are conditioned on compliance with the 
procedures, conditions, and limitations set forth in the approval of the 
application. Failure to comply in good faith with the procedures, 
conditions, and limitations shall automatically terminate the authority 
for the variations, and the person granted the variance shall fully 
comply with the prescribed requirements of regulations from which the 
variations were authorized. Authority for any variation may be withdrawn 
whenever, in the judgment of the Director, the effective administration 
of this part is hindered by the continuation of the variation. Where a 
person desires to employ an emergency variation, a written application 
shall be submitted to the appropriate regional director (compliance) for 
transmittal to the Director. The application shall describe the proposed 
variation

[[Page 131]]

and set forth the reasons for it. Variations may not be employed until 
the application is approved.
    (c) Retention of approved variations. The person granted the 
variance shall retain and make available for examination by ATF officers 
any application approved by the Director under this section.

                 Subpart D_Special (Occupational) Taxes


<R05>
Sec. 479.31  Liability for tax.

    (a) General. Every person who engages in the business of importing, 
manufacturing, or dealing in (including pawnbrokers) firearms in the 
United States shall pay a special (occupational) tax at a rate specified 
by Sec. 479.32. The tax shall be paid on or before the date of 
commencing the taxable business, and thereafter every year on or before 
July 1. Special (occupational) tax shall not be prorated. The tax shall 
be computed for the entire tax year (July 1 through June 30), regardless 
of the portion of the year during which the taxpayer engages in 
business. Persons commencing business at any time after July 1 in any 
year are liable for the special (occupational) tax for the entire tax 
year.
    (b) Each place of business taxable. An importer, manufacturer, or 
dealer in firearms incurs special tax liability at each place of 
business where an occupation subject to special tax is conducted. A 
place of business means the entire office, plant or area of the business 
in any one location under the same proprietorship. Passageways, streets, 
highways, rail crossings, waterways, or partitions dividing the premises 
are not sufficient separation to require additional special tax, if the 
divisions of the premises are otherwise contiguous. See also Sec. Sec. 
479.38-479.39.

tax rates effective January 1, 1988, are as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             Per year or

                                                               thereof
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Class 1--Importer of firearms (including an importer only         $1,000

Class 2--Manufacturer of firearms (including a manufacturer        1,000

increased special tax for the period January 1, 1988, through June 30, 
1988. The increased tax shall not exceed one-half the excess (if any) of 
(1) the rate of special tax in effect on January 1, 1988, over (2) the 
rate of such tax in effect on December 31, 1987. The increased special 
tax shall be paid on or before April 1, 1988.

<R05>
Sec. 479.32a  Reduced rate of tax for small importers and manufacturers.

    (a) General. Effective January 1, 1988, 26 U.S.C. 5801(b) provides 
for a reduced rate of special tax with respect to any importer or 
manufacturer whose gross receipts (for the most recent taxable year 
ending before the first day of the taxable period to which the special 
tax imposed by Sec. 479.32 relates) are less than $500,000. The rate of 
tax for such an importer or manufacturer is $500 per year or fraction 
thereof. The ``taxable year'' to be used for determining gross receipts 
is the taxpayer's income tax year. All gross receipts of the taxpayer

[[Page 132]]

shall be included, not just the gross receipts of the business subject 
to special tax. Proprietors of new businesses that have not yet begun a 
taxable year, as well as proprietors of existing businesses that have 
not yet ended a taxable year, who commence a new activity subject to 
special tax, quality for the reduced special (occupational) tax rate, 
unless the business is a member of a ``controlled group''; in that case, 
the rules of paragraph (b) of this section shall apply.
    (b) Controlled group. All persons treated as one taxpayer under 26 
U.S.C. 5061(e)(3) shall be treated as one taxpayer for the purpose of 
determining gross receipts under paragraph (a) of this section. 
``Controlled group'' means a controlled group of corporations, as 
defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563 and implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-
1 through 1.1563-4, except that the words ``at least 80 percent'' shall 
be replaced by the words ``more than 50 percent'' in each place they 
appear in subsection (a) of 26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the 
implementing regulations. Also, the rules for a ``controlled group of 
corporations'' apply in a similar fashion to groups which include 
partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more 
than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or 
more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of 
the controlled group are one taxpayer for the purpose of this section.
    (c) Short taxable year. Gross receipts for any taxable year of less 
than 12 months shall be annualized by multiplying the gross receipts for 
the short period by 12 and dividing the result by the number of months 
in the short period, as required by 26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).
    (d) Returns and allowances. Gross receipts for any taxable year 
shall be reduced by returns and allowances made during that year under 
26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).

Sec. 479.33  Special exemption.

    (a) Any person required to pay special (occupational) tax under this 
part shall be relieved from payment of that tax if he establishes to the 
satisfaction of the Director that his business is conducted exclusively 
with, or on behalf of, the United States or any department, independent 
establishment, or agency thereof. The Director may relieve any person 
manufacturing firearms for or on behalf of the United States from 
compliance with any provision of this part in the conduct of the 
business with respect to such firearms.
    (b) The exemption in this section may be obtained by filing with the 
Director an application, in letter form, setting out the manner in which 
the applicant conducts his business, the type of firearm to be 
manufactured, and proof satisfactory to the Director of the existence of 
the contract with the United States, department, independent 
establishment, or agency thereof, under which the applicant intends to 
operate.


<R05>
Sec. 479.34  Special tax registration and return.

    (a) General. Special tax shall be paid by return. The prescribed 
return is ATF Form 5630.7, Special Tax Registration and Return. Special 
tax returns, with payment of tax, shall be filed with ATF in accordance 
with instructions on the form. Properly completing, signing, and timely 
filing of a return (Form 5630.7) constitutes compliance with 26 U.S.C. 
5802.
    (b) Preparation of ATF Form 5630.7. All of the information called 
for on Form 5630.7 shall be provided, including:
    (1) The true name of the taxpayer.
    (2) The trade name(s) (if any) of the business(es) subject to 
special tax.
    (3) The employer identification number (see Sec. 479.35).
    (4) The exact location of the place of business, by name and number 
of building or street, or if these do not exist, by some description in 
addition to the post office address. In the case of one return for two 
or more locations, the address to be shown shall be the taxpayer's 
principal place of business (or principal office, in the case of a 
corporate taxpayer).
    (5) The class(es) of special tax to which the taxpayer is subject.
    (6) Ownership and control information: That is, the name, position, 
and residence address of every owner of the business and of every person 
having

[[Page 133]]

power to control its management and policies with respect to the 
activity subject to special tax. ``Owner of the business'' shall include 
every partner, if the taxpayer is a partnership, and every person owning 
10% or more of its stock, if the taxpayer is a corporation. However, the 
ownership and control information required by this paragraph need not be 
stated if the same information has been previously provided to ATF in 
connection with a license application under Part 478 of this chapter, 
and if the information previously provided is still current.
    (c) Multiple locations and/or classes of tax. A taxpayer subject to 
special tax for the same period at more than one location or for more 
than one class of tax shall--
    (1) File one special tax return, ATF Form 5630.7, with payment of 
tax, to cover all such locations and classes of tax; and
    (2) Prepare, in duplicate, a list identified with the taxpayer's 
name, address (as shown on ATF Form 5630.7), employer identification 
number, and period covered by the return. The list shall show, by 
States, the name, address, and tax class of each location for which 
special tax is being paid. The original of the list shall be filed with 
ATF in accordance with instructions on the return, and the copy shall be 
retained at the taxpayer's principal place of business (or principal 
office, in the case of a corporate taxpayer) for not less than 3 years.
    (d) Signing of ATF Forms 5630.7--(1) Ordinary returns. The return of 
an individual proprietor shall be signed by the individual. The return 
of a partnership shall be signed by a general partner. The return of a 
corporation shall be signed by any officer. In each case, the person 
signing the return shall designate his or her capacity as ``individual 
owner,'' ``member of firm,'' or, in the case of a corporation, the title 
of the officer.
    (2) Fiduciaries. Receivers, trustees, assignees, executors, 
administrators, and other legal representatives who continue the 
business of a bankrupt, insolvent, deceased person, etc., shall indicate 
the fiduciary capacity in which they act.
    (3) Agent or attorney in fact. If a return is signed by an agent or 
attorney in fact, the signature shall be preceded by the name of the 
principal and followed by the title of the agent or attorney in fact. A 
return signed by a person as agent will not be accepted unless there is 
filed, with the ATF office with which the return is required to be 
filed, a power of attorney authorizing the agent to perform the act.
    (4) Perjury statement. ATF Forms 5630.7 shall contain or be verified 
by a written declaration that the return has been executed under the 
penalties of perjury.
    (e) Identification of taxpayer. If the taxpayer is an individual, 
with the initial return such person shall securely attach to Form 5630.7 
a photograph of the individual 2 x 2 inches in size, clearly showing a 
full front view of the features of the individual with head bare, with 
the distance from the top of the head to the point of the chin 
approximately 1\1/4\ inches, and which shall have been taken within 6 
months prior to the date of completion of the return. The individual 
shall also attach to the return a properly completed FBI Form FD-258 
(Fingerprint Card). The fingerprints must be clear for accurate 
classification and should be taken by someone properly equipped to take 
them: Provided, That the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to 
individuals who have filed with ATF a properly executed Application for 
License under 18 U.S.C. Chapter 44, Firearms, ATF Form 7 (5310.12) (12-
93 edition), as specified in Sec. 478.44(a).

employer identification number may result in the imposition of the 
penalty specified in Sec. 70.113 of this chapter.

[[Page 134]]

    (b) Application for employer identification number. Each taxpayer 
who files a special tax return, who has not already been assigned an 
employer identification number, shall file IRS Form SS-4 to apply for 
one. The taxpayer shall apply for and be assigned only one employer 
identification number, regardless of the number of places of business 
for which the taxpayer is required to file a special tax return. The 
employer identification number shall be applied for no later than 7 days 
after the filing of the taxpayer's first special tax return. IRS Form 
SS-4 may be obtained from the director of an IRS service center or from 
any IRS district director.

statement, in accordance with the instructions on the form or issued in 
respect to it.

Sec. 479.38  Engaging in business at more than one location.

    A person shall pay the special (occupational) tax for each location 
where he engages in any business taxable under 26 U.S.C. 5801. However, 
a person paying a special (occupational) tax covering his principal 
place of business may utilize other locations solely for storage of 
firearms without incurring special (occupational) tax liability at such 
locations. A manufacturer, upon the single payment of the appropriate 
special (occupational) tax, may sell firearms, if such firearms are of 
his own manufacture, at the place of manufacture and at his principal 
office or place of business if no such firearms, except samples, are 
kept at such office or place of business. When a person changes the 
location of a business for which he has paid the special (occupational) 
tax, he will be liable for another such tax unless the change is 
properly registered with the regional director (compliance) for the 
region in which the special tax stamp was issued, as provided in Sec. 
479.46.

    If more than one business taxable under 26 U.S.C. 5801, is carried 
on at the same location during a taxable year, the special 
(occupational) tax imposed on each such business must be paid. This 
section does not require a qualified manufacturer or importer to qualify 
as a dealer if such manufacturer or importer also engages in business on 
his qualified premises as a dealer. However, a qualified manufacturer 
who engages in business as an importer must also qualify as an importer. 
Further, a qualified dealer is not entitled to engage in business as a 
manufacturer or importer.

continues the business, such person shall, within 30 days after the date 
on which the successor begins to carry on the business, file a new 
return, Form 5630.7, with ATF in accordance with the instructions on the

Sec. 479.43  Changes through bankruptcy of owner.

    A receiver or referee in bankruptcy may continue the business under 
the stamp issued to the taxpayer at the place and for the period for 
which the tax was paid. An assignee for the benefit of creditors may 
continue business under his assignor's special tax stamp without 
incurring additional special (occupational) tax liability. In such 
cases, the change shall be registered with ATF in a manner similar to 
that required by Sec. 479.42.

<R05>
Sec. 479.44  Change in partnership or unincorporated association.

    When one or more members withdraw from a partnership or an 
unincorporated association, the remaining member, or members, may, 
without incurring additional special (occupational) tax liability, carry 
on the same business at the same location for the balance of the taxable 
period for which special (occupational) tax was paid, provided any such 
change shall be registered in the same manner as required by Sec. 
479.42. Where new member(s) are taken into a partnership or an 
unincorporated association, the new firm so constituted may not carry on 
business under the special tax stamp of the old firm. The new firm must 
file a return, pay the special (occupational) tax and register in the 
same manner as a person who first engages in business is required to do 
under Sec. 479.34 even though the name of the new firm may be the same 
as that of the old. Where the members of a partnership or an 
unincorporated association, which has paid special (occupational) tax, 
form a corporation to continue the business, a new special tax stamp 
must be taken out in the name of the corporation.


<R05>
Sec. 479.45  Changes in corporation.

    Additional special (occupational) tax is not required by reason of a 
mere change of name or increase in the capital stock of a corporation if 
the laws of the State of incorporation provide for such change or 
increase without the formation of a new corporation. A stockholder in a 
corporation who after its dissolution continues the business, incurs new 
special (occupational) tax liability.

                       Change of Business Location


<R05>
Sec. 479.46  Notice by taxpayer.

    Whenever during the taxable year a taxpayer intends to remove his 
business to a location other than specified in his last special 
(occupational) tax return (see Sec. 479.34), he shall file with

[[Page 136]]

ATF (a) a return, Form 5630.7, bearing the notation ``Removal 
Registry,'' and showing the new address intended to be used, (b) his 
current special tax stamp, and (c) a letter application requesting the 
amendment of his registration. The regional director (compliance), upon 
approval of the application, shall return the special tax stamp, amended 
to show the new business location. Firearms operations shall not be 
commenced at the new business location by the taxpayer prior to the 
required approval of his application to so change his business location.

be used, (b) his current special tax stamp, and (c) a letter application 
requesting the amendment of his registration. The regional director 
(compliance), upon approval of the application, shall return the special 
tax stamp, amended to show the new trade name. Firearms operations shall 
not be commenced under the new trade name by the taxpayer prior to the 
required approval of his application to so change the trade name.

    Any person who engages in a business taxable under 26 U.S.C. 5801, 
without timely payment of the tax imposed with respect to such business 
(see Sec. 479.34) shall be liable for such tax, plus the interest and 
penalties thereon (see 26 U.S.C. 6601 and 6651). In addition, such 
person may be liable for criminal penalties under 26 U.S.C. 5871.

<R05>
Sec. 479.49  Failure to register change or removal.

    Any person succeeding to and carrying on a business for which 
special (occupational) tax has been paid without registering such change 
within 30 days thereafter, and any taxpayer removing his business with 
respect to which special (occupational) tax has been paid to a place 
other than that for which tax was paid without obtaining approval 
therefor (see Sec. 479.46), will incur liability to an additional 
payment of the tax, addition to tax and interest, as provided in 
sections 5801, 6651, and 6601, respectively, I.R.C., for failure to make 
return (see Sec. 479.50) or pay tax, as well as criminal penalties for 
carrying on business without payment of special (occupational) tax (see 
section 5871 I.R.C.).


<R05>
Sec. 479.50  Delinquency.

    Any person liable for special (occupational) tax under section 5801, 
I.R.C., who fails to file a return (Form 5630.7), as prescribed, will be 
liable for a delinquency penalty computed on the amount of tax due 
unless a return (Form 5630.7) is later filed and failure to file the 
return timely is shown to the satisfaction of the regional director 
(compliance), to be due to reasonable cause. The delinquency penalty to 
be added to the tax is 5 percent if the failure is for not more than 1 
month, with an additional 5 percent for each additional month or 
fraction thereof during which failure continues, not to exceed 25 
percent in the aggregate (section 6651, I.R.C.). However, no delinquency 
penalty is assessed where the 50 percent addition to tax is assessed for 
fraud (see Sec. 479.51).

<R05>
Sec. 479.51  Fraudulent return.

    If any part of any underpayment of tax required to be shown on a 
return is due to fraud, there shall be added to

[[Page 137]]

the tax an amount equal to 50 percent of the underpayment, but no 
delinquency penalty shall be assessed with respect to the same 
underpayment (section 6653, I.R.C.).

                        Application of State Laws


<R05>
Sec. 479.52  State regulations.

    Special tax stamps are merely receipts for the tax. Payment of tax 
under Federal law confers no privilege to act contrary to State law. One 
to whom a special tax stamp has been issued may still be punishable 
under a State law prohibiting or controlling the manufacture, possession 
or transfer of firearms. On the other hand, compliance with State law 
confers no immunity under Federal law. Persons who engage in the 
business of importing, manufacturing or dealing in firearms, in 
violation of the law of a State, are nevertheless required to pay 
special (occupational) tax as imposed under the internal revenue laws of 
the United States. For provisions relating to restrictive use of 
information furnished to comply with the provisions of this part see 
Sec. 479.23.

Director a written application on Form 1 (Firearms), Application to Make 
and Register a Firearm, in duplicate, executed under the penalties of 
perjury, to make and register the firearm and has received the approval 
of the Director to make the firearm which approval shall effectuate 
registration of the weapon to the applicant. The application shall 
identify the firearm to be made by serial number, type, model, caliber 
or gauge, length of barrel, other marks of identification, and the name 
and address of original manufacturer (if the applicant is not the 
original manufacturer). The applicant must be identified on the Form 1 
(Firearms) by name and address and, if other than a natural person, the 
name and address of the principal officer or authorized representative 
and the employer identification number and, if an individual, the 
identification must include the date and place of birth and the 
information prescribed in Sec. 479.63. Each applicant shall identify 
the Federal firearms license and special (occupational) tax stamp issued 
to the applicant, if any. The applicant shall also show required 
information evidencing that making or possession of the firearm would 
not be in violation of law. If the making is taxable, a remittance in 
the amount of $200 shall be submitted with the application in accordance 
with the instructions on the form. If the making is taxable and the 
application is approved, the Director will affix a National Firearms Act 
stamp to the original application in the space provided therefor and 
properly cancel the stamp (see Sec. 479.67). The approved application 
will be returned to the applicant. If the making of the firearm is tax 
exempt under this part, an explanation of the basis of the exemption 
shall be attached to the Form 1 (Firearms).

the form, a photograph of the applicant 2 x 2 inches in size, clearly 
showing a full front view of the features of the applicant with head 
bare, with the distance from the top of the head to the point of the

State or local district attorney or prosecutor, or such other person 
whose certificate may in a particular case be acceptable to the 
Director, shall be completed on each copy of the Form 1 (Firearms). The 
certificate shall state that the certifying official is satisfied that 
the fingerprints and photograph accompanying the application are those 
of the applicant and that the certifying official has no information 
indicating that possession of the firearm by the maker would be in 
violation of State or local law or that the maker will use the firearm 
for other than lawful purposes.

    The application to make a firearm, Form 1 (Firearms), must be 
forwarded directly, in duplicate, by the maker of the firearm to the 
Director in accordance with the instructions on the form. The Director 
will consider the application for approval or disapproval. If the 
application is approved, the Director will return the original thereof 
to the maker of the firearm and retain the duplicate. Upon receipt of 
the approved application, the maker is authorized to make the firearm 
described therein. The maker of the firearm shall not, under any 
circumstances, make the firearm until the application, satisfactorily 
executed, has been forwarded to the Director and has been approved and 
returned by the Director with the National Firearms Act stamp affixed. 
If the application is disapproved, the original Form 1 (Firearms) and 
the remittance submitted by the applicant for the purchase of the stamp 
will be returned to the applicant with the reason for disapproval stated 
on the form.

Sec. 479.86  Action on application.

    The Director will consider a completed and properly executed 
application, Form 4 (Firearms), to transfer a firearm. If the 
application is approved, the Director will affix the appropriate 
National Firearms Act stamp, cancel it, and return the original 
application showing approval to the transferor who may then transfer the 
firearm to the transferee along with the approved application. The 
approval of an application, Form 4 (Firearms), by the Director will 
effectuate registration of the firearm to the transferee. The transferee 
shall not take possession of a firearm until the application, Form 4 
(Firearms), for the transfer filed by the transferor has been approved 
by the Director and registration of the firearm is effectuated to the 
transferee. The transferee shall retain the approved application as 
proof that the firearm described therein is registered to the 
transferee, and shall make the approved Form 4 (Firearms) available to 
any ATF officer on request. If the application, Form 4 (Firearms), to 
transfer a firearm is disapproved by the Director, the original 
application and the remittance for purchase of the stamp will be 
returned to the transferor with reasons for the disapproval stated on 
the application. An application, Form 4 (Firearms), to transfer a 
firearm shall be denied if the transfer, receipt, or possession of a 
firearm would place the transferee in violation of law. In addition to 
any other records checks that may be conducted to determine whether the 
transfer, receipt, or possession of a firearm would place the transferee 
in violation of law, the Director shall contact the National Instant 
Criminal Background Check System.

              Exemptions Relating to Transfers of Firearms


<R05>
Sec. 479.88  Special (occupational) taxpayers.

    (a) A firearm registered to a person qualified under this part to 
engage in business as an importer, manufacturer, or dealer may be 
transferred by that person without payment of the transfer tax to any 
other person qualified under this part to manufacture, import, or deal 
in firearms.

[[Page 141]]

    (b) The exemption provided in paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
obtained by the transferor of the firearm filing with the Director an 
application, Form 3 (Firearms), Application for Tax-exempt Transfer of 
Firearm and Registration to Special (Occupational) Taxpayer, in 
duplicate, executed under the penalties of perjury. The application, 
Form 3 (Firearms), shall (1) show the name and address of the transferor 
and of the transferee, (2) identify the Federal firearms license and 
special (occupational) tax stamp of the transferor and of the 
transferee, (3) show the name and address of the manufacturer and the 
importer of the firearm, if known, (4) show the type, model, overall 
length (if applicable), length of barrel, caliber, gauge or size, serial 
number, and other marks of identification of the firearm, and (5) 
contain a statement by the transferor that he is entitled to the 
exemption because the transferee is a person qualified under this part 
to manufacture, import, or deal in firearms. If the Director approves an 
application, Form 3 (Firearms), he shall return the original Form 3 
(Firearms) to the transferor with the approval noted thereon. Approval 
of an application, Form 3 (Firearms), by the Director shall remove 
registration of the firearm reported thereon from the transferor and 
shall effectuate the registration of that firearm to the transferee. 
Upon receipt of the approved Form 3 (Firearms), the transferor shall 
deliver same with the firearm to the transferee. The transferor shall 
not transfer the firearm to the transferee until his application, Form 3 
(Firearms), has been approved by the Director and the original thereof 
has been returned to the transferor. If the Director disapproves the 
application, Form 3 (Firearms), he shall return the original Form 3 
(Firearms) to the transferor with the reasons for the disapproval stated 
thereon.
    (c) The transferor shall be responsible for establishing the exempt 
status of the transferee before making a transfer under the provisions 
of this section. Therefore, before engaging in transfer negotiations 
with the transferee, the transferor should satisfy himself as to the 
claimed exempt status of the transferee and the bona fides of the 
transaction. If not fully satisfied, the transferor should communicate 
with the Director, report all circumstances regarding the proposed 
transfer, and await the Director's advice before making application for 
the transfer. An unapproved transfer or a transfer to an unauthorized 
person may subject the transferor to civil and criminal liabilities.

requirement under other provisions of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 479.90  Certain government entities.

    (a) A firearm may be transferred without payment of the transfer tax 
to or from any State, possession of the United States, any political 
subdivision thereof, or any official police organization of such a 
governmental entity engaged in criminal investigations.
    (b) The exemption provided in paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
obtained by the transferor of the firearm filing with the Director an 
application, Form 5 (Firearms), Application for Tax-exempt Transfer and 
Registration of Firearm, in duplicate, executed under the penalties of 
perjury. The application shall (1) show the name and address of the 
transferor and of the transferee, (2) identify the Federal firearms 
license and special (occupational) tax stamp, if any, of the transferor 
and of the transferee, (3) show the name and address of the manufacturer 
and the importer of the firearm, if known, (4) show the type, model, 
overall length (if applicable), length of barrel, caliber, gauge or 
size, serial number, and other marks of identification of the firearm, 
and (5) contain a statement by the

[[Page 142]]

transferor that the transferor is entitled to the exemption because 
either the transferor or the transferee is a governmental entity coming 
within the purview of paragraph (a) of this section. In the case of a 
transfer of a firearm by a governmental entity to a transferee who is a 
natural person not qualified as a manufacturer, importer, or dealer 
under this part, the transferee shall be further identified in the 
manner prescribed in Sec. 479.85. If the Director approves an 
application, Form 5 (Firearms), the original Form 5 (Firearms) shall be 
returned to the transferor with the approval noted thereon. Approval of 
an application, Form 5 (Firearms), by the Director shall effectuate the 
registration of that firearm to the transferee. Upon receipt of the 
approved Form 5 (Firearms), the transferor shall deliver same with the 
firearm to the transferee. The transferor shall not transfer the firearm 
to the transferee until the application, Form 5 (Firearms), has been 
approved by the Director and the original thereof has been returned to 
the transferor. If the Director disapproves the application, Form 5 
(Firearms), the original Form 5 (Firearms) shall be returned to the 
transferor with the reasons for the disapproval stated thereon. An 
application by a governmental entity to transfer a firearm shall be 
denied if the tranfer, receipt, or possession of a firearm would place 
the transferee in violation of law.
    (c) The transferor shall be responsible for establishing the exempt 
status of the transferee before making a transfer under the provisions 
of this section. Therefore, before engaging in transfer negotiations 
with the transferee, the transferor should satisfy himself of the 
claimed exempt status of the transferee and the bona fides of the 
transaction. If not fully satisfied, the transferor should communicate 
with the Director, report all circumstances regarding the proposed 
transfer, and await the Director's advice before making application for 
transfer. An unapproved transfer or a transfer to an unauthorized person 
may subject the transferor to civil and criminal liabilities. (See 26 
U.S.C. 5852, 5861, and 5871.)

Sec. 479.91  Unserviceable firearms.

    An unserviceable firearm may be transferred as a curio or ornament 
without payment of the transfer tax. However, the procedures for the 
transfer of a firearm as provided in Sec. 479.90 shall be followed in a 
tax-exempt transfer of a firearm under this section, except a statement 
shall be entered on the transfer application, Form 5 (Firearms), by the 
transferor that he is entitled to the exemption because the firearm to 
be transferred is unservicable and is being transferred as a curio or 
ornament. An unapproved transfer, the transfer of a firearm under the 
provisions of this section which is in fact not an unserviceable 
firearm, or the transfer of an unserviceable firearm as something other 
than a curio or ornament, may subject the transferor to civil and 
criminal liabilities. (See 26 U.S.C. 5811, 5852, 5861, and 5871.)

order to effect the transfer of a firearm authorized under the

Sec. 479.101  Registration of firearms.

    (a) The Director shall maintain a central registry of all firearms 
in the United States which are not in the possession of or under the 
control of the United States. This registry shall be known as the 
National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record and shall include:
    (1) Identification of the firearm as required by this part;

    (3) Identification and address of person entitled to possession of 
the firearm as required by this part.
    (b) Each manufacturer, importer, and maker shall register each 
firearm he manufactures, imports, or makes in the manner prescribed by 
this part. Each firearm transferred shall be registered to the 
transferee by the transferor in the manner prescribed by this part. No 
firearm may be registered by a person unlawfully in possession of the 
firearm except during an amnesty period established under section 207 of 
the Gun Control Act of 1968 (82 Stat. 1235).
    (c) A person shown as possessing firearms by the records maintained 
by the Director pursuant to the National Firearms Act (26 U.S.C. Chapter 
53) in force on October 31, 1968, shall be considered to have registered 
the firearms in his possession which are disclosed by that record as 
being in his possession on October 31, 1968.
    (d) The National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record shall 
include firearms registered to the possessors thereof under the 
provisions of section 207 of the Gun Control Act of 1968.
    (e) A person possessing a firearm registered to him shall retain 
proof of registration which shall be made available to any ATF officer

<R05>
Sec. 479.102  How must firearms be identified?

    (a) You, as a manufacturer, importer, or maker of a firearm, must 
legibly identify the firearm as follows:
    (1) By engraving, casting, stamping (impressing), or otherwise 
conspicuously placing or causing to be engraved, cast, stamped 
(impressed) or placed on the frame or receiver thereof an individual 
serial number. The serial number must be placed in a manner not 
susceptible of being readily obliterated, altered, or removed, and must 
not duplicate any serial number placed by you on any other firearm. For 
firearms manufactured, imported, or made on and after January 30, 2002, 
the engraving, casting, or stamping (impressing) of the serial number 
must be to a minimum depth of .003 inch and in a print size no smaller 
than 1/16 inch; and
    (2) By engraving, casting, stamping (impressing), or otherwise 
conspicuously placing or causing to be engraved, cast, stamped 
(impressed), or placed on the frame, receiver, or barrel thereof certain 
additional information. This information must be placed in a manner not 
susceptible of being readily obliterated, altered or removed. For 
firearms manufactured, imported, or made on and after January 30, 2002, 
the engraving, casting, or stamping (impressing) of this information 
must be to a minimum depth of .003 inch. The additional information 
includes:
    (i) The model, if such designation has been made;
    (ii) The caliber or gauge;
    (iii) Your name (or recognized abbreviation) and also, when 
applicable, the name of the foreign manufacturer or maker;
    (iv) In the case of a domestically made firearm, the city and State 
(or recognized abbreviation thereof) where you as the manufacturer 
maintain your place of business, or where you, as the maker, made the 
firearm; and
    (v) In the case of an imported firearm, the name of the country in 
which

[[Page 144]]

it was manufactured and the city and State (or recognized abbreviation 
thereof) where you as the importer maintain your place of business. For 
additional requirements relating to imported firearms, see Customs 
regulations at 19 CFR part 134.
    (b) The depth of all markings required by this section will be 
measured from the flat surface of the metal and not the peaks or ridges. 
The height of serial numbers required by paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section will be measured as the distance between the latitudinal ends of 
the character impression bottoms (bases).
    (c) The Director may authorize other means of identification upon 
receipt of a letter application from you, submitted in duplicate, 
showing that such other identification is reasonable and will not hinder 
the effective administration of this part.
    (d) In the case of a destructive device, the Director may authorize 
other means of identifying that weapon upon receipt of a letter 
application from you, submitted in duplicate, showing that engraving, 
casting, or stamping (impressing) such a weapon would be dangerous or 
impracticable.
    (e) A firearm frame or receiver that is not a component part of a 
complete weapon at the time it is sold, shipped, or otherwise disposed 
of by you must be identified as required by this section.
    (f)(1) Any part defined as a machine gun, muffler, or silencer for 
the purposes of this part that is not a component part of a complete 
firearm at the time it is sold, shipped, or otherwise disposed of by you 
must be identified as required by this section.
    (2) The Director may authorize other means of identification of 
parts defined as machine guns other than frames or receivers and parts 
defined as mufflers or silencers upon receipt of a letter application 
from you, submitted in duplicate, showing that such other identification 
is reasonable and will not hinder the effective administration of this 
part.

Sec. 479.103  Registration of firearms manufactured.

    Each manufacturer qualified under this part shall file with the 
Director an accurate notice on Form 2 (Firearms), Notice of Firearms 
Manufactured or Imported, executed under the penalties of perjury, to 
show his manufacture of firearms. The notice shall set forth the name 
and address of the manufacturer, identify his special (occupational) tax 
stamp and Federal firearms license, and show the date of manufacture, 
the type, model, length of barrel, overall length, caliber, gauge or 
size, serial numbers, and other marks of identification of the firearms 
he manufactures, and the place where the manufactured firearms will be 
kept. All firearms manufactured by him during a single day shall be 
included on one notice, Form 2 (Firearms), filed by the manufacturer no 
later than the close of the next business day. The manufacturer shall 
prepare the notice, Form 2 (Firearms), in duplicate, file the original 
notice as prescribed herein and keep the copy with the records required 
by subpart I of this part at the premises covered by his special 
(occupational) tax stamp. Receipt of the notice, Form 2 (Firearms), by 
the Director shall effectuate the registration of the firearms listed on 
that notice. The requirements of this part relating to the transfer of a 
firearm are applicable to transfers by qualified manufacturers.


<R05>
Sec. 479.104  Registration of firearms by certain governmental entities.

    Any State, any political subdivision thereof, or any official police 
organization of such a government entity engaged in criminal 
investigations, which acquires for official use a firearm not registered 
to it, such as by abandonment or by forfeiture, will register such 
firearm with the Director by filing Form 10 (Firearms), Registration of 
Firearms Acquired by Certain Governmental Entities, and such 
registration shall become a part of the National Firearms Registration 
and Transfer Record. The application shall identify the applicant, 
describe each firearm covered by the application, show the location 
where each firearm usually

[[Page 145]]

will be kept, and, if the firearm is unserviceable, the application 
shall show how the firearm was made unserviceable. This section shall 
not apply to a firearm merely being held for use as evidence in a 
criminal proceeding. The Form 10 (Firearms) shall be executed in 
duplicate in accordance with the instructions thereon. Upon registering 
the firearm, the Director shall return the original Form 10 (Firearms) 
to the registrant with notification thereon that registration of the 
firearm has been made. The registration of any firearm under this 
section is for official use only and a subsequent transfer will be 
approved only to other governmental entities for official use.

                              Machine Guns


<R05>
Sec. 479.105  Transfer and possession of machine guns.

    (a) General. As provided by 26 U.S.C. 5812 and 26 U.S.C. 5822, an 
application to make or transfer a firearm shall be denied if the making, 
transfer, receipt, or possession of the firearm would place the maker or 
transferee in violation of law. Section 922(o), Title 18, U.S.C., makes 
it unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machine gun, except 
a transfer to or by, or possession by or under the authority of, the 
United States or any department or agency thereof or a State, or a 
department, agency, or political subdivision thereof; or any lawful 
transfer or lawful possession of a machine gun that was lawfully 
possessed before May 19, 1986. Therefore, notwithstanding any other 
provision of this part, no application to make, transfer, or import a 
machine gun will be approved except as provided by this section.
    (b) Machine guns lawfully possessed prior to May 19, 1986. A machine 
gun possessed in compliance with the provisions of this part prior to 
May 19, 1986, may continue to be lawfully possessed by the person to 
whom the machine gun is registered and may, upon compliance with the 
provisions of this part, be lawfully transferred to and possessed by the 
transferee.
    (c) Importation and manufacture. Subject to compliance with the 
provisions of this part, importers and manufacturers qualified under 
this part may import and manufacture machine guns on or after May 19, 
1986, for sale or distribution to any department or agency of the United 
States or any State or political subdivision thereof, or for use by 
dealers qualified under this part as sales samples as provided in 
paragraph (d) of this section. The registration of such machine guns 
under this part and their subsequent transfer shall be conditioned upon 
and restricted to the sale or distribution of such weapons for the 
official use of Federal, State or local governmental entities. Subject 
to compliance with the provisions of this part, manufacturers qualified 
under this part may manufacture machine guns on or after May 19, 1986, 
for exportation in compliance with the Arms Export Control Act (22 
U.S.C. 2778) and regulations prescribed thereunder by the Department of 
State.
    (d) Dealer sales samples. Subject to compliance with the provisions 
of this part, applications to transfer and register a machine gun 
manufactured or imported on or after May 19, 1986, to dealers qualified 
under this part will be approved if it is established by specific 
information the expected governmental customers who would require a 
demonstration of the weapon, information as to the availability of the 
machine gun to fill subsequent orders, and letters from governmental 
entities expressing a need for a particular model or interest in seeing 
a demonstration of a particular weapon. Applications to transfer more 
than one machine gun of a particular model to a dealer must also 
establish the dealer's need for the quantity of samples sought to be 
transferred.
    (e) The making of machine guns on or after May 19, 1986. Subject to 
compliance with the provisions of this part, applications to make and 
register machine guns on or after May 19, 1986, for the benefit of a 
Federal, State or local governmental entity (e.g., an invention for 
possible future use of a governmental entity or the making of a weapon 
in connection with research and development on behalf of such an entity) 
will be approved if it is established by

[[Page 146]]

specific information that the machine gun is particularly suitable for 
use by Federal, State or local governmental entities and that the making 
of the weapon is at the request and on behalf of such an entity.
    (f) Discontinuance of business. Since section 922(o), Title 18, 
U.S.C., makes it unlawful to transfer or possess a machine gun except as 
provided in the law, any qualified manufacturer, importer, or dealer 
intending to discontinue business shall, prior to going out of business, 
transfer in compliance with the provisions of this part any machine gun 
manufactured or imported after May 19, 1986, to a Federal, State or 
local governmental entity, qualified manufacturer, qualified importer, 
or, subject to the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, dealer 
qualified to possess such, machine gun.

                               Importation


<R05>
Sec. 479.111  Procedure.

    (a) No firearm shall be imported or brought into the United States 
or any territory under its control or jurisdiction unless the person 
importing or bringing in the firearm establishes to the satisfaction of 
the Director that the firearm to be imported or brought in is being 
imported or brought in for:
    (1) The use of the United States or any department, independent 
establishment, or agency thereof or any State or possession or any 
political subdivision thereof; or
    (2) Scientific or research purposes; or
    (3) Testing or use as a model by a registered manufacturer or solely 
for use as a sample by a registered importer or registered dealer.

The burden of proof is affirmatively on any person importing or bringing 
the firearm into the United States or any territory under its control or 
jurisdiction to show that the firearm is being imported or brought in 
under one of the above paragraphs. Any person desiring to import or 
bring a firearm into the United States under this paragraph shall file 
with the Director an application on Form 6 (Firearms), Application and 
Permit for Importation of Firearms, Ammunition and Implements of War, in 
triplicate, executed under the penalties of perjury. The application 
shall show the information required by subpart G of Part 478 of this 
chapter. A detailed explanation of why the importation of the firearm 
falls within the standards set out in this paragraph shall be attached 
to the application. The person seeking to import or bring in the firearm 
will be notified of the approval or disapproval of his application. If 
the application is approved, the original Form 6 (Firearms) will be 
returned to the applicant showing such approval and he will present the 
approved application, Form 6 (Firearms), to the Customs officer at the 
port of importation. The approval of an application to import a firearm 
shall be automatically terminated at the expiration of one year from the 
date of approval unless, upon request, it is further extended by the 
Director. If the firearm described in the approved application is not 
imported prior to the expiration of the approval, the Director shall be 
so notified. Customs officers will not permit release of a firearm from 
Customs custody, except for exportation, unless covered by an 
application which has been approved by the Director and which is 
currently effective. The importation or bringing in of a firearm not 
covered by an approved application may subject the person responsible to 
civil and criminal liabilities. (26 U.S.C. 5861, 5871, and 5872.)
    (b) Part 478 of this chapter also contains requirements and 
procedures for the importation of firearms into the United States. A 
firearm may not be imported into the United States under this part 
unless those requirements and procedures are also complied with by the 
person importing the firearm.
    (c) The provisions of this subpart shall not be construed as 
prohibiting the return to the United States or any territory under its 
control or jurisdiction of a firearm by a person who can establish to 
the satisfaction of Customs that (1) the firearm was taken out of the 
United States or any territory under its control or jurisdiction

[[Page 147]]

by such person, (2) the firearm is registered to that person, and (3) if 
appropriate, the authorization required by Part 478 of this chapter for 
the transportation of such a firearm in interstate or foreign commerce 
has been obtained by such person.

<R05>
Sec. 479.112  Registration of imported firearms.

    (a) Each importer shall file with the Director an accurate notice on 
Form 2 (Firearms), Notice of Firearms Manufactured or Imported, executed 
under the penalties of perjury, showing the importation of a firearm. 
The notice shall set forth the name and address of the importer, 
identify the importer's special (occupational) tax stamp and Federal 
firearms license, and show the import permit number, the date of release 
from Customs custody, the type, model, length of barrel, overall length, 
caliber, gauge or size, serial number, and other marks of identification 
of the firearm imported, and the place where the imported firearm will 
be kept. The Form 2 (Firearms) covering an imported firearm shall be 
filed by the importer no later than fifteen (15) days from the date the 
firearm was released from Customs custody. The importer shall prepare 
the notice, Form 2 (Firearms), in duplicate, file the original return as 
prescribed herein, and keep the copy with the records required by 
subpart I of this part at the premises covered by the special 
(occupational) tax stamp. The timely receipt by the Director of the 
notice, Form 2 (Firearms), and the timely receipt by the Director of the 
copy of Form 6A (Firearms), Release and Receipt of Imported Firearms, 
Ammunition and Implements of War, required by Sec. 478.112 of this 
chapter, covering the weapon reported on the Form 2 (Firearms) by the 
qualified importer, shall effectuate the registration of the firearm to 
the importer.
    (b) The requirements of this part relating to the transfer of a 
firearm are applicable to the transfer of imported firearms by a 
qualified importer or any other person.
    (c) Subject to compliance with the provisions of this part, an 
application, Form 6 (Firearms), to import a firearm by an importer or 
dealer qualified under this part, for use as a sample in connection with 
sales of such firearms to Federal, State or local governmental entities, 
will be approved if it is established by specific information attached 
to the application that the firearm is suitable or potentially suitable 
for use by such entities. Such information must show why a sales sample 
of a particular firearm is suitable for such use and the expected 
governmental customers who would require a demonstration of the firearm. 
Information as to the availability of the firearm to fill subsequent 
orders and letters from governmental entities expressing a need for a 
particular model or interest in seeing a demonstration of a particular 
firearm would establish suitability for governmental use. Applications 
to import more than one firearm of a particular model for use as a 
sample by an importer or dealer must also establish the importer's or 
dealer's need for the quantity of samples sought to be imported.
    (d) Subject to compliance with the provisions of this part, an 
application, Form 6 (Firearms), to import a firearm by an importer or 
dealer qualified under this part, for use as a sample in connection with 
sales of such firearms to Federal, State or local governmental entities, 
will be approved if it is established by specific information attached 
to the application that the firearm is particularly suitable for use by 
such entities. Such information must show why a sales sample of a 
particular firearm is suitable for such use and the expected 
governmental customers who would require a demonstration of the firearm. 
Information as to the availability of the firearm to fill subsequent 
orders and letters from governmental entities expressing a need for a 
particular model or interest in seeing a demonstration of a particular 
firearm would establish suitability for governmental use. Applications 
to import more than one firearm of a particular model for use as a 
sample by an importer or dealer must also establish the importer's or 
dealer's need for the

quantity of samples sought to be imported.

testing the firearm in connection with making a determination as to 
whether the importation or bringing in of such firearm will be 
authorized under this subpart. An application under this section shall 
be filed on Form 6 (Firearms), in triplicate, with the Director. The 
Director may impose conditions upon any importation under this section 
including a requirement that the firearm be shipped directly from 
Customs custody to the Director and that the person importing or 
bringing in the firearm must agree to either export the weapon or 
destroy it if a final determination is made that it may not be imported 
or brought in under this subpart. A firearm so imported or brought into 
the United States may be released from Customs custody in the manner 
prescribed by the conditional authorization of the Director.

Sec. 479.114  Application and permit for exportation of firearms.

    Any person desiring to export a firearm without payment of the 
transfer tax must file with the Director an application on Form 9 
(Firearms), Application and Permit for Exportation of Firearms, in 
quadruplicate, for a permit providing for deferment of tax liability. 
Part 1 of the application shall show the name and address of the foreign 
consignee, number of firearms covered by the application, the intended 
port of exportation, a complete description of each firearm to be 
exported, the name, address, State Department license number (or date of 
application if not issued), and identification of the special 
(occupational) tax stamp of the transferor. Part 1 of the application 
shall be executed under the penalties of perjury by the transferor and 
shall be supported by a certified copy of a written order or contract of 
sale or other evidence showing that the firearm is to be shipped to a 
foreign designation. Where it is desired to make a transfer free of tax 
to another person who in turn will export the firearm, the transferor 
shall likewise file an application supported by evidence that the 
transfer will start the firearm in course of exportation, except, 
however, that where such transferor and exporter are registered special-
taxpayers the transferor will not be required to file an application on 
Form 9 (Firearms).


<R05>
Sec. 479.115  Action by Director.

    If the application is acceptable, the Director will execute the 
permit, Part 2 of Form 9 (Firearms), to export the firearm described on 
the form and return three copies thereof to the applicant. Issuance of 
the permit by the Director will suspend assertion of tax liability for a 
period of six (6) months from the date of issuance. If the application 
is disapproved, the Director will indicate thereon the reason for such 
action and return the forms to the applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 479.116  Procedure by exporter.

    Shipment may not be made until the permit, Form 9 (Firearms), is 
received from the Director. If exportation is to be made by means other 
than by parcel post, two copies of the form must be addressed to the 
District Director of Customs at the port of exportation, and must 
precede or accompany the shipment in order to permit appropriate 
inspection prior to lading. If exportation is to be made by parcel post, 
one copy of the form must be presented to the postmaster at the office 
receiving the parcel who will execute Part 4 of such form and return the 
form to the exporter for transmittal to the Director. In the event 
exportation is not effected, all copies of the form must be immediately 
returned to the Director for cancellation.


<R05>
Sec. 479.117  Action by Customs.

    Upon receipt of a permit, Form 9 (Firearms), in duplicate, 
authorizing

[[Page 149]]

the exportation of firearms, the District Director of Customs may order 
such inspection as deemed necessary prior to lading of the merchandise. 
If satisfied that the shipment is proper and the information contained 
in the permit to export is in agreement with information shown in the 
shipper's export declaration, the District Director of Customs will, 
after the merchandise has been duly exported, execute the certificate of 
exportation (Part 3 of Form 9 (Firearms)). One copy of the form will be 
retained with the shipper's export declaration and the remaining copy 
thereof will be transmitted to the Director.


<R05>
Sec. 479.118  Proof of exportation.

    Within a six-month's period from date of issuance of the permit to 
export firearms, the exporter shall furnish or cause to be furnished to 
the Director (a) the certificate of exportation (Part 3 of Form 9 
(Firearms)) executed by the District Director of Customs as provided in 
Sec. 479.117, or (b) the certificate of mailing by parcel post (Part 4 
of Form 9 (Firearms)) executed by the postmaster of the post office 
receiving the parcel containing the firearm, or (c) a certificate of 
landing executed by a Customs officer of the foreign country to which 
the firearm is exported, or (d) a sworn statement of the foreign 
consignee covering the receipt of the firearm, or (e) the return 
receipt, or a reproduced copy thereof, signed by the addressee or his 
agent, where the shipment of a firearm was made by insured or registered 
parcel post. Issuance of a permit to export a firearm and furnishing of 
evidence establishing such exportation under this section will relieve 
the actual exporter and the person selling to the exporter for 
exportation from transfer tax liability. Where satisfactory evidence of 
exportation of a firearm is not furnished within the stated period, the 
transfer tax will be assessed.


<R05>
Sec. 479.119  Transportation of firearms to effect exportation.

    Notwithstanding any provision of Sec. 478.28 of this chapter, it 
shall not be required that authorization be obtained from the Director 
for the transportation in interstate or foreign commerce of a firearm in 
order to effect the exportation of a firearm authorized under the 
provisions of this subpart.

[T.D. ATF-270, 53 FR 10511, Mar. 31, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 479.120  Refunds.

    Where, after payment of tax by the manufacturer, a firearm is 
exported, and satisfactory proof of exportation (see Sec. 479.118) is 
furnished, a claim for refund may be submitted on Form 843 (see Sec. 
479.172). If the manufacturer waives all claim for the amount to be 
refunded, the refund shall be made to the exporter. A claim for refund 
by an exporter of tax paid by a manufacturer should be accompanied by 
waiver of the manufacturer and proof of tax payment by the latter.


<R05>
Sec. 479.121  Insular possessions.

    Transfers of firearms to persons in the insular possessions of the 
United States are exempt from transfer tax, provided title in cases 
involving change of title (and custody or control, in cases not 
involving change of title), does not pass to the transferee or his agent 
in the United States. However, such exempt transactions must be covered 
by approved permits and supporting documents corresponding to those 
required in the case of firearms exported to foreign countries (see 
Sec. Sec. 479.114 and 479.115), except that the Director may vary the 
requirements herein set forth in accordance with the requirements of the 
governing authority of the insular possession. Shipments to the insular 
possessions will not be authorized without compliance with the 
requirements of the governing authorities thereof. In the case of a 
nontaxable transfer to a person in such insular possession, the 
exemption extends only to such transfer and not to prior transfers.

                         Arms Export Control Act


<R05>
Sec. 479.122  Requirements.

    (a) Persons engaged in the business of importing firearms are

with the Director. (See Part 447 of this chapter.)
    (b) Persons engaged in the business of exporting firearms caliber 
.22 or larger

State. Application for such license should be made to the Office of 
Munitions Control, Department of State, Washington, DC 20502, prior to 
exporting firearms.

    For the purposes of this part, each manufacturer, importer, and 
dealer in firearms shall keep and maintain such records regarding the 
manufacture, importation, acquisition (whether by making, transfer, or 
otherwise), receipt, and disposition of firearms as are prescribed, and 
in the manner and place required, by part 478 of this chapter. In 
addition, each manufacturer, importer, and dealer shall maintain, in 
chronological order, at his place of business a separate record 
consisting of the documents required by this part showing the 
registration of any firearm to him. If firearms owned or possessed by a 
manufacturer, importer, or dealer are stored or kept on premises other 
than the place of business shown on his special (occupational) tax 
stamp, the record establishing registration shall show where such 
firearms are stored or kept. The records required by this part shall be 
readily accessible for inspection at all reasonable times by ATF 
officers.

destruction report the matter to the Director. The report will show in 
detail the circumstances of the theft, loss, or destruction and will 
include all known facts which may serve to identify the document. Upon 
receipt of the report, the Director will make such investigation as 
appears appropriate and may issue a duplicate document upon such 
conditions as the circumstances warrant.

refuse to make any such return within the time prescribed by this part 
or designated by the Director, then the return shall be made by an ATF 
officer upon inspection of the books, but the making of such return by 
an ATF officer shall not relieve the person from any default or penalty 
incurred by reason of failure to make such return.

Sec. 479.172  Refunds.

    As indicated in this part, the transfer tax or tax on the making of 
a firearm is ordinarily paid by the purchase and affixing of stamps, 
while special tax stamps are issued in payment of special (occupational) 
taxes. However, in exceptional cases, transfer tax, tax on the making of 
firearms, and/or special (occupational) tax may be paid pursuant to 
assessment. Claims for refunds of such taxes, paid pursuant to 
assessment, shall be filed on ATF Form 2635 (5620.8) within 3 years next 
after payment of the taxes. Such claims shall be filed with the regional 
director (compliance) serving the region in which the tax was paid. (For 
provisions relating to hand-carried documents and manner of filing, see 
26 CFR 301.6091-1(b) and 301.6402-2(a).) When an applicant to make or 
transfer a firearm wishes a refund of the tax paid on an approved 
application where the firearm was not made pursuant to an approved Form 
1 (Firearms) or transfer of the firearm did not take place pursuant to 
an approved Form 4 (Firearms), the applicant shall file a claim for 
refund of the tax on ATF Form 2635 (5620.8) with the Director. The claim 
shall be accompanied by the approved application bearing the stamp and 
an explanation why the tax liability was not incurred. Such claim shall 
be filed within 3 years next after payment of the tax.

or possesses explosive materials. An inference of current use may be 
drawn from evidence of a recent use or possession of a controlled 
substance or a pattern of use or possession that reasonably covers the 
present time, e.g., a conviction for use or possession of a controlled 
substance within the past year; multiple arrests for such offenses 
within the past 5 years if the most recent arrest occurred within the 
past year; or persons found through a drug test to use a controlled 
substance unlawfully, provided that the test was administered within the 
past year. For a current or former member of the Armed Forces, an 
inference of current use may be drawn from recent disciplinary or other 
administrative action based on confirmed drug use, e.g., court-martial 
conviction, nonjudicial punishment, or an administrative discharge based 
on drug use or drug rehabilitation failure.

<R05>
Sec. 555.22  Alternate methods or procedures; emergency variations 
from requirements.

    (a) Alternate methods or procedures. The permittee or licensee, on 
specific approval by the Director as provided by this paragraph, may use 
an alternate method or procedure in lieu of a method or procedure 
specifically prescribed in this part. The Director may approve an 
alternate method or procedure, subject to stated conditions, when he 
finds that:
    (1) Good cause is shown for the use of the alternate method or 
procedure;
    (2) The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and 
consistent with the effect intended by, the specifically prescribed 
method or procedure and that the alternate method or procedure is 
substantially equivalent to that specifically prescribed method or 
procedure; and
    (3) The alternate method or procedure will not be contrary to any 
provision of law and will not result in an increase in cost to the 
Government or hinder the effective administration of this part.

Where the permittee or licensee desires to employ an alternate method or 
procedure, he shall submit a written application to the regional 
director (compliance), for transmittal to the Director. The application 
shall specifically describe the proposed alternate method or procedure 
and shall set forth the reasons for it. Alternate methods or procedures 
may not be employed until the application is approved by the Director. 
The permittee or licensee shall, during the period of authorization of 
an alternate method or procedure, comply with the terms of the approved 
application. Authorization of any alternate method or procedure may be 
withdrawn whenever, in the judgment of the Director, the effective 
administration of this part is hindered by the continuation of the 
authorization. As used in this paragraph, alternate methods or 
procedures include alternate construction or equipment.
    (b) Emergency variations from requirements. The Director may approve 
construction, equipment, and methods of operation other than as 
specified in this part, where he finds that an emergency exists and the 
proposed variations from the specified requirements are necessary and 
the proposed variations:
    (1) Will afford security and protection that are substantially 
equivalent to those prescribed in this part;
    (2) Will not hinder the effective administration of this part; and
    (3) Will not be contrary to any provisions of law.

Variations from requirements granted under this paragraph are 
conditioned on compliance with the procedures, conditions, and 
limitations set forth in the approval of the application. Failure to 
comply in good faith with the procedures, conditions, and limitations 
shall automatically terminate the authority for the variations and the 
licensee or permittee shall fully comply with the prescribed 
requirements of regulations from which the variations were authorized. 
Authority for any variation may be withdrawn whenever, in the judgment 
of the Director, the effective administration of this part is hindered 
by the continuation of the variation. Where the licensee or permittee 
desires to employ an emergency variation, he shall submit a written 
application to the regional director (compliance) for transmittal to the 
Director. The application shall describe the proposed variation and set 
forth the reasons for it. Variations may not be employed until the 
application is approved, except

[[Page 162]]

when the emergency requires immediate action to correct a situation that 
is threatening to life or property. Corrective action may then be taken 
concurrent with the filing of the application and notification of the 
Director via telephone.
    (c) Retention of approved variations. The licensee or permittee

<R05>
Sec. 555.33  Background checks and clearances (effective May 24, 2003).

    (a) Background checks. (1) If the Director receives from a licensee 
or permittee the names and appropriate identifying information of 
responsible persons and employees who will be authorized by the employer 
to possess explosive materials in the course of employment with the 
employer, the Director will conduct a background check in accordance 
with this section.
    (2) The Director will determine whether the responsible person or 
employee is one of the persons described in any paragraph of section 
842(i) of the Act (see Sec. 555.26). In making such determination, the 
Director may take into account a letter or document issued under 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
    (3)(i) If the Director determines that the responsible person or the 
employee is not one of the persons described in any paragraph of section 
842(i) of the Act (see Sec. 555.26), the Director will notify the 
employer in writing or electronically of the determination and issue, to 
the responsible person or employee, as the case may be, a letter of 
clearance which confirms the determination.
    (ii) If the Director determines that the responsible person or 
employee is one of the persons described in any paragraph of section 
842(i) of the Act (see Sec. 555.26), ATF will notify the employer in 
writing or electronically of the determination and issue to the 
responsible person or the employee, as the case may be, a document that 
confirms the determination; explains the grounds for the determination; 
provides information on how the disability may be relieved; and explains 
how the determination may be appealed. The employer will retain the 
notification as part of his permanent records in accordance with Sec. 
555.121. The employer will take immediate steps to remove the 
responsible person from his position directing the management or 
policies of the business or operations as they relate to explosive 
materials or, as the case may be, to remove the employee from a position 
requiring the possession of explosive materials. Also, if the employer 
has listed the employee as a person authorized to accept delivery of 
explosive materials, as specified in Sec. 555.103 or Sec. 555.105, the 
employer must remove the employee from such list and immediately, and in 
no event later than the second business day

[[Page 166]]

after such change, notify distributors of such change.
    (b) Appeals and correction of erroneous system information. (1) In 
general. A responsible person or employee may challenge the adverse 
determination set out in the letter of denial, in writing and within 45 
days of issuance of the determination, by directing his or her challenge 
to the basis for the adverse determination, or to the accuracy of the 
record upon which the adverse determination is based, to the Director. 
The appeal request must include appropriate documentation or record(s) 
establishing the legal and/or factual basis for the challenge. Any 
record or document of a court or other government entity or official 
furnished in support of an appeal must be certified by the court or 
other government entity or official as a true copy. In the case of an 
employee, or responsible person who did not submit fingerprints, such 
appeal must be accompanied by two properly completed FBI Forms FD-258 
(fingerprint card). The Director will advise the individual in writing 
of his decision and the reasons for the decision.
    (2) Employees. The letter of denial, among other things, will advise 
an employee who elects to challenge an adverse determination to submit 
the fingerprint cards as described above. The employee also will be 
advised of the agency name and address that originated the record 
containing the information causing the adverse determination 
(``originating agency''). At that time, and where appropriate, an 
employee is encouraged to apply to the originating agency to challenge 
the accuracy of the record(s) upon which the denial is based. The 
originating agency may respond to the individual's application by 
addressing the individual's specific reasons for the challenge, and by 
indicating whether additional information or documents are required. If 
the record is corrected as a result of the application to the 
originating agency, the individual may so notify ATF which will, in 
turn, verify the record correction with the originating agency and take 
all necessary steps to contact the agency responsible for the record 
system and correct the record. The employee may provide to ATF 
additional and appropriate documentation or record(s) establishing the 
legal and/or factual basis for the challenge to ATF's decision to uphold 
the initial denial. If ATF does not receive such additional 
documentation or record(s) within 45 days of the date of the decision 
upholding the initial denial, ATF will close the appeal.
    (3) Responsible persons. The letter of denial, among other things, 
will advise a responsible person of the agency name and address which 
originated the record containing the information causing the adverse 
determination (``originating agency''). A responsible person who elects 
to challenge the adverse determination, where appropriate, is encouraged 
to apply to the originating agency to challenge the accuracy of the 
record(s) upon which the denial is based. The originating agency may 
respond to the individual's application by addressing the individual's 
specific reasons for the challenge, and by indicating whether additional 
information or documents are required. If the record is corrected as a 
result of the application to the originating agency, the individual may 
so notify ATF which will, in turn, verify the record correction with the 
originating agency and take all necessary steps to contact the agency 
responsible for the record system and correct the record. A responsible 
person may provide additional documentation or records as specified for 
employees in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

Sec. 555.62  State or other law.

    A license or permit issued under this part confers no right or 
privilege to conduct business or operations, including storage, contrary 
to State or other law. The holder of a license or permit issued under 
this part is not, by reason of the rights and privileges granted by that 
license or permit, immune from punishment for conducting an explosive 
materials business or operations in violation of the provisions of any 
State or other law. Similarly, compliance with the provisions of any 
State or other law affords no immunity under Federal law or regulations.

Sec. 555.63  Explosives magazine changes.

    (a) General. (1) The requirements of this section are applicable to 
magazines used for other than temporary (under 24 hours) storage of 
explosives.
    (2) A magazine is considered suitable for the storage of explosives 
if the construction requirements of this part are met during the time 
explosives are stored in the magazine.
    (3) A magazine is considered suitable for the storage of explosives 
if positioned in accordance with the applicable table of distances as 
specified in this part during the time explosives are stored in the 
magazine.

[[Page 176]]

    (4) For the purposes of this section, notification of the regional 
director (compliance) may be by telephone or in writing. However, if 
notification of the regional director (compliance) is in writing it must 
be at least three business days in advance of making changes in 
construction to an existing magazine or constructing a new magazine, and 
at least five business days in advance of using any reconstructed 
magazine or added magazine for the storage of explosives.
    (b) Exception. Mobile or portable type 5 magazines are exempt from 
the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, but must 
otherwise be in compliance with paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this 
section during the time explosives are stored in such magazines.
    (c) Changes in magazine construction. A licensee or permittee who 
intends to make changes in construction of an existing magazine shall 
notify the regional director (compliance) describing the proposed 
changes prior to making any changes. Unless otherwise advised by the 
regional director (compliance), changes in construction may commence 
after explosives are removed from the magazine. Explosives may not be 
stored in a reconstructed magazine before the regional director 
(compliance) has been notified in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section that the changes have been completed.
    (d) Magazines acquired or constructed after permit or license is 
issued. A licensee or permittee who intends to construct or acquire 
additional magazines shall notify the regional director (compliance) in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section describing the

Sec. 555.71  Opportunity for compliance.

    Except in cases of willfulness or those in which the public interest 
requires otherwise, and the regional director (compliance) so alleges in 
the notice of denial of an application or revocation of a license or 
permit, no license or permit will be revoked or renewal application 
denied without first calling to the attention of the licensee or 
permittee the reasons for the contemplated action and affording him an 
opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance with all lawful 
requirements and to submit facts, arguments, or proposals of adjustment. 
The notice of contemplated action, ATF F 5400.12, will afford the 
licensee or permittee 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice to 
respond. If no response is received within the 15 days, or if after 
consideration of relevant matters presented by the licensee or 
permittee, the regional director (compliance) finds that the licensee or 
permittee is not likely to abide by the law and regulations, he will 
proceed as provided in Sec. 555.74.

Sec. 555.72  Denial of initial application.

    Whenever the regional director (compliance) has reason to believe 
that an applicant for an original license or permit is not eligible to 
receive a license or permit under the provisions of Sec. 555.49, he 
shall issue a notice of denial on ATF F 5400.11. The notice will set 
forth the matters of fact and law relied upon in determining that the 
application should be denied, and will afford the applicant 15 days from 
the date of receipt of the notice in which to request a hearing to 
review the denial. If no request for a hearing is filed within that 
time, a copy of the application, marked ``Disapproved'', will be 
returned to the applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 555.73  Hearing after initial application is denied.

    If the applicant for an original license or permit desires a 
hearing, he

[[Page 177]]

shall file a request with the regional director (compliance) within 15 
days after receipt of the notice of denial. The request should include a 
statement of the reasons for a hearing. On receipt of the request, the 
regional director (compliance) shall refer the matter to an 
administrative law judge who shall set a time and place (see Sec. 
555.77) for a hearing and shall serve notice of the hearing upon the 
applicant and the regional director (compliance) at least 10 days in 
advance of the hearing date. The hearing will be conducted in accordance 
with the hearing procedures prescribed in part 71 of this chapter (see 
Sec. 555.82). Within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the 
hearing, and as expeditiously as possible, the administrative law judge 
shall render his recommended decision. He shall certify to the complete 
record of the proceedings before him and shall immediately forward the 
complete certified record, together with four copies of his recommended 
decision, to the regional director (compliance) for decision.


<R05>
Sec. 555.74  Denial of renewal application or revocation of license 
or permit.

    If following the opportunity for compliance under Sec. 555.71, or 
without opportunity for compliance under Sec. 555.71, as circumstances 
warrant, the regional director (compliance) finds that the licensee or 
permittee is not likely to comply with the law or regulations or is 
otherwise not eligible to continue operations authorized under his 
license or permit, the regional director (compliance) shall issue a 
notice of denial of the renewal application or revocation of the license 
or permit, ATF F 5400.11 or ATF F 5400.10, as appropriate. In either 
case, the notice will set forth the matters of fact constituting the 
violations specified, dates, places, and the sections of law and 
regulations violated. The notice will, in the case of revocation of a 
license or permit, specify the date on which the action is effective, 
which date will be on or after the date the notice is served on the 
licensee or permittee. The notice will also advise the licensee or 
permittee that he may, within 15 days after receipt of the notice, 
request a hearing and, if applicable, a stay of the effective date of 
the revocation of his license or permit.


<R05>
Sec. 555.75  Hearing after denial of renewal application or revocation 
of license or permit.

    If a licensee or permittee whose renewal application has been denied 
or whose license or permit has been revoked desires a hearing, he shall 
file a request for a hearing with the regional director (compliance). In 
the case of the revocation of a license or permit, he may include a 
request for a stay of the effective date of the revocation. On receipt 
of the request the regional director (compliance) shall advise the 
licensee or permittee whether the stay of the effective date of the 
revocation is granted. If the stay of the effective date of the 
revocation is granted, the regional director (compliance) shall refer 
the matter to an administrative law judge who shall set a time and place 
(see Sec. 555.77) for a hearing and shall serve notice of the hearing 
upon the licensee or permittee and the regional director (compliance) at 
least 10 days in advance of the hearing date. If the stay of the 
effective date of the revocation is denied, the licensee or permittee 
may request an immediate hearing. In this event, the regional director 
(compliance) shall immediately refer the matter to an administrative law 
judge who shall set a date and place for a hearing, which date shall be 
no later than 10 days from the date the licensee or permittee requested 
an immediate hearing. The hearing will be held in accordance with the 
applicable provisions of part 71 of this chapter. Within a reasonable 
time after the conclusion of the hearing, and as expeditiously as 
possible, the administrative law judge shall render his decision. He 
shall certify to the complete record of the proceeding before him and 
shall immediately forward the complete certified record, together with 
two copies of his decision, to the regional director (compliance), serve 
one copy of his decision on the licensee or permittee or his counsel, 
and transmit a copy to the attorney for the Government.

<R05>
Sec. 555.76  Action by regional director (compliance).

    (a) Initial application proceedings. If, upon receipt of the record 
and the recommended decision of the administrative law judge, the 
regional director (compliance) decides that the license or permit should 
be issued, the regional director (compliance) shall cause the 
application to be approved, briefly stating, for the record, his 
reasons. If he contemplates that the denial should stand, he shall serve 
a copy of the administrative law judge's recommended decision on the 
applicant, informing the applicant of his contemplated action and 
affording the applicant not more than 10 days in which to submit 
proposed findings and conclusions or exceptions to the recommended 
decision with supporting reasons. If the regional director (compliance), 
after consideration of the record of the hearing and of any proposed 
findings, conclusions, or exceptions filed with him by the applicant, 
approves the findings, conclusions and recommended decision of the 
administrative law judge, the regional director (compliance) shall cause 
the license or permit to be issued or disapproved the application 
accordingly. If he disapproves the findings, conclusions, and 
recommendation of the administrative law judge, in whole or in part, he 
shall by order make such findings and conclusions as in his opinion are 
warranted by the law and the facts in the record. Any decision of the 
regional director (compliance) ordering the disapproval of an initial 
application for a license or permit shall state the findings and 
conclusions upon which it is based, including his ruling upon each 
proposed finding, conclusion, and exception to the administrative law 
judge's recommended decision, together with a statement of his findings 
and conclusions, and reasons or basis for his findings and conclusions, 
upon all material issues of fact, law or discretion presented on the 
record. A signed duplicate original of the decision will be served upon 
the applicant and the original copy containing certificate of service 
will be placed in the official record of the proceedings. If the 
decision of the regional director (compliance) is in favor of the 
applicant, he shall issue the license or permit, to be effective on 
issuance.
    (b) Renewal application and revocation proceedings. Upon receipt of 
the complete certified records of the hearing, the regional director 
(compliance) shall enter an order confirming the revocation of the 
license or permit, or disapproving the application, in accordance with 
the administrative law judge's findings and decision, unless he 
disagrees with the findings and decision. A signed duplicate original of 
the order, ATF F 5400.9, will be served upon the licensee or permittee 
and the original copy containing certificate of service will be placed 
in the official record of the proceedings. If the regional director 
(compliance) disagrees with the findings and decision of the 
administrative law judge, he shall file a petition with the Director for 
review of the findings and decision, as provided in Sec. 555.79. In 
either case, if the renewal application denial is sustained, a copy of 
the application marked ``Disapproved'' will be returned to the 
applicant. If the renewal application denial is reversed, a license or 
permit will be issued to become effective on expiration of the license 
or permit being renewed, or on the date of issuance, whichever is later. 
If the proceedings involve the revocation of a license or permit which 
expired before a decision is in favor of the licensee or permittee, the 
regional director (compliance) shall:
    (1) If renewal application was timely filed and a stay of the 
effective date of the revocation was granted, cause to be issued a 
license or permit effective on the date of issuance;
    (2) If renewal application was not timely filed but a stay of the 
effective date of the revocation had been granted, request that a 
renewal application be filed and, following that, cause to be issued a 
license or permit to be effective on issuance; or
    (3) If a stay of the effective date of the revocation had not been 
granted, request that an application be filed as provided in Sec. 
555.45, and process it in the same manner as for an application for an 
original license or permit.
    (c) Curtailment of stay of revocation effective date. If, after 
approval of a request for a stay of the effective date of

[[Page 179]]

an order revoking a license or permit but before actions are completed 
under this subpart, the regional director (compliance) finds that it is 
contrary to the public interest for the licensee or permittee to 
continue the operations or activities covered by his license or permit, 
the regional director (compliance) may issue a notice of withdrawal of 
the approval, effective on the date of issuance. Notice of withdrawal 
will be served upon the licensee or permittee in the manner provided in 
Sec. 555.81.

with the U.S. Court of Appeals for judicial review. An appeal may be 
taken by the applicant, licensee, or permittee to the Director from a 
decision resulting from a hearing under Sec. 555.73 or Sec. 555.75. An 
appeal may also be taken by a regional director (compliance) from a 
decision resulting from a hearing under Sec. 555.75 as provided in 
Sec. 555.76(b). The appeal shall be taken by filing a petition for 
review on appeal with the Director within 15 days of the service of an 
administrative law judge's decision or an order. The petition will set 
forth facts tending to show (a) action of an arbitrary nature, (b)

Appeals for the district in which he resides or has his principal place 
of business. The Director, upon notification that a petition has been 
filed, shall have prepared a complete transcript of the record of the 
proceedings. The regional director (compliance) or the Director, as the 
case may be, shall certify to the correctness of the transcript of the 
record, forward one copy to the attorney for the Government in the 
review of the case, and file the original record of the proceedings with

Sec. 555.103  Transactions among licensees/permittees and transactions 
among licensees and holders of user permits.

    (a) Transactions among licensees/permittees prior to May 24, 2003. 
(1) General.

[[Page 181]]

(i) A licensed importer, licensed manufacturer or licensed dealer 
selling or otherwise distributing explosive materials (or a permittee 
disposing of surplus stock to a licensee or another permittee) who has 
the certified information required by this section may sell or 
distribute explosive materials to a licensee or permittee for not more 
than 45 days following the expiration date of the distributee's license 
or permit, unless the distributor knows or has reason to believe that 
the distributee's authority to continue business or operations under 
this part has been terminated.
    (ii) A licensed importer, licensed manufacturer or licensed dealer 
selling or otherwise distributing explosive materials (or a permittee 
disposing of surplus stock to another licensee or permittee) must verify 
the license or permit status of the distributee prior to the release of 
explosive materials ordered, as required by this section.
    (iii) Licensees or permittees desiring to return explosive materials 
to a licensed manufacturer may do so without obtaining a certified copy 
of the manufacturer's license.
    (iv) Where possession of explosive materials is transferred at the 
distributor's premises, the distributor must in all instances verify the 
identity of the person accepting possession on behalf of the distributee 
before relinquishing possession. Before the delivery at the 
distributor's premises of explosive materials to an employee of a 
licensee or permittee, or to an employee of a common or contract carrier 
transporting explosive materials to a licensee or permittee, the 
distributor delivering explosive materials must obtain an executed ATF F 
5400.8, Explosives Delivery Record, from the employee before releasing 
the explosive materials. The ATF F 5400.8 must contain all of the 
information required on the form and required by this part.

    Example 1. An ATF F 5400.8 is required when:
    a. An employee of the purchaser takes possession at the 
distributor's premises.
    b. An employee of a common or contract carrier hired by the 
purchaser takes possession at the distributor's premises.
    Example 2. An ATF F 5400.8 is not required when:
    a. An employee of the distributor takes possession of the explosives 
for the purpose of transport to the purchaser.
    b. An employee of a common or contract carrier hired by the 
distributor takes possession of the explosives for the purpose of 
transport to the purchaser.

    (2) License/permit verification of individuals. (i) The distributee 
must furnish a certified copy (or, in the case of a user-limited, the 
original) of the license or permit. The certified copy need be furnished 
only once during the current term of the license or permit. Also, a 
licensee need not furnish certified copies of licenses to other licensed 
locations operated by such licensee.
    (ii) The distributor may obtain any additional verification as the 
distributor deems necessary.
    (3) License/permit verification of business organizations. (i) A 
business organization may (in lieu of furnishing a certified copy of a 
license) furnish the distributor a certified list which contains the 
name, address, license number and date of license expiration of each 
licensed location. The certified list need be furnished only once during 
the current term of the license or permit. Also, a business organization 
need not furnish a certified list to other licensed locations operated 
by such business organization.
    (ii) A business organization must, prior to ordering explosive 
materials, furnish the licensee or permittee a current certified list of 
the representatives or agents authorized to order explosive materials on 
behalf of the business organization showing the name, address, and date 
and place of birth of each representative or agent. A licensee or 
permittee may not distribute explosive materials to a business 
organization on the order of a person who does not appear on the 
certified list of representatives or agents and, if the person does 
appear on the certified list, the licensee or permittee must verify the 
identity of such person.
    (4) Licensee/permittee certified statement. (i) A licensee or 
permittee ordering explosive materials from another licensee or 
permittee must furnish a current, certified statement of the intended 
use of the explosive materials, e.g., resale, mining, quarrying, 
agriculture, construction, sport rocketry,

[[Page 182]]

road building, oil well drilling, seismographic research, to the 
distributor.
    (ii) For individuals, the certified statement of intended use must 
specify the name, address, date and place of birth, and social security 
number of the distributee.
    (iii) For business organizations, the certified statement of 
intended use must specify the taxpayer identification number, the 
identity and the principal and local places of business.
    (iv) The licensee or permittee purchasing explosive materials must 
revise the furnished copy of the certified statement only when the 
information is no longer current.
    (5) User-limited permit transactions. A user-limited permit issued 
under the provisions of this part is valid for only a single purchase 
transaction and is not renewable (see Sec. 555.51). Accordingly, at the 
time a user-limited permittee orders explosive materials, the licensed 
distributor must write on the front of the user-limited permit the 
transaction date, his signature, and the distributor's license number 
prior to returning the permit to the user-limited permittee.
    (b) Transactions among licensees/permittees on and after May 24, 
2003. (1) General. (i) A licensed importer, licensed manufacturer or 
licensed dealer selling or otherwise distributing explosive materials 
(or a holder of a user permit disposing of surplus stock to a licensee; 
a holder of a user permit; or a holder of a limited permit who is within 
the same State as the distributor) who has the certified information 
required by this section may sell or distribute explosive materials to a 
licensee or permittee for not more than 45 days following the expiration 
date of the distributee's license or permit, unless the distributor 
knows or has reason to believe that the distributee's authority to 
continue business or operations under this part has been terminated.
    (ii) A licensed importer, licensed manufacturer or licensed dealer 
selling or otherwise distributing explosive materials (or a holder of a 
user permit disposing of surplus stock to another licensee or permittee) 
must verify the license or permit status of the distributee prior to the 
release of explosive materials ordered, as required by this section.
    (iii) Licensees or permittees desiring to return explosive materials 
to a licensed manufacturer may do so without obtaining a certified copy 
of the manufacturer's license.
    (2) Verification of license/user permit. (i) Prior to or with the 
first order of explosive materials, the distributee must provide the 
distributor a certified copy (or, in the case of a user-limited, the 
original) of the distributee's license or user permit. However, 
licensees or holders of user permits that are business organizations may 
(in lieu of a certified copy of a license or user permit) provide the 
distributor with a certified list that contains the name, address, 
license or user permit number, and date of the license or user permit 
expiration of each location.
    (ii) The distributee must also provide the distributor with a 
current list of the names of persons authorized to accept delivery of 
explosive materials on behalf of the distributee. The distributee 
ordering explosive materials must keep the list current and provide 
updated lists to licensees and holders of user permits on a timely 
basis. A distributor may not transfer possession of explosive materials 
to any person whose name does not appear on the current list of names of 
persons authorized to accept delivery of explosive materials on behalf 
of the distributee. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section, in all instances the distributor must verify the identity of 
the distributee, or the employee of the distributee accepting possession 
of explosive materials on behalf of the distributee, by examining an 
identification document (as defined in Sec. 555.11) before 
relinquishing possession.
    (iii) A licensee or holder of a user permit ordering explosive 
materials from another licensee or permittee must provide to the 
distributor a current, certified statement of the intended use of the 
explosive materials, e.g., resale, mining, quarrying, agriculture, 
construction, sport rocketry, road building, oil well drilling, 
seismographic research, etc.
    (A) For individuals, the certified statement of intended use must 
specify the name, address, date and place of

[[Page 183]]

birth, and social security number of the distributee.
    (B) For business organizations, the certified statement of intended 
use must specify the taxpayer identification number, the identity and 
the principal and local places of business.
    (C) The licensee or holder of a user permit purchasing explosive 
materials must revise the furnished copy of the certified statement only 
when the information is no longer current.
    (3) Delivery of explosive materials by common or contract carrier. 
When a common or contract carrier will transport explosive materials 
from a distributor to a distributee who is a licensee or holder of a 
user permit, the distributor must take the following actions before 
relinquishing possession of the explosive materials:
    (i) Verify the identity of the person accepting possession for the 
common or contract carrier by examining such person's valid, unexpired 
driver's license issued by any State, Canada, or Mexico; and
    (ii) Record the name of the common or contract carrier (i.e., the 
name of the driver's employer) and the full name of the driver. This 
information must be maintained in the distributor's permanent records in 
accordance with Sec. 555.121.
    (4) User-limited permit transactions. A user-limited permit issued 
under the provisions of this part is valid for only a single purchase 
transaction and is not renewable (see Sec. 555.51). Accordingly, at the 
time a user-limited permittee orders explosive materials, the licensed 
distributor must write on the front of the user-limited permit the 
transaction date, his signature, and the distributor's license number 
prior to returning the permit to the user-limited permittee.

Sec. 555.105  Distributions to nonlicensees, nonpermittees, and limited 
permittees.

    (a) Distributions to nonlicensees and nonpermittees prior to May 24, 
2003. (1) This section will apply in any case where distribution of 
explosive materials to the distributee is not otherwise prohibited by 
the Act or this part.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a 
licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer may 
distribute explosive materials to a nonlicensee or nonpermittee if the 
nonlicensee or nonpermittee is a resident of the same State in which the 
licensee's business premises are located, and the nonlicensee or 
nonpermittee furnishes to the licensee the explosives transaction 
record, ATF F 5400.4, required by Sec. 555.126. Disposition of ATF F 
5400.4 will be made in accordance with Sec. 555.126.

[[Page 184]]

    (3) A licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer 
may sell or distribute explosive materials to a resident of a State 
contiguous to the State in which the licensee's place of business is 
located if the purchaser's State of residence has enacted legislation, 
currently in force, specifically authorizing a resident of that State to 
purchase explosive materials in a contiguous State and the purchaser and 
the licensee have, prior to the distribution of the explosive materials, 
complied with all the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(5), and 
(a)(6) of this section applicable to intrastate transactions occurring 
on the licensee's business premises.
    (4) A permittee may dispose of surplus stocks of explosive materials 
to a nonlicensee or nonpermittee if the nonlicensee or nonpermittee is a 
resident of the same State in which the permittee's business premises or 
operations are located, or is a resident of a State contiguous to the 
State in which the permittee's place of business or operations are 
located, and if the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(5), 
and (a)(6) of this section are fully met.
    (5) A licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer 
selling or otherwise distributing explosive materials to a business 
entity must verify the identity of the representative or agent of the 
business entity who is authorized to order explosive materials on behalf 
of the business entity. Each business entity ordering explosive 
materials must furnish the distributing licensee prior to or with the 
first order of explosive materials a current certified list of the names 
of representatives or agents authorized to order explosive materials on 
behalf of the business entity. The business entity ordering explosive 
materials is responsible for keeping the certified list current. A 
licensee may not distribute explosive materials to a business entity on 
the order of a person whose name does not appear on the certified list.
    (6) Where the possession of explosive materials is transferred at 
the distributor's premises, the distributor must in all instances verify 
the identity of the person accepting possession on behalf of the 
distributee before relinquishing possession. Before the delivery at the 
distributor's premises of explosive materials to an employee of a 
nonlicensee or nonpermittee, or to an employee of a common or contract 
carrier transporting explosive materials to a nonlicensee or 
nonpermittee, the distributor delivering explosive materials must obtain 
an executed ATF F 5400.8 from the employee before releasing the 
explosive materials. The ATF F 5400.8 must contain all of the 
information required on the form and by this part. (See examples in 
Sec. 555.103(a)).
    (7) A licensee or permittee disposing of surplus stock may sell or 
distribute commercially manufactured black powder in quantities of 50 
pounds or less to a nonlicensee or nonpermittee if the black powder is 
intended to be used solely for sporting, recreational, or cultural 
purposes in antique firearms as defined in 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(16), or in 
antique devices as exempted from the term ``destructive device'' in 18 
U.S.C. 921(a)(4).
    (b) Distributions to holders of limited permits on and after May 24, 
2003. (1) This section will apply in any case where distribution of 
explosive materials to the distributee is not otherwise prohibited by 
the Act or this part.
    (2) A licensed importer, licensed manufacturer or a licensed dealer 
may distribute explosive materials to a holder of a limited permit if 
such permittee is a resident of the same State in which the licensee's 
business premises are located, the holder of the limited permit presents 
in person or by mail ATF Form 5400.4, Limited Permittee Transaction 
Report (LPTR), and the licensee completes Form 5400.4 in accordance with 
Sec. 555.126(b). In no event will a licensee distribute explosive 
materials to a holder of a limited permit unless the holder presents a 
Form 5400.4 with an original unaltered and unexpired Intrastate Purchase 
of Explosives Coupon (IPEC), ATF Form 5400.30, affixed. The coupon must 
bear the name, address, permit number, and the coupon number of the 
limited permittee seeking distribution of the explosives.
    (3) A holder of a limited permit is authorized to receive explosive 
materials from a licensee or permittee whose premises are located in the 
same State of residence in which the premises of

[[Page 185]]

the holder of the limited permit are located on no more than 6 separate 
occasions during the one-year period of the permit. For purposes of this 
section, the term ``6 separate occasions'' means six deliveries of 
explosive materials. Each delivery must--
    (i) Relate to a single purchase transaction made on one ATF F 
5400.4;
    (ii) Be referenced on one commercial invoice or purchase order; and
    (iii) Be delivered to the holder of the limited permit in one 
shipment delivered at the same time.
    (4) A holder of a user permit may dispose of surplus stocks of 
explosive materials to a licensee or holder of a user permit, or a 
holder of a limited permit who is a resident of the same State in which 
the premises of the holder of the user permit are located. A holder of a 
limited permit may dispose of surplus stocks of explosive materials to 
another holder of a limited permit who is a resident of the same State 
in which the premises of the distributor are located, if the transaction 
complies with the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section and 
Sec. 555.126(b). A holder of a limited permit may also dispose of 
surplus stocks of explosive materials to a licensee or holder of a user 
permit if the disposition occurs in the State of residence of the holder 
of the limited permit. (See Sec. 555.103.)
    (5) Each holder of a limited permit ordering explosive materials 
must furnish the distributing licensee prior to or with the first order 
of the explosive materials a current list of the names of employees 
authorized to accept delivery of explosive materials on behalf of the 
limited permittee. The distributee ordering explosive materials must 
keep the list current and provide updated lists to licensees and holders 
of user permits on a timely basis. A licensed importer, licensed 
manufacturer, licensed dealer, or permittee, selling or otherwise 
distributing explosive materials to a holder of a limited permit must, 
prior to delivering the explosive materials, obtain from the limited 
permittee a current list of persons who are authorized to accept 
deliveries of explosive materials on behalf of the limited permittee. A 
licensee or permittee may not deliver explosive materials to a person 
whose name does not appear on the list.
    (6)(i) Delivery at the distributor's premises. Where possession of 
explosive materials is transferred directly to the distributee at the 
distributor's premises, the distributor must obtain an executed Form 
5400.4 in accordance with Sec. 555.126(b) and must in all instances 
verify the identity of the person accepting possession on behalf of the 
distributee by examining an identification document (as defined in Sec. 
555.11) before relinquishing possession.
    (ii) Delivery by distributor. Where possession of explosive 
materials is transferred by the distributor to the distributee away from 
the distributor's premises, the distributor must obtain an executed Form 
5400.4 in accordance with Sec. 555.126(b) and must in all instances 
verify the identity of the person accepting possession on behalf of the 
distributee by examining an identification document (as defined in Sec. 
555.11) before relinquishing possession.
    (iii) Delivery by common or contract carrier hired by the 
distributor. Where a common or contract carrier hired by the distributor 
will transport explosive materials from the distributor to a holder of a 
limited permit:
    (A) The limited permittee must, prior to delivery of the explosive 
materials, complete the appropriate section on Form 5400.4, affix to the 
Form 5400.4 one of the six IPECs he has been issued, and provide the 
form to the distributor in person or by mail.
    (B) The distributor must, before relinquishing possession of the 
explosive materials to the common or contract carrier:
    (1) Verify the identity of the person accepting possession for the 
common or contract carrier by examining such person's valid, unexpired 
driver's license issued by any State, Canada, or Mexico; and
    (2) Record the name of the common or contract carrier (i.e., the 
name of the driver's employer) and the full name of the driver. This 
information must be maintained in the distributor's permanent records in 
accordance with Sec. 555.121.

[[Page 186]]

    (C) At the time of delivery of the explosive materials, the common 
or contract carrier, as agent for the distributor, must verify the 
identity of the person accepting delivery on behalf of the distributee, 
note the type and number of the identification document (as defined in 
Sec. 555.11) and provide this information to the distributor. The 
distributor must enter this information in the appropriate section on 
Form 5400.4.
    (iv) Delivery by common or contract carrier hired by the 
distributee. Where a common or contract carrier hired by the distributee 
will transport explosive materials from the distributor to a holder of a 
limited permit:
    (A) The limited permittee must, prior to delivery of the explosive 
materials, complete the appropriate section on Form 5400.4, affix to the 
Form 5400.4 one of the six IPECs he has been issued, and provide the 
form to the distributor in person or by mail.
    (B) Before the delivery at the distributor's premises to the common 
or contract carrier who will transport explosive materials to the holder 
of a limited permit, the distributor must:
    (1) Verify the identity of the person accepting possession for the 
common or contract carrier by examining such person's valid, unexpired 
driver's license issued by any State, Canada, or Mexico; and
    (2) Record the name of the common or contract carrier (i.e., the 
name of the driver's employer) and the full name of the driver. This 
information must be maintained in the distributor's permanent records in 
accordance with Sec. 555.121.
    (7) A licensee or permittee disposing of surplus stock may sell or 
distribute commercially manufactured black powder in quantities of 50 
pounds or less to a holder of a limited permit, nonlicensee, or 
nonpermittee if the black powder is intended to be used solely for 
sporting, recreational, or cultural purposes in antique firearms as 
defined in 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(16), or in antique devices as exempted from 
the term ``destructive device'' in 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(4).

Sec. 555.207  Construction of type 1 magazines.

    A type 1 magazine is a permanent structure: a building, an igloo or 
``Army-type structure'', a tunnel, or a dugout. It is to be bullet-
resistant, fire-resistant, weather-resistant, theft-resistant, and 
ventilated.
    (a) Buildings. All building type magazines are to be constructed of 
masonry, wood, metal, or a combination of these materials, and have no 
openings except for entrances and ventilation. The ground around 
building magazines must slope away for drainage or other adequate 
drainage provided.

[[Page 204]]

    (1) Masonry wall construction. Masonry wall construction is to 
consist of brick, concrete, tile, cement block, or cinder block and be 
not less than 6 inches in thickness. Hollow masonry units used in 
construction must have all hollow spaces filled with well-tamped, 
coarse, dry sand or weak concrete (at least a mixture of one part cement 
and eight parts of sand with enough water to dampen the mixture while 
tamping in place). Interior walls are to be constructed of, or covered 
with, a nonsparking material.
    (2) Fabricated metal wall construction. Metal wall construction is 
to consist of sectional sheets of steel or aluminum not less than number 
14-gauge, securely fastened to a metal framework. Metal wall 
construction is either lined inside with brick, solid cement blocks, 
hardwood not less than four inches thick, or will have at least a six 
inch sand fill between interior and exterior walls. Interior walls are 
to be constructed of, or covered with, a nonsparking material.
    (3) Wood frame wall construction. The exterior of outer wood walls 
is to be covered with iron or aluminum not less than number 26-gauge. An 
inner wall of, or covered with nonsparking material will be constructed 
so as to provide a space of not less than six inches between the outer 
and inner walls. The space is to be filled with coarse, dry sand or weak 
concrete.
    (4) Floors. Floors are to be constructed of, or covered with, a 
nonsparking material and shall be strong enough to bear the weight of 
the maximum quantity to be stored. Use of pallets covered with a 
nonsparking material is considered equivalent to a floor constructed of 
or covered with a nonsparking material.
    (5) Foundations. Foundations are to be constructed of brick, 
concrete, cement block, stone, or wood posts. If piers or posts are 
used, in lieu of a continuous foundation, the space under the buildings 
is to be enclosed with metal.
    (6) Roof. Except for buildings with fabricated metal roofs, the 
outer roof is to be covered with no less than number 26-guage iron or 
aluminum, fastened to at least \7/8\ inch sheathing.
    (7) Bullet-resistant ceilings or roofs. Where it is possible for a 
bullet to be fired directly through the roof and into the magazine at 
such an angle that the bullet would strike the explosives within, the 
magazine is to be protected by one of the following methods:
    (i) A sand tray lined with a layer of building paper, plastic, or 
other nonporous material, and filled with not less than four inches of 
coarse, dry sand, and located at the tops of inner walls covering the 
entire ceiling area, except that portion necessary for ventilation.
    (ii) A fabricated metal roof constructed of \3/16\-inch plate steel 
lined with four inches of hardwood. (For each additional \1/16\ inch of 
plate steel, the hardwood lining may be decreased one inch.)
    (8) Doors. All doors are to be constructed of not less than \1/4\ 
inch plate steel and lined with at least two inches of hardwood. Hinges 
and hasps are to be attached to the doors by welding, riveting or 
bolting (nuts on inside of door). They are to be installed in such a 
manner that the hinges and hasps cannot be removed when the doors are 
closed and locked.
    (9) Locks. Each door is to be equipped with (i) two mortise locks; 
(ii) two padlock fastened in separate hasps and staples; (iii) a 
combination of a mortise lock and a padlock; (iv) a mortise lock that 
requires two keys to open; or (v) a three-point lock. Padlocks must have 
at least five tumblers and a casehardened shackle of at least \3/8\ inch 
diameter. Padlocks must be protected with not less than \1/4\ inch steel 
hoods constructed so as to prevent sawing or lever action on the locks, 
hasps, and staples. These requirements do not apply to magazine doors 
that are adequately secured on the inside by means of a bolt, lock, or 
bar that cannot be actuated from the outside.
    (10) Ventilation. Ventilation is to be provided to prevent dampness 
and heating of stored explosive materials. Ventilation openings must be 
screened to prevent the entrance of sparks. Ventilation openings in side 
walls and foundations must be offset or shielded

[[Page 205]]

for bullet-resistant purposes. Magazines having foundation and roof 
ventilators with the air circulating between the side walls and the 
floors and between the side walls and the ceiling must have a wooden 
lattice lining or equivalent to prevent the packages of explosive 
materials from being stacked against the side walls and blocking the air 
circulation.
    (11) Exposed metal. No sparking material is to be exposed to contact 
with the stored explosive materials. All ferrous metal nails in the 
floor and side walls, which might be exposed to contact with explosive 
materials, must be blind nailed, countersunk, or covered with a 
nonsparking lattice work or other nonsparking material.
    (b) Igloos, ``Army-type structures'', tunnels, and dugouts. Igloo, 
``Army-type structure'', tunnel, and dugout magazines are to be 
constructed of reinforced concrete, masonry, metal, or a combination of 
these materials. They must have an earthmound covering of not less than 
24 inches on the top, sides and rear unless the magazine meets the 
requirements of paragraph (a)(7) of this section. Interior walls and 
floors must be constructed of, or covered with, a nonsparking material. 
Magazines of this type are also to be constructed in conformity with the

 Table: American Table of Distances for Storage of Explosives (December 
      1910), as Revised and Approved by the Institute of Makers of 
                         Explosives--July, 1991.

        Notes to the Table of Distances for Storage of Explosives

    (1) Terms found in the table of distances for storage of explosive 
materials are defined in Sec. 555.11.
    (2) When two or more storage magazines are located on the same 
property, each magazine must comply with the minimum distances specified 
from inhabited buildings, railways, and highways, and, in addition, they 
should be separated from each other by not less than the distances shown 
for ``Separation of Magazines,'' except that the quantity of explosives 
contained in cap magazines shall govern in regard to the spacing of said 
cap magazines from magazines containing other explosives. If any two or 
more magazines are separated from each other by less than the specified 
``Separation of Magazines'' distances, then such two or more magazines, 
as a group, must be considered as one magazine, and the total quantity 
of explosives stored in such group must be treated as if stored in a 
single magazine located on the site of any magazine of the group, and 
must comply with the minimum of distances specified from other 
magazines, inhabited buildings, railways, and highways.
    (3) All types of blasting caps in strengths through No. 8 cap should 
be rated at 1\1/2\ lbs. (1.5 lbs.) of explosives per 1,000 caps. For 
strengths higher than No. 8 cap, consult the manufacturer.
    (4) For quantity and distance purposes, detonating cord of 50 or 60 
grains per foot should be calculated as equivalent to 9 lbs. of high 
explosives per 1,000 feet. Heavier or lighter core loads should be rated 
proportionately.

Notes of Table of Separation Distances of Ammonium Nitrate and Blasting 
                Agents From Explosives or Blasting Agents

    (1) This table specifies separation distances to prevent explosion 
of ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrate-based blasting agents by 
propagation from nearby stores of high explosives or blasting agents 
referred to in the table as the ``donor.'' Ammonium nitrate, by itself, 
is not considered to be a donor when applying this table. Ammonium 
nitrate, ammonium nitrate-fuel oil or combinations thereof are 
acceptors. If stores of ammonium nitrate are located within the 
sympathetic detonation distance of explosives or blasting agents, one-
half the mass of the ammonium nitrate is to be included in the mass of 
the donor.
    (2) When the ammonium nitrate and/or blasting agent is not 
barricaded, the distances shown in the table must be multiplied by six. 
These distances allow for the possibility of high velocity metal 
fragments from mixers, hoppers, truck bodies, sheet metal structures, 
metal containers, and the like which may enclose the ``donor.'' Where 
explosives storage is in bullet-resistant magazines or where the storage 
is protected by a bullet-resistant wall, distances and barricade 
thicknesses in excess of those prescribed in the table in Sec. 555.218 
are not required.
    (3) These distances apply to ammonium nitrate that passes the 
insensitivity test prescribed in the definition of ammonium nitrate 
fertilizer issued by the Fertilizer Institute.\1\ Ammonium nitrate 
failing to pass the test must be stored at separation distances in 
accordance with the table in Sec. 555.218.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Definition and Test Procedures for Ammonium Nitrate Fertilizer, 
Fertilizer Institute 1015-18th St. N.W. Washington, DC 20036.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (4) These distances apply to blasting agents which pass the 
insensitivity test prescribed in regulations of the U.S. Department of 
Transportation (49 CFR part 173).
    (5) Earth or sand dikes, or enclosures filled with the prescribed 
minimum thickness of earth or sand are acceptable artificial barricades. 
Natural barricades, such as hills or timber of sufficient density that 
the surrounding exposures which require protection cannot be seen from 
the ``donor'' when the trees are bare of leaves, are also acceptable.
    (6) For determining the distances to be maintained from inhabited 
buildings, passenger railways, and public highways, use the table in 
Sec. 555.218.

Sec. 555.221  Requirements for display fireworks, pyrotechnic compositions, 
and explosive materials used in assembling fireworks or articles pyrotechnic.

    (a) Display fireworks, pyrotechnic compositions, and explosive 
materials used to assemble fireworks and articles pyrotechnic shall be 
stored at all times as required by this Subpart unless they are in the 
process of manufacture, assembly, packaging, or are being transported.
    (b) No more than 500 pounds (227 kg) of pyrotechnic compositions or 
explosive materials are permitted at one time in any fireworks mixing 
building, any building or area in which the pyrotechnic compositions or 
explosive materials are pressed or otherwise prepared for finishing or 
assembly, or any finishing or assembly building. All pyrotechnic 
compositions or explosive materials not in immediate use will be stored 
in covered, non-ferrous containers.
    (c) The maximum quantity of flash powder permitted in any fireworks 
process building is 10 pounds (4.5 kg).
    (d) All dry explosive powders and mixtures, partially assembled 
display fireworks, and finished display fireworks shall be removed from 
fireworks process buildings at the conclusion of a day's operations and 
placed in approved magazines.

\3\ While consumer fireworks or articles pyrotechnic in a finished state
  are not subject to regulation, explosive materials used to manufacture
  or assemble such fireworks or articles are subject to regulation.
  Thus, fireworks process buildings where consumer fireworks or articles
  pyrotechnic are being processed shall meet these requirements.
\4\ A maximum of 500 pounds of in-process pyrotechnic compositions,
  either loose or in partially-assembled fireworks, is permitted in any
  fireworks process building. Finished display fireworks may not be
  stored in a fireworks process building.
\5\ A maximum of 10 pounds of flash powder, either in loose form or in
  assembled units, is permitted in any fireworks process building.
  Quantities in excess of 10 pounds must be kept in an approved
  magazine.
