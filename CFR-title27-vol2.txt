                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, April 1, 2002), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

                            Distilled Spirits


<R05>
Sec. 251.40  Distilled spirits.

    (a) A tax is imposed on all distilled spirits in customs bonded 
warehouses or imported into the United States at the rate prescribed by 
26 U.S.C. 5001 on each proof gallon and a proportionate tax at a like 
rate on all fractional

[[Page 9]]

parts of each proof gallon. All products of distillation, by whatever 
name known, which contain distilled spirits, are considered to be 
distilled spirits and are taxed as such. The tax will be determined at 
the time of importation, or, if entered into bond, at the time of 
withdrawal therefrom.
    (b) A credit against the tax imposed on distilled spirits by 26 
U.S.C. 5001 is allowable under 26 U.S.C. 5010 on each proof gallon of 
alcohol derived from eligible wine or from eligible flavors which do not 
exceed 2\1/2\ percent of the finished product on a proof gallon basis. 
The credit is allowable at the time the tax is payable as if it 
constituted a reduction in the rate of tax.
    (c) Where credit against the tax is desired, the person liable for 
the tax shall establish an effective tax rate in accordance with 
Sec. 251.40a. The effective tax rate established will be applied to each 
entry.

<R05>
Sec. 251.41  Computation of effective tax rate.

    (a) The proprietor shall compute the effective tax rate for 
distilled spirits containing eligible wine or eligible flavors as the 
ratio of the numerator and denominator as follows:
    (1) The numerator will be the sum of:
    (i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product 
(exclusive of distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors), 
multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001;
    (ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, 
multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5041(b)(1), (2), or 
(3), as applicable; and
    (iii) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits derived from 
eligible flavors used in the product, multiplied by the tax rate 
prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001, but only to the extent that such distilled 
spirits exceed 2\1/2\% of the denominator prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section.
    (2) The denominator will be the sum of:
    (i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product, 
including distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors; and
    (ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, 
multiplied by twice the percentage of alcohol by volume of each, divided 
by 100.
    (b) In determining the effective tax rate, quantities of distilled 
spirits, eligible wine, and eligible flavors will be expressed to the 
nearest tenth of a proof gallon. The effective tax rate may be rounded 
to as many decimal places as the proprietor deems appropriate, provided 
that, such rate is expressed no less exactly than the rate rounded to 
the nearest whole cent, and the effective tax rates for all products 
will be consistently expressed to the same number of decimal places. In 
such case, if the number is less than five it will be dropped; if it is 
five or over, a unit will be added.
    (c) The following is an example of the use of the formula.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Proof gallons by which distilled spirits derived from eligible 
flavors exceed 2\1/2\% of the total proof gallons in the batch (100.9 - 
(2\1/2\%) x 3.371.8 = 16.6).

                              BATCH RECORD
Distilled spirits..............................    2249.1 proof gallons.
Eligible wine (14% alcohol by volume)..........     2265.0 wine gallons.
Eligible wine (19% alcohol by volume)..........     1020.0 wine gallons.
Eligible flavors...............................     100.9 proof gallons.

Sec. 251.48a  Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.

    (a) Each importer who was liable, during a calendar year, for a 
gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in distilled 
spirits taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and 
parts 19 and 26 of this chapter, a gross amount equal to or exceeding 
five million dollars in wine taxes combining tax liabilities incurred 
under this part and parts 24 and 26 of this chapter, or a gross amount 
equal to or exceeding five million dollars in beer taxes combining tax 
liabilities incurred under this part and parts 25 and 26 of this 
chapter, shall use a commercial bank in making payment by electronic 
fund transfer (EFT), as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, of 
such taxes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment of such taxes by 
cash, check, or money order is not authorized for an importer who is 
required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. For purposes of 
this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is to be summarized 
separately for distilled spirits taxes, wine taxes, or beer taxes, and 
is defined as the gross tax liability on all taxable withdrawals from 
premises in the United States and importations (including products of 
the same tax class brought into the United States from Puerto Rico or 
the Virgin Islands) during the calendar year, without regard to any 
drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises from which such 
activities are conducted by the taxpayer.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a 
controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and 
implementing regulations in

[[Page 12]]

26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except that the words ``at least 80 
percent'' shall be replaced by the words ``more than 50 percent'' in 
each place it appears in subsection (a) of 26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in 
the implementing regulations. Also, the rules for a ``controlled group 
of corporations'' apply in a similar fashion to groups which include 
partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more 
than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or 
more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of 
the controlled group are one taxpayer for the purpose of determining who 
is required to make remittances by EFT.
    (c) Electronic fund transfer or EFT means any transfer of funds, 
other than a transaction originated by check, draft, or similar paper 
instrument, which is initiated through an electronic terminal, 
telephonic instrument, or computer of magnetic tape, so as to order, 
instruct, or authorize a financial institution to either debit or credit 
an account, in accordance with procedures established by the U.S. 
Customs Service.
    (d) An importer who is required by this section to make remittances 
by EFT shall make the EFT remittance in accordance with the requirements 
of the U.S. Customs Service.

the approval from the person to whom it was issued and, over the 
signature of the importer or other duly authorized person, place the 
following declaration:

I declare under the penalties of perjury that this approval has been

effective tax rate established for this product is applicable to all 
like products contained in this shipment.

by the appropriate ATF officer. The importer shall file or furnish a 
copy of the standard effective tax rate approval in the manner 
prescribed in Sec. 251.76(d). The use of a standard effective tax rate

due. The appropriate ATF officer may at any time require an importer to 
immediately discontinue the use of a standard effective tax rate.

    (2) If a Government agency intends to withdraw spirits free of tax 
under this part and part 22 of this chapter, Form 5150.33 may be 
annotated to cover both types of withdrawals.
    (3) A separate permit is not required for each port of entry. The 
application, Form 5150.33, may be completed to indicate the applicable 
ports of entry in which spirits will be withdrawn from customs custody.
    (4) A Government agency may specify on its application that it 
desires a single permit authorizing all sub-agencies under its control 
to procure and withdraw spirits free of tax under this subpart and 
subpart N of part 22 of this chapter; or, each Government location may 
individually file an application for a permit, Form 5150.33.
    (5) Each application for a permit shall be signed by the head of the 
agency or sub-agency, or the incumbent of an office which is authorized 
by the head of the agency or sub-agency, to sign. Evidence of 
authorization to sign on behalf of the head of an agency or sub-agency 
shall be furnished with the application.
    (c) Use of spirits. Spirits withdrawn under this subpart may not be 
used for non-Government purposes.

    (a) Application. An importer who desires to use an alternate method 
or procedure in lieu of a method or procedure prescribed by this part 
must file an application, in triplicate, with the appropriate ATF 
officer. Each application must:
    (1) Specify the name, address, and permit number of the importer to 
which it relates;
    (2) State the purpose for which filed; and
    (3) Specifically describe the alternate method or procedure and set

[[Page 22]]


No alternate method or procedure relating to the assessment, payment, or

    (b) Approval. When an application for use of an alternate method or 
procedure is received, the appropriate ATF officer must determine 
whether approval thereof would unduly hinder the effective 
administration of this part or would result in jeopardy to the revenue. 
The appropriate ATF officer may approve the alternate method or 
procedure if such officer finds that:
    (1) Good cause has been shown for the use of the alternate method or 
procedure;
    (2) The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and 
consistent with the effect intended by, the specifically prescribed 
method or procedure, and affords equivalent security to the revenue; and
    (3) The alternate method or procedure will not be contrary to any 
provision of law, and will not result in an increase in cost to the 
Government or hinder the effective administration of this part.

No alternate method or procedure shall be used until approval has been 
received from the appropriate ATF officer. Authorization for the 
alternate method or procedure may be withdrawn whenever in the judgment 
of the appropriate ATF officer, the revenue is jeopardized or the 
effective administration of this part is hindered by the continuation of 
such authorization.

Sec. 252.22  Vessels employed in the fisheries.

    Liquors may be withdrawn or laden under the provisions of paragraphs 
(b) and (e) of Sec. 252.21 relating to vessels employed in the 
fisheries, only for use on vessels of the United States documented to 
engage in the fisheries and foreign fishing vessels of 5 net tons or 
over if the district director of customs is satisfied by reason of the 
quantity requested in the light of (a) whether the vessel is employed in 
substantially continuous fishing activities, and (b) the vessel's 
complement, that none of the liquors to be withdrawn or laden are 
intended to be removed from the vessel in, or otherwise returned to, the 
United States. Such withdrawal or lading shall be conditioned upon 
compliance with the applicable provisions of this part. Lading of such 
liquors for use on such vessels shall be subject to approval by the 
district director of customs of a special written application by the 
withdrawer or the vessel's master on customs Form 5125 (in duplicate) 
and a statement by the withdrawer in his application or notice on the 
required ATF Form 5100.11, 5110.30, 1582-A, 1582-B, or 1689, as the case 
may be, that the liquors are to be laden for use as supplies on a vessel 
employed in the fisheries. The original application on customs Form 
5125, after approval, shall be stamped with the serial number of the ATF 
Form 5100.11, 5110.30, 1582-A, 1582-B, or 1689, as the case may be, and 
the date thereof, and shall be returned by the district director of 
customs to the withdrawer or vessel's master for use as prescribed 
below. Approval of each such application shall be subject to the 
condition that the original shall be presented thereafter by the 
withdrawer or the vessel's master to the district director of customs 
within 24 hours (excluding Saturday, Sunday, and holidays) after each 
subsequent arrival of the vessel at a customs port or station and that 
an accounting shall be made at the time of such presentation of the 
disposition of the liquors until the district director of customs is 
satisfied that they have been consumed on board, or landed under customs 
supervision, and takes up the authorization. The approval of customs 
Form 5125 shall be subject to the further condition that any such 
liquors remaining on board while the vessel is in port shall be 
safeguarded in the manner and to such extent as the director of the port 
or place of arrival shall deem necessary. When such liquors have been 
accounted for to the satisfaction of the district director of customs, 
he shall execute his certificate of lading and use on both copies of the 
ATF Form 5100.11, 5110.30, 1582-A, 1582-B, or 1689, as the case may be, 
and forward the original of the form to the regional director 
(compliance) designated thereon. In the event of a failure on the part 
of the withdrawer or the master of the vessel to comply with the 
conditions of this section or upon receipt of evidence that the liquors 
were not lawfully used as supplies on the vessel, the district director 
of customs shall advise the regional director (compliance) of all the 
facts in the case for determination of any liability incurred. In the 
case of liquors withdrawn without payment of tax, assessment of tax 
liability found to have been incurred shall be made against the 
principal on the bond. In the case of taxpaid or tax determined liquors, 
the regional director (compliance) shall determine as to whether to make 
demand upon the principal and the surety on the bond or to disallow the 
claim as the case may be.
    Note: As used in this section, the word ``withdrawer'' shall mean 
the person executing the application or notice, ATF Form 5100.11,

    Assistant regional commissioners may approve applications relating 
to the withdrawal or lading of liquors for use on aircraft of those 
foreign countries which will allow, to aircraft registered in the United 
States and engaged in foreign trade, privileges substantially reciprocal 
to the privileges allowed herein to aircraft of a foreign country. Where 
application is made to withdraw or lade liquors for use on aircraft of 
other countries, which it is claimed reciprocate similar privileges to 
aircraft of the United States, the applicant must first establish the 
right of such withdrawal or lading. In appropriate cases, the applicant 
should request the Secretary of Commerce to find and advise the 
Secretary of the Treasury that such foreign country or countries allow, 
or will allow, substantially reciprocal privileges to aircraft of the 
United States.

purposes are considered to be exported. Export status is not acquired 
until application on Form 214 for admission of the liquors into the zone 
has been approved by the district director of customs under the 
appropriate provision of 19 CFR chapter I, and the required 
certification of deposit has been made on the ATF form prescribed in 
this part.
    (b) The provisions of subpart H of this part do not apply to 
specially denatured spirits transferred to a foreign-trade zone for use 
in the manufacture of articles pursuant to the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 
81c(c). Transfer of domestic specially denatured spirits to a qualified 
user in a foreign-trade zone is made free of tax under the provisions of 
part 20 of this chapter. Such transfer does not place the domestic 
specially denatured spirits in an export status.

Sec. 252.36  Application.

    Liquors deposited in a foreign-trade zone from the United States 
which have become unmerchantable or unfit for export may be destroyed. 
The exporter shall prepare a letter application, in duplicate, and 
submit it to the regional director (compliance) of the region in which 
the zone is located. The application shall identify the name and address 
of the exporter and contain the following information:
    (a) The kind and quantity of the liquor, the serial numbers, if any, 
of the containers thereof, and identification of the zone in which the 
liquor is stored;
    (b) The name and address of the producer bottler or packager of the 
liquor, and the name, registry number, if any, and location of the 
plant, warehouse or other establishment from which such liquors were 
withdrawn for transportation to and deposit in the foreign-trade zone;
    (c) The date, form, and serial number of the ATF Form 5100.11, 
5110.30, 1582-A, 1582-B, or 1689, as the case may be; and, in the case 
of liquors on which drawback of internal revenue tax has been allowed, 
the claim number assigned thereto by the regional director (compliance);
    (d) Whether the liquor has become unmerchantable or unfit for export 
after deposit in the zone, together with all the known facts relating 
thereto; and
    (e) Whether the unmerchantable or unfit liquor is covered by valid 
insurance in excess of the market value thereof, exclusive of tax. If 
the liquor is insured, the application shall show its market value, the 
amount and date of each and every policy of insurance, the name and 
location of the company by which each and every policy was issued, the 
name and address of the bona fide owner of the liquor, and to the best 
of the affiant's knowledge, whether any other person or party is 
indemnified against the loss of the liquor by reason of its spoilage or 
destruction.

Such application shall be signed by the exporter or his authorized agent 
and be executed under the penalties of perjury. The regional director 
(compliance) may require any further evidence as is deemed necessary. 
The operator of the foreign-trade zone shall countersign the application 
or otherwise indicate thereon his knowledge of and concurrence in the 
application to destroy the liquor. The exporter shall file the 
application with the district director of customs in whose district the 
foreign-trade zone is located; at the same time the exporter shall 
likewise file Zone Form E in accordance with Customs Regulations (19 CFR 
chapter I). On receipt of the application the district director of 
customs shall determine the completeness thereof and shall report any 
facts relating to the condition of the liquor of which he may have 
knowledge. The original application shall be forwarded to the regional 
director (compliance) and the district director of customs shall retain 
the copy for his files.

    The regional director (compliance) shall carefully examine the 
application to see that all the required information has been furnished 
and shall cause an investigation to be made or require any additional 
evidence, including samples, to be submitted if necessary. If the 
regional director (compliance) finds that the liquors were transported 
to and deposited in a foreign-trade zone in good faith for the purpose 
of exportation or storage pending exportation, and that the liquors, 
after deposit in the zone, have become unmerchantable or unfit for 
export, he may approve the application and authorize the destruction of 
the liquor described therein under the supervision of the district 
director of customs. On approval or disapproval of the application, the 
regional director (compliance) shall advise the district director of 
customs of his action.

exporter's application on Zone Form E and dispose of it in accordance 
with the applicable provisions of Customs Regulations (19 CFR chapter 
I). Where the regional director (compliance) has authorized the 
destruction of the liquor, such destruction shall be accomplished under 
customs supervision.

of tax, as authorized by Sec. 252.91(a)(1), (2), (3), (5), or

    (b) Penal sum of bond. The penal sum of the bond shall be sufficient

that may remain unaccounted for at any one time. However, the maximum 
penal sum of the bond shall not exceed $200,000, but in no case shall 
the penal sum be less than $1,000. Distilled spirits and wine withdrawn

    (c) Apportioning bonds. If the bond, Form 2735 (5100.30), is in less 
than the maximum penal sum, the principal shall apportion the bond, in 
accordance with the requirements on the bond form. The exporter may 
reapportion the bond coverage, if changing conditions make this 
necessary, by filing a consent of surety, ATF Form 1533 (5000.18), for 
approval by the Director of Industry Operations (DIO).

bonded wine cellar for transfer to a customs bonded warehouse. The 
consent shall be executed in accordance with Sec. 252.54 and filed in 
accordance with instructions on the form. Exporters with bonds executed 
on or after April 1, 1981, do not need this consent of surety, because 
such bonds automatically apply to withdrawals for transfer to customs

Sec. 275.25  Disposal of forfeited, condemned, and abandoned tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes.

    When any Federal, State, or local officer having custody of 
forfeited, condemned, or abandoned tobacco products or cigarette papers

opinion that the sale thereof will not bring a price equal to the tax 
due and payable thereon, and the expenses incident to the sale thereof, 
he shall not sell, nor cause to be sold, such articles for consumption 
in the United States. Where the articles are not sold, the officer may 
deliver them to a Federal or State hospital or institution (if they are 
fit for consumption) or cause their destruction by burning completely or 
by rendering them unfit for consumption. Where such articles are sold, 
they shall not be released by the officer having custody thereof until 
they are properly packaged and taxpaid, which tax shall be considered as 
a portion of the sales price. Except where the tax is to be paid to the 
Port Directors of Customs or other authorized customs officer in 
accordance with Customs regulations (19 CFR part 127) on sales of 
articles by customs officers, the payment of tax on such articles must 
be evidenced by presentation, to the officer having custody of the 
articles, of a receipt from the appropriate ATF officer showing such 
payment. In the case of such articles held by or for the Federal 
Government, the sale thereof shall be subject to the applicable 
provisions of the Regulations of the General Services Administration,

Sec. 275.26  Alternate methods or procedures.

    An importer, on specific approval by the Director as provided in 
this section, may use an alternate method or procedure in lieu of a 
method or procedure specifically prescribed in this part. The Director 
may approve an alternate method or procedure, subject to stated 
conditions, when he finds that--
    (a) Good cause has been shown for the use of the alternate method or 
procedure,

[[Page 76]]

    (b) The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and 
consistent with the effect intended by, the specifically prescribed 
method or procedure, and affords equivalent security to the revenue, and
    (c) The alternate method of procedure will not be contrary to any 
provision of law, and will not result in an increase in cost to the 
Government or hinder the effective administration of this part.

No alternate method or procedure relating to the giving of any bond or 
to the assessment, payment, or collection of tax, shall be authorized 
under this section. When an importer desires to employ an alternate 
method or procedure, he shall submit a written application to do so, in 
triplicate, to the regional director (compliance) for transmittal to the 
Director. The application shall specifically describe the proposed 
alternate method or procedure, and shall set forth the reasons therefor. 
Alternate methods or procedures shall not be employed until the 
application has been approved by the Director. The importer shall, 
during the period of authorization of an alternate method or procedure, 
comply with the terms of the approved application. Authorization for any 
alternate method or procedure may be withdrawn whenever in the judgment 
of the Director the revenue is jeopardized or the effective 
administration of this part is hindered. The importer shall retain, as 
part of his records, any authorization of the Director under this 
section.

Sec. 275.27  Emergency variations from requirements.

    The Director may approve methods of operation other than as 
specified in this part, where he finds that an emergency exists and the 
proposed variations from the specified requirements are necessary, and 
the proposed variations--
    (a) Will afford the security and protection to the revenue intended 
by the prescribed specifications,
    (b) Will not hinder the effective administration of this part, and
    (c) Will not be contrary to any provision of law.

Variations from requirements granted under this section are conditioned 
on compliance with the procedures, conditions, and limitations set forth 
in the approval of the application. Failure to comply in good faith and 
with such procedures, conditions, and limitations shall automatically 
terminate the authority for such variations and the importer thereupon 
shall fully comply with the prescribed requirements of regulations from 
which the variations were authorized. Authority for any variations may 
be withdrawn whenever in the judgment of the Director the revenue is 
jeopardized or the effective administration of this part is hindered by

be liable for the internal revenue taxes imposed thereon by 26 U.S.C. 
5701 or 7652: Provided, That tobacco products or cigarette papers or 
tubes (other than those previously exported and returned) imported or 
brought into the United States, may be released from customs custody 
without payment of tax, for delivery to the proprietor of an export 
warehouse, to a manufacturer of tobacco products, or to a manufacturer 
of cigarette papers or tubes (except for tobacco products), if such 
articles are not put up in packages (see Sec. 275.11). Under these 
circumstances the transferee will become liable for the internal revenue 
tax on such articles upon release from customs custody and the importer 
will thereupon be relieved of the liability for such tax. If the 
transferee is also the importer, then the importer will not be relieved 
of the liability for such tax.

Sec. 275.63  Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.

    (a) Each importer who was liable, during a calendar year, for a 
gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in taxes on 
cigars, cigarettes, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes combining tax 
liabilities incurred under this part and part 40 of this chapter, shall 
use a commercial bank in making payment by electronic fund transfer 
(EFT) of such taxes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment of such 
taxes by cash, check, or money order is not authorized for an importer 
who is required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. For 
purposes of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is defined 
as the gross tax liability on all taxable withdrawals and importations 
(including similar products brought into the United States from Puerto 
Rico or the Virgin Islands) during the calendar year, without regard to 
any drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises from which such 
activities are conducted by the taxpayer.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a 
controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and 
implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except 
that the words ``at least 80 percent'' shall be replaced by the words 
``more than 50 percent'' in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 
26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the 
rules for a ``controlled group of corporations'' apply in a similar 
fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole 
proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a 
group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or 
sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one 
taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make 
remittances by EFT.
    (c) For the purposes of this section, (1) electronic fund transfer 
or EFT means any transfer of funds, other than a transaction originated 
by check, draft, or similar paper instrument, which is initiated through 
an electronic terminal, telephonic instrument, or computer of magnetic 
tape, so as to order, instruct, or authorize a financial institution to 
either debit or credit an account, in accordance with procedures 
established by the U.S. Customs Service, and (2) electronic fund 
transfer or EFT does not have the meaning defined in Sec. 275.11 for use 
elswhere in this part.
    (d) An importer who is required by this section to make remittances 
by EFT, shall make the EFT remittance

            and Tubes Without Payment of Tax or Certain Duty


<R05>
Sec. 275.82  Restrictions on tobacco products labeled for export.

    (a) The provisions of this section apply to tobacco products and 
cigarette papers and tubes manufactured in the United States and labeled 
for exportation under parts 44 and 270 of this chapter.
    (b) Articles described in paragraph (a) of this section may be 
transferred to or removed from the premises of a manufacturer or an 
export warehouse proprietor only if such articles are being transferred 
or removed without tax as provided in this part.
    (c) Articles described in paragraph (a) of this section may only be 
imported or brought into the United States, after their exportation, 
under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 5704(d), by release from Customs 
custody for delivery to the original manufacturer of such tobacco 
products or cigarette papers or tubes or to the proprietor of an export 
warehouse authorized by such manufacturer to receive such articles. 
These products are transferred in bond and are released from Customs 
custody without payment of that part of the duty attributable to 
internal revenue tax.

[[Page 84]]

    (d) Articles described in paragraph (a) of this section that are not 
put up in packages may be imported or brought into the United States 
under 26 U.S.C. 5704(c) by release from Customs custody without payment 
of tax for delivery to the original manufacturer of such articles. 
However, because such articles are also eligible for release under 26 
U.S.C. 5704(d), such articles will be treated as though released under 
section 5704(d), due to the penalty provisions in section 5761(c).
    (e) Articles described in paragraph (a) of this section may not be 
sold or held for sale for domestic consumption in the United States 
unless such articles are removed from their export packaging and 
repackaged by the original manufacturer into new packaging that does not 
contain an export label. The new packages, marks and notices must 
conform to the requirements of 27 CFR part 270.
    (f) The provisions of this section shall apply to articles labeled 
for export even if the packaging or the appearance of such packaging to 
the consumer of such articles has been modified or altered by a person 
other than the original manufacturer so as to remove or conceal or 
attempt to remove or conceal (including by placement of a sticker over) 
any export label.
    (g) For purposes of this section, an article is labeled for export 
or contains an export label if it bears the mark, label, or notice 
required by Sec. 44.185 of this chapter.
    (h) For purposes of this section, references to exportation shall be 
treated as including a reference to shipment to the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico.
    (i) The provisions of this section do not apply to any person who, 
when entering U.S. manufactured tobacco products labeled for export 
under parts 44 and 270 of this chapter, claims and is granted an 
exemption from duty and tax for such products under chapter 98 of the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. The quantity of tobacco 
products entered may not exceed the quantity limit imposed on such 
products under the applicable tariff provision. A traveler claiming an 
exemption under this subsection upon arrival at the border may 
voluntarily relinquish to the U. S. Customs Service at the time of entry 
any excess of such quantity without incurring the penalty under section 
Sec. 275.83.
    (j) For civil penalties and forfeiture provisions related to 
violations of this section, see Sec. 275.83. For a criminal penalty 
applicable to any violation of this section see 26 U.S.C. 5762(b).

    Except for the return of exported products that are specifically 
authorized under Sec. 275.82(b) and (c):
    (a) Every person who sells, relands, or receives within the 
jurisdiction of the United States any tobacco products or cigarette 
papers or tubes which have been labeled or shipped for exportation under 
parts 44 and 270 of this chapter;
    (b) Every person who sells or receives such relanded tobacco 
products or cigarette papers or tubes; and,
    (c) Every person who aids or abets in such selling, relanding, or 
receiving, shall, in addition to the tax and any other penalty provided 
for in title 26 U.S.C., be liable for a penalty equal to the greater of 
$1,000 or 5 times the amount of the tax imposed by title 26 U.S.C. All 
tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes relanded within the 
jurisdiction of the United States shall be forfeited to the United 
States and destroyed. All vessels, vehicles and aircraft used in such 
relanding or in removing such products, papers, and tubes from the place 
where relanded, shall be forfeited to the United States.
    (d) The provisions of this section do not apply to any person who, 
when entering U.S. manufactured tobacco products labeled for export, 
claims and is granted an exemption from duty and tax for such products 
under chapter 98 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. 
The quantity of tobacco products entered may not exceed the quantity 
limit imposed on such products under the applicable tariff provision. A 
traveler claiming an exemption under this subsection upon arrival at the 
border may voluntarily relinquish to the U. S. Customs Service at the 
time of entry any excess of such quantity without incurring the penalty

Sec. 275.85  Release from customs custody of imported tobacco articles.

    (a) The provisions of this section apply only to tobacco products, 
cigarette papers, and cigarettes tubes, which are not put up in 
packages, i.e., not placed by the manufacturer or importer in packages 
in which the products will be sold to consumers. Tobacco products 
manufactured in a foreign country, the Virgin Islands, or a possession 
of the United States may be released by the Port Director of Customs or 
authorized customs officer from customs custody, without payment of 
internal revenue tax, for transfer to the factory of any manufacturer of 
tobacco products under the internal revenue bond of the manufacturer to 
whom such articles are released. Cigarette papers and tubes manufactured 
in a foreign country, the Virgin Islands, or a possession of the United 
States may be released by the Port Director of Customs or authorized 
customs officer from customs custody, without payment of internal 
revenue tax, for transfer, under the internal revenue bond of the 
manufacturer to whom such articles are released, to the factory of a 
manufacturer of cigarette papers and tubes; or a manufacturer of tobacco 
products solely for use in the manufacture of cigarettes. Releases under 
this section must be in accordance with Sec. 275.86: Provided, however, 
that in the case of products exported from the Virgin Islands, in order 
for a manufacturer of tobacco products or a manufacturer of cigarette 
papers and tubes to remove such products from customs custody in the 
United States under the manufacturer's internal revenue bond without 
payment of internal revenue tax, the manufacturer must file an extension 
of coverage of the internal revenue bond on ATF Form 2105, and receive a 
notice of approval from the appropriate ATF officer. The extension of 
coverage must be executed by the principal and the surety and must be in 
the following form:

    ``Whereas the purpose of this extension is to bind the obligors for 
the purpose of the tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. 7652(b), on tobacco products 
and tubes exported from the Virgin Islands and removed from customs 
custody in the United States without payment of internal revenue tax, 
for delivery to the principal on said bond.''
    ``Now, therefore, the said bond is further specifically conditioned 
that the principal named therein must pay all taxes imposed by 26 U.S.C. 
7652(b) plus penalties, if any, and interest, for which he may become 
liable with respect to these products exported from the Virgin Islands 
and removed from customs custody in the United States without payment of 
internal revenue tax thereon, and must comply with all provision of law 
and regulations with respect thereto.''

    (b) Articles received into the factory of a manufacturer under the 
provision of this section are subject to the provisions of part 40 of 
this chapter.

U.S.C. 1202) exported from and returned to the United States without 
change to the product or the shipping container may be released, under 
the bond of the manufacturer or export warehouse proprietor to whom such 
articles are released, from customs custody in the United States without 
payment of that part of the duty attributable to the internal revenue 
tax for delivery to the factory of any tobacco products manufacturer or 
to the permit premises of an export warehouse proprietor.
    (b) Domestically produced cigarette papers and tubes (classifiable 
under item 9801.00.80 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States, 19 U.S.C. 1202) exported from and returned to the United States 
without change to the product or the shipping container may be released 
from customs custody in the United States without payment of that part 
of the duty attributable to the internal revenue tax for delivery, under 
the bond of the manufacturer to whom such articles are released, to the 
factory of:

[[Page 86]]

    (1) A manufacturer of cigarette papers and tubes; or
    (2) A manufacturer of tobacco products solely for use in the 
manufacture of cigarettes.
    (c) Releases under this section must be in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in Sec. 275.86. Once released, the tobacco products 
and cigarette papers and tubes will be subject to the tax and all other 
provisions of 26 U.S.C. chapter 52, and, as applicable, subject to the 
provisions of the regulations in part 40 of this chapter as if they had 
not been exported or otherwise removed from internal revenue bond.

release of tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes from customs 
custody, without payment of internal revenue tax, under its internal 
revenue bond, as provided in Secs. 275.85 or 275.85a, must prepare a 
notice of release, Form 5200.11, in triplicate, and file the three 
copies of the form with the appropriate ATF officer. The appropriate ATF 
officer will not certify Form 5200.11 covering the release of tobacco 
products and cigarette papers and tubes unless the manufacturer is 
authorized, under part 40 of this chapter, to receive, without payment 
of tax, the kinds of articles set forth in the form.
    (b) Importers who are either manufacturers of tobacco products and 
cigarette papers and tubes or export warehouse proprietors, or their 
authorized agents, who request the release of tobacco products or 
cigarette papers and tubes from customs custody in the United States 
under this section, using customs electronic filing procedures, must not 
request such release until they have received the ATF Form 5200.11 
certified by the appropriate ATF officer. Once Customs releases the 
tobacco products or cigarette papers and tubes in accordance with 19 CFR 
Part 143, Customs Directives, and any other applicable instructions, the 
importer will send a copy of the ATF Form 5200.11 along with a copy of 
the electronic filing and customs release to the appropriate ATF officer 
at the address shown thereon. The importer will retain one copy of the 
ATF Form 5200.11 to meet ATF recordkeeping requirements and one copy to 
meet customs recordkeeping requirements.
    (c) Importers or their authorized agents requesting release of 
tobacco products or cigarette papers and tubes from customs custody in 
the United States under any other authorized procedure will submit all 
copies of the ATF Form 5200.11 to the appropriate customs officer along 
with their request for release. The customs officer will verify that the 
ATF Form 5200.11 has been certified by the appropriate ATF officer and 
return all copies to the importer or the importer's authorized 
representative.
    (d) Once Customs releases the tobacco products or cigarette papers 
and tubes in accordance with 19 CFR Part 143, Customs Directives, and 
any other applicable instructions, the importer will send a copy of the 
ATF Form 5200.11 along with a copy of the customs release to the 
appropriate ATF office at the address shown thereon. The importer will 
retain one copy of the ATF Form 5200.11 to meet ATF recordkeeping 
requirements and one copy to meet customs recordkeeping requirements.

Sec. 275.112  Tax return.

    The internal revenue taxes imposed by 26 U.S.C. 7652(a), with 
respect to tobacco products manufactured in Puerto Rico and shipped to 
the United States on computation of tax under the provisions of this 
subpart shall be paid on the basis of a semimonthly tax return. The

duplicate, and file the original with the Chief, Puerto Rico Operations, 
and maintain one copy for the file for each semimonthly return period. 
The bonded manufacturer shall execute the return, ATF Form 5000.25, 
under the penalties of perjury. He shall file a return for each return 
period at the time specified in Sec. 275.114, regardless of whether

[[Page 89]]

tax is due for that return period. However, where the Regional Director 
(compliance), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Atlanta, GA, 
grants specific authorization, the bonded manufacturer need not file a 
tax return during the term of such authorization for any period in which 
tax liability was not incurred under the provisions of this subpart.

Sec. 275.114a  Qualification for extended deferral.

    Note: This section applies only to removals made before January 1, 
1983.
    (a) Bonded manufacturers with bonds executed before September 1, 
1973. Bonded manufacturers with bonds on Form 2936 executed before 
September 1, 1973, who desire to file returns under this subpart with 
benefit of the extended deferral permitted by Sec. 275.114 shall file 
with the regional director (compliance) an extension of coverage of bond 
on Form 2105. Such extension of coverage shall identify the particular 
bond to which it applies and shall contain a statement of purpose as 
follows:

    To continue in effect said bond (including all extensions or 
limitations of terms and conditions previously consented to and 
approved) notwithstanding that the time for payment of the tax may be 
deferred by the extended deferral period permitted by regulations in 27 
CFR 275.114.


If the bond on Form 2986 is in an amount insufficient to cover an 
extended deferral period, according to the requirements of Sec. 275.121, 
the bonded manufacturer must either file a new bond or file a 
strengthening bond to increase the total amount of the bonds then in 
force to a sufficient amount.
    (b) Bonded manufacturers with bonds executed after September 1, 
1973. Bonded manufacturers operating under original or superseding bonds 
executed after September 1, 1973, are automatically qualified for the 
extended deferral permitted by Sec. 275.114 (unless found in default as 
provided in Sec. 275.116). Such bonds must be executed in an amount 
sufficient to cover an extended deferral period, according to the 
requirements of Sec. 275.121.
    (c) Commencement of extended deferral. Bonded manufacturers may file 
returns with benefit of extended deferral only after the applicable 
bonds and extensions of coverage required by this section have been 
filed with and approved by the regional director (compliance).

Chief, Puerto Rico Operations is authorized to accept under the

Sec. 275.115a  Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.

    (a) General. (1) Each taxpayer who was liable, during a calendar 
year, for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in 
taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes 
combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and part 40 of this 
chapter, shall use a commercial bank in making payment by electronic 
fund transfer (EFT) of taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and 
cigarette tubes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment of taxes on 
tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes by cash, check, 
or money order, as described in Sec. 275.115, is not authorized for a 
taxpayer who is required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. 
For purposes of this

[[Page 91]]

section, the dollar amount of tax liability is defined as the gross tax 
liability of all taxes which are paid in accordance with this subpart, 
taxable withdrawals from premises in the United States, and importations 
during the calendar year, without regard to any drawbacks, credits, or 
refunds, for all premises from which such activities are conducted by 
the taxpayer. Overpayments are not taken into account in summarizing the 
gross tax liability.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a 
controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and 
implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except 
that the words ``at least 80 percent'' shall be replaced by the words 
``more than 50 percent'' in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 
26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the 
rules for a ``controlled group of corporations'' apply in a similar 
fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole 
proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a 
group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or 
sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one 
taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make 
remittances by EFT.
    (3) A taxpayer who is required by this section to make remittances 
by EFT, shall make a separate EFT remittance and file a separate tax 
return for each factory which tobacco products, or cigarette papers, or 
cigarette tubes are withdrawn upon determination of tax.
    (b) Requirements. (1) On or before January 10 of each calendar year, 
except for a taxpayer already remitting the tax by EFT, each taxpayer 
who was liable for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million 
dollars in taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette 
tubes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and part 40 of 
this chapter during the previous calender year, shall notify, in 
writing, the regional director (compliance), for each region in which 
taxes are paid. The notice shall be an agreement to make remittances by 
EFT.
    (2) For each return filed in accordance with this part, the taxpayer 
shall direct the taxpayer's bank to make an electronic fund transfer in 
the amount of the taxpayment to the Treasury Account as provided in 
paragraph (e) of this section. The request shall be made to the bank 
early enough for the transfer to be made to the Treasury Account by no 
later than the close of business on the last day for filing the return, 
prescribed in Sec. 275.105 or Sec. 275.114. The request shall take into 
account any time limit established by the bank.
    (3) If a taxpayer was liable for less than five million dollars in 
taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes during 
the preceding calendar year, the taxpayer may choose either to continue 
remitting the tax as provided in this section or to remit the tax with 
the return as prescribed by Sec. 275.115. On the first return on which 
the taxpayer chooses to discontinue remitting the tax by EFT and to 
begin remitting the tax with the tax return, the taxpayer shall notify 
the regional director (compliance) by attaching a written notification 
to the tax return, stating that no taxes are due by EFT, because the tax 
liability during the preceding calendar year was less than five million 
dollars, and that the remittance shall be filed with the tax return.
    (c) Remittance. (1) Each taxpayer shall show on the tax return, 
information about remitting the tax for that return by EFT and shall 
file the return with the Chief, Puerto Rico Operations.
    (2) Remittances shall be considered as made when the taxpayment by 
electronic fund transfer is received by the Treasury Account. For 
purposes of this section, a taxpayment by electronic fund transfer shall 
be considered as received by the Treasury Account when it is paid to a 
Federal Reserve Bank.
    (3) When the taxpayer directs the bank to effect an electronic fund 
transfer message as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any 
transfer data record furnished to the taxpayer, through normal banking 
procedures, will serve as the record of payment, and shall be retained 
as part of required records.
    (d) Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT. The taxpayer is subject to 
a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5761, 6651, or 6656, as applicable, for 
failure to make a taxpayment by EFT on or before the

[[Page 92]]

close of business on the prescribed last day for filing.
    (e) Procedure. Upon the notification required under paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, the appropriate ATF officer will issue to the taxpayer 
an ATF Procedure entitled, Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund Transfer. 
This publication outlines the procedure a taxpayer is to follow when 
preparing returns and EFT remittances in accordance with this part.

disposition of the articles (and destruction of the stamps, if any) or 
the regional director (compliance) may authorize the receiving 
manufacturer to verify the schedule and disposition of the articles (and 
destruction of the stamps, if any) covered therein, without supervision, 
by so stating on the original and one copy of the schedule returned to 
the manufacturer. Where the receipt in a factory of tobacco products and 
cigarette papers and tubes has been verified, such articles shall be 
treated by the receiving manufacturer as nontaxpaid and shall be covered 
by the manufacturer's bond.

Sec. 275.174  Disposition of tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes, and schedule.

    When an ATF officer is assigned to verify the schedule and supervise 
destruction or other disposition of tobacco products and cigarette 
papers and tubes which have been imported or brought into the United 
States, such officer shall, upon completion of his assignment, execute a 
certificate on all copies of the schedule to show the disposition and 
the date of disposition of such articles. The ATF officer shall return 
the original and one copy of the certified schedule to the taxpayer. 
When a taxpayer destroys such articles (and stamps, if any) or reduces 
tobacco products to materials, or a receiving manufacturer verifies the 
schedule and disposition of such articles (and stamps, if any), he shall 
execute a certificate on the original and the copy of the schedule 
returned to him, to show the disposition and the date of disposition of 
the articles. The taxpayer shall attach the original of the certified 
schedule to his claim for refund.

Sec. 275.181  Records of large cigars.

    Every person who imports large cigars for sale within the United 
States must keep such records as are necessary to establish and verify 
the sale

[[Page 99]]

price that applies to large cigars removed (entered or withdrawn).
    (a) Basic record. The importer must keep a record to show each sale 
price (as determined under Sec. 275.39), which is applicable to large 
cigars removed. No later than the tenth business day in January of each 
year the importer must prepare such a record to show the sale price in 
effect on the first day of that year for each brand and size of large 
cigars. The importer must note any change in a price from that shown in 
the record within ten business days after such change in price. The 
record must be a continuing one for each brand and size of cigar (and 
type of packaging, if pertinent), so that the taxable price on any date 
may be readily ascertained. If an importer removes new types of large 
cigars after the beginning of the year, the importer must enter the sale 
price and its effective date for such large cigars in the basic record 
within ten business days after such removal.
    (b) Copies of price announcements. The importer must keep a copy of 
each general announcement that is issued internally or to the trade 
about establishment or change of large cigar sale prices. If the copy 
does not show the actual date when issued it must be annotated to show 
this information.
    (c) Copies of entry and withdrawal forms. The importer must keep a 
copy of each customs entry or withdrawal form on which internal revenue 
tax for large cigars is declared pursuant to Sec. 275.81.
    (d) Alternative record. If an importer has so few import 
transactions and/or brands and sizes of large cigars that retention of 
an appropriate copy of each entry and withdrawal form required under 
paragraph (c) of this section will provide an adequate record of sale 
prices, then the record required under paragraph (a) of this section 
need not be kept. In such case the entry and withdrawal forms must 
identify the brands and sizes of cigars covered and show the 
corresponding quantity and sale price for each. If such information was 
not originally entered on the form it may be included by annotation. 
Whenever the appropriate ATF officer finds that alternative records 
being kept pursuant to this paragraph are inadequate for the intended 
purpose, he or she may so notify the importer in writing, after which 
time the importer must keep the record required under paragraph (a) of 
this section.

available for inspection by any ATF officer upon his request. (For 
retention period, see Sec. 275.22.)

Sec. 275.190  Persons required to qualify.

    Any person who engages in the business as an importer of tobacco 
products must qualify as an importer of tobacco products in accordance 
with the provisions of this part. Any person eligible for the exemption 
in Sec. 275.50 is not engaged in the business as an importer of tobacco 
products.
    Persons importing tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes 
for personal use, in such quantities as may be allowed by Customs 
without payment of tax, do not require an importer's permit.


<R05>
Sec. 275.191  Application for permit.

    Except as provided in Sec. 275.192, every person, before commencing 
business as an importer of tobacco products as defined in Sec. 275.11, 
must make application for, and obtain, the permit provided by this 
subpart K. Such application must be made on ATF Form 5230.4, according 
to the instructions for the form. All documents required under this part 
to be furnished with such application must be made a part thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 275.192  Transitional rule.

    Any person who--

[[Page 100]]

    (a) Was engaged in the business as an importer of tobacco products 
before January 1, 2000, and
    (b) Who files an application with ATF before January 1, 2000, may 
continue to import tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes 
pending action on their application by ATF. Pending such final action, 
all provisions of chapter 52 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will 
apply to such applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 275.193  Corporate documents.

    Every corporation, before commencing business as an importer of 
tobacco products, must furnish with its application for permit, required 
by Sec. 275.191, a true copy of the corporate charter or a certificate 
of corporate existence or incorporation executed by the appropriate 
officer of the State in which incorporated. The corporation must 
likewise furnish duly authenticated extracts of the stockholders' 
meetings, bylaws, or directors' meetings, listing the offices the 
incumbents of which are authorized to sign documents or otherwise act in 
behalf of the corporation in matters relating to 26 U.S.C. chapter 52, 
and regulations issued thereunder. The corporation must also furnish 
evidence, in duplicate, of the identity of the officers and directors 
and each person who holds more than ten percent of the stock of such 
corporation. Where any of the information required by this section has 
previously been filed with the appropriate ATF officer, and such 
information is currently complete and accurate, a written statement to 
that effect, in duplicate, will be sufficient for the purpose of this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 275.194  Articles of partnership or association.

    Every partnership or association, before commencing business as an 
importer of tobacco products, must furnish with its application for 
permit required by Sec. 275.191 a true copy of the articles of 
partnership or association, if any, or certificate of partnership or 
association where required to be filed by any State, county, or 
municipality. Where a partnership or association has previously filed 
such documents with the appropriate ATF officer and such documents are 
currently complete and accurate, a written statement, in duplicate, to 
that effect by the partnership or association will be sufficient for the 
purpose of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 275.195  Trade name certificate.

    Every person, before commencing business under a trade name as an 
importer of tobacco products, must furnish with his application for a 
permit, required by Sec. 275.191, a true copy of the certificate or 
other document, if any, issued by a State, county, or municipal 
authority in connection with the transaction of business under such 
trade name. If no such true copy of the certificate or other document is 
so required, a written statement, in duplicate, to that effect by such 
person will be sufficient for the purpose of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 275.196  Power of attorney.

    If the application for permit or any report, return, notice, 
schedule, or other document required to be executed is to be signed by 
an individual (including one of the partners for a partnership or one of 
the members of an association) as an attorney in fact for any person, or 
if an individual is to otherwise officially represent such person, power 
of attorney on Form 1534 must be furnished to the appropriate ATF 
officer. (For power of attorney in connection with conference and 
practice requirements see subpart E, part 70 of this chapter.) Such 
power of attorney is not required for persons whose authority is 
furnished with the corporate documents as required by Sec. 275.194. Form 
1534 does not have to be filed again with the appropriate ATF officer if 
such form has previously been submitted to ATF and is still in effect.


<R05>
Sec. 275.197  Additional information.

    The appropriate ATF officer may require such additional information 
as may be deemed necessary to determine whether the applicant is 
entitled to a permit under the provisions of this part. The applicant 
must, when required by the appropriate ATF officer, furnish as a part of 
his application for such permit such additional information as the 
appropriate ATF officer deems necessary to determine whether the 
applicant is entitled to a permit.

[[Page 101]]


<R05>
Sec. 275.198  Investigation of applicant.

    Appropriate ATF officers may inquire or investigate to verify the 
information in connection with an application for a permit. The 
investigation will ascertain whether the applicant is, by reason of his 
business experience, financial standing, and trade connections, likely 
to maintain operations in compliance with 26 U.S.C. chapter 52, and 
regulations thereunder; whether the applicant has disclosed all material 
information required, or whether the applicant has made any material 
false statement in the application for such permit.


<R05>
Sec. 275.199  Notice of contemplated disapproval.

    If the appropriate ATF officer has reason to believe that the 
applicant is not entitled to a permit, the appropriate ATF officer will 
promptly give to the applicant a notice of the contemplated disapproval 
of the application and opportunity for hearing thereon in accordance 
with part 71 of this chapter. If, after such notice and opportunity for 
hearing, the appropriate ATF officer finds that the applicant is not 
entitled to a permit, an order will be prepared stating the findings on 
which the permit request is denied.

<R05>
Sec. 275.200  Issuance of permit.

    If the application for permit, together with the required supporting 
documents, is approved, the appropriate ATF officer will issue a permit 
on ATF F 5200.24 to the applicant as an importer of tobacco products.


<R05>
Sec. 275.201  Duration of permit.

    (a) Permits other than temporary permits issued under paragraph (b) 
of this section will be valid for a period of three years from the 
effective date shown on the permit, ATF F 5200.24.
    (b) Temporary permits will be issued for a one-year period to those 
applicants described in Sec. 275.192.


<R05>
Sec. 275.202  Renewal of permit.

    Importers wishing to continue operations beyond the expiration of 
their current permit must renew their permit by making application 
within 30 days of such expiration on ATF F 5200.24, in accordance with 
instructions for the form. The expiring permit will continue in effect 
until final action is taken by ATF on the application for renewal, 
provided a timely application for renewal is filed.


<R05>
Sec. 275.203  Retention of permit and supporting documents.

    The importer must retain the permit, together with the copy of the 
application and supporting documents returned with the permit, at the 
same place where the records required by this part are kept. The permit 
and supporting documents must be made available for inspection by any 
appropriate ATF officer upon request.

                      Required Records and Reports


<R05>
Sec. 275.204  General.

    Every tobacco products importer must keep such records and, when 
required by this part, submit such reports, of the physical receipt and 
disposition of tobacco products. Records and reports will not be 
required under this part with respect to tobacco products while in 
customs custody.


<R05>
Sec. 275.205  Recordkeeping requirements.

    Any owner, importer, consignee, or their agent who imports, or 
knowingly causes to be imported, any tobacco product or cigarette papers 
or tubes must make and keep records. A person purchasing a tobacco 
product from the importer in a domestic transaction and who does not 
knowingly cause merchandise to be imported is not required to make and 
keep records unless:
    (a) The terms and conditions of the importation are controlled by 
the person placing the order with the importer (e.g., the importer is 
not an independent contractor but the agent of the person placing the 
order).
    (b) The tobacco products purchased from the importer include more 
than 60,000 cigarettes, in which case the importer and the person 
placing the order with the importer must keep the records required by 27 
CFR Part 46, Subpart F, Distribution of Cigarettes. Dividing a single 
shipment of more

[[Page 102]]

than 60,000 cigarettes into smaller components of 60,000 cigarettes or 
less does not exempt any person from the recordkeeping requirements of 
this subpart.

[T.D. ATF-422, 64 FR 71951, Dec. 22, 1999, as amended by T.D. ATF-457,

               Filing and Retention of Records and Reports


<R05>
Sec. 275.206  Reports.

    (a) Importers must file a monthly report on ATF F 5220.6 in 
accordance with the format and instructions for the form.
    (b) The first report(s) must be submitted by the 15th day of the 
month following the month in which the permit is issued; all previous 
months beginning January 1, 2000, must also be reported at that time.

For example:

    An importer who is issued a permit with a date of August 17, 2000, 
would be required to submit by September 15, 2000, a total of eight 
reports for the months January-August, 2000.

    (c) Reports with the notation ``No Activity'' must be made for those 
months in which no activity occurs.
    (d) When a transfer of ownership of the business of an importer of 
tobacco products described in Sec. 275.224, or when a change in control 
of a corporation described in Sec. 275.226 occurs, a concluding report 
with the notation ``Concluding Report'' must be made for the month or 
partial month during which the transfer of ownership or change in 
control becomes effective.


<R05>
Sec. 275.207  Filing.

    All records and reports required by this part will be maintained 
separately, chronologically by transaction or reporting date, at the 
importer's place of business. The appropriate ATF officer may, pursuant 
to an application, authorize files, or an individual file, to be 
maintained at another business location under the control of the 
importer, if the alternative location does not cause undue inconvenience 
to ATF or Customs officers desiring to examine the files or delay in the 
timely transmittal of any documents required to be submitted.


<R05>
Sec. 275.208  Retention.

    (a) All records and reports required by this part, documents or 
copies of documents supporting these records or reports, and file copies 
of reports required by this part to be submitted to ATF must be retained 
for not less than three years following the close of the calendar year 
in which filed or made, and during this period must be available for 
inspection and copying by ATF during business hours.
    (b) Furthermore, the appropriate ATF officer may require these 
records to be kept for an additional period of not more than three years 
in any case where it is determined that such record retention is 
necessary to protect the revenue. Any records, or copies thereof, 
containing any of the information required by this part to be prepared, 
wherever kept, must also be made available for inspection and copying.

<R05>
Sec. 275.223  Fiduciary successor.

    If an administrator, executor, receiver, trustee, assignee, or other 
fiduciary, is to take over the business of an importer of tobacco 
products, as a continuing operation, such fiduciary must make 
application for permit, before commencing operations as required by 
subpart K of this part, furnish certified copies, in duplicate, of the 
order of the court, or other pertinent documents, showing his 
appointment and qualification as such fiduciary. However, where a 
fiduciary intends only to liquidate the business, qualification as an 
importer of tobacco products will not be required if the fiduciary 
promptly files with the appropriate ATF officer a written statement to 
that effect.


<R05>
Sec. 275.224  Transfer of ownership.

    If a transfer is to be made in ownership of the business of an 
importer of tobacco products (including a change of any member of a 
partnership or association), such importer must give notice, in writing, 
to the appropriate ATF officer, naming the proposed successor and the 
desired effective date of such transfer. The proposed successor must 
qualify as an importer of tobacco products, before commencing 
operations, in accordance with the applicable provisions of subpart K of 
this part. The importer must give such notice of transfer, and the 
proposed successor must make application for permit in ample time for 
examination and approval thereof before the desired date of such change. 
The predecessor must make a concluding report, in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 275.205, and surrender the permit with such report. 
The successor must make a commencing report, in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 275.206.


<R05>
Sec. 275.225  Change in officers, directors, or stockholders of a corporation.

    Upon election or appointment (excluding successive reelection or 
reappointment) of any officer or director of a corporation operating the 
business of an importer of tobacco products, or upon any occurrence 
which results in a person acquiring ownership or control of more than 
ten percent in aggregate of the outstanding stock of such corporation, 
the importer must, within 30 days of such action, so notify the 
appropriate ATF officer in writing, giving the identity of such person. 
In the event that the acquisition of ten or more percent in aggregate of 
the outstanding stock of such corporation results in a change of control 
of such corporation, the provisions of Sec. 275.226 will apply. When 
there is any change in the authority furnished under Sec. 275.196 for 
officers to act on behalf of the corporation the importer must 
immediately so notify the appropriate ATF officer in writing.


<R05>
Sec. 275.226  Change in control of a corporation.

    Where the issuance, sale, or transfer of the stock of a corporation 
operating as an importer of tobacco products results in a change in the 
identity of the principal stockholders exercising actual or legal 
control of the operations of the corporation, the corporate importer 
must make application on ATF Form 5230.4 for a new permit within 30 days 
after the change occurs. Otherwise, the present permit will be 
automatically terminated at the expiration of such 30-day period, and 
the importer will dispose of all tobacco products on hand, in accordance 
with this part, make a concluding report, in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 275.206, and surrender his permit with such report. 
If the application for a new permit is timely made, the present permit 
will continue in effect pending final action with respect to such 
application.

an amended permit.


<R05>
