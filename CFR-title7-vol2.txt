                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 1998), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.

[[Page vii]]

    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

The certificate shall show the identification of the cotton according to 
the information in the possession of the Marketing Services Office, the 
classification of the cotton according to its grade and length of staple 
and such other facts as the Director may require. As soon as practicable

Service located at another point to certify the results of any 
classification or Micronaire determination upon the basis of information 
furnished by them, notwithstanding any other provisions of this section.

Sec. 27.98  Value of grade where no sale; determination.

    As provided in Sec. 27.96, whenever no sale of a particular grade of 
cotton shall have been made on a given day in a particular spot market, 
the value of such grade in the market on that day will be determined as 
follows:
    (a) If on such given day there shall have been in such market both a 
sale of any higher grade and a sale of any lower grade, the average of 
the declines, or advances, or decline and advance, as the case may be,

deducted from, or added to, as the case may be, the value, on the last 
preceding business day, of the grade the value of which on such given 
day is sought to be ascertained.
    (b) If on such given day there shall have been in such market a sale 
of either a higher or a lower grade, but not sales of both, the decline 
or advance of the next higher or the next lower grade so sold shall be 
deducted from, or added to, as the case may be, the value on the last 
preceding business day of the grade the value of which on such given day 
is sought to be ascertained.
    (c) If on such given day there shall have been in such market no 
sale of spot cotton of any grade, the value of each grade shall be 
deemed to be the same as its value therein on the last preceding 
business day, unless in the meantime there shall have been bona fide 
bids and offers, or sales of hedged cotton, or other sales of cotton, or 
changes in prices of futures contracts made subject to the act, which in 
the usual course of business would clearly establish a rise or fall in 
the value of spot cotton in such market, in which case such rise or fall 
may be calculated and added to or deducted from the value on the 
preceding business day of cotton of all grades affected thereby.

Sec. 28.23  Suspension or revocation of license.

    (a) Any license issued to a warehouse or gin to sample cotton may be 
suspended or revoked, following notice and opportunity for hearing, if 
the licensee has knowingly or carelessly sampled cotton improperly, or 
has submitted improper samples for classification, or has violated any 
provision of the Act or the regulations, or has used the license, or 
allowed it to be used, for any improper purpose.
    (b) Procedure. (1) All cases arising under this paragraph shall be 
conducted under the Uniform Rules of Practice, 7 CFR 1.130 et seq., and 
instituted upon a complaint filed by the Administrator.
    (2) In all cases except those involving willfulness, or in which the 
public health, interest, or safety otherwise requires, prior to the 
institution of a formal proceeding, the Administrator shall give written 
notice to the licensee of facts or conduct which appear to warrant 
institution of such a proceeding and shall afford the licensee the 
opportunity, within a reasonable time, to demonstrate or achieve 
compliance with the Act and regulations.
    (c) Suspension pending adjudication. In any situation where the 
integrity of sampling procedures would be seriously jeopardized if a 
license remained valid pending formal adjudication, the Administrator 
may temporarily suspend the license effective on or after the third day 
after mailing notice thereof to the licensee's last know address. Notice 
of temporary suspension may be made at or after the filing of a 
complaint and shall contain the reasons for the action.

temporary suspension if practicable, or within 2 days of oral notice, 
stating the reasons and grounds for temporary suspension.
    (3) A licensee may request a formal hearing procedure following 
receipt of oral or written notice of temporary suspension.
    (e) During any period in which the cotton sampling license of a 
warehouse or gin is suspended or revoked, the Division will not accept

<R05>
Sec. 28.25  Samples for Form A determination.

    Samples for Form A determination shall be drawn, handled, 
identified, and shipped by a licensed warehouse according to the methods 
and procedures specified in this section. Any samples or set of samples 
which do not meet these specified requirements may be rejected by the 
Area Director.
    (a) Samples shall be freshly drawn.
    (b) Each sample shall consist of two portions, one drawn from each 
side of the bale. Each portion shall be at least six (6) inches wide and 
approximately twelve (12) inches long and shall weigh at least three (3) 
ounces.
    (c) Where it is necessary to draw two sets of samples, a single cut 
should be made in each side of the bale, and the portion of cotton 
removed from each cut should be broken in half across the layers to 
provide two complete samples. In those cases where this method would 
result in samples of insufficient length, it will be acceptable to split 
the sample lengthwise along the layers provided the outside portion from 
each side is submitted for the official classification.
    (d) Dressing, trimming, or discarding part of the sample is 
prohibited. No part of the cotton or pieces of bagging, leaf, grass, 
dirt, sand, or any other material shall be removed from either side of 
the sample.

[[Page 28]]

    (e) A coupon showing the correct warehouse bale number and name and 
address of warehouse shall be placed between the two portions of each 
sample.
    (f) Samples shall be identified and sacked immediately after they 
are cut without further handling prior to shipment to the Classing 
Office.
    (g) Samples shall be addressed to and mailed, shipped, or delivered 
direct to the Classing Office serving the territory in which the 
warehouse is located. Samples shall in no case be consigned or routed 
through the owner or custodian of the cotton. Samples mailed or shipped 
shall be prepaid.
    (h) The Area Director may require that any licensed warehouse shall 
provide the crop year, gin name and gin bale number for each sample 
submitted whenever the Area Director deems that such information is 
necessary in order to assure that each sample is properly identified 
with the correct bale of cotton.
    (i) The licensed warehouse shall cooperate with employees of the 
Division making inspections of sampling procedures, and shall draw or 
permit the drawing of such additional samples, without charge as may be 
deemed necessary to appraise sampling procedures.

construed, respectively, to mean:
    (a) Cotton of perished staple. Cotton that has had the strength of 
fiber, as ordinarily found in cotton, destroyed or unduly reduced 
through exposure to the weather either before picking or after baling, 
or through heating by fire, or on account of water packing, or by other 
causes.
    (b) Micronaire (mike) reading. The measurement of the fiber fineness 
and maturity, in combination, of cotton as determined by an airflow 
instrument. For any cotton that has a micronaire reading of 2.6 or 
lower, the Classing Office will enter the micronaire reading on all 
classification memoranda issued for such cotton.
    (c) Gin-cut cotton. Cotton that shows damage in ginning through 
cutting by the saws, to an extent that reduces its value more than two 
grades.
    (d) Reginned cotton. Cotton that has passed through the ginning 
process more than once, and cotton that, after having been ginned, has 
been subjected to a cleaning process and then baled.

[[Page 30]]

    (e) Repacked cotton. Cotton that is composed of factors', brokers', 
or other samples, or of loose or miscellaneous lots collected and 
rebaled, or cotton in a bale which is composed of cotton from two or 
more smaller bales or parts of bales that are combined after the cotton 
leaves the gin.
    (f) False packed cotton. Cotton in a bale (1) containing substances 
entirely foreign to cotton; (2) containing damaged cotton in the 
interior with or without any indication of such damage upon the 
exterior; (3) composed of good cotton upon the exterior and decidedly 
inferior cotton in the interior, in such manner as not to be detected by 
customary examination; or (4) containing pickings or linters worked into 
the bale.
    (g) Mixed packed cotton. Cotton in a bale which, in the sample taken 
therefrom, shows (1) a difference of three or more grades, or (2) a 
difference of three or more color groups, or (3) a difference in length 
of staple of one-eighth inch or more. For purposes of this paragraph, 
White Cotton (including the Plus grades), Light Gray Cotton, and Gray 
Cotton shall constitute one color group, and Light Spotted Cotton, 
Spotted Cotton, Tinged Cotton, and Yellow Stained Cotton shall each 
constitute a color group.
    (h) Water-packed cotton. Cotton in a bale that has been penetrated 
by water during the baling process, causing damage to the fiber, or a 
bale that through exposure to the weather or by other means, while 
apparently dry on the exterior, has been damaged by water in the 
interior.

    Source: Sections 28.601 to 28.603 appear at 30 FR 7239, May 29, 
1965, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 28.601  Official cotton standards for fiber fineness and maturity.

    The official cotton standards of the United States for fiber 
fineness and maturity shall be the measure of such qualities, in 
combination, provided by air flow instrument tests in terms of 
micronaire readings in accordance with the procedure specified in 
Sec. 28.603.


<R05>
Sec. 28.602  Terms of designations.

    The fiber fineness and maturity of any cotton shall be designated by 
the micronaire reading obtained from an air flow instrument test for a 
specimen of the cotton as determined under Sec. 28.603, e.g., 4.1, 4.2, 
4.3, etc. To simplify recording, the decimal point may be omitted, and 
the micronaire reading recorded as 41, 42, 43, etc.


<R05>
Sec. 28.603  Procedures for air flow tests of micronaire reading.

    In determining in terms of micronaire readings, the fiber fineness 
and maturity, in combination, of cotton, the following procedures shall 
apply:
    (a) Facilities and equipment shall include:
    (1) Air flow instrument complete with accessories to measure the 
fineness and maturity, in combination, of cotton in terms of micronaire 
reading on the curvilinear scale adopted in September 1950 by the 
Department of Agriculture, or its equivalent.
    (2) A suitable supply of compressed air filtered to remove moisture 
and other impurities.
    (3) Balance or scales suitable for accurately weighing the specimens 
required for the particular instrument.
    (4) International Calibration Cotton Standards with established 
micronaire reading values for calibration of the air flow instrument.
    (b) The instrument shall be calibrated each day before routine 
testing begins, as follows:
    (1) The air shall be allowed to flow through the instrument until 
the indicator stabilizes.
    (2) Specimens from at least two of the calibration cottons shall be 
tested to insure proper calibration of the instrument. The instrument 
shall be considered in calibration if the values obtained on the test 
specimens agree with the established values of the calibration cottons 
within 0.1 micronaire reading.
    (c) Testing of the cotton specimen shall be performed as follows:
    (1) Approximately the same amount of cotton shall be taken from each 
side of the sample for a test specimen. The weight of the test specimen 
shall be that weight prescribed for the air flow instrument being used.
    (2) The weighed specimen shall be tested in a properly calibrated 
instrument.
    (3) The specimen shall be inserted into the specimen holder of the 
instrument so that the mass of fibers is well distributed within the 
specimen holder.
    (4) The air shall then be allowed to flow through the specimen in 
accordance with the method of operation of the instrument.
    (5) The position of the instrument indicator shall be determined to 
the nearest 0.1 micronaire reading when it becomes stable.
    (d) The accuracy of the instrument shall be checked at least every 2 
hours

[[Page 46]]

during operation by testing appropriate calibration cottons. If the 
value obtained on a specimen from the calibration cotton is outside the 
established limits of 0.1 micronaire reading, or when successive 
readings show the results to be within the established limits, but 
consistently high or low, the instrument and technique shall be 
thoroughly checked to remedy the discrepancies. Additional tests using 
calibration cottons shall be made until acceptable results are obtained 
before routine testing is resumed.

<R05>
Sec. 28.908  Samples.

    (a) Only one sample to be submitted. Only one sample from each bale 
of eligible cotton shall be submitted for classification under this 
subpart. This does not prohibit the submission of an additional sample 
from a bale for review classification if the producer so desires.
    (b) Drawing of samples manually. (1) Each cut sample shall be drawn 
from the bale after it is tied out following the ginning process, and 
shall be approximately 6 ounces in weight, not less than 3 ounces of 
which are to be drawn from each side of the bale: Provided, That each 
sample from a bale of American Pima cotton shall be approximately 10 
ounces in weight, not less than 5 ounces of which are to be drawn from 
each side of the bale.
    (2) Where it is necessary to draw two sets of samples, a single cut 
should be made in each side of the bale, and the portion of cotton 
removed from each cut should be broken in half across the layers to 
provide two complete samples. In those cases where this method would 
result in samples of insufficient length, it will be acceptable to split 
the sample lengthwise along the layers, provided the outside portion 
from each side is submitted for the official classification.
    (c) Mechanical sampling. Samples may be drawn in gins equipped with 
mechanical samplers approved by the Division and operated according to 
sampling instructions furnished by the Director or an authorized 
representative. Such samples shall not be less than 6 ounces in weight.
    (d) Samples must be representative. Each sample must be 
representative of the bale from which drawn.
    (e) Handling samples. Samples shall not be dressed or trimmed and 
shall be carefully handled in such manner as not to cause loss of leaf, 
sand, or other material, or otherwise change their representative 
character. Samples shall be handled only by employees of the licensee 
prior to shipment or delivery to the cotton classing office of the 
Division.
    (f) Identifying and shipping samples. Each sample shall be 
identified with a tag, supplied or approved by the Division, bearing the 
gin or warehouse number of the bale from which the sample was drawn and 
the name and address of the producer of the bale. The tag shall be 
placed between the two halves of the sample, the sample tightly rolled 
and enclosed in a package or bag for shipment. Each package or bag shall 
be labeled or marked with the name and address of the licensed gin or 
warehouse. The packages shall be shipped or delivered direct to the 
cotton classing office serving the territory in which the cotton is 
ginned. Samples that were drawn by a mechanical sampler at the gin may 
be transported with the bales to the warehouse and then shipped or 
delivered direct to the classing office by the warehouse.
    (g) Request for classification. Samples received from a licensed gin 
or warehouse with the identification tag required in Sec. 28.908(f) 
shall constitute a request for classification service by the producer.

    (a) Additional sale means an additional auction sale proposed to be 
conducted on a designated market.
    (b) Adequate set of buyers means 5 or more buyers representing 5 or

reasonably be expected to purchase at least two-thirds of the total U.S. 
production of the kind of tobacco for

[[Page 61]]

which the additional services are requested.
    (c) Auction market means a marketing center containing one or more

auction sales on an auction market.
    (d) Bona fide auction sale and auction sale mean the buying and 
selling of tobacco offered by producers by the auction process which 
customarily and usually consists of an adequate set of buyers; an

opening bid on each lot; and a ticket marker who records the applicable 
sales data on each lot.
    (e) Designated market means an auction market designated by the 
Secretary under section 5 of the Tobacco Inspection Act including the 
town or city which is the population center of the market and whose name 
the market bears and all of the geographical area within 5 road miles of 
the boundaries of said city or town as they are constituted on January 
1, 1993. Provided, That any warehouse beyond those boundaries which 
received tobacco inspection and price support services during the 1992 
marketing season shall continue to receive such services at the same 
location regardless of any prohibition contained herein: And further 
provided, That this geographical limitation may be waived by the 
Secretary after a hearing held pursuant to Secs. 29.2 and 29.3.
    (f) Secretary means the Secretary of Agriculture of the United

FR 17097, Mar. 31, 1977; 58 FR 21343, Apr. 21, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 29.2  Policy statement.

    Inspection and price support services currently provided in auction 
marketing areas are adequate and the lack of these services is not a 
limiting factor to accelerated marketings or the extension of price 
support to producers. Consequently, the extension of inspection and 
price support services, without limitation even though the cost of such 
service is paid by the seller, would not contribute to the effectuation 
of the purposes of either of these services. The additional cost 
incident to the unlimited extension of these services would be 
unjustifiable and excessive in relation to the total quantity of tobacco 
available for market. Accordingly, inspection and price support services 
shall be made available on new markets at warehouses which are located 
beyond the geographical limitation for ``designated markets'' set forth 
in Sec. 29.1(e), and additional sales for other than flue-cured tobacco 
only as hereinafter provided. With regard to flue-cured tobacco, 
allocation of inspection services is based on producer designation, as 
provided for in 7 CFR 1464.2(e)(2)(iii), see subpart G. Also, since 
these services shall be made available to new markets to warehouses 
which are located beyond the geographical limitation for ``designated 
markets'' set forth in Sec. 29.1(e), and additional sales only as herein 
provided, referenda incident to market designations shall not be 
conducted until auction markets seeking designation have qualified for 
inspection and price support services as herein provided.
    (a) Reasonable inspection and price support services. The extension 
of tobacco inspection and price support services to new markets to 
warehouses

[[Page 62]]

which are located beyond the geographical limitation for ``designated 
markets'' set forth in Sec. 29.1(e), and additional sales will be 
conditioned upon the reasonableness of such services existing in the 
marketing area of the proposed new market or additional sale. 
Transactions in tobacco as conducted at auction markets customarily 
involve the sale of tobacco at a bona fide auction sale. Determination 
with respect to reasonableness, and consequently with respect to 
granting or denying additional services, will be based on evidence (1) 
that the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical 
limitation for ``designated markets'' set forth in Sec. 29.1(e), or 
additional sale will function as a bona fide auction sale, and (2) that 
additional services are justifiable in relation to other market data, 
including the volume of tobacco produced in the area surrounding the 
proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical 
limitation for ``designated markets'' set forth in Sec. 29.1(e), or 
additional sale; the roads and road distances involved in moving tobacco 
to the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical 
limitation for ``designated markets'' set forth in Sec. 29.1(e), or 
additional sale in relation to other tobacco marketing centers; the 
relative availability or congestion of all facilities for redrying and 
packing tobacco handled or to be handled in the proposed new market, 
warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for ``designated 
markets'' set forth in Sec. 29.1(e), or additional sale; the location of 
other auction markets on which tobacco produced in the marketing area of 
the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical 
limitation for ``designated markets'' set forth in Sec. 29.1(e), or 
additional sale may be marketed; the number of tobacco growers to be 
affected by the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the 
geographical limitation for ``designated markets'' set forth in 
Sec. 29.1(e), or additional sale; the volume of tobacco likely to be 
sold in the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the 
geographical limitation for ``designated markets'' set forth in 
Sec. 29.1(e), or additional sale; the relationship of sales in the 
proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical 
limitation for ``designated markets'' set forth in Sec. 29.1(e), or 
additional sale to sales in other auction markets in the producing area 
for that kind of tobacco; other economic factors affecting the marketing 
of tobacco, by growers, in the marketing area of the proposed new 
market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for 
``designated markets'' set forth in Sec. 29.1(e), or additional sale and 
in the producing area for that kind of tobacco, including limitations on 
sales imposed by any marketing agreement and/or order, or by any other 
means; and also, as to flue-cured tobacco, data with regard to producer 
designations which shall include, but not be limited to, the markets and 
warehouses currently available for the producers, who would be eligible 
to designate the new market or, warehouse located beyond the 
geographical limitation for ``designated markets'' set forth in 
Sec. 29.1(e), who already designate and who desire to designate the new 
market.
    (b) Order of priority. If the Secretary finds that there are 
insufficient qualified tobacco inspectors available to service 
adequately all applicants otherwise found to be qualified for additional 
inspection service pursuant to this subpart for a kind of tobacco, those 
applicants found to be eligible for additional services on auction 
markets designated for mandatory inspection shall be given priority over 
applicants for additional inspection service on other auction markets. 
If it becomes necessary to determine which of several qualified 
applicants having an equal order of priority under the preceding 
sentence shall receive additional inspection and price support services, 
those auction sales or auction markets where the greatest number of 
growers needing such service may be served with the qualified inspectors 
shall have priority. If an application for an additional sale on a 
designated market is denied for lack of qualified

[[Page 63]]

inspectors, the Secretary, on application from such market, may 
temporarily suspend the requirement of inspection and certification on 
such market pursuant to section 5 of the Tobacco Inspection Act.
    (c) Price support services to be through warehouses. Price support 
services on any auction market will be offered through tobacco auction 
warehouses operating in such market, and, notwithstanding any provision 
of this subpart, the offering of price support services through any 
auction warehouse located on any auction market will be conditioned upon 
a qualified, responsible warehouseman entering into an approved auction 
warehouse contract under the provisions of the applicable tobacco price 
support program, published at part 1464 of this title.

Hearing Clerk, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250. 
Applications which are not received by the Hearing Clerk on or before 
the foregoing cutoff date for the kind of tobacco shall be rejected as 
untimely filed. After denial of an application for additional inspection 
and price support services for a marketing season, no application from 
the same auction market or proposed new market shall be considered for 
the next consecutive marketing season, unless the application contains a 
statement by the applicant setting forth new facts that constitute 
evidence of such a substantial change in conditions since the previous 
hearing as the review committee as specified in paragraph (h) of this 
section deems would warrant such further hearing.
    (b) Form and content of application. The application shall be in 
writing, shall set forth the grounds for the application and shall be 
signed by the applicant or applicants. If an applicant is a corporation, 
the application shall be executed by a responsible officer of such

address and form of business organization of each party to the 
application and the location of the proposed new market or additional 
sale.
    (c) Hearings on applications. Following the closing date for filing 
applications for each kind of tobacco, a hearing or hearings shall be 
held on the applications, if any, filed for additional inspection and 
price support services for the kind of tobacco in question. Such hearing 
or hearings shall be scheduled to begin within 60 days following the 
closing date for such applications. Notice of hearing shall be issued by 
the Secretary, filed with the Hearing Clerk, and published in the 
Federal Register, and a copy shall be mailed by the Hearing Clerk to 
each applicant. Such publication and mailing shall be not less than 5 
days prior to the opening of the hearing.
    (d) Hearing officer. A hearing officer shall preside over each such 
hearing. The hearing officer shall determine the order of procedure at 
the hearing, shall have power to administer oaths and affirmations, to 
rule on and admit evidence, and, following the opening of the hearing, 
to recess the hearing to such other times and places as he deems 
desirable or necessary.
    (e) Scope of hearing and burden of proof. Each applicant shall have 
the burden of presenting evidence relative to the factors specified in 
Sec. 29.2(a).
    (f) Record and evidence. The proceedings at each such hearing shall 
be transcribed verbatim. All oral testimony shall be under oath or 
affirmation. All documentary exhibits shall be submitted in triplicate 
by the person offering the same. The Hearing Officer shall, insofar as 
possible, exclude testimony and exhibits which are irrelevant, 
immaterial, or not of the sort upon which responsible persons are 
accustomed to

[[Page 64]]

rely. Cross-examination shall be allowed only to the extent that the 
Hearing Officer in his discretion deems it desirable or necessary to 
develop the material facts.
    (g) Briefs. If requested at the hearing, the presiding officer shall 
fix a time, not to exceed 20 days from the close of the hearing, within 
which interested persons may mail briefs to the Hearing Clerk.
    (h) Certification and referral. As soon as practicable following the 
close of the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall certify the transcript 
of the proceedings at the hearing together with all exhibits and shall 
transmit the same to the Hearing Clerk for referral to a review 
committee comprised of the Administrator, Agricultural Marketing 
Service, the Administrator, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation 
Service, and a representative of the Office of the Secretary to be 
designated by the Secretary.
    (i) Recommended action. The review committee shall review and 
consider the applications, hearing record, including exhibits, and all 
other available information and data relating to applications for each 
kind of tobacco and shall submit a recommendation thereon to the 
Secretary.
    (j) Final decision. The Secretary shall issue the decision on each 
application and such decision shall be final: Provided, That any 
determination that additional services will be provided may be 
reconsidered and may be vacated if it is subsequently found that any 
material fact upon which such determination was based was materially 
erroneous or false, or that the new market or additional sale in 
question is not functioning as a bona fide auction sale. Such decision 
shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk who shall mail a true copy 
thereof, by certified mail, to the applicant.

                          mandatory inspection


<R05>
Sec. 29.71  Mandatory inspection.

    Mandatory inspection consists of inspecting and certifying tobacco 
under the Act on designated markets before it is offered for sale at 
auction.


<R05>
Sec. 29.72  Where mandatory inspection is required.

    All tobacco offered for sale at auction on a market designated in 
accordance with the Act and Sec. 29.73 shall be inspected and 
certificated under the Act upon the date specified by the Secretary in 
public notice of such designation, and thereafter, except when the 
requirement of such inspection and certification is temporarily 
suspended by the Director in accordance with the Act and the regulations 
in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 29.73  Designation of markets; termination of designation.

    An auction market where tobacco bought or sold thereon at auction or 
the products customarily manufactured therefrom move in commerce may be 
designated under the Act by the Secretary after the Director has advised 
the Secretary that two-thirds of the growers voting in the referendum 
held in accordance with Sec. 29.74 favored the designation of such 
market. When a market is designated by the Secretary, he shall give 
public notice of the fact and in such public notice he shall specify the 
date on which the requirement of inspection and certification of tobacco 
sold at auction on such market shall become effective. The Director may 
temporarily suspend the requirement of inspection and certification on a 
designated market when it is found impracticable to provide such 
services because competent inspectors are not obtainable or because the 
quantity of tobacco available for inspection is insufficient to justify 
the cost of such service. A designation shall terminate automatically at 
the end of any two consecutive marketing seasons during which a 
designated market does not conduct any sales of tobacco at auction. A 
market whose designation is terminated under this section shall be 
considered as a new market, as defined in Sec. 29.1, and any future

[[Page 69]]

application for services shall be filed and determined in accordance 
with the provisions of Secs. 29.3 and 29.2.
[38 FR 27599, Oct. 5, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 29.74  Growers' referendum.

    (a) Method of conducting. Any referendum held as provided in section 
5 of the Act shall be conducted by the Division in accordance with this 
section. The Director shall determine (1) the market or group of markets 
to be covered by a referendum; (2) when a referendum is to be held; and 
(3) the period during which growers, entitled to vote therein, may cast 
their ballots. When a referendum is held for a group of markets, the 
result of such referendum may be construed to apply either individually 
or collectively to such markets. Before holding a referendum, the 
Division shall establish from the records of the collectors of internal 
revenue for the preceding marketing season, or in the absence of such 
records then from such other reliable sources of information as are 
available, a list showing the names of all growers who are entitled to 
vote in the referendum, and from the list so established the eligibility 
of growers to vote in a referendum shall be determined by the Division: 
Provided, That if a grower, whose name appears on such lists for two or 
more markets selling the same class of tobacco, votes in one referendum 
for a market selling such type, he shall not be eligible to vote in a 
referendum for any other market selling such type. If no growers sold 
tobacco at auction on a proposed new market during the preceding 
marketing season, then the list of growers entitled to vote in the 
referendum shall be comprised of the growers residing in the county 
where the pRoposed new market is located and in the adjacent counties.
    (b) Form of ballot. Ballots to be used for voting in a referendum 
held under the Act shall be in a form approved for the purpose by the 
Director.
    (c) Distribution of ballots. Ballots to be used by growers in a 
referendum under the act may be distributed by mail or otherwise as the 
Director may select. The Director may establish and publish a list of 
voting places for the purpose of any referendum and distribute ballots 
therefrom. When ballots are not mailed directly to growers who are 
entitled to vote, insofar as their addresses are known, the Director 
shall announce the voting places at which ballots can be secured, and 
copies of such announcement shall be given to the press and mailed, for 
posting and distribution, to the post offices of the market or group of 
markets covered by the referendum and to post offices in the vicinity of

in a referendum shall be examined to verify the eligibility of the voter 
and the Director shall have compiled the result of the referendum and 
furnish the Secretary a statement showing whether or not two-thirds of 
the growers voting favored the designation of the market or group of 
markets covered by the referendum. In verifying votes, ballots which do 
not show the desire of the voter, or ballots which are defective or 
illegible, or ballots on which the signature or other identification 
does not correspond with the established list shall not be counted. The 
choice of any individual voter shall not be divulged by any official of 
the Division, except to the Secretary when requested. Votes, ballots,

    (a) All tobacco subject to mandatory inspection on a designated 
market shall be made readily accessible for inspection.

[[Page 70]]

    (b)(1) Each warehouse operator shall block off in his warehouse 
adequate space for each basket of flue-cured tobacco offered for sale on 
the auction market, and shall prominently number each 10th basket space. 
The blocking and numbering arrangement shall follow the order of sale; 
that is, down one row and back on the adjacent row.
    (2) Each warehouse shall display a plainly visible sign with the 
total number of baskets of flue-cured tobacco allotted to be sold each 
day. Each warehouse operator shall designate to the inspector the number 
of the starting space for each day's sale and grading will begin at this 
designated space. All spaces, whether empty or full, shall be counted. 
No tobacco will be graded beyond the numbered space corresponding with 
the number of baskets allotted for each day's sale. The grading shall 
proceed from the beginning point of the sale to the closing point of the 
sale in an orderly sequence. An inspector shall not go back and grade 
any basket of tobacco placed in a space which was empty when grading for 
the day's sales passed such sales space.
    (c) Before starting inspection of the day's sale of flue-cured 
tobacco in each warehouse, the head grader or market supervisor grader 
shall determine if there is compliance with the requirements of 
paragraph (b) of this section. If he determines that the prescribed 
system has not been followed, the inspectors shall proceed to the next 
scheduled warehouse and shall return to the noncomplying warehouse on 
the next sales day for such warehouse when the head grader or market 
supervisor grader shall again determine if the prescribed system has 
been followed before starting the inspection.
    (d) A reduction in daily sales for any warehouse resulting from 
noncompliance with this section, including empty spaces, shall not 
prevent the maximum number of baskets allotted per day per set of buyers 
from being sold in the market.

    (a)(1) Each lot of burley tobacco displayed for sale on auction 
warehouse floors shall have a minimum space of 24 inches from butts to 
butts between the rows. Distances between lots of tobacco within the row 
shall be no less than 8 inches between immediately adjacent lots.
    (2) The number of bales on a pallet shall not exceed eight. Tobacco 
packed in bales shall have the stems turned toward the aisle.
    (3) Each warehouse operator shall display a plainly visible sign 
showing the total number of lots of burley tobacco allotted to be sold 
each day. Such sign shall be displayed at the point of lots where the 
days' sales will conclude and no additional tobacco shall be graded 
beyond that point.
    (4) Each warehouse operator shall arrange his entire day's sale in a 
continuous and orderly arrayed sequence of lots and rows of tobacco. Any 
arrangement of tobacco in rows of progressively varying lengths, or any 
deviations from an orderly arrayed sequence of lots and rows of tobacco, 
shall have prior approval of the Set Work Leader or Circuit Supervisor.
    (5) Each warehouse operator shall designate to the Set Work Leader 
or Circuit Supervisor the starting point or lot for each day's sale, and 
counting and grading will begin at this designated point and proceed to 
the closing point of the sale in an orderly sequence. All lot spaces, 
containing or not containing a lot of tobacco, and all lots of tobacco, 
covered or uncovered, shall be counted and included in the daily sales 
allotment. Lots of tobacco shall not be removed, added, rearranged, or 
substituted between the time they are counted for the day's sale and the 
time they are graded for the day's sale, provided, however, that with 
prior approval of the Set Work Leader or Circuit Supervisor compensating 
lots of tobacco may be substituted for empty spaces and covered lots 
included in a daily sales count.
    (6) Each operator of a warehouse at which baled burley tobacco is 
offered

[[Page 71]]

for sale shall open the particular bale, in a lot of tobacco, chosen by 
a grader for inspection and reseal that bale after inspection.
    (7) Each seller, by offering burley tobacco for sale, certifies that 
the lot inspected by a grader is representative of the grade of all the 
tobacco in that lot, that the leaf was stalk-cured, that the bales do 
not contain any foreign matter or material, and are not nested.
    (b) Before starting inspection of the day's sale of burley tobacco 
in each warehouse, the Set Work Leader or Circuit Supervisor shall 
determine if there is compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a) 
of this section. If he determines that the prescribed requirements have 
not been followed, the inspector shall proceed to the next sale or sales 
as originally scheduled for that day and grade the number of lots of 
tobacco scheduled for such sale or sales, and shall return to the 
noncomplying warehouse on the next regularly scheduled sales day for 
such warehouse, at which time the Set Work Leader or Circuit Supervisor 
shall again determine if the prescribed system has been followed before 
starting the inspection. If noncompliance or failure to observe 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are discovered after 
inspection for the day's sale has started, the inspector shall 
discontinue inspection and proceed to the next sale or sales scheduled 
for that day and shall return to the noncomplying warehouse on the next 
regularly scheduled sales day for such warehouse.
    (c) The provisions of this section shall not preclude the 
application of other administrative remedies or the institution of 
criminal proceedings in appropriate cases as provided by the Act.

Sec. 29.78  Changes or alterations.

    No change or alteration shall be made, in the weight or other 
identification of the lot, on a mandatory inspection ticket after the 
certification of type and grade by an official inspector, and any such 
change or alteration shall constitute and be construed as a change or 
alteration in the certificate issued or authorized under the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 29.79  Disposition of ticket.

    One copy of the mandatory inspection ticket shall be attached to, or 
placed on, the tobacco certificated as a further identification of the 
lot and all copies of such ticket shall become null and void when such

Director, one copy of such ticket, showing (a) the certification of type 
and grade; (b) the weight and other identification; and (c) the details 
of the sale at auction, shall be delivered by the warehouseman to the 
Division or the head inspector of the market.


<R05>
Sec. 29.80  Announcing grades.

    The grade of each lot of tobacco as certified by an official 
inspector on a designated market shall be clearly announced by the

floor. While inspectors are engaged in grading the day's sale, all 
requests for information concerning the grade designation on or requests 
to review the grade of any lot of tobacco shall be made only to the head 
grader or to the market supervisor grader: Provided, however, That the 
producer of a lot of tobacco may discuss the grading of his tobacco with 
the inspector while he is performing his grading operations.
    (b) In the event that the head grader or market supervisor grader 
determines that a person has violated any provision of this section, 
inspection ticket(s) if already issued on the lot(s) of unsold tobacco 
involved shall be null and void and no further inspection shall be 
performed on such lot(s) offered for sale by the warehouseman in whose 
premises the violation occurred until the next regularly-scheduled sale 
for such warehouse: Provided, That if violation consists of talking to 
the inspector while he is grading the tobacco, a warning shall be given 
on first offense and penalty provisions shall apply on any subsequent 
offense. A reduction in daily sales for any warehouse resulting from a 
violation of this section shall not prevent the maximum number of 
baskets or pounds allotted per day per set of buyers from being sold in 
a designated market.
    (c) The provisions of this section shall not preclude the 
application of other administrative remedies or the institution of 
criminal proceedings in appropriate cases as provided by the Act.

review for the purpose of verification or confirmation any tobacco which 
he has certificated, and any supervising official may review the work of

certification, the inspector, sampler, or weigher concerned, or 
supervising official shall immediately correct the error by making an 
appropriate change in the certificate or by canceling the certificate 
and issuing a new certificate in lieu thereof. Any correction made on a

                           elements of quality


<R05>
Sec. 29.1101  Elements of quality and degrees of each element.

    These standardized words or terms are used to describe tobacco 
quality and to assist in interpreting grade specifications. Tobacco 
attributes or characteristics which constitute quality are designated as 
elements of quality. The range within each element is expressed by the 
use of words or terms designated as degrees. These several degrees are 
arranged to show their relative value, but the actual value of each 
degree varies with group.

                                  rules


<R05>
Sec. 29.1106  Rules.

    The application of these official standard grades shall be in 
accordance with the following rules.


<R05>
Sec. 29.1107  Rule 1.

    Each grade shall be treated as a subdivision of a particular type. 
When the grade is stated in an inspection certificate, the type also 
shall be stated.

    The determination of a grade shall be based upon a thorough 
examination of a lot of tobacco or of an official sample of the lot.


<R05>
Sec. 29.1109  Rule 3.

    In drawing an official sample from a hogshead or other package of 
tobacco, three or more breaks shall be made at such points and in such 
manner as the inspector or sampler may find necessary to determine the 
kinds of tobacco and the percentage of each kind contained in the lot. 
All breaks shall be made so that the tobacco contained in the center of 
the package is visible to the sampler. Tobacco shall be drawn from at 
least three breaks from which a representative sample shall be selected. 
The sample shall include tobacco of each different group, quality, 
color, length, and kind found in the lot in proportion to the quantities 
of each contained in the lot.


<R05>
Sec. 29.1110  Rule 4.

    All standard grades must be clean unless otherwise noted by a 
special factor.


<R05>
Sec. 29.1111  Rule 5.

    The grade assigned to any lot of tobacco shall be a true 
representation of the tobacco at the time of inspection and 
certification. If, at any time, it is found that a lot of tobacco does 
not comply with the specifications of the grade previously assigned, it 
shall not thereafter be represented as such grade.

[[Page 89]]


<R05>
Sec. 29.1112  Rule 6.

specifications of such grade.


<R05>
Sec. 29.1115  Rule 9.

    The use of any grade may be restricted by the Director during any 
marketing season when it is found that the grade is not needed or 
appears in insufficient volume to justify its use.


<R05>
Sec. 29.1116  Rule 10.

    Any special factor approved by the Director of the Tobacco Division, 
Agricultural Marketing Service, may be used to show a peculiar side or 
characteristic of the tobacco which tends to modify the grade.

limitations established by other rules.) The minor portion must be 
closely related, but may be of a different group, quality, and color 
from the major portion.


<R05>
Sec. 29.1120  Rule 14.

    The application of injury tolerance as an element of quality shall 
be expressed in terms of a percentage. The appraisal of injury shall be 
based upon the percentage of affected leaf surface or the degree of 
injury. In appraising injury, consideration shall be given to the normal 
characteristics of the group as related to injury.

    The application of these official standard grades shall be in 
accordance with the following rules.


<R05>
Sec. 29.2392  Rule 1.

    Each grade shall be treated as a subdivision of a particular type. 
When the grade is stated in an inspection certificate, the type also 
shall be stated.


<R05>
Sec. 29.2393  Rule 2.

    The determination of a grade shall be based upon a thorough 
examination of a lot of tobacco or of an official sample of the lot.


<R05>
Sec. 29.2394  Rule 3.

    In drawing an official sample from a hogshead or other package of 
tobacco, two or more breaks shall be made at such points and in such 
manner as the inspector or sampler may find necessary to determine the 
kinds of tobacco and the percentage of each kind contained in the lot. 
All breaks shall be made so that the tobacco contained in the center of 
the package is visible to the sampler. Tobacco shall be drawn from at 
least two breaks from which a representative sample shall be selected.


<R05>
Sec. 29.2395  Rule 4.

    All standard grades must be clean.


<R05>
Sec. 29.2396  Rule 5.

    The grade assigned to any lot of tobacco shall be a true 
representation of the tobacco at the time of inspection and 
certification. If, at any time, it is found that a lot of tobacco does 
not comply with the specifications of the grade previously assigned it 
shall not thereafter be represented as such grade.


<R05>
Sec. 29.2397  Rule 6.

    A lot of tobacco on the marginal line between two colors shall be 
placed in the color with which it best corresponds with respect to body 
or other associated elements of quality.


<R05>
Sec. 29.2398  Rule 7.

    Any lot of tobacco which meets the specifications of two grades 
shall be placed in the higher grade. Any lot of tobacco on the marginal 
line between two grades shall be placed in the lower grade.


<R05>
Sec. 29.2399  Rule 8.

    A lot of tobacco meets the specifications of a grade when it is not 
lower in any degree of any element of quality than the minimum 
specifications of such grade.


<R05>
Sec. 29.2400  Rule 9.

    In determining the grade of a lot of tobacco, the lot as a whole 
shall be considered. Minor irregularities which do not affect over 1 
percent of the tobacco shall be overlooked.


<R05>
Sec. 29.2401  Rule 10.

    Any special factor symbol approved by the Director of the Tobacco 
Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, may be used after a grademark 
to show a peculiar side or characteristic of the tobacco which tends to 
modify the grade.


<R05>
Sec. 29.2402  Rule 11.

    Interpretations, the use of specifications, and the meaning of terms 
shall be in accordance with determinations or clarifications made by the 
Chief of the Standards and Testing Branch and approved by the Director.


<R05>
Sec. 29.2403  Rule 12.

    The use of any grade may be restricted by the Director during any 
marketing season, when it is found

[[Page 106]]

that the grade is not needed or appears in insufficient volume to 
justify its use.


<R05>
Sec. 29.2404  Rule 13.

    Length shall be stated in connection with each grade of the A, B and 
C groups and may be stated in connection with the grades of other

length.
[51 FR 40406, Nov. 7, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 29.2406  Rule 15.

    Uniformity shall be expressed in percentages. These percentages 
shall govern the portion of a lot which must meet each specification of 
the grade. The minor portion must be closely related but may be of a 
different group, quality, and color from the major portion. Specified 
percentages of uniformity shall not affect limitations established by 
other rules.


<R05>
Sec. 29.2407  Rule 16.

    Injury tolerance shall be expressed in percentages. The appraisal of 
injury shall be based upon the percentage of affected leaf surface or 
the degree of injury. In appraising injury, consideration shall be given 
to the normal characteristics of the group.


<R05>
Sec. 29.2408  Rule 17.

    Any lot of tobacco of the B, C, or X groups containing over 30

<R05>
Sec. 29.3101  Elements of quality and degrees of each element.

    These standardized words or terms are used to describe tobacco 
quality and to assist in interpreting grade specifications. Tobacco 
attributes or characteristics which constitute quality are designated as 
elements of quality. The range within each element is expressed by the 
use of words or terms designated as degrees. These several degrees are 
arranged to show their relative value, but the actual value of each 
degree varies with type, group, and grade. In each case the first and 
last degrees represent the full range for the element, and the 
intermediate degrees show gradual steps between them.

Sec. 29.3152  Lugs or Cutters (C Group).

    This group consists of leaves normally grown at the midportion of 
the stalk. Cured leaves from this stalk position have a tendency to 
roll, concealing the stem or midrib. Lugs or Cutters have an oblate to 
rounded tip and are usually thin to medium in body. The leaves are 
spready in relation to their length and show little or no ground injury.

Sec. 29.3153  Leaf (B Group).

    This group consists of leaves normally grown above the midpoint of 
the stalk. Cured leaves from the upper stalk position have a tendency to 
fold, concealing the face of the leaf and exposing the stem or midrib. 
These leaves have a pointed tip and generally are medium to heavy in 
body. They are narrower in relation to their length than corresponding 
qualities of the C Group.

    In drawing an official sample from a hogshead or other package of 
tobacco, three or more breaks shall be made at such points and in such 
manner as the inspector or sampler may find necessary to determine the 
kinds of tobacco and the percentage of each kind contained in the lot. 
All breaks shall be made so that the tobacco contained in the center of 
the package is visible to the sampler. Tobacco shall be drawn from at 
least three breaks from which a representative sample shall be selected. 
The sample shall include tobacco of each different group, quality, 
color, length, and kind found in the lot in proportion to the quantities 
of each contained in the lot.

                                  Rules


<R05>
Sec. 29.6086  Rules.

    The application of these official standard grades shall be in 
accordance with the following rules.


<R05>
Sec. 29.6087  Rule 1.

    Each grade shall be treated as a subdivision of a particular type. 
When the grade is stated in an inspection certificate, the type also 
shall be stated.


<R05>
Sec. 29.6088  Rule 2.

    The determination of grade shall be based upon a representative 
sample or a thorough examination of a packing of tobacco.


<R05>
Sec. 29.6089  Rule 3.

    The grade of unsorted tobacco shall be based upon a representative 
sample of the packing. A minimum of 10 percent of the bundles or bales 
shall be selected at random for sampling; a higher

[[Page 154]]

percentage may be sampled at the discretion of the inspector. To obtain 
the sample, a sufficient amount of tobacco shall be drawn to be 
representative of each selected bale. In determining the grade, the 
inspector shall consider the quality of all samples. The grade assigned 
shall represent the quality of the lot as a whole.


<R05>
Sec. 29.6090  Rule 4.

    Standard grades shall be assigned to clean and sound tobacco only.


<R05>
Sec. 29.6091  Rule 5.

    Tobacco leaves shall be placed straight in bundles or bales of 
normal weight, size, and shape with the butts out and tips overlapping 
from 6 to 8 inches or sufficiently to make a level, solid, and uniform 
pack. The sides of the bundles shall be completely covered with paper, 
or other suitable protective material, and tightly bound with not less 
than three large twines spaced so that the tobacco will be held securely 
together. Improperly packed tobacco shall be designated as ``No--G.''


<R05>
Sec. 29.6092  Rule 6.

    The grade assigned to any lot of tobacco shall be a true 
representation of the tobacco at the time of inspection and 
certification. If, at any time, it is found that a lot of tobacco does 
not comply with the specifications of the grade previously assigned, it 
shall not thereafter be represented as such grade.


<R05>
Sec. 29.6093  Rule 7.

    Any lot of tobacco which meets the specifications of two grades 
shall be placed in the higher grade. Any lot of tobacco on the marginal 
line between two grades shall be placed in the lower grade.


<R05>
Sec. 29.6094  Rule 8.

    A lot of tobacco meets the specifications of a grade when it is not 
lower in any degree of any element of quality than the minimum 
specifications of such grade.


<R05>
Sec. 29.6095  Rule 9.

    In determining the grade of a lot of tobacco, the lot as a whole 
shall be considered. Minor irregularities which do not affect over one 
percent of the tobacco shall be overlooked.


<R05>
Sec. 29.6096  Rule 10.

    Interpretations, the use of specifications, and the meaning of terms 
shall be in accordance with determinations or clarifications made by the 
Chief of the Standardization Branch and approved by the Director of the 
Tobacco Division, Agricultural Marketing Service.


<R05>
Sec. 29.6097  Rule 11.

    The use of any grade may be restricted by the Director during any 
marketing season when it is found that the grade is not needed or 
appears in insufficient volume to justify its use.


<R05>
Sec. 29.6098  Rule 12.

    Uniformity shall be expressed in percentages. These percentages 
shall govern the portion of a lot which must meet each specification of 
the grade; the remaining portion must be related. Grade specifications 
state the minimum acceptable degree of each element of quality. 
Specified percentages of uniformity shall not affect limitations 
established by other rules.


<R05>
Sec. 29.6099  Rule 13.

    Injury tolerance shall be expressed in percentages. The appraisal of 
injury shall be based upon the percentage of affected leaf surface or 
the degree of injury, and consideration shall be given to the kinds of 
injury normal to the group or grade.


<R05>
Sec. 29.6100  Rule 14.

    Stem rot shall not exceed 40 percent of the specified injury 
tolerance for any grade.


<R05>
Sec. 29.6101  Rule 15.

    In grade specifications the tolerance of crude shall apply to the 
entire leaf surface of the lot.


<R05>
Sec. 29.6102  Rule 16.

    In grade specifications frozen shall be treated as a separate kind 
of injury and the tolerance shall apply to the entire leaf surface of 
the lot.

[[Page 155]]


<R05>
Sec. 29.6103  Rule 17.

    Tobacco shall be designated as No Grade, using the grademark ``No--
G,'' when it is damaged, dirty, nested, offtype, semicured, wet, 
improperly packed, contains foreign matter, or has an odor foreign to 
the type.


<R05>
Sec. 29.6104  Rule 18.

    Burn shall be determined as the average burning time of leaves 
selected at random from the sample. A minimum of 10 leaves shall be 
selected as representative regardless of the number of bundles or bales 
in the lot. All burn tests shall be made in the bindercutting area on 
the same side of the leaf. The leaf shall be punctured to permit quick 
ignition when placed over a candle, alcohol lamp, or electrical-lighting 
device. Good burn shall average 6 seconds or longer; fair burn, 3 to 5 
seconds; and poor burn, under 3 seconds. B1 and B2 shall require good 
burn and B3, fair burn.

           Subpart D--Orders of Designation of Tobacco Markets

    Authority: Sec. 5, 49 Stat. 732, as amended by sec. 157(a)(1), 95 
Stat. 374 (7 U.S.C. 511d).


<R05>
Sec. 29.8001  Designation of tobacco markets.

    The Act of Congress approved August 23, 1935 (49 Stat. 731; 7 
U.S.C., Chapter 21A) entitled ``The Tobacco Inspection Act'' contains 
the following provisions:

    Sec. 2. That transactions in tobacco involving the sale thereof at 
auction as commonly conducted at auction markets are affected with a 
public interest; that such transactions are carried on by tobacco 
producers generally and by persons engaged in the business of buying and 
selling tobacco in commerce; that the classification of tobacco 
according to type, grade, and other characteristics affects the prices 
received therefor by producers; that without uniform standards of 
classification and inspection the evaluation of tobacco is susceptible 
to speculation, manipulation, and control, and unreasonable fluctuations 
in prices and quality determinations occur which are detrimental to 
producers and persons handling tobacco in commerce; that such 
fluctuations constitute a burden upon commerce and make the use of 
uniform standards of classification and inspection imperative for the 
protection of producers and others engaged in commerce and the public 
interested therein. * * *
    Sec. 5. That the Secretary is authorized to designate those auction 
markets where tobacco bought and sold thereon at auction, or the 
products customarily manufactured therefrom, moves in commerce. Before 
any market is designated by the Secretary under this section he shall 
determine by referendum the desire of tobacco growers who sold tobacco 
at auction on such market during the preceding marketing season. The 
Secretary may at his discretion hold one referendum for two or more 
markets or for all markets in a type area. No market or group of markets 
shall be designated by the Secretary unless two-thirds of the growers 
voting favor it. The Secretary shall have access to the tobacco records 
of the Collector of Internal Revenue and of the several collectors of 
internal revenue for the purpose of obtaining the names and addresses of 
growers who sold tobacco on any auction market, and the Secretary shall 
determine from said records the eligibility of such grower to vote in 
such referendum, and no grower shall be eligible to vote in more than 
one referendum. After public notice of not less than thirty days that 
any auction market has been so designated by the Secretary, no tobacco 
shall be offered for sale at auction on such market until it shall have 
been inspected and certified by an authorized representative of the 
Secretary according to the standards established under this Act, except 
that the Secretary may temporarily suspend the requirement of inspection 
and certification at any designated market whenever he finds it 
impracticable to provide for such inspection and certification because 
competent inspectors are not obtainable or because the quantity of 
tobacco available for inspection is insufficient to justify the cost of 
such service: Provided, That, in the event competent inspectors are not 
available, or for other reasons, the Secretary is unable to provide for 
such inspection and certification at all auction markets within a type 
area, he shall first designate those auction markets where the greatest 
number of growers may be served with the facilities available to him. No 
fee or charge shall be imposed or collected for inspection or 
certification under this section at any designated auction market. 
Nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to prevent transactions 
in tobacco at markets not designated by the Secretary or at designated 
markets where the Secretary has suspended the requirement of inspection 
or to authorize the Secretary to close any market.

<R05>
Sec. 29.9221  Policy statement.

    Public Law 97-98 enacted on December 22, 1981, amended section 320 
of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, to preserve the 
effectiveness of the tobacco program by discouraging the production of 
tobacco not under quota in states where tobacco farmers have elected to 
comply with marketing quotas. Under the amendment, any tobacco 
represented by the producer as nonquota which is produced in a state 
where producers have approved marketing quotas shall be determined to be 
subject to marketing quotas for the quota tobacco produced in that state 
having the highest price support, with the specific exemptions provided 
for in section 320(b) and set out in 7 CFR parts 724, 725, and 726 of 
these regulations. The regulations in this subpart set out procedures 
for requesting a Tobacco Classification Certificate which would certify 
that the inspected tobacco is readily and distinguishably different from 
all kinds of quota tobacco, as determined through application of the 
standards for inspection and identification of tobacco.

 Subpart G--Policy Statement and Regulations Governing Availability of 
 Tobacco Inspection and Price Support Services to Flue-Cured Tobacco on 
                           Designated Markets

    Authority: Tobacco Inspection Act, 49 Stat. 731 (7 U.S.C. 511 et 
seq.); Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act, 62 Stat. 1070, as 
amended (15 U.S.C. 714 et seq.); sec. 213, Pub. L. 98-180, 97 Stat. 1149

someone other than its producer.
    (d) Nonauction-purchased tobacco means tobacco purchased at other

    (e) Nonauction-purchased resale tobacco means tobacco being offered 
for sale, or sold, at auction by a person who purchased it at other than 
a bona fide auction sale, as defined in 7 CFR 29.1(d), on a designated

[39 FR 17754, May 20, 1974, as amended at 40 FR 31592, July 28, 1975]


<R05>
Sec. 29.9402  Policy statement.

    The sets of inspectors available to serve the flue-cured marketing 
areas are currently adequate to provide inspection service as rapidly as 
tobacco can be purchased, handled and processed by the currently 
existing facilities of the buyers, and the lack of inspection personnel 
is not a limiting factor to accelerated marketings or the extension of 
price support to producers. The sets of buyers assigned to the flue-
cured markets by the buying industry are adequate to purchase tobacco as 
rapidly as it can be handled and processed by the buyers' facilities. 
However, the tobacco ready for marketing during most weeks of the 
marketing season substantially exceeds the quantities which can be 
purchased, handled and processed by the currently existing facilities of 
the buyers. Moreover, the total number of flue-cured markets are 
substantially greater than the number of sets of buyers assigned by the 
buying companies or the number of sets of available inspectors. In this 
situation, about 6 months is required to market a year's crop of flue-
cured tobacco and all warehouses cannot be served at the same time by 
the available sets of inspectors and the sets of buyers assigned by the 
buying companies. As additional sets of inspectors would not relieve the 
situation, inspection service will be provided by assigning the 
available inspectors to the various marketing areas and to warehouses 
within the marketing areas in a manner determined by the Secretary to

[[Page 175]]

provide the best and most equitable service to all growers.


<R05>
Sec. 29.9403  Flue-Cured Tobacco Advisory Committee.

    (a) To assist the Secretary in making the apportionment and 
assignment of inspectors, a Flue-Cured Tobacco Advisory Committee, 
appointed in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 
U.S.C. Appendix I), shall advise and recommend to the Secretary 
marketing area opening dates and selling schedules for both designated 
and undesignated flue-cured tobacco to be sold in each marketing area 
and in each warehouse within each marketing area.
    (b) The Committee shall consist of 39 representatives and 39 
alternates of the flue-cured industry--21 producers, 10 warehousemen, 
and 8 buyers.
    (c) Recommendations to the Secretary or producer membership on the 
Committee will be received from the following organizations: one each 
from the Florida Farm Bureau, the South Carolina Grange, and the Tobacco 
Growers Association of North Carolina, Inc., two each from the Georgia 
Farm Bureau, the South Carolina Farm Bureau, and the Virginia Farm 
Bureau, four from the North Carolina Grange, and eight from the North 
Carolina Farm Bureau.
    (d) Recommendations of the 10 warehouse representatives shall be 
received from the various belt warehouse associations.
    (e) Recommendations for the eight buyer representatives shall be 
received: five from the Tobacco Association of the United States and one 
each from Philip Morris, Inc., P. Lorillard Co. and R. J. Reynolds 
Tobacco Co.

<R05>
Sec. 29.9404  Marketing area opening dates and marketing schedules.

    (a) The Flue-Cured Tobacco Advisory Committee shall recommend, to 
the Secretary, marketing areas in the flue-cured tobacco production area 
and marketing area opening dates and selling schedules for both 
designated and undesignated tobacco for each marketing area and for the 
individual warehouses in each marketing area, which specify the length 
of time inspectors will be available to inspect designated tobacco and 
undesignated tobacco and/or the quantity of designated or undesignated 
tobacco to be marketed in each area and through each warehouse within 
such marketing area. In developing such opening date and selling 
schedules, the Committee shall take into account the following:
    (1) When a sufficient volume of tobacco produced within a specific 
area of the flue-cured tobacco production area will be ready for 
marketing;
    (2) The volume of tobacco ready for marketing which the producers 
have designated under Sec. 1464.2(e) of this title to be sold at 
specific warehouses and also the volume of tobacco ready for marketing 
which has not been so designated by the producer;
    (3) With regard to undesignated tobacco, the Committee shall first 
determine, on the basis of all information available to it, the volume 
of undesignated tobacco in a geographical area, and then shall provide 
sales opportunity for each warehouse to sell an amount of the 
undesignated tobacco available for sale from that geographical area in 
proportion to the amount of tobacco designated to the warehouse in 
comparison to the total amount of tobacco designated in the marketing 
area in which the warehouse is located. Provided, however, that the 
Secretary may authorize additional undesignated sales opportunity if the 
warehouse provided proper proof that it does, in fact, have available 
for sale a volume of tobacco which has not previously been designated 
and which was eligible for designation to that warehouse had the 
producer chosen to designate and that such additional volume of tobacco 
warrants more sales opportunity than allowed by the schedule;
    (4) The processing or redrying capacity of the industry and the 
number of inspectors available to provide inspection service during the 
specific period involved;
    (5) Such other factors or information as may be necessary to develop 
an effective and equitable opening date and selling schedule.
    (b) The Flue-Cured Tobacco Advisory Committee shall thereupon submit 
its

[[Page 176]]

recommended opening date and selling schedules for designated and 
undesignated tobacco and the geographic areas to be included in specific 
marketing areas to the Secretary together with a basis supporting its 
recommendations.

Sec. 29.9405  Issuance of marketing area opening date and selling schedules by the Secretary.

    (a) The Secretary shall review the recommendations of the Flue-Cured 
Tobacco Advisory Committee and based upon such recommendations and the 
basis therefor and such other information as may be available to him, 
shall specify the geographic areas to be encompassed by specific 
marketing areas, set the opening dates for sale within the marketing 
areas and issue the selling schedules for designated and undesignated 
tobacco. The inspection of flue-cured tobacco shall be in accordance 
with said schedules.
    (b) The Flue-Cured Tobacco Advisory Committee shall recommend 
modifications in the opening date and marketing schedule during the

    (b) For each of any two consecutive sales days during the marketing 
season a warehouse may exceed its scheduled sales opportunity for 
designated or undesignated tobacco, but the pounds sold during the 
second or third sales day must be adjusted so the warehouse will be back 
in compliance at the end of the third sales day or no tobacco inspection 
or price support services will be made available on the next succeeding 
sales day. Any such adjustment which is within 100 pounds of the 
required reduction shall be considered as in compliance with this 
section. During the closeout period, if a warehouse sells tobacco in 
excess of that allowed by the sales schedule on either of the last two 
sales days of the marketing season, then such excess sales shall be 
deducted from its scheduled sales opportunity on the first, or more, 
sales days of the next marketing season.
    (c) The amount of the poundage adjustment specified in paragraph (b) 
of this section for a warehouse selling in excess of the sales schedule 
shall be as follows:
    (1) If the excess is 2500 pounds or less of designated producer 
tobacco, the adjustment in producer sales opportunity shall be one pound 
for each pound of excess; sales in excess of 2500 pounds shall be a 
violation of the sales schedule and the adjustment for the first 
violation shall be 2500 pounds plus the larger of 3 pounds for each 
pound in excess of 2500 pounds or 2500 pounds; for the second violation, 
the adjustment shall be 2500 pounds plus the larger of 5 pounds for each 
pound in excess of 2500 pounds or 5000 pounds; and for the third and 
subsequent violations, the adjustment shall be 2500 pounds plus the 
larger of 5 pounds for each pound in excess of 2500 pounds or 50 percent 
of a scheduled day's sales opportunity.
    (2) If the excess is 500 pounds or less of undesignated producer 
tobacco, the adjustment in producer sales opportunity is one pound for 
each pound of excess; if the excess is larger than 500 pounds, the 
adjustment is 500 pounds plus the larger of 3 pounds for each pound in 
excess of 500 pounds or 1000 pounds.
    (3) If the excess is designated producer tobacco that is not 
eligible for sale at the warehouse on the day of the sale, the 
adjustment in producer sales opportunity for the first violation is the 
larger of 3 pounds for each pound in excess or 2500 pounds, and for the 
second and succeeding violations, the larger of 5 pounds for each pound 
in excess or 5000 pounds.
    (d) If, on any sales day, a warehouse does not sell the full 
quantity of designated or undesignated tobacco authorized to be sold at 
such warehouse, the designated or undesignated sales

[[Page 177]]

the opening of the marketing season in which the tobacco is sold, and 
make available to the Secretary such records as are necessary for the 
Secretary to verify the information required by paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (c) Failure to comply with the requirements of this section 
including but not limited to failure to provide information which is 
accurate, shall result in suspension of tobacco inspection services for 
a minimum of the equivalent of one sales day or until such time as the 
warehouse comes into compliance.

Secs. 30.2 through 30.21 shall be construed as explained therein.


<R05>
Sec. 30.2  Leaf tobacco.

    Tobacco in the forms in which it appears between the time it is 
cured and stripped from the stalk, or primed and cured, and the time it 
enters into the different manufacturing processes. The acts of stemming, 
sweating or fermenting, and conditioning are not regarded as 
manufacturing processes. Leaf tobacco does not include any manufactured 
or semimanufactured tobacco, stems which have been removed from leaves, 
cuttings, clippings, trimmings, shorts, or dust.


<R05>
Sec. 30.3  Unstemmed.

    A form of leaf tobacco consisting of a collection of leaves from 
which the stems or midribs have not been removed, including leaf-scrap.

[[Page 178]]


<R05>
Sec. 30.4  Stemmed.

    A form of leaf tobacco consisting of a collection of leaves from 
which the stems or midribs have been removed, including strip scrap.


<R05>
Sec. 30.5  Class.

    One of the major divisions of leaf tobacco based on the distinct 
characteristics of the tobacco caused by differences in varieties, soil 
and climatic conditions, and the methods of cultivation, harvesting, and 
curing.


<R05>
Sec. 30.6  Type.

    A subdivision of a class of leaf tobacco, having certain common 
characteristics which permit of its being divided into a number of 
related grades. Any tobacco that has the same characteristics and 
corresponding qualities, colors, and lengths, shall be treated as one 
type, regardless of any factors of historical or geographical nature 
which cannot be determined by an examination of the tobacco.


<R05>
Sec. 30.7  Group.

    A group of grades, or a division of a type covering several closely 
related grades, based on the general quality of the tobacco, including 
the percentage of injury, and other factors. The factors that determine 
the group divisions also largely determine the usage or suitability of 
tobacco for certain purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 30.8  Scrap.

    A byproduct from handling leaf tobacco in both the unstemmed and 
stemmed forms, consisting of loose and tangled portions of tobacco 
leaves, floor sweepings, and all other tobacco materials (except stems) 
which accumulate in auction and storage warehouses, packing and 
conditioning plants, and stemmeries. Scrap which accumulates from 
handling unstemmed leaf tobacco is known as leaf-scrap, and scrap which 
accumulates from handling stemmed leaf tobacco is known as strip-scrap. 
The scrap group, covering both leaf-scrap and strip-scrap is designated 
by the letter ``S''.


<R05>
Sec. 30.9  Nondescript.

    Any tobacco of a certain type which cannot be placed in other groups 
of the type, or any nested tobacco, or any muddy or extremely dirty 
tobacco, or any tobacco containing an unusual quantity of foreign 
matter, or any crude tobacco, or any tobacco which is damaged to the 
extent of 20 percent or more, or any tobacco infested with live tobacco 
beetles or other injurious insects, or any wet tobacco, or any tobacco 
that contains fat stems or wet butts. The nondescript group is 
designated by the letter ``N''.

[[Page 179]]


<R05>
Sec. 30.15  Cigar binder.

    A portion of a tobacco leaf rolled around the filler of a cigar to 
bind or hold it together and form the first covering. Cigar-binder 
tobacco is tobacco of the kind and quality commonly used for cigar 
binders. Cigar-binder types are those which produce chiefly tobacco 
suitable for cigar-binder purposes.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 33.10  Minimum requirements.

    No person shall ship, or offer for shipment, and no carrier shall 
transport, or receive for transportation, any shipment of apples or 
pears to any foreign destination unless:
    (a) Apples grade at least U.S. No. 1 or U.S. No. 1 Early: Provided, 
That apples for export to Pacific ports of Russia shall grade at least 
U.S. Utility or U.S. No. 1 Hail for hail-damaged apples, as specified in 
the United States Standards for Apples (Secs. 51.300-51.323 of this 
chapter): Provided further, That apples for export to any foreign 
destination do not contain apple maggot, and do not have more than 2 
percent, by count, of apples with apple maggot injury, nor more than 2 
percent, by count, of apples infested with San Jose scale or scale of 
similar appearance;
    (b) Pears grade at least U.S. No. 2 as specified in the United 
States Standards for Summer and Fall Pears, such as Bartlett, Hardy, and 
other similar varieties (Sections 51.1260-51.1280 of this chapter), or 
in the United States Standards for Winter Pears, such as Anjou, Bosc, 
Comice, and other similar varieties (Sections 51.1300-51.1323 of this 
chapter), do not contain apple maggot, and do not have more than 2 
percent, by count, of pears with apple maggot injury, nor more than 2 
percent, by count, of pears infested with San Jose scale or scale of 
similar appearance: Provided, That the minimum quality requirements for 
pears exported to Pacific ports of Russia are as follows:
    (1) Summer and fall pears shall be of one variety which are mature, 
hand picked, clean, sound and free from hard-end; and free from serious 
damage caused by broken skin, insects, disease, hail marks, limbrubs, 
heavy russet, or

[[Page 188]]

other means; and shall not be so excessively elongated or flattened as 
to preclude the cutting of one good half. Broken skin must not exceed 1/
4 inch in diameter. The following definitions shall apply to all 
varieties:
    Clean means reasonably free from dust, dirt, or honey dew.
    Free from serious damage means defects when taken singly or 
collectively shall not seriously affect the edible or culinary value of 
the fruit.
    Hand picked means that pears do not show evidence of rough handling 
or of having been on the ground.
    Hard-end means pears which show an abnormally yellow or green color 
at the blossom end or an abnormally smooth rounded base with little or 
no depression at the calyx, or if the flesh near the calyx is abnormally 
dry and tough or woody. Pears affected by hard-end shall be considered 
defects. Rat-tail shaped pears, or second bloom pears that are tough or 
ridged shall be considered defects. At the time of packing, not more 
than 10 percent, by count, of any lot may be below the requirements of 
the grade, and not more than one-tenth of this amount or 1% shall be 
allowed for decay and/or breakdown. For a tolerance of 10 percent or 
more, individual packages in any lot may contain not more than one and 
one-half times the tolerance specified, except that when the package 
contains 15 specimens or less, individual packages may contain not more 
than double the tolerance specified. For a tolerance of less than 10 
percent, individual packages in any lot may contain not more than double 
the tolerance specified, provided at least one specimen which does not 
meet the requirements shall be allowed in any one package. Slight 
imperfections which are not discernible in good commercial sorting 
practice shall not be considered as defects. Small inconspicuous skin 
breaks of less than \1/8\ inch in diameter or depth shall not be 
considered as damage, and not more than 15 percent of the pears in any 
container may have not more than one skin break from \1/8\ inch to \3/
16\ inch, inclusive, in diameter or depth. After pears have been placed 
in storage, or in transit; scald, breakdown, decay, bitter pit, or 
physical injury affecting keeping quality, which may have developed or 
may only have become evident after pears are packed, are defined as 
applying to condition rather than to grade. Pears also shall not contain 
apple maggot, and shall not have more than 2 percent, by count, of pears 
with apple maggot injury, nor more than 2 percent, by count, of pears 
infested with San Jose scale or scale of similar appearance.
    Mature means having reached the stage of maturity which will insure 
a proper completion of the ripening process. Firmness of the flesh shall 
be considered only in connection with other factors to determine the 
degree of maturity.
    Sound means that pears at time of packing are free from visible 
defects such as decay, breakdown, scald, bitter pit, or physical injury 
affecting keeping quality. The following conditions shall not be 
considered serious damage: healed insect depressions or other surface 
blemishes which do not prevent the cutting of one good half;
    (2) Winter pears shall be of one variety which are mature, hand 
picked, clean, sound, not very seriously misshapen, free from black end, 
free from damage caused by hard end, broken skins, and from serious 
damage caused by cork spot or bruises. The following definitions shall 
apply to all varieties:
    Black end is evidenced by an abnormally deep green color around the 
calyx, or black spots usually occurring on one-third of the surface 
nearest to the calyx, or by an abnormally shallow calyx cavity.
    Clean means free from excessive dirt, dust, spray residue, or other 
foreign material. Damage by skin break means any pear with one skin 
break larger than \3/16\ inch in diameter or depth, or with more than 
one skin break \1/8\ inch or larger in diameter or depth. Such pear 
shall be considered damaged, and scored against the grade tolerance.
    Damage by skin break means any pear with one skin break larger than 
\3/16\ inch in diameter or depth, or with more than one skin break \1/8\ 
inch or larger in diameter or depth. Such pear shall be considered 
damaged, and scored against the grade tolerance.
    Handpicked means that the pears do not show evidence of having been 
on the ground.

[[Page 189]]

    Hard end is an abnormal yellow color at the blossom end, or an 
abnormally smooth, rounded base with little or no depression at the 
calyx, or if the flesh near the calyx is abnormally dry and tough or 
woody.
    Mature means that the pear has reached the stage of maturity which 
will insure the proper completion of the ripening process.
    Overripe means dead ripe, very mealy or soft, past commercial 
utility.
    Serious damage by cork spot is when more than two cork spots are 
visible externally, or when the visible external injury affects an 
aggregate area of more than \1/2\ inch in diameter. Serious damage by 
bruising is bruising which seriously affects the appearance, edible or 
shipping quality. For a tolerance of 10 percent or more, individual 
packages in any lot may contain not more than one and one-half times the 
tolerance specified, except that when the package contains 15 specimens 
or less, individual packages may contain not more than double the 
tolerance specified. For a tolerance of less than 10 percent, individual 
packages in any lot may contain not more than double the tolerance 
specified, provided at least one specimen which does not meet the 
requirements shall be allowed in any one package. Pears also shall not 
contain apple maggot, and shall not have more than 2 percent, by count, 
of pears with apple maggot injury, nor more than 2 percent, by count, of 
pears infested with San Jose scale or scale of similar appearance;
    (c) Decay, scald or any other deterioration which may have developed 
on apples or pears after they have been in storage or transit shall be 
considered as affecting condition and not the grade.
    (d) Each package of apples or pears is packed so that the apples or 
pears in the top layer shall be reasonably representative in size, 
color, and quality of the contents of the package; and
    (e) Each package of apples or pears is marked plainly and 
conspicuously with:
    (1) The name and address of the grower, packer, or domestic 
distributor: Provided, That the name of the foreign distributor may be 
placed on consumer unit packages shipped in a master container if such 
master container is marked with the name and address of the grower, 
packer, or domestic distributor;
    (2) The variety of the apples or pears;
    (3) The name of the U.S. grade or the name of a state grade if the 
fruit meets each minimum requirement of a U.S. grade specified in this 
section; and Provided further, That the marking requirements of this 
paragraph shall not apply to pears meeting minimum quality requirements 
of this section and shipped to Pacific ports of Russia.

<R05>


Sec.
36.1  General information.
36.2  Initiating action on grade standards.
36.3  Public notification of grade standards action.

    Authority: 7 U.S.C. 1621-1627.

    Source: 62 FR 43439, Aug. 13, 1997, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 36.1  General information.

    The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS or agency) of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) facilitates the fair and efficient 
marketing of agricultural products by promulgating voluntary official 
grade standards for dairy, fresh and processed fruits and vegetables, 
livestock, meats and meat products, eggs, poultry and rabbit products, 
tobacco, wool, mohair, and other agricultural products. AMS standards 
provide a uniform language for describing the quality of various 
agricultural commodities in the marketplace. These standards may cover 
(but are not limited to) terms, classes, sizes (including quantities of 
packaged consumer agricultural commodities), dimensions, capacities, 
quality levels, performance criteria, inspection requirements, marking 
requirements, testing equipment, test procedures, and installation 
procedures.

[[Page 195]]

    (a) Grade standards are officially designated as U.S. Grade 
Standards and the AMS assigns each grade standard an appropriate 
identification number. AMS develops, revises, suspends, or terminates 
official grade standards under procedures that allows for input by 
interested parties.
    (b) These procedures set forth the process by which AMS will 
develop, revise, suspend, or terminate the U.S. standards.
    (c) Communications about AMS standards in general should be 
addressed to the Administrator, Attention: Functional Committee for 
Standards. Communications about specific standards (such as a request to 
develop or revise a standard) should be addressed to the Director of the 
appropriate Division (Dairy, Fruit and Vegetable, Livestock and Seed, 
Poultry, or Tobacco). All communications should include in the address: 
Agricultural Marketing Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 
96456, Washington, DC 20090-6456.


<R05>
Sec. 36.2  Initiating action on grade standards.

    The Agency will develop, revise, suspend, or terminate grade 
standards if it determines that such action is in the public interest. 
Any standardization action should reflect the broad interest of 
individuals or an industry involved in manufacturing, producing, 
packaging, distributing, testing, consuming, or using the product; or 
the interest of a Federal, State, or local agency. Proposed actions 
should always be based on sound technical and marketing information and 
should include careful consideration of the factors that determine a 
commodity's quality and condition and that will allow trained personnel 
to determine objectively conformance or non-conformance.
    (a) AMS encourages interested parties to participate in the review, 
development, and revision of grade standards. Interested parties include 
growers, producers, processors, shippers, distributors, consumers, 
individuals or groups, trade associations, companies, and State or 
Federal agencies. Such groups and individuals may at any time recommend 
that AMS develop, revise suspend, or terminate a grade standard. 
Requests for Agency action should be in writing, preferably accompanied 
by a draft of the suggested change.
    (1) The Agency, in cooperation with interested parties, as 
applicable, will:
    (i) Determine the need for new or revised standards;
    (ii) Collect technical, marketing, or other appropriate data;
    (iii) Conduct research regarding new or revised standards, as 
appropriate; and,
    (iv) Draft the proposed standards;
    (2) [Reserved]
    (b) If the Agency determines that new standards are needed, existing 
standards need to be revised, or the suspension or termination of 
existing standards is justified, it will undertake the action, with 
input from all interested parties.


<R05>
Sec. 36.3  Public notification of grade standards action.

    After developing a standardization proposal, the Agency will publish 
a notice in the Federal Register describing new or changes to existing 
standards or to suspend or terminate existing standards. AMS will 
simultaneously issue a news release about these actions. AMS will also 
distribute copies of the full text of the proposals to anyone requesting 
a copy or to anyone the Agency believes may be interested, including 
other Federal, State, or local government agencies, and on the Internet. 
For other than minor editorial or technical changes, the notice will 
provide at least 60 days for interested parties to submit comments to 
the Agency.
    (a) All comments received within the comment period will be part of 
the public record maintained by the Agency, will be available to the 
public for review, and will be considered by the Agency before final 
action is taken on the proposal.
    (1) Based on the comments received, the Agency's knowledge of 
standards, grading, marketing, and other technical factors, and any 
other relevant information AMS will decide whether the proposed actions 
should be implemented.

[[Page 196]]

    (2) If AMS concludes that the actions as proposed or with minor 
modifications should be adopted, AMS will publish a description of the 
changes or actions in a Federal Register notice. The Agency, through the 
appropriate AMS Divisions, will make the grade standards and related 
information available in printed form and electronic media.
    (3) If the Agency determines that proposed changes are not 
warranted, or otherwise are not in the public interest, the Agency will 
either publish in the Federal Register a notice withdrawing the 
proposal, or will revise the proposal and again seek public input.
    (b) [Reserved]

Sec. 42.102  Definitions, general.

    For the purpose of this part, unless the context otherwise requires, 
the following terms shall be construed, respectively, to mean:
    Acceptable Quality Level (AQL). The maximum number of defects per 
hundred units (DHU) which is acceptable as a process average. Lots, or 
portions of production, having a quality level equal to a specified AQL 
will be accepted approximately 95 percent of the time when using the 
sampling plans prescribed for the AQL.
    Acceptance Number (Ac). The number in a sampling plan that indicates 
the maximum number of defects permitted in a sample in order to consider 
a lot as meeting a specific requirement.
    Administrator. The Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing 
Service

[[Page 197]]

(AMS) of the Department or any other officer or employee of the Agency 
to whom there has heretofore been delegated, or to whom there may 
hereafter be delegated, the authority to act in his stead.
    Basic Inspection Period. A specified period of consecutive 
production designated for on-line inspection (e.g., one shift's 
production, one day's production, etc.).
    Condition. The degree of acceptability of the container with respect 
to freedom from defects which affect the serviceability, including 
appearance as well as usability, of the container for its intended 
purpose.
    Cumulative Sum Sampling (CuSum) Plan. An on-line sampling plan that 
accumulates the number of defects which exceed the subgroup tolerance 
(``T'') in a series of consecutive subgroups. Terms specified to the 
CuSum sampling plans are:
    (a) Acceptance Limit (``L''). The maximum accumulation of defects 
allowed to exceed the subgroup tolerance (``T'') in any subgroup or 
consecutive subgroups.
    (b) CuSum value. The accumulated number of defects that exceed the 
subgroup tolerance (``T'').
    (c) Subgroup tolerance (``T''). The allowable number of defects in 
any subgroup.
    (d) Starting value (``S''). The initial CuSum value used to begin a 
CuSum sampling plan.
    Defect. Any nonconformance of a container from specified 
requirements.
    Defect classifications. The terms used to denote the severity of a 
defect. The terms are as follows:
    (a) Critical defect. A defect that seriously affects, or is likely 
to seriously affect, the usability of the container for its intended 
purpose.
    (b) Major defect. A defect that materially affects, or is likely to 
materially affect, the usability of the container for its intended 
purpose.
    (c) Minor defect. A defect that materially affects the appearance of 
the container but is not likely to affect the usability of the container 
for its intended purpose.
    (d) Insignificant defect. A flaw in the container that does not 
materially affect the appearance and does not affect usability of the 
container for its intended purpose. When performing examinations, 
insignificant defects shall not be recorded.
    Defective. A container which has one or more defects.
    Department. The U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    Double sampling. A sampling scheme which involves use of two 
independently drawn but related samples, a first sample and a second 
sample which is added to the first to form a total sample size. A double 
sampling plan consists of first and total sample sizes with associated 
acceptance and rejection criteria. The first sample must be inspected 
first, and if possible, a decision as to acceptance or rejection of the 
lot made before a second sample is inspected. When the decision cannot 
be made on the first sample, a second sample is inspected; the decision 
to accept or reject is based on the total sample size.
    Lot. A collection of filled food containers of the same size, type, 
and style. The term shall mean ``inspection lot,'' i.e., a collection of 
units of product from which a sample is to be drawn and inspected to 
determine conformance with the applicable acceptance criteria. An 
inspection lot may differ from a collection of units designated as a lot 
for other purposes (e.g., production lot, shipping lot, etc.).
    On-line sampling. The random selection of samples from a production 
line.
    Operating Characteristic Curve (OC Curve). A curve that gives the 
probability of acceptance as a function of the quality level of the lot 
or the quality level of the portion of production. It shows the 
discriminatory power of a sampling plan, i.e., how the probability of 
accepting a lot, or portion of production, varies with the quality of 
the containers offered for inspection.
    Origin inspection. An inspection made at any location where the 
filled containers are examined prior to shipment or transfer to the 
purchaser.
    Primary container. The immediate container in which the product is 
packaged and which serves to protect, preserve, and maintain the 
condition of the product. It may be metal, glass, fiber, wood, textile, 
plastic, paper, or any other suitable type of material and

[[Page 198]]

may be supplemented by liners, overwraps, or other protective materials.
    Probability of acceptance--(a) For stationary lot sampling. The 
chance that a lot with a given level of quality will be accepted. 
Probability of acceptance is synonymous with ``Percent of Lots Expected 
to be Accepted.'' The probability of acceptance is normally designated 
as ``Pa'' but is designated as ``Pas'' when referring to skip lot 
sampling and inspection.
    (b) For On-line Sampling. The chance that a portion of production 
with a given level of quality will be accepted. Probability of 
acceptance is synonymous with ``Percent of Production Expected to be 
Accepted.'' The probability of acceptance is normally designated as 
``Pa.'' In on-line sampling inspection, the probability of acceptance of 
any portion of production depends on the sample results obtained from 
the preceding portions. The probability of acceptance values associated 
with these procedures are the values which would be expected if a large 
number of samples are to be inspected. For the CuSum plans referenced in 
this standard, the probability of acceptance at the Acceptable Quality 
Level (AQL) is approximately 95 percent. The starting value (``S'') 
associated with each CuSum plan helps to make the probability of 
acceptance of the first portions of production of a basic inspection 
period as close as possible to 95 percent.
    Random sampling. A process of selecting a sample from a lot, or 
portion of production, whereby each unit in the lot of portion of 
production, has an equal chance of being chosen.
    Rejection number (Re). The number in a sampling plan that indicates 
the minimum number of defects in a sample that will cause a lot to fail 
a specific requirement.
    Sample. Any number of sample units which are to be used for 
inspection.
    Sample size (n). The number of sample units which are to be included 
in the sample.
    Sample unit. The individual container including any component parts.
    Sampling plan. Any plan stating the number of sample units to be 
included in the sample as well as the corresponding plan parameters used 
to make acceptance and rejection decisions.
    Secondary container. The container in which one or more primary 
containers are packed. For example, a shipping case containing canned 
product.
    Shipping case. The container in which the product or primary 
containers of the product are placed to protect, preserve, and maintain 
the condition of the product during transit or storage. The shipping 
case may include strapping, liners or other protective material.
    Single sampling. A sampling scheme where the decision to accept or 
reject an inspection lot with respect to a specified requirement is made 
after the inspection of a single sample. A single sampling plan consists 
of a single sample size with associated acceptance and rejection 
criteria.
    Stationary lot sampling. The process of randomly selecting sample 
units from a lot whose production has been completed. This type of lot 
is usually stored in a warehouse or in some other storage area and is 
offered ``in toto'' for inspection.
    Subgroup. A group of sample units representing a portion of 
production.
    Total defects. The sum of critical, major, and minor defects.
    User. The person or agency at whose request inspection is conducted.

    Subpart B--Procedures for Stationary Lot Sampling and Inspection


<R05>
Sec. 42.103  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart outlines the procedure to be used to establish the 
condition of containers in stationary lots of packaged foods. This 
subpart shall be used to determine the acceptability of a lot based on 
specified acceptable quality levels and defects referenced in 
Sec. 42.104 or any alternative plan which is approved by the 
Administrator. In addition, any other sampling plan in the tables with a 
larger first sample size

[[Page 199]]

than that indicated by the lot size range may be specified when approved 
by the Administrator. This subpart or approved alternative plan will be 
applied when a Government agency or private user of the inspection or 
grading services requests that filled primary containers or shipping 
cases, or both, be certified for condition. Unless the request for 
certification specifically asks that only the primary container or only 
the shipping case be examined, both containers will be examined.
    (b) Unless otherwise specified by the user of service, this subpart 
will not apply to inspection lots of less than 50 shipping cases or to 
inspection lots of less than 300 primary containers. When the primary 
container is the shipping case, the shipping case limit will apply. When 
the lot size exceeds either the 50 shipping case limit or the 300 
primary container limit or both, the provisions of paragraph (a) of this 
section will apply.
    (c) Under certain conditions, special procedures (Skip Lot Sampling 
and Inspection) may be used to determine the condition of containers in 
stationary lots of packaged foods. Subpart C sets forth the requirements 
and procedures for Skip Lot Sampling and Inspection.

and further amended at 45 FR 69424, Oct. 21, 1980. Redesignated at 46 FR 
63203, Dec. 31, 1981]


<R05>
Sec. 42.104  Sampling plans and defects.

    (a) Sampling plans. Sections 42.109 through 42.111 show the number 
of containers to examine for condition in relation to lot size ranges. 
The tables provide acceptance (Ac) and rejection (Re) numbers for lot 
acceptance (or rejection) based on the number, class, and type of 
defects present in the sample.
    (b) Defects. The tables in Sec. 42.112 enumerate and classify 
defects according to the degree to which the individual defect affects 
the serviceability, including appearance as well as usability, of the 
container for its intended purpose. The table in Sec. 42.113 enumerates 
and classifies defects of the label, marking, or code.

1981]


<R05>
Sec. 42.105  Basis for selection of sample.

    (a) Identification of lot. Selection of proper samples requires 
sufficient information to identify the lot; such information includes, 
but is not limited to:
    (1) The lot size (see Sec. 42.103 for restriction on small lots);
    (2) The type and size of container;
    (3) The code marks or other identification marks and the number of 
containers represented by each mark.
    (4) The history of the lot regarding previous inspections; and
    (5) The inspection status (normal, tightened, or reduced).
    (b) Preliminary scanning. Prior to drawing the sample, the lot 
should be scanned to determine if any segments or portions are abnormal 
with respect to wet cases, blown cans, top layer rust, leaking bags, 
etc. If such segments or portions noted are of any consequence, the lot 
may be rejected for condition of containers without sampling.
    (c) Sample size. Determination of the number of containers to check 
for condition:
    (1) Refer to the table in Secs. 42.109 through 42.111 (sampling 
plans) and find where the lot size (number of individual containers) 
fits into the column headed ``Lot Size Ranges.''
    (i) Tables I-A (normal), II-A (tightened), or III-A (reduced), as 
applicable, will apply to origin inspections, unless the contractor 
requests that corresponding single sampling plans be used.
    (ii) The appropriate double sampling plans in Table I will apply to 
other than origin inspections, unless the contractor requests that 
corresponding single sampling plans be used.
    (2) Select the appropriate sample size for the corresponding lot 
size range as indicated in the appropriate column headed ``Sample 
Size.''

[[Page 200]]

    (3) Lots rejected for unsatisfactory condition of containers may be 
subsequently sampled after being reconditioned or reworked. Such lots or 
resulting portion of a lot may be sampled as a reoffered lot providing 
the reoffered portion is separately identifiable. When making such 
inspections, the appropriate sampling plan for tightened inspection 
shall be used. Except in the case of an appeal inspection, it is not 
permissible to reinspect a previously rejected lot until it has been 
reconditioned or reworked.
    (d) Sample selection. Select samples from the lot presented in 
accordance with either of the following two procedures as may be 
applicable. (A lot offered for inspection will be accepted or rejected 
in its entirety with either sampling procedure used to select the 
sample.)
    (1) Proportional random sampling. When the number of codes or other 
identifying marks within the lot and the approximate number of cases or 
containers per code are known, select sample units at random within each 
mark and in a number proportionate to the number of containers 
represented by such mark.
    (2) Simple random sampling. When there are no code or other 
identifying marks, or when the number of codes or identifying marks 
within the lot and/or approximate number of cases or containers per mark 
are not known, select sample units at random from the entire lot.
    (e) Maximum sample units per case. If the lot is cased, predetermine 
the number of containers to draw from each sampled case as well as the 
position within the case. Do not restrict the sampling to the top or 
bottom layers or to the corners. The best sample is one selected from 
all the various positions in the shipping case. It is desirable but not 
mandatory to limit the number of sample units to a single container from 
any one case. Multiple sample units may be taken from a single case but 
not in excess of the following plan:
    (1) When containers are packed 12 or less to a case, draw a maximum 
of 6 sample units from any one case; and
    (2) When containers are packed more than 12 to a case but not more 
than 60, draw a maximum of 12 sample units from any one case; and
    (3) When containers are packed more than 60 to a case but not more 
than 250, draw a maximum of 16 sample units from any one case; and
    (4) When containers are packed more than 250 in a case, draw a 
maximum of 24 sample units from any one case.

1981]


<R05>
Sec. 42.106  Classifying and recording defects.

    (a) Classifying defects. Examine each sample unit for the applicable 
type of defects listed in the table covering the container being 
inspected in Secs. 42.112 and 42.113. Other defects, not specifically 
listed, shall be classified according to their effect on the intended 
use of the container.
    (1) Related defects are defects on a single container that are 
related to a single cause. If the initial incident causing one of the 
defects had not occurred, none of the other related defects on the 
container would be present. As an example of related defects, a can may 
be a leaker and the exterior may also be seriously rusted due to the 
leakage of the contents. In this case, the container is scored only once 
for these two defects since the rust condition can be atributed to the 
leak. Score the container according to whichever condition is the most 
serious. In this example, score as a ``leaker'' (a critical defect) and 
not as ``pitted rust'' (a major defect).
    (2) Unrelated defects are defects on a single container that result 
from separate causes. If the incident that caused one of the defects had 
not occurred, the other unrelated defects on the container would still 
be present. As an example of unrelated defects, a can may be seriously 
rusted, may have a bad dent along the seam, and the label may also be 
detached from the can because of improper gluing. In this case it is 
unlikely that any of the three defects exist because of a common cause. 
Therefore, they are considered unrelated defects and should be scored as 
three defects.

[[Page 201]]

    (3) The lot acceptance portion of this procedure is based on the 
number of defects per 100 containers. It is necessary to determine if 
the defects on any one container are ``related'' defects or 
``unrelated'' defects. A container is scored for the most serious of 
related defects, and is also scored for each unrelated defect.
    (b) Recording defects. Record on a worksheet the number, type, and 
class (critical, major, or minor) of defects on each sample unit.
    (c) Totaling defects. Add the number of defects in each class, then 
add the number of minor, major, and critical defects to obtain the total 
defects.

<R05>
Sec. 42.107  Lot acceptance criteria.

    (a) The acceptability of the lot is determined by relating the 
number and class of defects enumerated on the worksheet to the 
acceptance and rejection numbers shown in Secs. 42.109 through 42.111 
for the respective sample size and Acceptable Quality Level (AQL).
    (b) Unless otherwise specified, use the following AQL's for the 
respective class of defects:

Total.........................................          6.5         10.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Refer to the appropriate sample size and AQL and compare the 
number of defects found in the sample with the acceptance (Ac) and 
rejection (Re) numbers in the sampling plan.
    (1) Accept the lot after examining the single sample or first sample 
of a double sampling plan when all of the following conditions are met:
    (i) The number of critical defects does not exceed the applicable 
acceptance number (Ac) for critical defects, and
    (ii) The number of major defects does not exceed the applicable 
acceptance number (Ac) for major defects, and
    (iii) The total number of critical, major, and minor defects does 
not exceed the applicable acceptance number (Ac) for total defects.
    (2) Reject the lot after examining the single sample or first sample 
of a double sampling plan when any one or more of the following 
conditions occur:
    (i) The number of critical defects equals or exceeds the applicable 
rejection number (Re) for critical defects, or
    (ii) The number of major defects equals or exceeds the applicable 
rejection number (Re) for major defects, or
    (iii) The total number of critical, major, and minor defects equals 
or exceeds the applicable rejection number (Re) for total defects.
    (3) If the lot can neither be accepted nor rejected on the first 
sample, when a double sampling plan is used, select and examine the 
prescribed second sample. Accept the lot if the accumulated defects of 
the first and second sample meet conditions of paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, otherwise, reject the lot.

<R05>
Sec. 42.108  Normal, tightened, or reduced inspection.

    (a) Normal inspection. Sampling plans for normal inspection are 
those in Tables I and I-A. These plans shall be used except when the 
history of inspection permits reduced inspection or requires tightened 
inspection.
    (b) Tightened inspection. Sampling plans for tightened inspection 
are those in Tables II and II-A.
    (c) Reduced inspection. Sampling plans for reduced inspection are 
those in Tables III and III-A.
    (d) Switching rules. The normal inspection procedure shall be 
followed except when conditions in paragraph (d) (1) or (3) of this 
section are applicable or unless otherwise specified. Application of the 
following switching rules will be restricted to the inspection of lots 
for one applicant at a single location (plant, warehouse, etc.), and 
will be based upon records of original inspections of lots (excluding 
resubmitted lots) at that same location.

[[Page 202]]

    (1) Normal inspection to reduced inspection. When normal inspection 
is in effect, reduced inspection shall be instituted providing that 
reduced inspection is considered desirable by the Administrator and 
further provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied for 
each class of defect:
    (i) The preceding 10 inspection lots (or more, as indicated by the 
note to Table III-B) which have been inspected within the preceding 6 
months have been on normal inspection and none has been rejected on 
original inspection; and
    (ii) The total number of defects in the samples from the preceding 
10 inspection lots (or such other number of lots used for condition in 
paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) is equal to or less than the 
applicable number given in Table III-B. If a double sampling plan is 
used, all samples inspected should be included, not ``first'' samples 
only; and
    (2) Reduced inspection to normal inspection. When reduced inspection 
is in effect, normal inspection shall be reinstituted if any of the 
following occur:
    (i) An inspection lot is rejected on original inspection; or
    (ii) Production becomes irregular (delayed or accelerated); or
    (iii) Other valid conditions warrant that normal inspection shall be 
reinstituted.
    (3) Normal inspection to tightened inspection. When normal 
inspection is in effect, tightened inspection shall be instituted when 2 
out of 5 consecutive inspection lots have been rejected on original 
inspection.
    (4) Tightened inspection to normal inspection. When tightened 
inspection is in effect, normal inspection shall be reinstituted when 
five consecutive inspection lots have been considered acceptable on 
original inspection.
    (e) When the rules require a switch in the inspection status because 
of one or more classes of defects, all classes of defects shall be 
inspected under the new inspection criteria. At the option of the user 
of the service and when approved by the Administrator, such user may 
elect to remain on normal inspection when qualified for reduced 
inspection, or on tightened inspection when qualified for normal 
inspection.
    (f) Appeal inspection--(1) Appeal request. Any interested party who 
is not satisfied with the results of a condition inspection on packaged 
food containers, as stated on an official certificate, may request an 
appeal inspection.
    (2) How to file an appeal. A request for an appeal inspection may be 
made orally or in writing. If made orally, written confirmation may be 
required. The applicant shall clearly state the reasons for requesting 
the appeal service and a description of the product to be appealed.
    (3) When an application for an appeal inspection may be refused. 
When it appears that: (i) The reasons given in the request are frivolous 
or not substantial; or (ii) the condition of the containers has 
undergone a material change since the original inspection; or (iii) the 
original lot is no longer intact, the applicant's request for the appeal 
inspection may be refused. In such case, the applicant shall be promptly 
notified of the reason(s) for such refusal.
    (4) Who shall perform the appeal. An appeal inspection shall be 
performed by a person(s) other than the person who made the inspection 
being appealed.
    (5) Sampling procedures. The sampling plan for an appeal inspection 
shall be the next larger sampling plan from the plan in the table used 
in the original inspection.
    (6) Appeal certificate. Immediately after an appeal inspection is 
completed, an appeal certificate shall be issued to show that the 
original inspection was sustained or was not sustained. Such certificate 
shall supersede any previously issued certificate for the inspection 
involved and shall clearly identify the number and date of the 
superseded certificate. The issuance of the appeal certificate may be 
withheld until the previously issued certificate and all copies have 
been returned when such action is deemed necessary to protect the 
interest of the Government.

         Subpart C--Skip Lot Sampling and Inspection Procedures

    Source: 41 FR 42639, Sept. 28, 1976, unless otherwise noted. 
Redesignated at 42 FR 32514, June 27, 1977, and at 46 FR 63203, Dec. 31, 
1981.


<R05>
Sec. 42.120  Description and qualification.

    Skip lot sampling and inspection are special procedures for 
inspecting stationary lots in which only one-half or one-fourth of the 
lots offered for inspection are formally inspected. Skip lot sampling 
and inspection procedures may be instituted only when all of the 
following conditions are met:
    (a) When authorized by the Administrator and acceptable to the user 
and producer, if different from the user.
    (b) When inspection is origin inspection (see Sec. 42.102).
    (c) When all lots can be expected to be of essentially the same 
quality.
    (d) When lots from the producer are currently on, or eligible to be 
on, either normal or reduced inspection.


<R05>
Sec. 42.121  Sampling and inspection procedures.

    (a) Following skip lot procedure authorization, inspect every lot 
consecutively offered for inspection using normal inspection procedures 
as set forth in Subpart B of this part. When 10 consecutive lots are 
acceptable, inspect only one-half of the lots offered for inspection 
using normal inspection procedures. While on the one-half inspection 
rate, when 10 consecutively inspected lots are acceptable, inspect only 
one-fourth of the lots offered for inspection using normal inspection 
procedures. While on the one-half or one-fourth inspection rate, if any 
formally inspected lot is unacceptable, revert immediately to the 
inspection of every lot using normal inspection procedures and 
recommence the above procedure. See Sec. 42.123 for a flow diagram of 
the skip lot sampling plan.
    (b) Two exceptions to the procedures in paragraph (a) of this 
section are as follows:
    (1) The skip lot sampling and inspection rate of one-half can be 
instituted immediately if the lots from the producer are currently on, 
or eligible to be on, reduced inspection and all other conditions in 
Sec. 42.120 are met. After skip lot sampling and inspection begins, 
however, only normal inspection is permitted.
    (2) While inspecting every lot consecutively as offered for 
inspection, i.e., while not on the one-half or one-fourth sampling and 
inspection rate, if requirements for switching from normal to tightened 
inspection are met as specified in Sec. 42.108 then skip lot procedures 
terminate, tightened inspection is initiated, and stationary lot 
sampling and inspection procedures in Subpart B are instituted. Skip lot 
procedures may be instituted again only when all conditions of 
Sec. 42.120 are met.
    (c) All lot selections for the one-half and one-fourth inspection 
rates must be strictly random (for example, not every other lot or every 
fourth lot). Use of random number tables, coin flipping, or numbered 
cards is encouraged.
    (d) Preliminary scanning procedures (see Sec. 42.105) shall be used 
on all lots scheduled for formal inspection and also shall be used on 
lots not scheduled for inspection (``skipped'' lots) whenever the 
inspector feels such action is prudent to further insure the 
acceptability of such lots.


<R05>
Sec. 42.122  Applicability of other procedures.

    Whenever appropriate, the procedures for classifying and recording 
defects in Sec. 42.106 and for appeal inspections in Sec. 42.108 also 
apply to skip lot sampling and inspection.

    Notes: 1. Only normal inspection is permitted.
    2. All lot selections for the one-half and one-fourth sampling rates 
must be strictly random (for example, not every other lot or every 
fourth lot).
    3. Two exceptions to the procedures shown above are as follows:
    (a) The skip lot sampling and inspection rate of one-half can be 
instituted immediately if the lots from the producer are currently on, 
or eligible to be on, reduced inspection and all other conditions in 
Sec. 42.120 are met. When skip lot inspection begins, however, only 
normal inspection is permitted.
    (b) While inspecting every lot consecutively as offered for 
inspection, i.e., while not on the one-half or one-fourth rate, if 
requirements for switching from normal to tightened inspection are met 
as specified in Sec. 42.108 then skip lot procedures terminate, 
tightened inspection is initiated, and stationary lot sampling and 
inspection procedures in Subpart B are instituted. Skip lot procedures 
may be instituted again only when all conditions of Sec. 42.120 are met.

Sec. 42.130  Description and qualifications.

    (a) In many instances, food containers are loaded directly into 
carriers immediately after final packaging. This situation makes 
stationary lot sampling and inspection impractical. For such 
circumstances, the optional procedure for on-line sampling and 
inspection using cumulative sum sampling plans is provided. On-line 
sampling and inspection is a procedure in which subgroups of sampling 
units are selected randomly from predesignated portions of production. 
The acceptability of the portions of production is determined by 
inspecting, at the time of the sampling, the subgroups which represent 
these portions. On-line sampling and inspection contrasts with 
stationary lot procedures in which sample units are selected randomly 
and inspected and lot acceptability determinations are made only after 
lot production is completed.
    (b) On-line sampling and inspection procedures may be instituted 
only when all of the following conditions are met:
    (1) When authorized by the Administrator and acceptable to the user 
and producer, if different from the user.
    (2) When inspection is origin inspection (see Sec. 42.102).
    (3) When previous production lots from the producer are currently 
on, or eligible to be on, either normal or reduced inspection. (When 
shifting from stationary lot sampling and inspection to on-line sampling 
and inspection, normal on-line inspection shall be initially used.)
    (4) When inspection of the containers is performed at a point after 
which all condition of container related characteristics are fixed and 
will not be subject to change during final handling.


<R05>
Sec. 42.131  Selection of samples.

    (a) Prior to commencement of on-line sampling and inspection, the 
total amount of production for a given day or shift is predicted and is 
then subdivided into conveniently designated portions of production 
approximately equal in size. Portions may be designated by sequential 
numbers (e.g., containers 1 through 500 are portion 1, containers 501 
through 1000 are portion 2, etc.) or by time intervals (e.g., the first 
half hour of production is portion 1, the second half hour of production 
is portion 2, etc.) during which the containers are identified by 
individual production codes for each time interval.
    (b) Determine the number of sample units in a subgroup as follows:

              Type of Inspection and Number of Sample Units

Normal--25
Tightened--50
Reduced--13

    (c) Subgroups are drawn randomly from portions of production 
throughout the production process and are inspected for defects. The 
drawing of sampling units may be done in either of two ways: (1) The 
number of sample units (13, 25 or 50) comprising a subgroup may be drawn 
at the same time from a randomly chosen point in the production of each 
portion, or (2) sample units may be drawn individually, but in a random 
manner, throughout the production of each portion. At least 6 subgroups 
must be obtained during each basic inspection period regardless of the 
system used to designate portions of production.
    (d) A shift to on-line sampling plans from stationary lot sampling 
plans (or vice versa) during a basic inspection period is not permitted.

Sec. 42.132  Determining cumulative sum values.

    (a) The parameters for the on-line cumulative sum sampling plans for 
AQL's applicable to origin inspection are as follows:

    (b) At the beginning of the basic inspection period, the CuSum value 
is set equal to the starting value (``S'') for the specified CuSum plan. 
The CuSum value is then determined for each consecutive subgroup as 
follows:
    (1) Add the number of defects for the present subgroup to the CuSum 
value of the previous subgroup.
    (2) Subtract the subgroup tolerance (``T'').
    (3) The CuSum value is reset in the following situations; however, 
determine portion of production acceptability (see Sec. 42.133) prior to 
resetting the CuSum value:
    (i) Reset the CuSum value to zero (0) if the CuSum value is less 
than zero (0).
    (ii) Reset the CuSum value to the acceptance limit (``L'') if the 
CuSum value exceeds the acceptance limit (``L'').


<R05>
Sec. 42.133  Portion of production acceptance criteria.

    (a) The acceptability of a portion of production is determined by 
comparing the calculated CuSum value with the acceptance limit (``L'') 
for the specified AQL.
    (b) A portion of production is acceptable if the CuSum value, 
calculated from the subgroup representing that portion, is equal to or 
less than the acceptance limit (``L'') for all classes of defects.
    (c) A portion of production is rejected if the CuSum value, 
calculated from the subgroup representing that portion, exceeds the 
acceptance limit (``L'') for one or more classes of defects.


<R05>
Sec. 42.134  Disposition of rejected portions of production.

    Rejected portions of production from the same basic inspection 
period may be reworked, combined together to form a lot, and resubmitted 
for inspection under the criteria for tightened inspection using 
stationary lot sampling procedures described in subpart B of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 42.135  Normal, tightened or reduced on-line inspection.

    (a) Normal, tightened and reduced on-line sampling plans are 
specified in Sec. 42.132 (Determining cumulative sum values). Normal 
plans shall be used except when the history of inspection permits 
reduced inspection or requires tightened inspection.
    (b) Switching rules: Normal on-line inspection procedures shall be 
followed except when conditions in paragraph (b) (1) or (3) of this 
section are applicable or unless otherwise specified. Application of the 
following switching rules will be restricted to the inspection of 
production for one applicant at a single production location and will be 
based upon records of original inspections of production (excluding 
resubmitted portions previously rejected and reworked) at that same 
location.
    (1) Normal inspection to reduced inspection. When normal inspection 
is in effect, reduced inspection shall be instituted provided that 
reduced inspection is considered desirable by the Administrator and 
further provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied for 
each class of defect:
    (i) The preceding 40 consecutive portions of production have been on 
normal inspection and no more than one of these portions has been 
rejected on original inspection; and
    (ii) The total number of defects in the subgroups (1000 sample 
units) from these preceding 40 consecutive portions of production is 
less than or equal to the following limit numbers for the specified 
AQL's:

                                                                        
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  Acceptable quality levels                    Limit No.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.25........................................................           0
1.5.........................................................           9
6.5.........................................................          54
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Reduced inspection to normal inspection. When reduced inspection 
is in effect, normal inspection shall be reinstituted if any of the 
following occurs:
    (i) More than one portion of production in any 40 consecutive 
portions of production is rejected on original inspection; or
    (ii) Production becomes irregular (delayed or accelerated); or
    (iii) Other valid conditions warrant that normal inspection shall be 
reinstituted.
    (3) Normal inspection to tightened inspection. When normal 
inspection is in

[[Page 215]]

effect, tightened inspection shall be instituted when two out of five 
consecutive portions of production have been rejected.
    (4) Tightened inspection to normal inspection. When tightened 
inspection is in effect, normal inspection shall be reinstituted when 
five consecutive portions of production have been considered acceptable.
    (c) When the rules require a switch in the inspection status because 
of one or more classes of defects, all classes of defects shall be 
inspected under the new inspection criteria. At the option of the user 
of the service, and when approved by the Administrator, such user may 
elect to remain on normal inspection when qualified for reduced 
inspection, or on tightened inspection when qualified for normal 
inspection.


<R05>
Sec. 42.136  Applicability of other procedures.

    When appropriate, the procedures for classifying and recording 
defects in Sec. 42.106 and for appeal inspections in Sec. 42.108 also 
apply to on-line sampling and inspection.

<R05>
Sec. 42.140  Operating Characteristic (OC) curves for on-line sampling and inspection.

    (a) This section contains the Operating Characteristic (OC) curve 
for each of the sampling plans given in Tables I, I-A, II, II-A, III, 
and III-A. The OC curve and the corresponding sampling plans are listed 
by AQL.
    (b) Different acceptance and rejection criteria are provided for 
each AQL. The criteria for each AQL must be obtained from the applicable 
sampling plan tables.
    (c) The curves show the ability of the various sampling plans to 
distinguish between good and bad lots. This can be illustrated by 
examining OC curve 6 for an AQL of 0.25 defects per hundred units in the 
Reduced and Normal Inspection Plans. If the quality of the lots 
submitted for inspection is poorer than the AQL of 0.25 defects per 
hundred units, fewer lots will be accepted. For example, OC curve 6 
shows that when the quality of lots submitted for inspection is 1.0 
defects per hundred units, only 26 percent of the lots are expected to 
be accepted. Conversely when the quality of the lots submitted for 
inspection is better than the AQL of 0.25 defects per hundred units, 
most lots are expected to be accepted. For example, the same OC curve 6 
shows that when the quality of lots submitted for inspection is 0.10 
defects per hundred units, about 99 percent of the lots are expected to 
be accepted.
    (d) The table of sampling plans that correspond to OC curve 6 can be 
found over the curves for an AQL of 0.25 defects per hundred units in 
the Reduced and Normal Inspection Plan. An examination of this table 
reveals that there is one single and one double sampling plan that have 
OC curves comparable to OC curve 6. The first plan listed is a single 
plan requiring the inspection of 500 individual containers. Under this 
plan the lot is accepted as meeting the requirements for an AQL of 0.25 
if there are 3 or less defects in the sample or rejected if there are 4 
or more defects in the sample.
    (e) The next plan that is listed in the column headed 6 for an AQL 
of 0.25 is a double sampling plan that requires the initial inspection 
of 228 individual containers. The lot will be accepted as meeting the 
requirements of an AQL of 0.25 if there are no defects in the sample, 
and rejected if there are 3 or more defects in the sample. In the event 
that the number of defects is between the acceptance (0) and rejection 
(3) numbers, additional containers must be inspected. In this case, the 
table indicates that a total of 516 containers must be inspected before 
a decision can be made to either accept or reject the lot. This will 
require the inspection of 288 more containers (516--228=288).

If there are 3 or less defects in the total sample, the lot will be 
accepted. If there are 4 or more defects in the total sample, the lot 
will be rejected. The other double sampling plans operate in a similar 
manner with the only differences being the sample sizes and acceptance 
and rejection numbers.

Sec. 42.141  Obtaining Operating Characteristic (OC) curve information for skip lot sampling and inspection.

    The Operating Characteristic (OC) curve information (probability of 
acceptance) for skip lot sampling and inspection procedures described in 
Sec. 42.121 is easily obtained from the single curve in Sec. 42.142. The 
procedure for using the curve in Sec. 42.142 is as follows:
    (a) Select any sampling plan for normal condition of container 
inspection from Table I or Table I-A of Sec. 42.109.
    (b) For a given Quality of Submitted Lots, 100<INF>p</INF>, find the 
Percent of Lots Expected to be Accepted, Pa from the respective OC curve 
in Sec. 42.140.
    (c) Refer to Sec. 42.142 with this Percent of Lots Expected to be 
Accepted, Pa, and read the new Percent of Lots Expected to be Accepted, 
Pas, which results when using these skip lot procedures.

For example, let's assume the lot size is 6,001 to 12,000 containers, 
and we use the single sampling plan of size 168 for normal inspection 
(Table I of Sec. 42.109) along with an AQL for total defects of 6.5. The 
OC curve for this sampling plan is curve N and R3. Also, assume that the 
quality of the lot is 6.5 defects per hundred units. From curve N and 
R3, then, the Pa is determined to be 95 percent. Then refer to the graph 
in Sec. 42.142 and locate Pa of 95 percent along the horizontal axis. 
From this point, proceed vertically to the curve and then horizontally 
to the left to the vertical axis. From this point on the vertical axis, 
Pas is determined to be approximately 98 <SUP>1</SUP> percent for skip 
lot sampling and inspection.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


    <SUP>1</SUP>  This slight increase of Pas over Pa results because 
all the lots offered for inspection are no longer being inspected. Some 
lots are being ``skipped'', and thereby accepted, which would have been 
rejected if inspected. The largest increase in Pa which will occur using 
skip lot sampling is approximately 4 percent. It is for this reason that 
skip lot sampling procedures are applied only in instances where past 
production quality has been consistently high--as evidenced by the 
requirement to have 10 consecutively acceptable lots prior to a 
reduction in sampling rate--and where all requirements in Sec. 42.120 
also have been met.

Notes:

1. This curve applies only to the specific skip lot sampling and 
inspection plan described in Sec. 42.121 and Sec. 42.123.
2. Pa and Pas are essentially equal for values under 50 percent.

Sec. 42.143  Operating Characteristic (OC) curves for on-line sampling and inspection.

    (a) This section contains the Operating Characteristic (OC) curve 
for each of the on-line cumulative sum sampling plans provided in 
subpart D. The OC curve and the corresponding cumulative sum sampling 
plans are listed by AQL.
    (b) Different plan parameters used to make acceptance and rejection 
decisions are provided for each AQL.
    (c) The curves show the ability of the various cumulative sum 
sampling plans to distinguish between good and bad portions of 
production. The interpretation of these curves for portions of 
production is similar to the interpretation of the OC curves for 
stationary lots as illustrated in Sec. 42.140(c).

Sec. 43.101  Meaning of words.

    Words used in this subpart in the singular form shall be considered 
to impart the plural, or vice versa, as the case may demand.


<R05>
Sec. 43.102  Definitions.

    Statistical and inspection or sampling terms and their respective 
definitions that are used in the sampling plans and operating 
characteristic curves of which are pertinent to the understanding of 
inspection by attributes follow:
    Acceptable quality level (AQL). The AQL is expressed in terms of 
percent defective or defects per 100 units. Lots having a quality level 
equal to a specified AQL will be accepted approximately 95 percent of 
the time when using the sampling plans prescribed for that AQL.
    Acceptance number (Ac). The number in a sampling plan that indicates 
the maximum number of defects or defectives permitted in a sample in 
order to consider a lot as meeting a specific requirement.
    Acceptance sampling. The art or science that deals with procedures 
in which decisions to accept or reject lots or processes are based on 
the examination of samples.
    Attributes. Refers to the measurement of a given factor noting and 
recording the presence or absence of some characteristic (attribute) in 
each of the units in the group under consideration.
    Consumer's risk. The risk a consumer takes that a lot will be 
accepted by a sampling plan even though the lot does not conform to 
requirements. In the standards of this subpart this risk is nominally 
set at ten percent.
    Consumer protection. The ability of a sampling plan to reject 
unacceptable supplies. This is measured as the complement of the 
probability of acceptance (Pa) for the Limited Quality (LQ) lots. The 
consumer protection is 90 percent in these standards.
    Defect. A failure to meet a requirement imposed on a unit with 
respect to a single quality characteristic. A unit may contain more than 
one defect.
    Defective. A defective unit; one containing one or more defects with 
respect to the quality characteristic(s) under consideration.
    Inspection. The examination (including testing) of supplies 
(including, when appropriate, raw materials, components and intermediate 
assemblies).
    (a) Acceptance inspection. An inspection to determine conformance of 
supplies to specified requirements in order to accept or reject the 
supplies.
    (b) Estimation inspection. In dealing with attributes, an inspection 
to determine the amount of the supplies conforming to a specified 
requirement--usually expressed as a percentage.
    Inspection by attributes. Inspection whereby either the sample unit 
is classified as defective or non-defective with respect to a 
requirement or set of requirements (when on a ``defective'' basis); or, 
inspection whereby the number of defects in each sample unit is counted 
with respect to a requirement or set of requirements (when on a 
``defect'' basis).
    Limiting quality (LQ). The LQ is expressed in terms of percent 
defective or defects per 100 units. Lots inspected under the standards 
of this subpart that have a ten percent probability of acceptance are 
referred to as a lot having a quality level equal to LQ.
    Lot. A collection of units of the same size, type and style which 
has been manufactured or processed under essentially the same 
conditions. The term shall mean ``inspection lot,'' i.e.,

[[Page 243]]

a collection of units of product from which a sample is to be drawn and 
inspected to determine conformance with the acceptability criteria. An 
inspection lot may differ from a collection of units designated as a lot 
for other purposes (e.g., production lot, shipping lot, etc.).
    Lot size. The number of units in the lot.
    Operating characteristic curve (OC curve). A curve that gives the 
probability of acceptance as a function of a specific lot quality level.
    Probability of acceptance (Pa). For a given sampling plan and a 
given quality of inspection lots, is that percentage of inspection lots 
expected to be accepted.
    Process capability. Performance of a process under normal operating 
conditions. The performance is measured with respect to specific 
characteristics.
    Producer's risk. The risk that a producer takes that a lot will be 
rejected by a sampling plan even though the lot conforms to 
requirements. In the standards of this subpart this risk is nominally 
set at five percent.
    Random sampling. A process of selecting a sample from a lot whereby 
each unit in the lot has an equal chance of being chosen. Ordinary 
haphazard choice is generally insufficient to guarantee randomness. 
Devices such as tables of random numbers are used to remove subjective 
biases inherent in personal choice.
    Rejection number (Re). The number in a sampling plan that indicates 
the minimum number of defects or defectives permitted in a sample that 
will cause a lot to fail a specific requirement.
    Sample. Any number of sample units which are to be used for 
inspection.
    Sample size. The number of sample units which are to be included in 
the sample.
    Sample unit. A container, the entire contents of a container, a 
portion of the contents of a container, a composite mixture of a 
product, or any other unit of container or commodity to be used for 
inspection.
    Sampling. The act of drawing or selecting sample units from a given 
lot.
    Sampling plan. A specific plan which states the sample size(s), 
acceptance number(s) and rejection number(s). In the standards of this 
subpart two types of sampling plans are provided:
    (a) Single sampling plan. A sampling inspection scheme in which a 
decision to accept or reject an inspection lot is based on the 
inspection of a single sample. A single sampling plan consists of a 
single sample size with associated acceptance and rejection number(s).
    (b) Double sampling plan. A sampling inspection scheme which 
involves use of two independently drawn but related samples, a first 
sample (n<INF>1</INF>) and a second sample which is added to the first 
to form a total sample size (n<INF>t</INF>). A double sampling plan 
consists of a first and total sample size with associated acceptance and 
rejection number(s). Inspection of the first sample leads to a decision 
to accept, to reject, or to take a second sample and the examination of 
a second sample, when required, always leads to a decision to accept or 
reject.

                             Sampling Plans


<R05>
Sec. 43.103  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart contains selected single and double sampling plans 
for inspection by attributes. They are to serve as a source of plans for 
developing sound specifications, standards, or sampling and inspection 
procedures.
    (b) The sampling plans of this subpart and corresponding operating 
characteristic curves are indexed by acceptable quality level, AQL. The 
AQL's expressed in percent defectives or defects per hundred units are:

                                                                        
                                                                        
                                                                        
0.065.............          0.40                2.5               8.5   
0.10..............          0.65                4.0              10.0   
0.15..............           1.0                5.0              12.5   
0.25..............           1.5                6.5              15.0   
                                                                        


<R05>
Sec. 43.104  Master table of single and double sampling plans.

    (a) In the master table, a sampling plan is selected by first 
determining the sample size or sizes and AQL to be used. Then find the 
applicable acceptance (Ac) and rejection (Re) numbers at the 
intersection of the sample size(s) row and AQL column. These numbers 
together with the sample size or sizes constitute a sampling plan.
    (b) Single sampling plans having a sample size of 66 or greater and 
an acceptance number of 1 are not included

[[Page 244]]

in the Master Table. These plans are listed in the tables which 
supplement the Master Table and accompany the OC curves as indexes to 
the comparable double sampling plans. The use of these single sampling 
plans do not facilitate the practice of using two or more AQL's 
simultaneously with the same sample size.


<R05>
Sec. 43.105  Operating characteristics (OC) curves.

    The OC curves shows the ability of the various sampling plans, 
presented for each AQL, to distinguish between lots of different 
quality.


<R05>
Sec. 43.106  Choosing AQL's and sampling plans.

    (a) The selection of AQL's and sampling plans for given lot sizes 
depends on too many factors to permit the issuance of a ``pre-selected'' 
standard set of plans for specified lot sizes. Each user of the 
standards of this subpart should select AQL's and sampling plans that 
are tailored to best meet his needs.
    (b) Some of the factors that must be considered prior to selecting 
the AQL's are:
    (1) Class of defects such as major and minor: Major defects would 
generally require lower AQL's than those for minor defects;
    (2) Process capabilities under good commercial practice with respect 
to the defects in question: For example, if under normal production 
processes, the defect level cannot be kept below 2.0 percent defective, 
the selection of an AQL of 0.15 percent defective, although desirable 
for the defects in question, may not be practical;
    (3) Consumer preferences: These may require higher AQL's or permit 
lower AQL's than process capabilities would indicate; and
    (4) Time and cost required to sample and inspect a lot under various 
AQL's: The smaller the AQL the more time and cost of inspection.
    (c) Some of the factors that may be considered prior to selecting 
the sampling plans for given lot sizes are:
    (1) The applicable AQL(s): The AQL dictates, among other things, the 
smallest sample size that can be used and the size of the ``jumps'' from 
one sample size to the next larger one;
    (2) The relative ability of the plans to discriminate between 
``good'' and ``bad'' lots: Although several plans in these standards 
have the same AQL, they differ in their ability to reject lots worse 
than the AQL's. The OC curve in the standards of this subpart provide 
the basis for determining the discriminating ability of each plan;
    (3) The amount, time, and cost of sampling required;
    (4) The size and value of the lots relative to the producer and 
consumer protection a sampling plan affords: One may be willing to take 
larger risks of passing ``bad'' lots that are small or of lesser value 
than they would for larger more valuable lots;
    (5) The knowledge about the lot(s) to be submitted for inspection: 
Lots consisting of product produced under essentially the same 
conditions may require smaller sample sizes than those consisting of 
product produced by different shifts and different raw stock for 
example; and
    (6) The record of the quality level of previously submitted lots: 
The sample size can be smaller for lots submitted from a supplier with a 
consistent record of quality levels significantly better than the 
specified AQL(s) than sample sizes for the supplier whose records show 
considerable variability in quality, ``borderline'' supplies or product 
worse than the AQL.

statement showing the date of receipt and date of final sale, the

the proper, usual or specifically agreed upon selling charges and 
expenses properly incurred or agreed to in the handling thereof, plus 
any other information required by Sec. 46.29;
    (2) Joint account transactions, to account by rendering a true and 
correct statement showing the date of receipt and date of final sale,

joint account cost of the produce, and the expenses properly incurred or 
other charges specifically agreed to in the handling thereof, plus any 
other information required by Sec. 46.29;
    (3) Buying brokerage transactions, to account by rendering a true 
and correct itemized statement showing the cost of the produce, the 
expenses properly incurred, and the amount of brokerage charged.
    (z) Account promptly, except when otherwise specifically agreed upon 
by the parties, means rendering to the

[[Page 270]]

principal a true and correct accounting:
    (1) In connection with buying brokerage transactions, within 24 
hours after the date of shipment;
    (2) In connection with consignment or joint account transactions, 
within 10 days after the date of final sale with respect to each 
shipment, or within 20 days from the date the goods are accepted at 
destination, whichever comes first: Provided, That whenever a grower's 
agent or shipper distributes individual lots of produce for or on behalf 
of others, accounting to the principal shall be made within 30 days 
after receipt of the shipment from the principal for sale or within 5 
days after the date the agent receives payment for the goods, whichever 
comes first. Whenever a grower's agent or shipper harvests, packs, or 
distributes entire crops or multiple lots therefrom for or on behalf of 
others, an accounting on the initial shipment shall be rendered within 
30 days after receipt of the goods for sale. Accountings for subsequent 
shipments shall be made at 10-day intervals from the date of the 
accounting for the initial shipment and a final accounting for the 
season shall be made to each principal within 30 days from the date the 
agent receives the last shipment for the season from that principal: 
Provided further, That whenever the marketing agreement between a 
principal and agent includes a provision for storage of goods prior to 
sale, the agent shall render accountings of inventory and expenses 
incurred to date at 30-day intervals from the date the goods are 
received by the agent until sales from storage begin, And Provided 
further, That nothing in the regulations in this part shall prohibit 
cooperative associations from accounting to their members on the basis 
of seasonal pools or other arrangements provided by their regulations or 
bylaws; and
    (3) In connection with a consignment or joint account transaction, 
within 10 days after the date of receipt of payment of a carrier claim 
filed.
    (aa) Full payment promptly is the term used in the Act in specifying 
the period of time for making payment without committing a violation of 
the Act. ``Full payment promptly,'' for the purpose of determining 
violations of the Act, means:
    (1) Payment of net proceeds for produce received on consignment or 
the pro-rata share of the net profits for produce received on joint 
account, within 10 days after the date of final sale with respect to 
each shipment, or within 20 days from the date the goods are accepted at 
destination, whichever comes first;
    (2) Payment by growers, growers' agents, or shippers of deficits on 
consignments or joint account transactions, within 10 days after the day 
on which the accounting is received;
    (3) Payment of the purchase price, brokerage, and other expenses to 
buying brokers who pay for the produce, within 10 days after the day on 
which the broker's invoice is received by the buyer;
    (4) Payment of brokerage earned and other expenses in connection 
with produce purchased or sold, within 10 days after the day on which 
the broker's invoice is received by the principal;
    (5) Payment for produce purchased by a buyer, within 10 days after 
the day on which the produce is accepted;
    (6) Payment to growers, growers' agents, or shippers by terminal 
market agents or brokers, who are selling for the account of a grower, 
growers' agent, or shipper and are authorized to collect from the buyer 
or receiver, within 5 days after the agent or broker receives payment 
from the buyer or receiver;
    (7) Payment to the principal, within 10 days after receipt, of net 
proceeds realized from a carrier claim in connection with a consignment 
transaction or, in connection with a joint account transaction, payment 
to the joint account partners of their share of the joint account net 
proceeds realized from a carrier claim;
    (8) Payment by growers agents or shippers who distribute individual 
lots of produce for or on behalf of others, within 30 days after receipt 
of the goods from the principal for sale or within 5 days after the date 
the agent receives payment for the goods, whichever comes first;
    (9) Whenever a grower's agent or shipper harvests, packs, or 
distributes

[[Page 271]]

entire crops or multiple lots therefrom for or on behalf of others, 
payment for the initial shipment shall be made within 30 days after 
receipt of the goods for sale or within 5 days after the date the agent 
receives payment for the goods, whichever comes first. Payment for 
subsequent shipments shall be made at 10-day intervals from the date of 
the accounting for the initial shipment or within 5 days after the date 
the agent receives payment for the goods, whichever comes first, and 
final payment for the seasons shall be made to each principal within 30 
days from the date the agent receives the last shipment for the season 
from that principal;
    (10) When contracts are based on terms other than those described in 
these regulations, payment is due the supplier-seller within 20 days 
from the date of acceptance of the shipment under the terms of the 
contract and Sec. 46.2(dd).
    (11) Parties who elect to use different times of payment than those 
set forth in paragraphs (aa) (1) through (10) of this section must 
reduce their agreement to writing before entering into the transaction 
and maintain a copy of the agreement in their records. If they have so 
agreed, then payment within the agreed upon time shall constitute ``full 
payment promptly'': Provided, That the party claiming the existence of 
such an agreement for time of payment shall have the burden of proving 
it.

Nothing in the regulations in this part shall limit the seller's 
privilege of shipping under a closed or advise bill of lading or other 
arrangement requiring cash on delivery unless there has been express 
prior agreement to the contrary between the parties; or prohibit 
cooperative associations from settling with their members on the basis 
of seasonal pools or other arrangements provided by their regulations or 
bylaws. If there is a dispute concerning a transaction, the foregoing 
time periods for prompt payment apply only to payment of the undisputed 
amount.
    (bb) Reject without reasonable cause means in connection with 
purchases, consignments, or joint account transactions: (1) Refusing or 
failing without legal justification to accept produce within a 
reasonable time; (2) advising the seller, shipper, or his agent that 
produce, complying with contract, will not be accepted; (3) indicating 
an intention not to accept produce through an act or failure to act 
inconsistent with the contract; or (4) any rejection following an act of 
acceptance.
    (cc) Reasonable time, as used in paragraph (bb) of this section, 
means:
    (1) For frozen fruits and vegetables with respect to rail shipments, 
48 hours after notice of arrival and the produce is made accessible for 
inspection, and with respect to truck shipments, not to exceed 12 hours 
after the receiver or a responsible representative is given notice of 
arrival and the produce is made accessible for inspection;
    (2) For fresh fruits and vegetables with respect to rail shipments, 
not to exceed 24 hours after notice of arrival and the car has been 
placed in a location where the produce is made accessible for 
inspection; and with respect to truck shipments, not to exceed 8 hours 
after the receiver or a responsible representative is given notice of 
arrival and the produce is made accessible for inspection; and, with 
respect to boat shipments, not to exceed 24 hours after the produce is 
unloaded and made accessible for inspection and the receiver is given 
notice thereof;
    (3) If, within the applicable period, the receiver cannot make a 
thorough inspection due to adverse weather condition or applies for but 
cannot obtain Federal inspection before the end of this period, and so 
notifies the consignor within the applicable period, the period shall be 
extended until weather conditions permit inspection or until Federal 
inspection is made, as the case may be, plus two hours after either an 
oral or written report of the results of such inspection is made 
available to the receiver; and
    (4) In computing the time periods specified above, (i) for shipments 
arriving on non-work days or after the close of regular business hours 
on work days when a representative of the receiver having authority to 
reject shipments is not present, non-working hours preceding the start 
of regular business hours on the next working day shall not be included; 
and (ii) for shipments arriving during regular business hours when

[[Page 272]]

a representative of the receiver having authority to reject shipments 
customarily is present, the period shall run without interruption except 
that, for shipments arriving less than two hours before the close of 
regular business hours, the unexpired balance of the time period shall 
be extended and run from the start of regular business hours on the next 
working day.
    (dd) Acceptance means:
    (1) Any act by the consignee signifying acceptance of the shipment, 
including diversion or unloading;
    (2) Any act by the consignee which is inconsistent with the 
consignor's ownership, but if such act is wrongful against the consignor 
it is acceptance only if ratified by him; or
    (3) Failure of the consignee to give notice of rejection to the 
consignor within a reasonable time as defined in paragraph (cc) of this 
section: Provided, That acceptance shall not affect any claim for 
damages because of failure of the produce to meet the terms of the 
contract.
    (ee) Employ and employment mean any affiliation of any person with 
the business operations of a licensee, with or without compensation, 
including ownership or self-employment.
    (ff) Responsibly connected means affiliation as individual owner, 
partner in a partnership, or officer, director or holder of more than 10 
percent of the outstanding stock of a corporation or association.
    (gg) Branch or additional business facility, as used in section 3(b) 
of the Act, means an office or outlet in a location other than that of 
the principal or main office of a firm, out of which or through which 
the firm purchases, sells, negotiates contracts, solicits, or handles 
consignments, or otherwise contracts in perishable agricultural 
commodities including seasonal, part-time and full-time operations. As 
used in this paragraph, ``branch or additional business facility'' 
includes, but is not limited to, the following:
    (1) Jobbers, wholesalers, distributors--each location through which 
commodities are bought, sold or otherwise contracted;
    (2) Retailers--each outlet through which retail sales of commodities 
are made and each office which purchases commodities;
    (3) Trucker/dealer--a truck is a ``branch'' office if the driver is 
authorized to buy, sell or otherwise contract for commodities on behalf 
of the firm;
    (4) Shippers--on-the-ground representatives making purchases, sales 
or otherwise contracting for commodities;
    (5) Brokers--each office conducting contract negotiations including 
on-the-ground representatives negotiating contracts for commodities;
    (6) Processors--each location at which commodities are purchased, 
sold or contracted to be purchased or sold;
    (7) Cooperatives--each operation away from the main office that has 
responsibility to account for proceeds received from sales of 
commodities; or
    (8) Seasonal/part-time operations--any facility with on-the-ground 
representatives making purchases, sales, or otherwise contracting for 
commodities.
    (hh) Good faith means honesty in fact and the observance of 
reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade. The 
principle of good faith requires that a party to a transaction disclose 
in writing the existence of any collateral fees and expenses to all 
other parties to the transaction where the collateral fees and expenses 
affect a material term of the agreement.
    (ii) Grocery wholesaler is a dealer primarily engaged in the full-
line wholesale distribution and resale of grocery and related nonfood 
items (such as perishable agricultural commodities, dry groceries, 
general merchandise, meat, poultry, and seafood, and health and beauty 
care items) to retailers. This term does not include persons primarily 
engaged in the wholesale distribution and resale of perishable 
agricultural commodities rather than other grocery and related nonfood 
items. Specifically, for an entity to be considered a grocery 
wholesaler, 50 percent or more of its annual gross sales must be from 
the full-line distribution and resale of grocery and related nonfood 
items, and it cannot have more than 50 percent of its sales in 
perishable agricultural commodities. ``Full line'' means that an entity 
must be supplying the retailer with a wide

[[Page 273]]

range of products such as the grocery and related nonfood items 
specified.

approval of employment shall automatically terminate.
    (f) Under section 8(c) of the Act a license can be revoked for any 
false or misleading statement, or through a misrepresentation or 
concealment or withholding of facts in connection with an application 
for a license.
    (g) Under section 9 of the Act a license can be suspended if the

amount satisfactory to the Secretary.
    (i) Under section 4(a) of the Act, at least 30 days prior to the

the license will automatically terminate on its anniversary date unless 
an application for renewal is filed supplying all information requested 
on a form to be supplied by the Division, and unless the renewal fee (if 
any is applicable) is paid on or before such date. If the renewal 
application is not filed and/or the renewal fee (if required) is not 
paid by the anniversary date, the licensee may obtain a renewal of that 
license at any time within 30 days by submitting the required renewal 
application and/or paying the renewal fee (if required), plus $50. 
Within 60 days after the termination date of a valid and effective 
license, the former licensee shall be notified of such termination, 
unless a new license has been obtained in the meantime.

Sec. 46.10  Nonlicensed person; liability; penalty.

    Any commission merchant, dealer, or broker who violates the Act by 
engaging in business subject to the Act without a license may settle its 
liability, if such violation is found by the Director not to have been 
willful but due to inadvertence, by submitting the required application 
and paying the amount of fees that it would have paid had it obtained 
and maintained a license during the period that it engaged in business 
subject to the Act, plus an additional sum not in excess of two hundred 
and fifty dollars ($250) as may be determined by the Director.
[62 FR 15087, Mar. 31, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 46.11  What constitutes valid license, form and use.

    Each license shall bear a serial number, the names in which 
authorized to conduct business, type of ownership; if the business is 
individually owned, the name of the owner; if a partnership, the names 
of all general partners; the facsimile signature of the Director, the 
seal of the Department and shall be duly countersigned. The licensee may 
place upon his stationery, trucks, or business sign an inscription 
indicating that he is licensed under the Act, but such inscription must 
not be of such form or arrangement as to be deceptive or misleading to 
the public, nor shall any such inscription be displayed or used unless 
the person using the inscription has a license valid and effective at 
the time.


<R05>
Sec. 46.12  Forms of inscriptions.

    The following inscriptions, for use with or without the license 
number, meet the foregoing requirements and may be used by licensees: 
``Licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture under the Perishable 
Agricultural Commodities Act'', or ``Licensed under the PACA.''


<R05>
Sec. 46.13  Address, ownership, changes in trade name, changes in number of branches, changes in members of partnership, and bankruptcy.

    The licensee shall:
    (a) Promptly report to the Director in writing;
    (1) Any change of address;
    (2) Any change in officers, directors, and holders of more than ten 
percent of the outstanding stock of a corporation, with the percentage 
of the stock held by each such person;

    (4) Any change in the number and address of any branches or 
additional business facilities, and;
    (5) When the licensee, or if the licensee is a partnership, any

license is required in case of a change in the ownership of a firm, an 
addition or withdrawal or members of a partnership, or in case business 
is conducted under a different corporate charter from that under which 
the license was originally issued.
    (b) Obtain approval from the Director prior to using any trade name.

<R05>
Sec. 46.14  General.

    (a) Every commission merchant, dealer, and broker shall prepare and 
preserve for a period of two years from the closing date of the 
transaction the accounts, records, and memoranda required by the Act, 
which shall fully and correctly disclose all transactions involved in 
his business. Licensees shall keep records which are adapted to the 
particular business that the licensee is conducting and in each case 
such records shall fully disclose all transactions in the business in 
sufficient detail as to be readily understood and audited. It is 
impracticable to specify in detail every class of records which may be 
found essential since many different types of business are conducted in 
the produce industry and many different types of contracts are made 
covering a wide range of services by agents and others. The 
responsibility is placed on every licensee to maintain records which 
will disclose all essential facts regarding the transactions in his 
business.
    (b) Every commission merchant, dealer, and broker shall prepare and 
preserve records and memoranda required by the Act which shall fully and 
correctly disclose the true ownership

[[Page 278]]

and management of such business during the preceding four years. Such 
records shall include the number and location of all branches or 
additional business facilities operated by or for the commission 
merchant, dealer or broker. In the case of a corporation, such records 
shall include the corporate charter, record of stock subscription and 
stock issued, the amounts paid in for stock and minutes of stockholders' 
and directors' meetings showing the election of directors and officers, 
resignations and other pertinent corporate actions. In the case of a 
partnership, the records shall contain a copy of the partnership 
agreement showing the type of partnership, the full names and addresses 
of all partners including general, special or limited partners, the 
partnership interest of each individual and any other pertinent records 
of the partnership.

<R05>
Sec. 46.15  Documents to be preserved.

    Bills of lading, diversion orders, paid freight and other bills, car 
manifests, express receipts, confirmations and memorandums of sales, 
letter and wire correspondence, inspection certificates, invoices on

handling, delivery, and sale of each lot of produce shall be preserved 
for a period of 2 years.


<R05>
Sec. 46.16  Method of preservation or storage of records.

    All records required to be preserved under the Act shall be stored 
in an orderly manner and in keeping with sound business practices. The 
records being currently used shall be filed in order of dates, by serial 
numbers, alphabetically or by any other proper method which will enable 
the licensee to promptly locate and produce the records. Records in dead 
storage should be arranged in an orderly fashion, be packaged or wrapped 
to insure proper preservation, be adequately marked or identified, and 
stored in a safe, dry location. When part of the records are forwarded 
to others (such as accountants, traffic agencies, attorneys, etc.), 
proper notations should be filed in appropriate places in the records 
identifying the missing records and stating where they can be located.


<R05>
Sec. 46.17  Inspection of records.

    (a) Each licensee shall, during ordinary business hours, promptly 
upon request, permit any duly authorized representative of USDA to enter 
its place of business and inspect such accounts, records, and memoranda 
as may be material:
    (1) In the investigation of complaints under the Act, including any 
petition, written notification, or complaint under section 6 of the Act,
    (2) To the determination of ownership, control, packer, or State, 
country, or region of origin in connection with commodity inspections,
    (3) To ascertain whether there is compliance with section 9 of the 
Act,
    (4) In administering the licensing and bonding provisions of the 
Act,
    (5) If the licensee has been determined in a formal disciplinary 
proceeding to have violated the prompt payment provision of section 2(4) 
of the Act, to determine whether, at the time of the inspection, there 
is compliance with that section.
    (b) Any necessary facilities for such inspection shall be extended 
to such representative by the licensee, its agents, and employees.

                       Records of Market Receivers


<R05>
Sec. 46.18  Record of produce received.

    Market receivers shall keep in the order of receipt a record of all 
produce received and this record shall be in the form of a book 
(preferably a bound book) with numbered pages or comparable business 
record. This record shall clearly show for each lot the date

[[Page 279]]

of arrival and unloading; whether received by freight, express, truck, 
or otherwise; the car initials and number; the truck license number and 
the driver's name or the name of the trucking firm; the number of 
packages or the quantity received; the kind of produce; the name and 
address of the consignor or seller; whether the produce was purchased; 
consigned or received on joint account; and the disposition of the 
produce, whether jobbed or sold in carlots or trucklots, and the lot 
number assigned to the shipment by the receiver (as required by 
Sec. 46.20).


<R05>
Sec. 46.19  Sales tickets.

    Sales tickets shall bear printed serial numbers running 
consecutively and shall be used in numerical order so far as 
practicable. No serial number shall be repeated within a 90-day period. 
The sales tickets shall be prepared and all the details of the sale 
shall be entered on the tickets in a legible manner in order that an 
audit can be readily made. Erasures, strike-outs, changes, etc., should 
be held to the minimum. When errors are made in preparing sales tickets, 
the tickets should be voided. Each sales ticket shall show the date of 
sale, the purchaser's name (so far as practicable), the kind, quantity, 
the unit price, and the total selling price of the produce. Each sales 
ticket shall show the lot number of the shipment if the produce is being 
handled on consignment or on joint account. Sales tickets on all other 
lots of the same commodity which are on hand at the same time shall also 
show a lot number. The original or a legible carbon copy of each sales 
ticket, including those voided or unused, shall be accounted for and 
shall be filed or stored either by dates of sales or in the order of the 
serial numbers for a period of two years.


<R05>
Sec. 46.20  Lot numbers.

    An identifying lot number shall be assigned to each shipment of 
produce to be sold on consignment or joint account or for the account of 
another person or firm. A lot number should be assigned to any purchased 
shipment in dispute between the parties to assist in proving damages. A 
lot number shall be assigned to each purchased shipment of similar 
produce on hand at that time or received later while the consigned or 
joint account or disputed lot is being sold. A lot number shall be 
assigned to each purchased shipment which is reconditioned if the seller 
is to be charged with the shrinkage or loss. The lot number shall be 
entered on the receiving record in connection with each shipment and 
entered on all sales tickets identifying and segregating the sales from 
the various shipments on hand. The lot number shall be entered on the 
sales tickets by the salesmen at the time of sale or by the produce 
dispatcher, and not by bookkeepers or others after the sales have been 
made. No lot number shall be repeated within a period of 30 days after 
the last sale from the preceding lot to which such number was assigned.


<R05>
Sec. 46.21  Returns, rejections, or credit memorandums on sales.

    In the event of the rejection and return of any produce sold for or 
on behalf of another, on consignment, or on joint account, or of any 
necessary allowance or adjustment being made to the buyers thereof, a 
credit memorandum showing the buyer's name, sales ticket number, lot 
number, date of the granting of the allowance, and amount of the credit 
or adjustment, with reasons therefor, shall be made or a notation shall 
be made on the original sales ticket referring to the adjustment and 
showing where the credit memorandum is filed. The credit memorandum 
shall be on a regular form, in a ledger book, or on a sales ticket or 
invoice properly completed to show the facts and shall be approved by a 
duly authorized person. Credits granted shall be entered in the same 
records as the original sales tickets.


<R05>
Sec. 46.22  Accounting for dumped produce.

    A clear and complete record shall be maintained showing 
justification for dumping of produce received on joint account, on 
consignment, or handled for or on behalf of another person if any 
portion of such produce regardless of percentage cannot be sold due to 
poor condition or is lost through re-sorting or reconditioning. In 
addition to the foregoing, if five percent or

[[Page 280]]

more of a shipment is dumped, an official certificate, or other adequate 
evidence, shall be obtained to prove the produce was actually without 
commercial value, unless there is a specific agreement to the contrary 
between the parties. The original certificate or other adequate evidence 
justifying dumping shall be forwarded to the consignor or joint account 
partner with the accounting and a copy shall be retained by the 
receiver.


<R05>
Sec. 46.23  Evidence of dumping.

    Reasonable cause for destroying any produce exists when the 
commodity has no commercial value or when it is dumped by order of a 
local health officer or other authorized official or when the shipper 
has specifically consented to such disposition. The term ``commercial 
value'' means any value that a commodity may have for any purpose that 
can be ascertained by the exercise of due diligence without unreasonable 
expense or loss of time. When produce is being handled for or on behalf 
of another person, proof as to the quantities of produce destroyed or 
dumped in excess of five percent of the shipment shall be provided by 
procuring an official certificate showing that the produce has no 
commercial value from any person authorized by the Department to inspect 
fruits and vegetables. Where such inspection service is not available 
certification may be obtained from (a) any health officer or food 
inspector of any State, county, parish, city or municipality or of the 
District of Columbia; (b) any established commercial agency or service 
making inspections for the fruit and vegetable industry; or (c) when no 
inspector or health officer designated above is available consideration 
will be given to other evidence such as inspection and certification 
made by any two persons having no financial interest in the produce 
involved or in the business of any person financially interested 
therein, and who are unrelated by blood or marriage to any such 
financially interested person, and who, at the time of the inspection 
and certification, and for a period of at least one year immediately 
prior thereto, have been engaged in the handling of the same general 
kind or class of produce with respect to which the inspections and 
certification are to be made. Any certificate issued by any persons 
designated in paragraph (c) of this section shall include a statement 
that each of them possesses the requisite qualifications. Any such 
certificate shall properly identify the produce by showing the 
commodity, lot number, brand or principal identifying marks on the 
containers, quantity dumped, name and address of shipper, name and 
address of applicant, condition of the produce, time, place, and date of 
inspection and a statement that the produce possesses no commercial 
value.

                          Records of Retailers


<R05>
Sec. 46.24  Records of retailers.

    Notwithstanding the specific records and documents prescribed in the 
foregoing sections, licensees who purchase produce solely for sale at 
retail shall establish and maintain accounts and records, adapted to 
their type of operations, which will fully and correctly disclose all 
transactions relating to the purchase of produce. Such accounts and 
records should include the date of receipt of each lot, kind of produce, 
number of packages and quantity, price paid, evidence of agreement, or 
contract of purchase, bills of lading, paid bills, and any other 
documents relating to the purchase of produce.

                              Auction Sales


<R05>
Sec. 46.25  Auction sales.

    Commission merchants, dealers and brokers who offer produce for sale 
through auction companies which publish catalogs of offerings will be 
responsible for furnishing the auction company for publication true and 
correct information concerning the ownership of the produce. When the 
produce is offered for sale by an owner, his name shall be shown in the 
catalog listing as owner. When a joint account partner makes an 
offering, his name as well as that of his joint partner, or partners, 
shall be shown. When any person offers produce for sale at auction for 
the account of another, the name, or names of the owner, if known, and 
of his principal shall be shown. In addition to listing such name or 
names

[[Page 281]]

he may show that he is acting in the capacity of agent. If a person 
instructs an auction company to catalog a shipment without disclosing 
true ownership, if known, or the name of an agent's principal, he shall 
be deemed to have made a false or misleading statement within the 
meaning of the Act. Since sales at auctions normally involve additional 
expenses, a broker, grower's agent or commission merchant shall have 
prior consent from his principal before such disposition is 
accomplished. Where a dispute exists regarding the ownership of produce, 
it may be listed in the auction catalog as being offered for sale ``for 
the account of whom concerned'' with the name of the party making the 
offering shown as agent.

                           Duties of Licensees


<R05>
Sec. 46.26  Duties of licensees.

    It is impracticable to specify in detail all of the duties of 
brokers, commission merchants, joint account partners, growers' agents 
and shippers because of the many types of businesses conducted. 
Therefore, the duties described in these regulations are not to be 
considered as a complete description of all of the duties required but 
is merely a description of their principal duties. The responsibility is 
placed on each licensee to fully perform any specification or duty, 
express or implied, in connection with any transaction handled subject 
to the Act.

                                 Brokers


<R05>
Sec. 46.27  Types of broker operations.

    (a) Brokers carry on their business operations in several different 
ways and are generally classified by their method of operation. The 
following are some of the broad groupings by method of operation. The 
usual operation of brokers consists of the negotiation of the purchase 
and sale of produce either of one commodity or of several commodities. A 
broker is usually engaged by only one of the parties, but in negotiating 
a contract the broker acts as a special agent of first one and then the 
other party in conveying offers, counter offers, and acceptances between 
the parties. Once the contract is formed, and the confirmation issued, 
the broker's duties are usually ended, and the broker is not the proper 
party to whom notice of breach or of rejection should be directed. 
However, a broker receiving notice has a duty to promptly convey the 
notice to the proper party. Frequently, brokers never see the produce 
they are quoting for sale or negotiating for purchase by the buyer, and 
they carry out their duties by conveying information received from the 
parties between the buyer and seller until a contract is effected. 
Generally, the seller of the produce invoices the buyer, however, when 
there is a specific agreement between the broker and its principal, the 
seller invoices the broker who, in turn, invoices the buyer, collects, 
and remits to the seller. Under other types of agreements, the seller 
ships the produce to pool buyers, and the broker as an accommodation to 
the seller invoices the buyers, collects, and remits to the seller. 
Also, there are times when the broker is authorized by the seller to act 
much like a commission merchant, being given blanket authority to 
dispose of the produce for the seller's account either by negotiation of 
sales to buyers not known to the seller or by placing the produce for 
sale on consignment with receivers in the terminal markets.
    (b) There is a second general grouping of brokers which are commonly 
referred to as buying brokers. Their operations are typified by the fact 
that they act as the buyer's representative in negotiating purchases at 
shipping points, terminal markets, or intermediate points. Their typical 
type of operation is to negotiate a purchase on the buyer's instructions 
and authorization. Sometimes the broker negotiates the purchase without 
seeing the produce. In other instances he may select the merchandise 
after forming an appraisal of the quality of the produce being offered 
for sale on the market. Generally, a purchase is made in the buyer's 
name and the seller invoices the buyer direct. On the other hand, acting 
on authority given him by the buyer, the broker may negotiate purchases 
in his own name, pay the seller for the produce, make arrangements for 
its loading and shipment, and bill

[[Page 282]]

the buyer direct for the cost price plus the brokerage fee and the cost 
of any agreed upon accessorial service charges such as ice, loading, 
etc.
[28 FR 7067, July 11, 1963; 28 FR 7287, July 17, 1963, as amended at 62 
FR 15087, Mar. 31, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 46.28  Duties of brokers.

    (a) General. The function of a broker is to facilitate good faith 
negotiations between parties which lead to valid and binding contracts. 
A broker who fails to perform any specification or duty, express or 
implied, in connection with any transaction is in violation of the Act, 
is subject to the penalties specified in the Act, and may be held liable 
for damages which accrue as a result of the violation. It shall be the 
duty of the broker to fully inform the parties concerning all proposed 
terms and conditions of the proposed contract. After all parties agree 
on the terms and the contract is effected, the broker shall prepare in 
writing and deliver promptly to all parties a properly executed 
confirmation or memorandum of sale setting forth truly and correctly all 
of the essential details of the agreement between the parties, including 
any express agreement as to the time when payment is due. The 
confirmation or memorandum of sale shall also identify the party who 
engaged the broker to act in the negotiations. If the confirmation or 
memorandum of sale does not contain such information, the broker shall 
be presumed to have been engaged by the buyer. Brokers do not normally 
act as general agents of either party, and will not be presumed to have 
so acted. Unless otherwise agreed and confirmed, the broker will be 
entitled to payment of brokerage fees from the party by whom it was 
engaged to act as broker. The broker shall retain a copy of such 
confirmations or memoranda as part of its accounts and records. The 
broker who does not prepare these documents and retain copies in its 
files is failing to prepare and maintain complete and correct records as 
required by the Act. The broker who does not deliver copies of these 
documents to all parties involved in the transaction is failing to 
perform its duties as a broker. A broker who issues a confirmation or 
memorandum of sale containing false or misleading statements shall be 
deemed to have committed a violation of section 2 of the Act. If the 
broker's records do not support its contentions that a binding contract 
was made with proper notice to the parties, the broker may be held 
liable for any loss or damage resulting from such negligence, or for 
other penalties provided by the Act for failing to perform its express 
or implied duties. The broker shall take into consideration the time of 
delivery of the shipment involved in the contract, and all other 
circumstances of the transaction, in selecting the proper method for 
transmitting the written confirmation or memorandum of sale to the 
parties. A buying broker is required to truly and correctly account to 
its principal in accordance with Sec. 46.2(y)(3). The broker should 
advise the appropriate party promptly when any notice of rejection or 
breach is received, or of any other unforeseen development of which it 
is informed.
    (b) Brokerage fees. A broker is not considered to be entitled to a 
brokerage fee unless he effects a sale or makes a valid and binding 
contract, fully performing his duties as a broker. Unless otherwise 
specifically agreed, the broker does not guarantee the performance of 
the contracting parties and is entitled to receive prompt payment of the 
brokerage fee whenever a valid and binding contract is negotiated. 
Brokerage fees may be charged to only one of the parties to the contract 
unless by prior agreement the parties agree to split the brokerage fee. 
If the brokerage fee is charged to both parties without a specific prior 
agreement, such action by the broker is a violation of the Act. A broker 
employed to negotiate the sale of produce may not employ another broker 
or selling agent, including auction companies, without the specific 
prior approval of his principal. When the broker is authorized to sell, 
invoice the buyer, collect and remit to his principal, he shall render 
an itemized accounting to the principal promptly on receipt of payment, 
showing the true gross selling price, all brokerage fees deducted, any 
auction charges and any other expenses incurred in connection with the 
sale of the shipment. The failure to account truly and correctly and

[[Page 283]]

make full payment promptly is a violation of the Act.
    (c) Broker's responsibility for payment. In the absence of a 
specific agreement, a broker is not responsible for payment to the 
seller by the buyer. Agreement to collect from the buyer and remit to 
the seller is not a guarantee by the broker that the buyer will pay for 
the produce purchased, unless there is a specific agreement by the 
broker that he will pay if the buyer does not pay. A broker who agrees 
to collect funds from the buyer for his principal shall render an 
itemized accounting to the principal promptly on receipt of payment 
showing the true gross selling price, all brokerage fees deducted and 
all expenses including auction charges, incurred in connection with the 
sale of the shipment. The failure to account truly and correctly and 
make full payment promptly is a violation of the Act. While the broker 
is not obliged to furnish his principal information regarding the 
financial condition of the buyer, if the broker furnishes such 
information, he must truthfully report the information available to him, 
and any false or misleading statements for a fraudulent purpose to the 
principal to encourage the sale will be a violation of the Act. A buying 
broker who negotiates a purchase in his own name under an agreement with 
his principal, is responsible for payment of the purchase price to the 
seller. A broker has no authority to grant allowances or adjust the 
seller's invoice price to the buyer without the specific prior approval 
of his principal.
    (d) Purchases and sales by brokers. A person who operates in a dual 
capacity, both as a broker and a dealer, shall clearly disclose his 
status in each transaction to all parties with whom he is dealing. If 
such a person misrepresents himself as a broker to the buyer or the 
seller when he is acting as a dealer purchasing produce or selling 
produce he has purchased, he shall be considered to have violated the 
Act. When a person purchases or sells produce as a dealer, he shall not 
request or receive a brokerage fee from the buyer or the seller. A 
broker shall not negotiate a transaction where the broker is subject to 
the direct or indirect control of any party to the transaction other 
than his principal, or where the other party is subject to the direct or 
indirect control of the broker without fully disclosing the 
circumstances to his principal and obtaining his specific prior 
approval.
    (e) Filing carrier claims by brokers. Without prior consent of the 
owner, a broker has no authority to file claims with carriers in his own 
name or any other name. A broker has no obligation to file carrier 
claims for the owners of the shipments. However, when a broker in a 
transaction receives information valuable to the owner in connection 
with carrier claim rights, the broker should promptly advise the owner. 
A broker who agrees to protect the carrier claims of owners shall at all 
times exercise reasonable care to fulfill such obligation. If a broker 
makes an agreement with a seller or a buyer to file and handle such a 
claim for the benefit of the owner of the produce, the claim shall be 
filed promptly with the carrier, supported by adequate evidence, and he 
shall take the necessary action to bring the matter to a conclusion. A 
copy of the claim shall be forwarded to the owner of the shipment when 
the claim is filed. When settlement of the claim is effected, the broker 
shall promptly remit the net amount due the owner, after deducting the 
agreed or customary charges for handling the claim. Adequate information 
shall be furnished the owner regarding the claim while the matter is 
being handled with the carrier. If the owner files the claim, the broker 
shall promptly furnish any necessary information available in his 
records which is requested by the owner.

    Receiving Market Commission Merchants and Joint Account Partners


<R05>
Sec. 46.29  Duties.

    (a) General. All licensees who accept produce for sale on 
consignment or on joint account are required to exercise reasonable care 
and diligence in disposing of the produce promptly and in a

[[Page 284]]

fair and reasonable manner. A commission merchant engaged to sell 
consigned produce may not employ another person or firm, including 
auction companies, to dispose of all or part of such produce without the 
specific prior authority of the consignor. A commission merchant is not 
authorized to sell consigned produce outside the market area where he is 
located without obtaining the permission of the consignor. Averaging or 
pooling of sales is not permissible unless the receiver obtains the 
specific written permission of the consignor prior to rendering the 
accounting. Complete and detailed records shall be prepared and 
maintained by all commission merchants and joint account partners 
covering produce received, sales, quantities lost, dates and cost of 
repacking or reconditioning, unloading, handling, freight, demurrage or 
auction charges, and any other expenses which are deducted on the 
accounting, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 46.18 through 
Sec. 46.23. When rendering account sales for produce handled for or on 
behalf of another, an accurate and itemized report of sales and expenses 
charged against the shipment shall be made. It is a violation of section 
2 of the Act to fail to render true and correct accountings in 
connection with consignments or produce handled on joint account. 
Charges which cannot be supported by proper evidence in the records of 
the commission merchant or joint account partner shall not be deducted. 
The commission merchant or joint account partner may be held liable for 
any financial loss and for other penalties provided by the Act, due to 
his negligence or failure to perform any specification or duty, express 
or implied, arising out of any transaction subject to the Act.
    (b) Commission charges. Before accepting produce on consignment, the 
parties should reach a definite agreement on the amount of the 
commission and other charges which will be assessed by the commission 
merchant. In the absence of such an agreement, only the usual and 
customary commission and other charges shall be permitted. The receiver 
may not reconsign produce to another person or firm, including auction 
companies, and incur additional commissions, charges or expenses without 
the specific prior authority of the consignor. Unless otherwise agreed 
upon by the parties, joint account partners shall not charge a 
commission fee or other selling charges against the joint account for 
disposing of the produce. When a portion of a consigned shipment is 
purchased by the commission merchant he shall not charge or receive a 
commission fee for such sales.
    (c) Purchasing consigned produce. A commission merchant or joint 
account partner may not purchase produce received on consignment or 
joint account or sell such produce to any person or firm over whose 
business he has direct or indirect control, or to any person or firm 
having direct or indirect control over his business, without specific 
prior authority of the consignor or the joint account partner. However, 
produce may be purchased by the commission merchant or joint account 
partner at reasonable market value to clean up remnants of shipments so 
accountings will not be unduly delayed, provided the accounting shows 
the quantity and price of the goods bought by the commission merchant or 
joint account partner. ``Remnants,'' as used here, mean small quantities 
remaining after the bulk of the shipment has been sold but shall not 
exceed 5 percent of the shipment. When consigned produce is purchased by 
a commission merchant he shall not charge or receive a commission fee 
for such sales.
    (d) Filing carrier claims. Without the prior consent of the owner of 
the produce, a commission merchant has no authority to file claims with 
carriers in his own name or any other name: Provided, That the 
commission merchant may file a claim for breakage where the owner has 
been paid for the full value of the produce without any deduction for 
damage. Commission merchants have no obligation to file carrier claims 
on shipments for the owners. However, when a commission merchant in a 
transaction receives information valuable to the consignor in connection 
with carrier claim rights, the commission merchant should promptly 
advise the consignor. Before a commission merchant files a carrier claim 
on a consigned shipment, a specific agreement shall be reached with

[[Page 285]]

the consignor. If a commission merchant is authorized and agrees to file 
the claim, he shall forward a copy of the claim filed with the carrier 
to the consignor and shall exercise reasonable care to protect the 
interests of the consignor by filing the claim promptly and in the 
proper amount, supported by adequate evidence, and shall take the 
necessary action to bring the matter to a conclusion. When settlement of 
the claim is effected, he shall promptly remit the net amount due the 
consignor, after deducting the agreed handling charges. Full and 
complete information shall be furnished the consignor while the claim is 
being handled. If the consignor is to file the claim, the commission 
merchant shall exercise reasonable care to protect the claim rights of 
the consignor and shall promptly furnish all necessary information and 
evidence from his records to enable the consignor to file a proper 
claim. A joint account partner who files a carrier claim on behalf of 
the partnership shall forward a copy of the claim filed with the carrier 
to his partner, keep him advised of its status, and remit promptly his 
share of the net proceeds realized from such claim.

                      Growers' Agents and Shippers


<R05>
Sec. 46.30  Types of operations by growers' agents and shippers.

    (a) The usual operations of shippers consist of purchasing produce 
from growers in their own names. They distribute the produce in commerce 
by selling, consigning, or jointing the shipments, assuming any loss or 
profits that result from these operations. In addition, shippers may 
handle produce on joint account with growers or others.
    (b) Growers' agents sell and distribute produce for or on behalf of 
growers and others and, in addition, may perform a wide variety of 
services, such as financing, planting, harvesting, grading, packing, 
furnishing labor, seed, containers, and other supplies or services. They 
usually distribute the produce in their own names and collect payment 
direct from the consignees. They render accountings to their principals, 
paying the net proceeds after deducting their expenses and fees. Some 
agents are limited by contract to making only sales and cannot joint or 
consign produce without obtaining the prior consent of the growers. 
Other agents are granted blanket authority by the growers to market and 
distribute the produce, using their discretion as to the best methods, 
depending on market conditions and the quality of the produce available. 
They can sell, consign or ship on joint account, use the services of 
brokers or sell through terminal market auctions. They are authorized to 
grant credits, make adjustments in the invoice price, handle claims with 
the carriers, or even abandon shipments, when circumstances justify such 
action, without consulting the growers. Some agents have an agreement 
with the growers to pool the produce and render accountings on the basis 
of the average or prorated selling prices after deducting the prorated 
expenses incurred for the various operations performed and the agents' 
selling fees. Some agents's contracts require an accounting on the basis 
of actual selling prices after deducting the actual expenses incurred 
for services performed and the selling fees. Some agents' contracts 
specify a fixed charge for harvesting, grading, packing, furnishing the 
container or other services, plus a selling fee, and thereby 
substantially reduce the record requirements necessary to prove the cost 
of the various operations.


<R05>
Sec. 46.31  Duties of shippers.

    (a) General. The responsibilities of shippers vary with their 
contracts with growers to purchase produce or to handle produce on joint 
account. Similarly, their responsibilities to their customers depend 
upon their contracts to sell, consign or joint account produce with 
dealers on terminal markets. Shippers shall pay promptly for produce 
purchased and any deficits incurred on consigned shipments. They shall 
fully comply with their obligations in connection with joint account 
transactions. A shipper who fails to perform any express or implied duty 
is in violation of the Act and may be held liable for any damages 
resulting therefrom. The shipper shall prepare and

[[Page 286]]

maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the details of his 
transactions.
    (b) Receiving records. Each shipper shall prepare and maintain a 
record of all produce handled including his own production. This record 
shall be in the form of a book (preferably a bound book), with numbered 
pages or comparable business records. This receiving record shall show 
for each lot the date received, whether purchased or received on joint 
account, the quantity, quality, and kind of produce, the purchase price 
or joint account cost, and the name and address of the supplier. 
Shippers shall issue receipts to growers and others for all produce 
received.
    (c) Disposition records. When a shipper purchases produce from 
growers or others, his records shall also show the disposition of the 
produce, whether sold or consigned, date of shipment, car number, or if 
shipped by truck, the license number, name and address of the carrier, 
name and address of the buyer, commission merchant or auction, and other 
pertinent details of the transaction, such as the terms of sale, selling 
price, and date of payment.
    (d) Joint accounts with growers. When a shipper enters into a joint 
account transaction with growers or others, the agreement between the 
parties should be reduced to a written contract clearly defining the 
duties and responsibilities of both parties and the extent of the 
shipper's authority in distributing the produce. The shipper shall 
prepare and maintain records to show in detail the actual expenses 
incurred for the services he furnishes, such as harvesting, grading, 
packing and selling the produce (unless a fixed charge is agreed upon by 
the parties to cover the cost of these services), methods of 
distribution and proceeds received for the produce. If a shipper is at 
the same time handling similar produce not involved in the joint account 
transaction, a lot number or other positive means of identification 
shall be assigned to each lot of produce received in order to segregate 
and identify the various lots of produce. If a shipper consigns all or 
part of the produce or employs the services of brokers or terminal 
market auctions, his records shall show the results of these 
transactions, including the expenses involved and the names and 
addresses of the commission merchants, brokers, and the auctions. The 
shipper shall render a detailed and accurate accounting and pay promptly 
the net proceeds due the joint partner, in accordance with Sec. 46.2(y), 
(z), and (aa). The accounting shall disclose the status of all claims 
collected or filed with the carriers.
    (e) Joint accounts with receivers. When a shipper enters into a 
joint account agreement with a terminal market dealer, the agreement 
should be reduced to writing clearly defining the terms of the 
agreement. The shipper's records shall show the expenses which may be 
properly charged in accordance with the joint agreement, purchase price 
or joint account cost of the produce, and cost of harvesting, packing, 
grading, or other expenses. His records shall show the quantity and 
quality of the produce packed and shipped, the dates and methods of 
shipment, and all other pertinent details of his operation. At the 
conclusion of the transaction, a detailed and accurate accounting shall 
be furnished promptly to the joint partner, in accordance with 
Sec. 46.2(z). If a deficit results, the shipper shall pay promptly his 
share of the deficit.


<R05>
Sec. 46.32  Duties of growers' agents.

    (a) General. The duties, responsibilities, and extent of the 
authority of a growers' agent depend on the type of contract made with 
the growers. Agreements between growers and agents should be reduced to 
a written contract clearly defining the duties and responsibilities of 
both parties and the extent of the agent's authority in distributing the 
produce. When such agreements between the parties are not reduced to 
written contracts, the agent shall have available a written statement 
describing the terms and conditions under which he will handle the 
produce of the grower during the current season and shall mail or 
deliver this statement to the grower on or before receipt of the first 
lot. A grower will be considered to have agreed to these terms if, after 
receiving such statement, he delivers his produce to the agent for 
handling in the usual manner. In the event an unsolicited lot

[[Page 287]]

of produce is accepted by an agent for handling in his usual manner, he 
shall promptly deliver or mail a copy of such statement to the grower. A 
copy of this statement, showing the name of the grower and the date the 
statement was delivered to the grower, shall be retained in the agent's 
files. An agent who does not have in his files either written contracts 
or a written statement as required herein is failing to prepare and 
maintain full and complete records as required by the Act. Provided, 
That regulations or bylaws of cooperative marketing associations may be 
used in lieu of individual agreements or contracts to determine the 
methods of accounting and settlement with their grower members. An agent 
who fails to perform any specification or duty, express or implied, is 
in violation of the Act and may be held liable for any damages resulting 
therefrom and for other penalties provided under the Act for such 
failure.
    (b) Accounting for charges. A growers' agent whose operations 
include such services as the planting, harvesting, grading, packing, 
furnishing of containers or other supplies, storing, selling or 
distributing produce for or on behalf of growers shall prepare and 
maintain complete records on all transactions in sufficient detail as to 
be readily understood and audited. Agents must be in a position to 
render to the growers accurate and detailed accountings covering all 
aspects of their handling of the produce. Agents shall maintain a record 
of all produce received in the form of a book (preferably a bound book) 
with numbered pages or comparable business records, showing for each lot 
the date received, quantity, the kind of produce and the name and 
address of the grower. Agents shall issue receipts to growers and others 
for all produce received. A lot number or other positive means of 
identification shall be assigned to each lot in order to segregate the 
various lots of produce received from different growers from similar 
produce being handled at the same time. Each lot shall be so identified 
and segregated throughout all operations conducted by the agent, 
including the sale or other disposition of the produce. The records 
shall show the result of all packing and grading operations, including 
the quantity lost through packing and grading and the quantity and 
quality packed out. If the culls are sold, they shall be included in the 
accounting. Unless there is a specific agreement with the growers to 
pool all various growers' produce, the accounting to each of the growers 
shall itemize the actual expenses incurred for the various operations 
conducted by the agent and all the details of the disposition of the 
produce received from each grower including all sales, adjustments, 
rejections, details of consigned or jointed shipments and sales through 
brokers, auctions, and status of all claims filed with or collected from 
the carriers. The agent shall prepare and maintain full and complete 
records on all details of such distribution to provide supporting 
evidence for the accounting. If an agent is working under a pool 
agreement with growers, the accounting shall show how the pool cost and 
pool sales prices are computed. If the agent and the growers have agreed 
on a fixed charge to cover the various operations conducted by the 
agent, actual expenses incurred for these services covered by the 
agreement are not required to be shown in the accounting. The failure of 
the agent to render prompt, accurate and detailed accountings in 
accordance with Sec. 46.2 (z) and (aa), is a violation of the Act.
    (c) Sales through brokers or auctions. Unless a growers' agent is 
specifically authorized in his contract with the growers to use the 
services of brokers, commission merchants, joint partners, or auctions, 
he is not entitled to use these methods of marketing the growers' 
produce. Any expense incurred for such services, without the growers' 
permission, cannot be charged to the growers.
    (d) Filing of carrier claims. Without the prior consent of the 
growers, an agent has no authority to file claims with the carriers in 
his own name or any other name. An agent has no obligation to file 
carrier claims on shipments for growers in the absence of a specific 
agreement to perform these duties. All information which an agent has 
received in handling the shipment which is essential for the growers to 
file such claims shall be made available

[[Page 288]]

to the growers. If an agent has an agreement with the growers to file 
and handle carrier claims, he shall exercise reasonable care in handling 
the claims with the carriers by filing the claim promptly in the proper 
amount, supported by adequate evidence, and take any necessary action to 
bring the matter to a conclusion.
    (e) Purchases and sales by growers' agents. A person who operates in 
a dual capacity, both as a growers' agent and as a shipper, shall 
clearly disclose his status in each transaction to all parties with whom 
he is dealing. If such a person misrepresents himself as an agent, when 
he is acting as a shipper selling produce he has purchased, he shall be 
considered to have violated the Act. A growers' agent shall not charge 
or receive a fee from the seller or the buyer when he purchases or sells 
produce as a shipper. A growers' agent shall not negotiate a transaction 
where he is subject to the direct or indirect control of any party to 
such transactions, other than his principal, or where the other party is 
subject to the agent's direct or indirect control, without fully 
disclosing the circumstances to his principal and obtaining his specific 
prior approval.
    (f) Negligence of agent. A growers' agent may be held liable for any 
loss or damage resulting to the growers due to his negligence or failure 
to perform any specification or duty, express or implied, arising out of 
any undertaking in connection with transactions subject to the Act.
    (g) Responsibility for payment. An agent is not responsible for the 
payment by the buyer who has purchased the growers' produce on credit, 
unless he guarantees payment or is negligent in extending credit. 
Agreement to collect from the buyer and remit to his principal is not a 
guarantee by the agent that the agent will pay if the buyer does not 
pay.
    (h) Responsibility for payment of selling fees and expenses to the 
growers' agent. In the absence of a specific agreement to the contrary, 
the agent does not guarantee the performance of the contracting parties 
and he is entitled to the payment of his selling fees and expenses 
incurred in handling the produce of growers or others, providing he 
fully performs his duties as agent.
    (i) Agent's financial responsibility to buyers for failure to comply 
with contracts. If a growers' agent contracts in his own name to deliver 
produce to a buyer and subsequently cannot deliver produce complying 
with the contract because the growers cannot or will not deliver such 
produce to him, he may be liable to the buyer for damages resulting from 
the breach of the contract.

                           Conversion of Funds


<R05>
Sec. 46.33  Conversion of funds.

    Any licensee who collects or receives funds for or on behalf of 
another person or firm in connection with produce shall not make any use 
or disposition of such funds in his possession or control that will 
endanger or impair faithful and prompt payment to the owner or consignor 
of the produce or to any other person having a financial interest 
therein.

                         Disclosure of Business


<R05>

Administrator, Director, or a court of competent jurisdiction, any facts 
or information regarding the business of such licensee which may come to 
the knowledge of such representative through an examination or 
inspection of the business or the accounts of the licensee, unless such 
facts or information should be testified to at a hearing authorized by 
the act because they are relevant and material to the issue in the case 
being heard.

<R05>
Sec. 46.35  Suspension or revocation order.

effective date thereof. Service of orders shall be accomplished in 
accordance with Sec. 47.4 of this chapter.
    (b) Except in the case of any license automatically suspended by the 
Act, a reasonable time shall be allowed, which shall not be less than 10

which period the licensee may make all necessary arrangements with some 
other person, who has a valid and effective license to safeguard the 
interests of consignors or other innocent parties whose property or 
business may be affected by such suspension or revocation and during 
which the licensee may terminate his affairs and business relating to 
the handling of produce.
    (c) After the revocation of his license or during the effective 
period of any suspension thereof, no person shall, either directly or 
indirectly, through any agent, employee, or otherwise, carry on the 
business of a commission merchant, dealer, or broker until his status as 
a licensee has been restored.
    (d) The suspension or revocation of a license shall not prevent the 
licensee from collecting amounts due on contracts entered into prior to 
the date of suspension or revocation or from remitting promptly to his 
principals and obligees.

                          Publication of Facts


<R05>
Sec. 46.36  Publicity.

    Upon the issuance by the Secretary of an order revoking or 
suspending a license, or in case of automatic suspension of a license 
for failure to pay a reparation award, the Director shall cause general 
publicity to be given to such fact, in order that those doing business 
with the licensee whose license has been revoked or suspended may take 
due notice thereof.

                       Trade Terms and Definitions


<R05>
Sec. 46.43  Terms construed.

    The following terms and definitions, when used in any contract or 
communication involving any transaction coming within the scope of the 
Act, shall be construed as follows:
    (a) Today's shipment, or shipment on a specified date (such as 
shipment September 12), means in connection with shipments by rail, that 
the goods referred to shall be under billing by the transportation 
company on the date the order is given or on the date specified in time 
to be picked up by a train schedule to move that day's loadings from the 
shipping point. When used in connection with shipments by boat, this 
term shall mean that the goods shall be placed alongside the boat and be 
under billing in time to be loaded and shipped on a boat scheduled to 
leave before midnight of the date specified. When used in connection 
with shipments by truck, this term shall mean that the goods shall be 
loaded and shall actually start from loading point to destination before 
midnight of the date specified.
    (b) Tomorrow's shipment or immediate shipment means that the 
shipment referred to shall be under billing by the transportation 
company in time to move on a transportation facility scheduled to leave 
not more than 24 hours later than allowed under ``today's shipment.''
    (c) Quick shipment means that the conditions of the offer, order, or 
confirmation will be met if the shipment is under billing by the 
transportation company in time to move on a transportation facility 
scheduled to leave not more than 48 hours later than allowed under 
``today's shipment.''
    (d) Prompt shipment means that the conditions of the offer, order, 
or confirmation will be met if the shipment is under billing by the 
transportation company in time to move on a transportation facility 
scheduled to leave not more than 72 hours later than allowed under 
``today's shipment.''
    (e) Shipment first part of week or shipment early part of week means 
that the produce referred to shall be under billing on Monday or Tuesday 
of the week specified in time to be picked up by a train scheduled to 
move these days' loadings from the shipping point. When used in 
connection with shipments by truck, this term shall mean that the goods 
shall be loaded and shall actually start from loading point to 
destination before midnight on Tuesday of the week specified.
    (f) Shipment middle of week means that the produce referred to shall

term shall mean that the goods shall be loaded and shall actually start 
from loading point to destination before midnight on Thursday of the 
week specified.
    (g) Shipment last of week or shipment latter part of week means that 
the produce referred to shall be under billing by the transportation

midnight on Saturday of the week specified.

[[Page 291]]

    (h) Shipment as soon as possible or Shipment as soon as car (truck) 
can be secured means that the shipper is uncertain as to when the 
shipment can be made, but expects to make it within a reasonable time 
and will make it soon as possible. But in any case where these words are 
used the buyer shall, at any time after 7 days from the date the order 
is given, have the right to cancel the order or contract of sale, if 
notice of his decision so to cancel shall have been received by the 
shipper before shipment has been made.
    (i) F.o.b. (for example, f.o.b. Laredo, Tex., or f.o.b. California) 
means that the produce quoted or sold is to be placed free on board the 
boat, car, or other agency of the through land transportation at 
shipping point, in suitable shipping condition (see definitions of 
``suitable shipping condition,'' paragraphs (j) and (k) of this 
section), and that the buyer assumes all risk of damage and delay in 
transit not caused by the seller irrespective of how the shipment is 
billed. The buyer shall have the right of inspection at destination 
before the goods are paid for to determine if the produce shipped 
complied with the terms of the contract at time of shipment, subject to 
the provisions covering suitable shipping condition.
    (j) Suitable shipping condition, in relation to direct shipments, 
means that the commodity, at time of billing, is in a condition which, 
if the shipment is handled under normal transportation service and 
conditions, will assure delivery without abnormal deterioration at the 
contract destination agreed upon between the parties. If a good delivery 
standard for a commodity is set forth in Sec. 46.44, and that commodity 
at the contract destination contains deterioration in excess of any 
tolerance provided therein, it will be considered abnormally 
deteriorated. The seller has no responsibility for any deterioration in 
transit if there is no contract destination agreed upon between the 
parties.
    (k) Suitable shipping condition, in connection with reconsigned 
rolling or tramp cars, means that the commodity, at time of sale, meets

section, relating to direct shipments.
    (l) F.o.b. acceptance or Shipping point acceptance means that the 
buyer accepts the produce at shipping point and has no right of 
rejection. The buyer has recourse against the seller if the produce was 
not in suitable shipping condition (see definitions, paragraphs (j) and 
(k) of this section) or has recourse for a material breach of contract, 
providing the shipment is not rejected. The buyer's remedy under this 
method of purchase is by recovery of damages from the seller and not by 
rejection.
    (m) F.o.b. acceptance final or Shipping point acceptance final means 
that the buyer accepts the produce at shipping point and has no right of 
rejection. Suitable shipping condition does not apply under this trade 
term. The buyer does have recourse for a material breach of contract, 
providing the shipment is not rejected. The buyer's remedy under this 
type of contract is by recovery of damages from the seller and not by 
rejection of the shipment.
    (n) F.o.b. steamer means that the produce is to be placed free on 
board steamer at shipping point, in suitable shipping condition (see 
definitions of ``suitable shipping condition'', paragraphs (j) and (k) 
of this section) in accordance with the terms of the contract, and that 
the buyer assumes all responsibility and risk of damage thereafter.
    (o) F.a.s. steamer means that the produce is to be delivered free 
alongside the steamer, in suitable shipping condition (see definitions 
of ``suitable shipping condition'', paragraphs (j) and (k) of this 
section), in accordance with the terms of the contract, and that the 
buyer assumes all responsibility and risk of damage thereafter.
    (p) Delivered or delivered sale means that the produce is to be 
delivered by the seller on board car, or truck or on dock if delivered 
by boat, at the market in which the buyer is located, or at such other 
market as is agreed upon, free of any and all charges for transportation 
or protective service. The seller assumes all risks of loss and damage 
in transit not caused by the buyer For example, a sale of ``U.S. No. 1 
potatoes delivered Chicago'' means that the potatoes, when tendered for 
delivery at Chicago, shall meet all the

requirements of the U.S. No. 1 grade as to quality and condition.
    (q) In transit, roller, or rolling car means that the produce 
referred to is in possession of the transportation company and under 
movement from shipping point when the quotation is made, and that the 
car is moving over a route in line of haul between the point of origin 
and the market in which delivery is to be made, and has been so moving 
since date of shipment, without any delay attributable to the shipper or 
his agent. Unless otherwise specifically agreed, if a roller, rolling 
car, or a car in transit is sold f.o.b. shipping point, the buyer shall 
be deemed to have assumed only the lowest all-rail freight charges 
applicable for the shipment between the point of origin and the contract 
destination agreed upon between the parties together with such other 
charges which would have accrued if the car had been originally shipped 
direct to the contract destination: Provided, That the buyer is not 
liable for payment for protective services if the seller does not inform 
him of the kind and extent of such services ordered from the carrier.
    (r) Tramp car or tramp car sale means that the produce has left the 
shipping point under a bill of lading issued prior to the day on which 
the quotation is made and has moved or is moving over a route out of 
line of haul with the market in which it is to be delivered or in which 
it is being offered or quoted, or has been moving over a route in line 
of haul between the point of origin and the market in which it is to be 
delivered or in which it is being offered or quoted, but has been 
delayed in transit by the seller, or has been held by the transportation 
company at diversion or other points en route awaiting instructions from 
the shipper and by such holding or delay has missed scheduled movement 
between points of shipment and the market in which it is to be delivered 
as the result of the transaction in question. Unless otherwise 
specifically agreed, if a ``tramp car'' is sold f.o.b. shipping point or 
a ``tramp car sale'' is made f.o.b. shipping point, the buyer shall be 
deemed to assume only the lowest authorized all-rail freight charges 
applicable for the shipment between the point of origin and the contract 
destination agreed upon between the parties, together with such other 
charges which would have accrued if the car had been originally shipped 
direct to the contract destination: Provided, That the buyer is not 
liable for payment for protective services if the seller does not inform 
him of the kind and extent of such services ordered from the carrier.
    (s) Rolling acceptance means that the buyer accepts at time of 
purchase produce which is in the custody of the transportation company 
and under movement from shipping point, under the terms and conditions 
described in paragraphs (q) and (r) of this section, except that the 
buyer assumes full responsibility for transportation of the goods from 
time of purchase, has no recourse against the seller because of any 
change in condition after time of purchase unless the goods at the time 
of sale were not in suitable shipping condition, and has no right of 
rejection on arrival. The buyer's remedy under this method of purchase 
is by recovery of damages from the shipper and not by rejection of the 
shipment. By agreement between the parties, however, the purchase may be 
made subject to inspection at any specified point while the car is 
rolling or in transit and the point at which the buyer will assume 
transportation charges may be specified without affecting the time of 
acceptance of the commodity.
    (t) Rolling acceptance final means the same as Rolling acceptance 
except that the buyer has no recourse against the seller because of any 
change in condition of the produce in transit. The buyer has recourse 
against the seller for any material breach of the contract providing the 
shipment is not rejected. The buyer's remedy under this type of contract 
is recovery of damages from the seller and not by rejection.
    (u)(1) Track sale or sale on track means a sale of produce on track 
after transit and after inspection or opportunity for inspection by the 
buyer, or his agent, who shall be considered to have waived any right to 
reject the commodity so purchased upon receipt by him or his duly 
authorized representative from the seller or his duly authorized 
representative of the bill of

[[Page 293]]

lading, delivery order, or other document enabling him to obtain the 
goods from the carrier.
    (2) The above definition shall not be construed as depriving the 
buyer of a right to reparation when the unloading of the car 
demonstrates that a part of the lading which was not accessible to 
inspection was of a quality or condition materially inferior to that 
portion which was accessible to inspection; but notice of intention to 
file a claim for reparation must be given the seller within 24 hours 
after receipt by the buyer of the delivery order or bill of lading.
    (3) If the seller gives the date of arrival when quoting price, the 
buyer shall, in the absence of any written memorandum of sale to the 
contrary, assume all charges that accrue on the shipment from the date 
of its arrival. If the seller fails to furnish the date of arrival when 
quoting price the buyer may, in the absence of any written memorandum of 
sale which includes the date of arrival or specific written statement as 
to who shall assume such charges as have accrued after arrival, assume 
that the shipment arrived at point of sale on the day and date upon 
which the purchase was made, and shall be liable only for such charges 
as would properly attach to a shipment arriving on the date the purchase 
was made.
    (v) C.a.f., c.a.c., and c.i.f. mean cost and freight, cost and 
charges, and cost, insurance, and freight, respectively. C.a.f. sales 
shall be deemed to be the same as f.o.b. sales, except that the selling 
price shall include the correct freight charges to destination. C.a.c. 
sales shall be deemed to be the same as f.o.b. sales, except that the 
selling price includes the correct freight and refrigeration or heater 
charges to destination. C.i.f. sales shall be deemed to be the same as 
f.o.b. sales, except that the selling price includes insurance and the 
correct freight and refrigeration or heater charges to destination.
    (w) Carload, carlot, or car when used in offers, quotations, or 
contracts in which the quantity is not more definitely specified, and in 
the absence of well-established trade custom or standard as to size of a 
``carload,'' ``carlot,'' or ``car'' of the produce in question, means 
not less than the minimum quantity required by the carrier's tariff 
applicable to the movement, and not more than 10 percent in excess of 
such minimum tariff requirements, except that, where the carrier's 
tariffs provide alternative rates and minimum, the buyer shall state 
which tariff minimum must be observed, and, in event of failure so to 
do, the shipper may exercise his discretion, in no case, however, 
exceeding the higher alternative minimum quantity provided by the 
tariff, with only such variations therefrom as are permitted by this 
paragraph.
    (x) Shipping-point inspection means that the seller is required to 
obtain Federal or Federal-State inspection, or such private inspection 
as has been mutually agreed upon, to show the compliance of the lot sold 
with the quality, condition, and grade specifications of the contract, 
and that the seller assumes the risk incident to incorrect 
certification.
    (y) Shipping-point inspection final, or inspection final following 
the name of the State or point, as California inspection final, means 
that the seller is required to obtain Federal or Federal-State 
inspection, or such private inspection as has been mutually agreed upon, 
to show the compliance of the lot sold with the quality, condition, and 
grade specifications of the contract, and that the buyer assumes the 
risk incident to incorrect certification and is without recourse against 
the seller on account of quality, condition, and grade.
    (z) Subject approval Government inspection means that the seller is 
required to obtain Federal or Federal-State inspection, or such private 
inspection as has been mutually agreed upon, and to correctly 
communicate, by wire or other agreed means, the statements on the 
certificate as to quality, condition and grade, and other essential 
information, whereupon the buyer, upon approval thereof, will be deemed 
to have accepted the produce without recourse against the seller on 
account of quality, condition, and grade.
    (aa) Guaranteed advance used in connection with an advance payment 
on consigned produce means that the person making the advance guarantees 
that the net proceeds to the consignor

[[Page 294]]

shall at least equal the amount so advanced, and that the consignor 
cannot be held liable for any deficit resulting from the sale of the 
produce, if such deficit is not occasioned by or contributed to by an 
act of the consignor.
    (bb) Accommodation advance or regular advance, used in connection 
with an advance of money or credit against anticipated net proceeds to 
be realized from the sale of consigned produce, means that the consignor 
has received an advance of money or credit and that, if the consigned 
produce does not sell for enough to cover the cost of transportation and 
handling, including customary or agreed commission and the advance made 
to him, the consignor must return to the person making the advance a sum 
equal to the deficit sustained.
    (cc) Price arrival, in the absence of a contrary specific 
understanding, means that the produce is shipped either direct to the 
customer or to an agent of the consignor, for the benefit of the 
customer, the price to be subject to agreement between the customer and 
the consignor upon the arrival of the produce at the customer's 
destination, with sufficient time being permitted for inspection.
    (dd) F.o.b. inspection and acceptance arrival means that the produce 
quoted or sold is to be placed by the seller free on board car or other 
agency of through transportation at shipping point, the cost of 
transportation to be borne by the buyer, but the seller to assume all 
risks of loss and damage in transit not caused by the buyer, who has the 
right to inspect the goods upon arrival and to reject them if, upon such 
inspection, they are found not to meet the specifications of the 
contract of sale at destination. The buyer may not reject without 
reasonable cause. Such a sale is f.o.b. only as to price and is on a 
delivered basis as to grade, quality, and condition.
    (ee) F.o.b. sale at delivered price means the same as f.o.b., except 
that transportation charges from shipping point to destination shall be 
borne by the seller; that is, the sale is f.o.b. as to grade, quality, 
and condition, and delivered as to price.
    (ff) Purchase after inspection means a purchase of produce after 
inspection or opportunity for inspection by the buyer or his agent. 
Under this term the buyer has no right of rejection and waives all 
warranties as to quality or condition, except warranties expressly made 
by the seller.
    (gg) Cash sale means that the buyer is required to pay the seller 
within 24 hours after his acceptance of the shipment.
    (hh) Joint Account--Split Above means that the receiving joint 
partner will pay promptly the agreed cost of the shipment to his joint 
partner. After disposition of the produce, the parties will divide 
equally the profits on the shipment after deduction of the cost of the 
shipment and proper expenses from the gross proceeds. The receiving 
joint partner will pay all expenses and cannot recover any loss 
resulting from the joint venture.
    (ii) Commercial Unit means a single shipment of one or more 
perishable agricultural commodities tendered for delivery on a single 
contract, such commercial unit must be accepted or rejected in its 
entirety. Acceptance of a commercial unit does not modify the parties' 
existing contractual rights and responsibilities.

                         Good Delivery Standards


<R05>
Sec. 46.44  Good delivery.

    Unless otherwise agreed to between the contracting parties, ``Good 
Delivery'' in connection with f.o.b. contracts of purchase and sale 
means that the commodity meets the requirements of the contract at time 
of loading or sale and, if the shipment is handled under normal 
transportation service and conditions, will meet the following 
additional requirements on delivery at the contract destination:
    (a) Lettuce. (1) If the contract specifies a U.S. grade, the lettuce 
may contain an average of not more than 3 percent condition defects, 
including not more than 2 percent decay affecting any portion of the 
head exclusive of wrapper leaves in excess of the destination tolerances 
provided for the applicable grade in the U.S. Standards for

[[Page 295]]

Grades of Lettuce. (For example, the U.S. No. 1 grade provides a 12 
percent tolerance for damage at destination. If a lot contains 5 percent 
damage by permanent grade factors, 7 percent of the tolerance can be 
applied to damage by condition factors. The additional 3 percent Good 
Delivery tolerance would then allow a total of 10 percent damage by 
condition factors in this shipment at destination.)
    (2) If the contract does not specify a U.S. grade or percentage of 
condition defects, the lettuce at destination may contain a maximum of 
15 percent, by count, of the heads in any lot which are damaged by 
condition defects, including therein not more than 9 percent serious 
damage of which not more than 5 percent may be decay affecting any 
portion of the head exclusive of wrapper leaves. Sales made on a 
percentage of a U.S. grade, without specifying the percentage of 
condition defects separately from the permanent defects, fall under this 
provision, and the lettuce may not contain more than a total of 15 
percent condition defects at destination. However, if the condition 
defects are specified, provision No. 3 will apply.
    (3) If the contract specifies a percentage of individual or combined 
condition defects, the lettuce at destination may contain either of the 
following, whichever is greater:
    (i) One and one-half times the specified percentage of damage or 
serious damage by condition defects: Provided, That, if serious damage 
is not specified, one-half of the allowance at destination may be 
serious damage, including therein not more than one-quarter of the total 
allowance may be decay affecting any portion of the head exclusive of 
wrapper leaves. (For example, a lot sold as ``16 percent tipburn'' could 
have a total of 24 percent damage by tipburn at destination, including 
not more than 12 percent serious damage of which not more than 6 percent 
may be decay affecting any portion of the head exclusive of wrapper 
leaves.) or
    (ii) Up to 15 percent, by count, of the heads in any lot which are 
damaged by condition defects, including therein not more than 9 percent 
serious damage of which not more than 5 percent may be decay affecting 
any portion of the head exclusive of wrapper leaves.

Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, condition defects will be 
considered to be damage as defined in the U.S. Standards for Lettuce.
    (4) If the contract clearly indicates by descriptive terms that the 
lettuce is of inferior quality, larger allowances for damage by 
condition defects than those specified above will be applied.
    (5) If the buyer and the seller agree to percentages for defects at 
destination, higher or lower than those specified above, such 
percentages will determine whether good delivery is made.

                    Misrepresentation or Misbranding


<R05>
Sec. 46.45  Procedure in administering section 2(5) of the Act.

    It is a violation of section 2(5) for a commission merchant, dealer, 
or broker to misrepresent by word, act, mark, stencil, label, statement, 
or deed, the character, kind, grade, quality, quantity, size, pack, 
weight, condition, degree, or maturity, or State, country, region of 
origin of any perishable agricultural commodity received, shipped, sold, 
or offered to be sold in interstate or foreign commerce. However, a 
person other than the first licensee handling misbranded perishable 
agricultural commodities shall not be held liable for a violation of 
section 2(5) of the Act by reason of the conduct of another if the 
person did not have knowledge of the violation or lacked the ability to 
correct the violation.
    (a) Violations. Violations are considered to be serious, very 
serious, or repeated and/or flagrant, depending upon the circumstances 
of the misrepresentation.
    (1) Serious violations. Include the following:
    (i) Any lot of a perishable agricultural commodity shown by official 
inspection to contain scorable defects, off-size, off-count, exceeding 
the tolerance(s) in an amount up to and including double the tolerance 
provided in the applicable grades, standards or inspection procedures;

[[Page 296]]

    (ii) Any lot of perishable agricultural commodity officially 
certified as failing to meet the declared weight;
    (iii) Any lot of a perishable agricultural commodity in which the 
State, country, or region of origin of the produce is misrepresentated 
because the lot is made up of containers with various labels or markings 
that reflect more than one incorrect State, country or region of origin. 
Example: A lot with containers individually marked to show the origin as 
Idaho or Maine or Colorado when the produce was grown in Wisconsin; or
    (iv) Any other physical act, verbal or written declaration, or 
record entry that misrepresents a lot of a perishable agricultural 
commodity to the same extent as the examples listed.
    (2) Very serious violations. Include the following:
    (i) Any lot of a perishable agricultural commodity shown by official 
inspection to contain scorable defects, off-size, off-count, in excess 
of double the tolerance(s) provided in the applicable grades, standards 
or inspection procedures;
    (ii) Any lot of a perishable agricultural commodity packed in 
containers showing a single point of origin, which is other than that in 
which the produce was grown, such as containers marked ``California'' 
when the produce was grown in Arizona;
    (iii) Any lot of a perishable agricultural commodity officially 
certified as having an average net weight more than four percent below 
the declared weight;
    (iv) Multiple sales or shipments of a misrepresented perishable 
agricultural commodity within a seven day period that can be attributed 
to one cause; or
    (v) Any other physical act, verbal or written declaration, or record 
entry that misrepresents a lot of a perishable agricultural commodity to 
the same extent as the examples listed.
    (3) Flagrant violations. Include, but are not necessarily limited 
to, the following examples:
    (i) Shipment or sale of a lot of a perishable agricultural commodity 
from shipping point after notification by official inspection that the 
inspected commodity fails to comply with any marking on the container 
without first correcting the misbranding;
    (ii) To offer for resale or consignment, a lot of a perishable 
agricultural commodity that has been officially inspected at destination 
and found to be misbranded without advising a prospective receiver that 
the lot is misbranded and that the misbranding must be corrected before 
resale. When a resale or consignment is finalized, written notice must 
be given that the lot is misbranded and must be corrected before resale; 
or
    (iii) To withhold or fail to disclose known material facts with 
respect to a misrepresentation or misbranding.
    (b) Evidence. (1) Evidence concerning a misrepresentation or 
misbranding includes official certificates of an inspection made by any 
person authorized by the Department to inspect fruits and vegetables or 
other public certifiers, and includes investigations and audit findings 
and any business records, testimony or other evidence bearing on the 
subject.
    (2) When a lot of a perishable agricultural commodity has been 
officially inspected, and certification is made that the descriptive 
container markings are correct, but a subsequent inspection reverses the 
original findings, both inspection certificates will be accepted as 
evidence to show that the shipper/seller has not misrepresented the lot. 
The receiver of the commodity will be in violation if the 
misrepresentation is not corrected before the commodity is shipped, sold 
or offered for resale.
    (c) Sanctions--(1) Informal. When liability for a violation of 
section 2(5) of the Act is to be settled informally, the violator may:
    (i) Be given written warnings; or
    (ii) Be given notice that liability for a violation may be settled 
by admitting the violation in writing and paying a penalty in an amount 
satisfactory to the Secretary in lieu of formal disciplinary action. In 
the event of a formal proceeding to suspend or revoke the license of 
such person because he has committed other violation(s), the admitted 
violation(s) will not be used to support the formal complaint but may be 
admitted to show a course of conduct prior to the filing of the formal 
complaint;

[[Page 297]]

    (iii) The schedule for informal disposition is as follows:

\3\ Very serious violation.                                             


Informal disposition of misrepresentation violations is not limited to 
seven occurrences and will be considered for further violations.
    (2) Formal. Formal proceedings to suspend or revoke a license may be 
instituted at any time against a person who has committed repeated and/
or flagrant violations.
    (d) Cumulative record. A cumulative record of licensee's 
misrepresentation violations will be maintained with the following 
limitations:
    (1) Two years after the date it was committed or after payment of a 
monetary penalty, the violation will not be used as a basis for 
instituting formal disciplinary action. However, it may be cited as a 
part of the pattern of violations if formal proceedings are instituted 
and will be used in determining the level of monetary penalty for 
informal settlements.
    (2) The record of violations not involved in formal proceedings will 
be expunged if there are no violations during a twenty-four (24) month 
period from the date of the most recent violation, or after thirty-six 
(36) months from the date of said violation, unless it was made a part 
of a formal disciplinary complaint.
    (e) Summary of procedure--(1) Compilation of authority. The rules 
defining misrepresentation, including misbranding, and for determining 
liability and disposition of violations are contained in the Act (7 
U.S.C. 499 et seq.), in particular sections 2(5) and 8 (7 U.S.C. 449b(5) 
and 499h), Sec. 46.45 of the Regulations (7 CFR 46.45), the Rules of 
Practice Governing Formal Adjudicatory Administrative Proceedings 
Instituted By the Secretary (7 CFR 1.130 et seq.), and in the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.).
    (2) Evidence of misrepresentation. Evidence of misrepresentation or 
misbranding violations includes results of official inspections, audit 
findings, business records, or other documentation or testimony bearing 
on the subject. When a lot of fruits and vegetables has been officially 
inspected, and certification made that the descriptive markings on the 
container do not misrepresent the produce, but a subsequent inspection 
reverses the original finding (such as to grade, size, weight, etc.), 
the shipper/seller will not be charged with violation of the Act. 
However, the misrepresentation must be corrected before the lot is 
shipped, sold, or offered for resale.
    (3) Warning letters. When informal settlement of liability is 
appropriate, violators are given two written warnings and an opportunity 
to take preventive action before formal action is considered. Warning 
letters include an explanation of the requirements of the Act and 
recommendations of actions which the violator can take to avoid future 
violations.
    (4) Informal sanctions. Violations subsquent to the sending of the 
warning letters referred to above, other than flagrant violations, may 
be settled informally pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section. This 
procedure permits the violator to resolve the matter by payment of a 
monetary penalty pursuant to a schedule set out in lieu of a formal 
proceeding.
    (5) Formal sanctions. In cases involving repeated or flagrant 
violations of the Act, formal proceedings seeking the suspension or 
revocation of the violator's license may be instituted pursuant to the 
Rules of Practice governing such matters (7 CFR 1.130 et seq.). Except 
in cases of willfulness or where the public health, interest, or safety 
requires otherwise, a violator must be given written warning and 
opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance with the Act before its 
license can be suspended or revoked (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.). The warning 
letters referred to above serve this purpose. If formal proceedings are 
instituted, the violator is afforded an oral hearing, if requested, 
before an Administrative Law Judge,

[[Page 298]]

an opportunity to appeal an adverse decision to the Department's 
Judicial Officer, and a further opportunity to appeal an adverse final 
decision to the appropriate United States Circuit Court of Appeals.
    (6) Use of record of misrepresentation. A cumulative record of 
misrepresentation is maintained. It is used as a basis for determining 
whether a warning letter should be considered, and, if so, the amount of 
monetary penalty which is appropriate, or whether there is cause for 
instituting a formal disciplinary proceeding seeking suspension or 
revocation of the violator's license. But after payment of a monetary 
penalty or after two years from the date of the last violation, no 
formal disciplinary use can be made of the previous record of violation. 
The record of misrepresentation shall be erased if there are no further 
violations in the twenty-four (24) month period immediately following 
the most recent violation, or after 36 months from the date of each 
individual violation unless it is involved in formal disciplinary 
proceedings.

                             Statutory Trust


<R05>
Sec. 46.46  Statutory trust.

    (a) Definitions. (1) ``Received'' means the time when the buyer, 
receiver, or agent gains ownership, control, or possession of the 
perishable agricultural commodities: Provided, That when perishable 
agricultural commodities have not been received as described above, and 
where there is a rejection without reasonable cause as provided in 
Sec. 46.2(bb) and (cc), the goods will be considered to have been 
received when proffered.
    (2) ``Dissipation'' means any act or failure to act which could 
result in the diversion of trust assets or which could prejudice or 
impair the ability of unpaid suppliers, sellers, or agents to recover 
money owed in connection with produce transactions.
    (3) ``Default'' means the failure to pay promptly money owed in 
connection with transactions in perishable agricultural commodities; 
i.e., within the period of time applicable to the type of transaction as 
established by the provisions of the regulations (Sec. 46.2(aa)), or as 
otherwise agreed upon by the parties.
    (4) ``Calendar days'' as used in section 5(c) 3 of the Act means 
every day of the week, including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, 
except that if the thirtieth calendar day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, 
or holiday, the final day with respect to the time for filing a written 
notice of intent to preserve the benefit of the trust shall be the next 
day upon which there is postal delivery service.
    (5) ``Ordinary and usual billing or invoice statements'' as used in 
section 5(c)(4) of the Act, and ``invoice or other billing statement'' 
as used in Sec. 46.46(f)(3), mean communications customarily used 
between parties to a transaction in perishable agricultural commodities 
in whatever form, documentary or electronic, for billing or invoicing 
purposes.
    (b) Trust assets. The trust is made up of perishable agricultural 
commodities received in all transactions, all inventories of food or 
other products derived from such perishable agricultural commodities, 
and all receivables or proceeds from the sale of such commodities and 
food or products derived therefrom. Trust assets are to be preserved as 
a nonsegregated ``floating'' trust. Commingling of trust assets is 
contemplated.
    (c) Trust benefits. (1) When a seller, supplier or agent who has met 
the eligibility requirements of paragraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this 
section, transfers ownership, possession, or control of goods to a 
commission merchant, dealer, or broker, it automatically becomes 
eligible to participate in the trust. Participants who preserve their 
rights to benefits in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section 
remain beneficiaries until they are paid in full.
    (2) Any licensee, or person subject to license, who has a fiduciary 
duty to collect funds resulting from the sale or consignment of produce, 
and remit such funds to its principal, also has the duty to preserve its 
principal's rights to trust benefits in accordance with

[[Page 299]]

paragraph (f) of this section. The responsibility for filing the notice 
to preserve the principal's rights is obligatory and cannot be avoided 
by the agent by means of a contract provision. Persons acting as agents 
also have the responsibility to negotiate contracts which entitle their 
principals to the protection of the trust provisions: Provided, That a 
principal may elect to waive its right to trust protection. To be 
effective, the waiver must be in writing and separate and distinct from 
any agency contract, must be signed by the principal prior to the time 
affected transactions occur, must clearly state the principal's intent 
to waive its right to become a trust beneficiary on a given transaction, 
or a series of transactions, and must include the date the agent's 
authority to act on the principal's behalf expires. In the event an 
agent having a fiduciary duty to collect funds resulting from the sale 
or consignment of produce and remit such funds to its principal fails to 
perform the duty of preserving its principal's rights to trust benefits, 
it may be held liable to the principal for damages. A principal 
employing a collect and remit agent must preserve its rights to trust 
benefits against such agent by filing appropriate notices with the 
agent.
    (d) Trust maintenance. (1) Commission merchants, dealers and brokers 
are required to maintain trust assets in a manner that such assets are 
freely available to satisfy outstanding obligations to sellers of 
perishable agricultural commodities. Any act or omission which is 
inconsistent with this responsibility, including dissipation of trust 
assets, is unlawful and in violation of section 2 of the Act, (7 U.S.C. 
499b).
    (2) Agents who sell perishable agricultural commodities on behalf of 
a principal are required to preserve the principal's rights as a trust 
beneficiary as set forth in Sec. 46.2(z), (aa) and paragraphs (d), (f), 
and (g) of this section. Any act or omission which is inconsistent with 
this responsibility, including failure to give timely notice of intent 
to preserve trust benefits, is unlawful and in violation of section 2 of 
the Act, (7 U.S.C. 499b).
    (e) Prompt payment and eligibility for trust benefits. (1) The times 
for prompt accounting and prompt payment are set out in Sec. 46.2(z) and 
(aa). Parties who elect to use different times for payment must reduce 
their agreement to writing before entering into the transaction and 
maintain a copy of their agreement in their records, and the times of 
payment must be disclosed on invoices, accountings, and other documents 
relating to the transaction.
    (2) The maximum time for payment for a shipment to which a seller, 
supplier, or agent can agree and still qualify for coverage under the 
trust is 30 days after receipt and acceptance of the commodities as 
defined in Sec. 46.2(dd) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (3) The trust provisions do not apply to transactions between a 
cooperative association (as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural 
Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)), and its members.
    (4) The amount claimable against the trust by a beneficiary or 
grower will be the net amount due after allowable deductions of 
contemplated expenses or advances made in connection with the 
transaction by the commission merchant, dealer, or broker.
    (f) Filing notice of intent to preserve trust benefits. (1) Notice 
of intent to preserve benefits under the trust must be in writing, must 
include the statement that it is a notice of intent to preserve trust 
benefits and must include information which establishes for each 
shipment:
    (i) The names and addresses of the trust beneficiary, seller-
supplier, commission merchant, or agent and the debtor, as applicable,
    (ii) The date of the transaction, commodity, invoice price, and 
terms of payment (if appropriate),
    (iii) The date of receipt of notice that a payment instrument has 
been dishonored (if appropriate), and
    (iv) The amount past due and unpaid.
    (2) Timely filing of a notice of intent to preserve benefits under 
the trust will be considered to have been made if written notice is 
given to the debtor within 30 calendar days:
    (i) After expiration of the time prescribed by which payment must be 
made pursuant to regulation,
    (ii) After expiration of such other time by which payment must be 
made as the parties have expressly agreed to

[[Page 300]]

in writing before entering into the transaction, but not longer than the 
time prescribed in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, or
    (iii) After the time the supplier, seller or agent has received 
notice that a payment instrument promptly presented for payment has been 
dishonored. Failures to pay within the time periods set forth in 
paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section constitute defaults.
    (3) Licensees may chose an alternate method of preserving trust 
benefits from the requirements described in paragraphs (f) (1) and (2) 
of this section. Licensees may use their invoice or other billing 
statement to preserve trust benefits. The alternative method requires 
that the licensee's invoice or other billing statement, given to the 
debtor, contain:
    (i) The statement: ``The perishable agricultural commodities listed 
on this invoice are sold subject to the statutory trust authorized by 
section 5(c) of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, 1930 (7 
U.S.C. 499e(c)). The seller of these commodities retains a trust claim 
over these commodities, all inventories of food or other products 
derived from these commodities, and any receivables or proceeds from the 
sale of these commodities until full payment is received.''; and
    (ii) The terms of payment if they differ from prompt payment set out 
in section 46.2(z) and (aa) of this part, and the parties have expressly 
agreed to such terms in writing before the affected transactions occur.

Sec. 46.48  Procedure for investigating complaints involving commodities of a unique nature or coming from a distinct geographic area.

    (a) Scope: This section provides for the payment of fees and the 
investigation of allegations of misrepresentation or misbranding in 
which the commodity which is misbranded or misrepresented is purported 
to be a commodity of a unique name or geographical designation which is 
defined as:
    (1) A perishable agricultural commodity as that term is defined 
under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, 1930;
    (2) Subject to a federal marketing order under the Agricultural 
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601 et seq.);
    (3) Traditionally identified as being produced in a distinct 
geographic area, State, or region; and
    (4) Of a unique identity, based on such distinct geographic area, 
which has been promoted with funds collected through producer 
contributions pursuant to such marketing order.
    (b) Filing complaints: (1) Any person desiring to complain of a 
possible violation by any commission merchant, dealer, or broker as a 
result of misrepresentation or misbranding of any commodity subject to 
these regulations may file a complaint with the Secretary of Agriculture 
and request an investigation of the complaint by the Secretary.
    (2) Complaints shall be made in writing setting forth all the 
essential details, including but not limited to:
    (i) The name and address of each complaining person;
    (ii) The name and address of each person against whom the complaint 
is made;
    (iii) The commodity, approximate quantity of the commodity, and 
circumstances of alleged misrepresentation or misbranding;
    (iv) The current location of the commodity;
    (v) If shipped, the shipping and destination points of the 
commodity;
    (vi) A statement of all other known material facts with respect to 
the complaint; and
    (vii) Copies of any documents or evidence of any kind in the 
possession of

[[Page 301]]

the complainant regarding the alleged violation.
    (3) The complaint shall be accompanied by a non-refundable $250.00 
filing fee made payable to the Agricultural Marketing Service (see 
paragraph (e) of this section Collection of fees).
    (4) The complaint, all supporting evidence, and fee should be mailed 
to: PACA Branch, room 2095 So., Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, 
P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090-6456.
    (c) Handling complaints. (1) Upon receiving a written complaint, 
supporting evidence, and the $250.00 preliminary investigation fee from 
a complaining person, the Director, Fruit and Vegetable Division, 
Agricultural Marketing Service, United States Department of Agriculture 
shall order a preliminary investigation to determine if the complaint 
can be substantiated. If the initial investigation discloses no 
violation of the Act, no further action shall be taken and the 
complaining person shall be informed of the finding. The $250.00 filing 
fee shall be considered full payment for the preliminary investigation.
    (2) If the Director finds reasonable cause for further 
investigation, the complaining person shall be duly notified of the 
findings. Prior to any further investigation, the Director shall advise 
the complaining person of the estimated fees and charges which the 
complaining person must pay. In calculating the estimated fees, the 
Director shall use the hourly salary rate of a GS-5, Step 4, for 
clerical time and GS-13, Step 1, for professional time, plus benefits 
and other related expenses including travel associated with the 
investigation.
    (3) At the conclusion of the investigation, the Department will 
inform the complaining person of the results, provided, however, that 
any findings, the release of which may jeopardize an ongoing formal 
disciplinary proceeding initiated under the PACA, may be withheld 
pending completion of the disciplinary case.
    (d) Investigative authority. Investigation of a complaint of this 
Section shall be deemed to be an investigation under Section 6(b) of the 
Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (7 U.S.C. 499f(b)).

Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 shall reimburse the Secretary of 
Agriculture for any and all costs associated with the enforcement of 
that section.
    (2) A non-refundable $250.00 fee for the preliminary investigation 
shall accompany the written complaint.

investigation calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section will be provided the complaining person.
    (i) Payment of the fees and charges shall be collected in advance by 
the Secretary prior to continuation of investigation of a complaint.
    (ii) Payment of fees and charges may be made by cash, check, or 
money order payable to the Agricultural Marketing Service.
    (iii) In the event that the estimated fees and charges prove to be 
inadequate, the complaining person will be informed of the deficiency. 
Any complaining person that does not reimburse the Secretary full 
payment for fees and charges associated with a completed investigation 
shall be liable to be proceeded against in any court of competent 
jurisdiction in a suit by the United States to collect any monetary or 
other damages connected with the investigation.
    (iv) The complaining person will be reimbursed by the Secretary for 
any overpayment of fees and charges, except for the $250.00 preliminary 
investigation fee which is nonrefundable.

office of USDA or any official thereof responsible for administering the 
Act. A written notification which is so filed, or any expansion of an 
investigation resulting from any indication of additional further 
violations of the Act found as a consequence of an investigation based 
on written notification or complaint, shall also be deemed to constitute 
a complaint under section 13(a) of this Act.
    (c) Upon becoming aware of a complaint under Section 6(a) or 6(b) of 
this Act, the Secretary will determine if reasonable grounds exist for 
an investigation of such complaint for disciplinary action. If the 
investigation substantiates the existence of violations, a formal 
disciplinary complaint may be filed by the Secretary as described under 
Section 6(c)(2) of the Act.
    (d) Whenever an investigation, initiated as a result of a written 
notification or complaint under Section 6(b) of the Act, is commenced, 
or expanded to include new violations, notice shall be given by the 
Secretary to the subject of the investigation within thirty (30) days of 
the commencement or expansion of the investigation. Within one hundred 
and eighty (180) days after giving initial notice, the Secretary shall 
provide the subject of the investigation with notice of the status of 
the investigation, including whether the Secretary intends to issue a 
complaint under Section 6(c)(2) of this Act, terminate the 
investigation, or continue or expand the investigation. Thereafter, the 
subject of the investigation may request in writing, no more frequently 
than every ninety (90) days, a status report from the Chief of the PACA 
Branch who shall respond thereto within fourteen (14) days of receiving 
the request. When an investigation is terminated, the Secretary shall, 
within fourteen (14) days, notify the subject of the investigation of 
the termination. In every case in which notice or response is required 
under this subsection such notice or response shall be accomplished by 
personal service or by posting the notice or response by certified mail 
to the last known address of the subject of the investigation.

Sec. 47.3  Institution of proceedings.

    (a) Informal complaints. (1) Any interested person (including any 
officer or agency of any State or Territory having jurisdiction over 
commission merchants, dealers, or brokers in such State or Territory, 
and any employee of the Department) desiring to complain of any 
violation of any provision of the Act by any commission merchant, 
dealer, or broker may file with the Director an informal complaint. 
Informal complaints may be made the basis of either a disciplinary 
complaint, or a claim for damages, or both. If the informal complaint is 
to be made the basis of a claim for damages, it must be received by the 
Director within 9 months after the cause of action accrues; if the 
informal complaint is not to be made the basis of a claim for damages, 
it may be filed at any time within 2 years after the violation of the 
act occurred: Provided, That the 2-year limitation herein prescribed 
shall not apply to complaints charging flagrant or repeated violations 
of the act.
    (2) Informal complaints may be made by telegram, by letter, or by a 
preliminary statement of facts, setting forth the essential details of 
the transaction complained of. So far as practicable, every such 
informal complaint shall state such of the following items as may be 
applicable:
    (i) The name and address of each person and of the agent, if any, 
representing him in the transaction involved;
    (ii) Quantity and quality or grade of each kind of produce shipped;
    (iii) Date of shipment;
    (iv) Car initial and number, if carlot;
    (v) Shipping and destination points;

    (viii) Amount of damages claimed, if any; and
    (ix) Statement of other material facts including terms of contract.
    (3) The informal complaint should, so far as practicable, be 
accompanied by true copies of all available papers relating to the 
transaction complained about, including shipping documents, letters, 
telegrams, invoices, manifests, inspection certificates, accounts sales, 
and any special contracts or agreements.
    (b) Investigations and disposition of informal complaints. (1) Upon 
receipt of all the information and supporting evidence submitted by the 
person filing the informal complaint, the Director shall cause such 
investigation to be made as, in the Director's opinion, is justified by 
the facts. If such investigation discloses that no violation of the Act 
has occurred, no further action shall be taken and the person filing the 
informal complaint shall be so informed.
    (2) If the statements in the informal complaint and the 
investigation thereunder seem to warrant such action, and, in any case 
except one of wilfullness or one in which public

[[Page 305]]

health, interest or safety otherwise requires, which may result in the 
suspension or revocation of a license, the Director, in an effort to 
effect an amicable or informal adjustment of the matter, shall give 
written notice to the person complained against of the facts or conduct 
concerning which complaint is made, and shall afford such person an 
opportunity, within a reasonable time fixed by the Director, to 
demonstrate or achieve compliance with the applicable requirements of 
the Act and regulations promulgated thereunder.
    (c) Status of person filing informal complaint. The person filing an 
informal reparation complaint shall not be a party to any disciplinary 
proceeding which may be instituted as a result of the informal 
reparation complaint. The person filing an informal reparation complaint 
shall have no legal status in the reparation proceeding, except as he or 
she may be subpoenaed as a witness or deposed without expense to him or 
her.

               Rules Applicable to Reparation Proceedings


<R05>
Sec. 47.6  Formal complaints.

    (a) Filing; contents; number of copies. If the procedure provided in 
Sec. 47.3(b) fails to effect an amicable or informal adjustment and 
indicates the probability of a violation of the Act, the person filing 
the informal complaint may, if further proceedings are desired, file 
with the Division a formal complaint setting forth the information and 
accompanied by the papers indicated in Sec. 47.3(a) (2) and (3) 
including a statement of the amount of damages claimed, with the basis 
therefor, and the method of determination. The original and three copies 
shall be furnished for filing, and service on the respondent. If there 
is more than one respondent, a further copy shall be furnished for each 
additional respondent.
    (b) Bond Required if Complainant is Nonresident. If formal complaint 
for reparation is filed by a nonresident of the United States, 
complainant shall first file a bond in double the amount of the claim 
either with a surety company approved by the Treasury Department of the 
United States as surety or with two personal sureties, each of whom 
shall be a citizen of the United States and shall qualify as financially 
responsible for the entire amount of the bond. The bond shall run to the 
respondent and be conditioned upon the payment of costs, including 
reasonable attorney's fees, for the respondent if the respondent shall 
prevail, and of any reparation award that may be issued by the Secretary 
against the complainant on any counterclaim asserted by

[[Page 307]]

respondent: Provided, That the furnishing of a bond may be waived at the 
discretion of the Secretary if the complainant is a resident of a 
country which permits the filing of a complaint in an administrative 
forum or its equivalent which is substantially similar to that provided 
under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act by a resident of the 
United States against a citizen of that country without the furnishing 
of a bond. Nothing in this section shall limit the discretion of the 
Secretary to deny such a waiver in order to effectuate the purposes of 
the Act or to protect the interests of the businesses concerned.
    (c) Service upon respondent; proof of service. If, upon receipt by 
the Division of the formal complaint, the complaint is found to be in 
proper form, a copy thereof shall be served by the Division upon the 
respondent in accordance with Sec. 47.4. If the complaint is not in the 
proper form, the Division shall return it and inform the complainant of 
the deficiencies therein.
    (d) Amendments. At any time prior to the close of the hearing, the 
complaint may be amended; but, in case of an amendment adding new 
provisions, the hearing shall, if the respondent so requests, be 
adjourned for a reasonable time to be determined by the examiner: 
Provided, That, if the amendment introduces a new or different cause of 
action, it must be filed within 9 months after the cause of action 
accrued. Amendments subsequent to the first amendment or subsequent to 
the filing of an answer by the respondent may be made only with leave of 
the examiner or with the written consent of the adverse party.
[10 FR 2209, Feb. 27, 1945, as amended at 56 FR 176, Jan. 3, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 47.7  Report of investigation.

    Where the facts and circumstances are deemed by the Director to 
warrant such action, the Division shall serve upon each of the parties a 
copy of the report made by the Division in connection with its 
investigation of the informal or formal complaint. Whenever the 
Secretary, or the Director, or the examiner deems it necessary, a 
supplemental investigation shall be made by the Division and a copy of 
the report thereon shall be served upon the parties. If an answer is 
filed by respondent, a copy of any report or reports of investigation 
served upon the parties shall be filed with the hearing clerk and shall 
be considered as part of the evidence in the proceeding: Provided, That 
either party shall be permitted to submit evidence in rebuttal in the 
same manner as is provided in the regulations in this part for the 
submission of other evidence in the proceeding.
[24 FR 10055, Dec. 12, 1959]


<R05>
Sec. 47.8  The answer.

    (a) Filing and service. Within 20 days after service of the formal 
complaint, unless extension of time has been requested and granted, the 
respondent may file with the Division, an answer, in triplicate, signed 
by the respondent or his attorney. A copy of the answer shall be served 
upon the complainant by the Division as provided in Sec. 47.4.
    (b) Contents. Such answer shall contain (1) a precise statement of 
the facts which constitute the grounds of defense, including any set-off 
or counterclaim, and shall specifically admit, deny, or explain each of 
the allegations of the complaint, unless respondent is without 
knowledge, in which case the answer shall so state; or (2) a statement 
that the respondent admits all of the allegations of the complaint; or 
(3) a statement containing an admission of liability in an amount less 
than that alleged in the complaint (in which event, an order may be 
made, pursuant to section 7(a) of the Act, directing payment of the 
undisputed amount), and a denial, as in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, of liability for the remaining amount. The answer may contain a 
waiver of hearing.
    (c) Failure to file answer; effect of. Failure to file an answer 
within the time prescribed shall constitute a waiver of hearing and an 
admission of the facts alleged in the complaint. If the facts deemed 
admitted are considered insufficient to support the amount of reparation 
sought, the proceeding shall continue on the question of damages only.
    (d) Procedure upon admission of facts. Upon the admission, in the 
answer or by failure to file an answer, of all the material allegations 
of fact contained

[[Page 308]]

in the complaint, an order may be issued without further procedure, 
official notice being taken of the license status of the respondent and 
the date of filing of the informal complaint, as disclosed by the 
records of the Department.
[10 FR 2212, Feb. 27, 1945, as amended at 24 FR 10055, Dec. 12, 1959]


<R05>
Sec. 47.9  The reply.

    (a) Filing and service. If the answer asserts a counterclaim or a 
set-off, the complaining party, within 20 days after service of the 
answer, may file a reply with the Division. A copy of the reply shall be 
served upon the respondent by the Division as provided in Sec. 47.4.
    (b) Contents. The reply shall be confined strictly to the matters 
alleged in the counterclaim or set-off in the answer. It shall contain a 
precise statement of the facts which constitute the grounds of defense 
to the counterclaim or set-off, unless the complainant is without 
knowledge, in which case the reply shall so state.
    (c) Failure to file reply. Failure to file a reply shall not be 
deemed a waiver of hearing or an admission of the allegations contained 
in the answer. If no reply is filed, the allegations of the answer shall 
be regarded as denied.
[10 FR 2209, Feb. 27, 1945, as amended at 56 FR 174, Jan. 3, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 47.10  Docketing of proceeding.

    Immediately following the expiration of the period of time 
heretofore prescribed for the filing of the answer or reply, the 
Division shall transmit all of the papers which have been filed in the 
proceeding to the hearing clerk, who shall assign a docket number to the 
proceeding. Thereafter the proceeding may be identified by such number.


<R05>
Sec. 47.11  Examiners.

    (a) Disqualification. No person who (1) has any pecuniary interest

    (b) Request for disqualification of examiner. Any party may file 
with the hearing clerk a timely request, in affidavit form, for the 
disqualification of the examiner, which request shall set forth with 
particularity the grounds of alleged disqualification. After such 
investigation or hearing as the Secretary may deem necessary, the 
Secretary shall either deny or grant the request. If the request is 
granted, another examiner shall be assigned to the proceeding. If the 
request is denied, the request, any record made thereon, and the finding 
and order of the Secretary thereon shall be made a part of the record.
    (c) Powers. Subject to review by the Secretary, as provided in this 
part, the examiner, in any proceeding assigned to him or her, shall have

evidence prior to any hearing to be conducted by telephone or audio-
visual telecommunication;
    (10) Require each party to provide all other parties with a copy of 
any document that the party intends to use to examine a deponent prior 
to any deposition to be conducted by telephone or audio-visual

parties are able to transmit and receive documents during the 
deposition;
    (13) Do all acts and take all measures necessary for the maintenance 
of order at the hearing and for the efficient conduct of the proceeding.
    (d) Who may act in absence of examiner. In case of the absence, 
illness, resignation, or death of the examiner who has been assigned to 
a proceeding, or, in case the General Counsel determines that, for other 
good cause, such examiner should not act, the powers and duties to be 
performed by the examiner under these rules of practice in connection 
with such proceeding may, subject to the provisions of paragraph (a) of 
this section, be assigned to another examiner.

<R05>
Sec. 47.12  Intervention.

    At any time after the institution of a proceeding and before it has 
been submitted to the Secretary for final consideration, the Secretary 
or the examiner may, upon petition in writing and for good cause shown, 
permit any person to intervene therein. The petition shall state with 
preciseness and particularity:
    (a) The petitioner's relationship to the matters involved in the 
proceeding; (b) the nature of the material the petitioner intends to 
present in evidence; (c) the nature of the argument the petitioner

[10 FR 2209, Feb. 27, 1945, as amended at 60 FR 8459, Feb. 14, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 47.13  Motions and requests.

    (a) General. (1) All motions and requests made after the formal 
filing of the proceeding with the hearing clerk shall be filed with the 
hearing clerk, except that those made during an oral hearing may be 
stated orally and made a part of the transcript or recording.
    (2) The examiner may rule upon all motions and requests filed or 
made prior to the transmittal of the record to the Secretary as 
hereinafter provided. The Secretary shall rule upon all motions and 
requests filed after that time.
    (b) Certification to the Secretary. The submission or certification 
of any motion, request, objection, or other question to the Secretary 
prior to transmittal of the record to the Secretary as provided in this 
part shall be made by and in the discretion of the examiner. The 
examiner may either rule upon or certify the motion, request, objection, 
or other question to the Secretary, but not both.
[10 FR 2209, Feb. 27, 1945; 11 FR 224, Jan. 4, 1946, as amended at 38 FR 
30445, Nov. 5, 1973; 60 FR 8459, Feb. 14, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 47.14  Prehearing conferences.

    (a) In any proceeding in which it appears that a conference will 
expedite the proceeding, the examiner, at any time prior to or during 
the course of the oral hearing, may request the parties or their counsel 
to appear at a conference before the examiner to consider:
    (1) The simplification of the issues;
    (2) The necessity or the desirability of amendments to the 
pleadings;
    (3) The possibility of obtaining stipulations of fact and of 
documents which will avoid unnecessary proof;
    (4) The limitation of the number of expert or other witnesses; or
    (5) Such other matters as may expedite and aid in the disposition of 
the proceeding.
    (b) No transcript or recording of the conference shall be made. If 
the conference is conducted by correspondence, the examiner shall 
forward copies of letters and documents to the parties as circumstances 
require. The correspondence in connection with a conference shall not be 
part of the record. The examiner shall prepare and file for the record a 
written summary of the action agreed upon or taken at the conference, 
which shall incorporate any written stipulations or agreements made by 
the parties at the conference or as a result of the conference.
    (c) Manner of the Conference. (1) The conference shall be conducted 
by telephone or correspondence unless the examiner determines that 
conducting the

[[Page 310]]

conference by audio-visual telecommunication:
    (i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;
    (ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected 
to participate in the conference; or
    (iii) Would cost less than conducting the conference by telephone or 
correspondence. If the examiner determines that a conference conducted 
by audio-visual telecommunication would measurably increase the United 
States Department of Agriculture's cost of conducting the conference, 
the conference shall be conducted by personal attendance of any 
individual who is expected to participate in the conference, by 
telephone, or by correspondence.
    (2) If the conference is not conducted by telephone or 
correspondence, the conference shall be conducted by audio-visual 
telecommunication unless the examiner determines that conducting the 
conference by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to 
participate in the conference:
    (i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;
    (ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected 
to participate in the conference; or
    (iii) Would cost less than conducting the conference by audio-visual 
telecommunication.
[60 FR 8460, Feb. 14, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 47.15  Oral hearing before the examiner.

    (a) When permissible. (1) Where the amount of the damages claimed, 
either in the complaint or in the counterclaim, does not exceed $15,000 
an oral hearing shall not be held, unless deemed necessary or desirable 
by the Division or unless granted by the examiner upon application of 
complainant or respondent setting forth the peculiar circumstances 
making an oral hearing necessary for a proper presentation of the case. 
In lieu of an oral hearing in any proceeding where the amount of damages 
claimed does not exceed $15,000 the proceeding shall be decided upon a 
record formed under the shortened procedure provided in Sec. 47.20.
    (2) Where the amount of damages claimed, either in the complaint or 
in the counterclaim, is in excess of $15,000, the procedure provided in 
this section (except as provided in Sec. 47.20(b)(2)) shall be 
applicable.
    (b) Request for hearing. Any party may request an oral hearing on 
the facts by including such request in the complaint, answer, or reply, 
or by a separate request filed with the Division. Failure to request an 
oral hearing within the time allowed for filing of the reply, or (if no 
reply is allowed) within 10 days after the expiration of the time 
allowed for filing an answer, shall constitute a waiver of such hearing, 
and any party so failing to request an oral hearing will be deemed to 
have agreed that the proceeding may be decided upon a record formed 
under the shortened procedure provided in Sec. 47.20.
    (c) Time, place, and manner. (1) If and when the proceeding has 
reached the stage of oral hearing, the examiner, giving careful 
consideration to the convenience of the parties, shall set a time for 
hearing and shall file with the hearing clerk a notice stating the time 
and place of hearing. Unless the parties otherwise agree, the place of 
the hearing shall be the place in which the respondent is engaged in 
business. This notice shall state whether the hearing will be conducted 
by telephone, audio-visual telecommunication, or personal attendance of 
any individual expected to participate in the hearing and the examiner's 
determination regarding the manner of the hearing shall be made in 
accordance with paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section. If any 
change in the time, place, or manner of the hearing is made, the 
examiner shall file with the hearing clerk a notice of the change. The 
notice of any change in the time, place, or manner of the hearing shall 
be served on the parties, unless it is made during the course of an oral 
hearing and made part of the transcript or recording, or actual notice 
is given to the parties.
    (2)(i) If and when the proceeding has reached the stage of oral 
hearing, any party may move that the hearing be conducted by telephone 
or personal attendance of any individual expected to attend the hearing 
rather than by audio-visual telecommunication. Any motion that the 
hearing be conducted by telephone or personal attendance of any 
individual expected to attend the

[[Page 311]]

hearing must be accompanied by a memorandum in support of the motion 
stating the basis for the motion and the circumstances that require the 
hearing to be conducted other than by audio-visual telecommunication.
    (ii) Within 10 days after the examiner issues a notice stating the 
manner in which the hearing is to be conducted, any party may move that 
the examiner reconsider the manner in which the hearing is to be 
conducted. Any motion for reconsideration must be accompanied by a 
memorandum in support of the motion stating the basis for the motion and 
the circumstances that require the hearing to be conducted other than in 
accordance with the examiner's notice.
    (3) The hearing shall be conducted by audio-visual telecommunication 
unless the examiner determines that conducting the hearing by personal 
attendance of any individual expected to attend the hearing:
    (i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;
    (ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected 
to participate in the hearing; or
    (iii) Would cost less than conducting the hearing by audio-visual 
telecommunication. If the examiner determines that a hearing conducted 
by audio-visual telecommunication would measurably increase the United 
States Department of Agriculture's cost of conducting the hearing, the 
hearing shall be conducted by personal attendance of any individual who 
is expected to participate in the hearing or by telephone.
    (4) The examiner may, in his or her sole discretion or in response 
to a motion by a party to the proceeding, conduct the hearing by 
telephone if the examiner finds that a hearing conducted by telephone:
    (i) Would provide a full and fair evidentiary hearing;
    (ii) Would not prejudice any party; and
    (iii) Would cost less than conducting the hearing by audio-visual 
telecommunication or personal attendance of any individual who is 
expected to participate in the hearing.
    (d) Appearances--(1) Representation. In any proceeding under the 
Act, the parties may appear in person or by counsel or other 
representative. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed 
to require the complainant to appear either in person or by counsel or 
other representative; instead, he may be permitted to submit his 
evidence in the form of depositions, taken in the manner provided in 
Sec. 47.16.
    (2) Failure to appear. If any party to the proceeding, after being 
duly notified, fails to appear at the hearing, the party shall be deemed 
to have waived the right to an oral hearing in the proceeding. In the 
event that a party appears at the hearing and no party appears for the 
opposing side, the examiner may determine whether the party who is 
present shall present his or her evidence, in whole or in part, in the 
form of affidavits or by oral testimony.
    (3) Debarment of counsel or representative. (i) Whenever, while a 
proceeding is pending before him or her, the examiner finds that a 
person acting as counsel or representative for any party to the 
proceeding is guilty of unethical or unprofessional conduct, the 
examiner may order that such person be precluded from further acting as 
counsel or representative in such proceeding. An appeal to the Secretary 
may be taken from any such order, but the proceeding shall not be 
delayed or suspended pending disposition of the appeal: Provided, That 
the examiner may suspend the proceedings for a reasonable time for the 
purpose of enabling the party to obtain other counsel or representative.
    (ii) In case the examiner has issued an order precluding a person 
from further acting as counsel or representative in the proceeding, the 
examiner, within a reasonable time thereafter, shall submit to the 
Secretary a report of the facts and circumstances surrounding the 
issuance of the order and shall recommend what action the Secretary 
should take respecting the appearance of such person as counsel or 
representative in other proceedings before the Secretary. Thereafter, 
the Secretary may, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, issue 
such order respecting the appearance of such person as counsel or 
representative in proceedings before the Secretary as the Secretary 
finds to be appropriate.

[[Page 312]]

    (e) Order of proceeding. The complainant shall proceed first at the 
hearing and shall have the burden of proof, except that a party 
asserting a set-off or counterclaim shall have the burden of proof on 
such issue.
    (f) Written statements of direct testimony. (1) Except as provided 
in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, each party must exchange with all 
other parties a written narrative verified statement of the oral direct 
testimony that the party will provide at any hearing to be conducted by 
telephone; the direct testimony of each employee or agent of the party 
that the party will call to provide oral direct testimony at any hearing 
to be conducted by telephone; and the direct testimony of each expert 
witness that the party will call to provide oral direct testimony at any 
hearing to be conducted by telephone. The written direct testimony of 
witnesses shall be exchanged by the parties at least 10 days prior to 
the hearing. The oral direct testimony provided by a witness at a 
hearing conducted by telephone will be limited to the presentation of 
the written direct testimony, unless the examiner finds that oral direct 
testimony which is supplemental to the written direct testimony would 
further the public interest and would not constitute surprise.
    (2) The parties shall not be required to exchange testimony in 
accordance with this paragraph if the hearing is scheduled to begin less 
than 20 days after the examiner's notice stating the time of the 
hearing.
    (g) Evidence--(1) In general. (i) The testimony of witnesses at a 
hearing shall be upon oath or affirmation, subject to cross-examination, 
and shall be reported verbatim.
    (ii) Any witness may, in the discretion of the examiner, be examined 
separately and apart from all other witnesses except those who may be 
parties to the proceeding.
    (iii) The examiner shall exclude, insofar as practicable, evidence 
which is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious, or which is not 
of the sort upon which responsible persons are accustomed to rely.
    (2) Objections. (i) If a party objects to the admission or rejection 
of any evidence or to the limitation of the scope of any examination or 
cross-examination, the party shall state briefly the grounds of such 
objections, whereupon an automatic exception will follow if the 
objection is overruled by the examiner. The transcript or recording 
shall not include argument or debate thereon except as ordered by the 
examiner. The ruling of the examiner on any objection shall be a part of 
the transcript or recording.
    (ii) Only objections made before the examiner may subsequently be 
relied upon in the proceeding.
    (3) Depositions. The deposition of any witness shall be admitted in 
the manner provided in and subject to the provisions of Sec. 47.16.
    (4) Affidavits. Except as is otherwise provided in these rules, 
affidavits may be admitted only if the evidence is otherwise admissible 
and the parties agree (which may be determined by their failure to make 
timely objections) that affidavits may be used.
    (5) Proof and authentication of official records or documents. An 
official record or document, if admissible for any purpose, shall be 
admissible in evidence without the production of the person who made or 
prepared the same. Such record or document shall be evidenced by an 
official publication thereof or by a copy attested by the person having 
legal authority to make such attestation. The person attesting the copy 
shall make a certificate showing such authority.
    (6) Exhibits. (i) All written statements, charts, tabulations, or 
similar data offered in evidence at the hearing shall, after 
identification by the proponent and upon a satisfactory showing of the 
admissibility of the contents thereof, be numbered as exhibits, received 
in evidence, and made a part of the record. Unless the examiner finds 
that the furnishing of copies is impracticable, a copy of each exhibit 
shall be filed with the examiner for the use of each other party to the 
proceeding. The examiner shall advise the parties as to the exact number 
of copies which will be required to be filed.
    (ii) If the testimony of a witness refers to a statute, a report, 
document, recording, or transcript, the examiner, after inquiry relating 
to the identification of such statute, report, document,

[[Page 313]]

recording, or transcript, shall determine whether the same shall be 
produced at the hearing and physically be made a part of the evidence as 
an exhibit, or whether it shall be incorporated into the evidence by 
reference. If relevant and material matter offered in evidence is 
embraced in a report, document, recording, or transcript containing 
immaterial or irrelevant matter, such immaterial or irrelevant matter 
shall, insofar as practicable, be designated by the party and segregated 
and excluded.
    (7) [Reserved]
    (8) Offer of proof. Whenever evidence is excluded from the record, 
the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall 
be included in the transcript or recording. The offer of proof shall 
consist of a brief statement describing the evidence to be offered. If 
the evidence consists of a brief oral statement or of an exhibit, it 
shall be inserted into the transcript or recording in toto. In such 
event, it shall be considered a part of the transcript or recording if 
the Secretary decides that the examiner's ruling in excluding the 
evidence was erroneous. The examiner shall not allow the insertion of 
such evidence in toto if the taking of such evidence will consume a 
considerable length of time at the hearing. In the latter event, if the 
Secretary decides that the examiner erred in excluding the evidence, and 
that such error was substantial, the hearing shall be reopened to permit 
the taking of such evidence.
    (h) Oral argument before examiner. The examiner may permit the 
parties or their counsel to argue orally at the hearing or at some other 
time prior to the transmittal of the record to the Secretary as provided 
in this part. Such argument may be limited by the examiner to any extent 
that the examiner finds necessary for the expeditious or proper 
disposition of the proceeding.
    (i) Transcript or recording. (1) Hearings to be conducted by 
telephone shall be recorded verbatim by electronic recording device. 
Hearings conducted by audio-visual telecommunication or the personal 
attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the 
hearing shall be transcribed, unless the examiner finds that recording 
the hearing verbatim would expedite the proceeding and the examiner 
orders the hearing to be recorded verbatim.
    (2) If a hearing is recorded verbatim, a party requests the 
transcript of a hearing or part of a hearing, and the examiner 
determines that the disposition of the proceeding would be expedited by 
a transcript of the hearing or part of a hearing, the examiner shall 
order the verbatim transcription of the recording as requested by the 
party.
    (3) If a reporter transcribes or records the testimony at a hearing, 
the reporter shall deliver the original transcript or recording, with 
exhibits thereto attached, to the examiner, who will retain such copy 
for the official file and for use in preparing his or her report. The 
reporter will also deliver to the examiner such other copy or copies as 
may be ordered by the Department, which copy or copies the examiner will 
forward to the hearing clerk.
    (4) Parties to the proceeding, or others, who desire a copy of the 
transcript or recording of the hearing may place orders at the hearing 
with the reporter, who will furnish and deliver such copies direct to 
the purchaser upon payment of the applicable rate.

Sec. 47.16  Depositions.

    (a) Application for taking deposition. Upon the application of a 
party to the proceeding, the examiner may, at any time after the filing

Secretary the taking of testimony by deposition. The application shall 
be in writing, shall be filed with the hearing clerk, and shall set 
forth:
    (1) The name and address of the proposed deponent; (2) the name and 
address of the person (referred to hereinafter in this section as the 
``officer''), qualified under the regulations in this part to take 
depositions, before whom the proposed examination is to be made; (3) the 
proposed time of the deposition which, unless otherwise agreed, shall be 
at least 30 days after the date of the mailing of the application; (4) 
the proposed place of the deposition; (5)

[[Page 314]]

the proposed manner in which the deposition is to be conducted 
(telephone, audio-visual telecommunication, or by personal attendance of 
the individuals who are expected to participate in the deposition); and 
(6) the reasons for taking the deposition.
    (b) Examiner's order for taking deposition. (1) If, after 
examination of the application, the examiner is of the opinion that the 
deposition should be taken, the examiner shall order the taking of the 
deposition. The order shall be filed with the hearing clerk and shall be 
served by the hearing clerk upon the parties in accordance with 
Sec. 47.4.
    (2) The order shall state:
    (i) The time of the deposition (which unless otherwise agreed shall 
not be less than 20 days after the filing of the order);
    (ii) The place of the deposition;
    (iii) The manner of the deposition (telephone, audio-visual 
telecommunication, or personal attendance of those who are to 
participate in the deposition);
    (iv) The name of the officer before whom the deposition is to be 
made; and
    (v) The name of the deponent.
    (3) The deposition shall be conducted in the manner (telephone, 
audio-visual telecommunication, or personal attendance of those who are 
to participate in the deposition) agreed to by the parties.
    (4) If the parties cannot agree on the manner in which the 
deposition is to be conducted:
    (i) The deposition shall be conducted by telephone unless the 
examiner determines that conducting the deposition by audio-visual 
telecommunication:
    (A) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;
    (B) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected 
to participate in the deposition; or
    (C) Would cost less than conducting the deposition by telephone.
    (ii) If the deposition is not conducted by telephone, the deposition 
shall be conducted by audio-visual telecommunication unless the examiner 
determines that conducting the deposition by personal attendance of any 
individual who is expected to participate in the deposition:
    (A) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;
    (B) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected 
to participate in the deposition; or
    (C) Would cost less than conducting the deposition by telephone or 
audio-visual telecommunication.
    (c) Qualification of officer. The deposition shall be made before 
the examiner or before an officer authorized by the law of the United 
States or by the law of the place of the examination to administer 
oaths, or before an officer authorized by the Secretary to administer 
oaths.
    (d) Procedure on examination. (1) The deponent shall be examined 
under oath or affirmation and shall be subject to cross-examination. The 
testimony of the deponent shall be recorded by the officer or some 
person under the officer's direction. In lieu of oral examination, 
parties may transmit written questions to the officer prior to 
examination and the officer shall propound the written questions to the 
deponent.
    (2) The applicant shall arrange for the examination of the witness 
either by oral examination or by written questions. If the place of 
business of the opposing party is more than 100 miles from the place of 
the examination, the applicant will be required to conduct the 
examination by means of written questions, unless the parties otherwise 
agree or the examiner otherwise orders. If the examination is conducted 
by means of written questions, copies of the applicant's questions must 
be received by the other party to the proceeding and the officer at 
least 10 days prior to the date set for the examination unless otherwise 
agreed, and any cross questions of a party other than the applicant must 
be received by the applicant and the officer at any time prior to the 
time of the examination.
    (e) Certification by officer. The officer shall certify on the 
deposition that the deponent was duly sworn by the officer and that the 
deposition is a true record of the deponent's testimony. The officer 
shall then securely seal the deposition, together with one copy thereof 
(unless there are more than two parties

[[Page 315]]

to a proceeding, in which case there should be another copy for each 
additional party), in an envelope and mail the same by registered mail 
to the hearing clerk.
    (f) Use of depositions. A deposition taken in accord with this 
section or in accord with the provisions of the Rules of Civil Procedure 
of the Courts of the United States, may be used in a proceeding under 
the act if the examiner finds that the evidence is otherwise admissible. 
If a deposition has been taken, and the party upon whose application it 
was taken refuses to offer it in evidence, the other party may offer the 
deposition, or any part thereof, in evidence.

taking of a deposition. Subpoenas may be issued by the Secretary, or by 
the examiner, over the facsimile signature of the Secretary upon a 
reasonable showing by the applicant of the grounds, necessity, and 
reasonable scope thereof.
    (b) Application for subpoena duces tecum. Subpoenas for the 
production of documentary evidence shall be issued only upon a verified 
written application. Such application shall specify, as exactly as 
possible, the documents desired and shall show their competency, 
relevancy, materiality, and the necessity for their production.
    (c) Service of subpoenas. Subponeas may be served by any person not 
less than 18 years of age. The party at whose instance a subponea is

<R05>
Sec. 47.18  Fees and mileage.

    Witnesses who are subpoenaed and who appear in the proceeding, 
including witnesses whose depositions are taken, shall be paid the same 
fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the United 
States, and persons taking depositions shall be entitled to the same 
fees as are paid for like services in the courts of the United States, 
to be paid by the party at whose request the deposition is taken. 
Witness fees and mileage shall be paid by the party at whose instance 
the witnesses appear, and claims therefor shall be presented to such 
party.


<R05>
Sec. 47.19  Post-hearing procedure before the examiner.

    (a) Certification of transcript or recording. As soon as practicable 
after receipt of the transcript or recording, the examiner shall prepare 
his or her certificate stating that, to the best of his or her knowledge 
and belief, the transcript or recording is a true, correct, and complete 
transcript or recording of the testimony given at the hearing, except in 
such particulars as the examiner shall specify, and that the exhibits 
transmitted are all the exhibits received in evidence at the hearing, 
with such exceptions as the examiner shall specify. The original of such 
certificate shall be attached to the original transcript or recording 
and a copy of such certificate shall be furnished to each of the parties 
and to the hearing clerk. The examiner shall correct the original copy 
of the transcript or recording by adding or crossing out (but without 
obscuring the text) at the appropriate places any words necessary to 
make the text conform to the correct meaning, as certified by the 
examiner.
    (b) Proposed findings of fact, conclusions, and order. The examiner 
shall decide and shall announce at the hearing whether proposed findings 
of fact, conclusions, and order may be filed by the parties. If allowed 
by the examiner, he or she shall announce a definite calendar day as the 
time within which these documents may be filed. Such findings of fact, 
conclusions, and order shall be based solely upon the evidence of 
record. They may be accompanied by supporting briefs and by a statement 
of

[[Page 316]]

objections made to the rulings of the examiner at the hearing.
    (c) Briefs. If the examiner does not allow proposed findings of 
fact, conclusions, and order to be filed, the parties shall be given 
until a definite calendar day to file briefs.
    (d) Claim for award of fees and expenses--(1) Filing. Prior to the 
close of the hearing, or within 20 days thereafter, each party may file 
with the examiner a claim for the award of the fees and expenses which 
he incurred in connection with the oral hearing. No award of fees and 
expenses to the prevailing party and against the losing party shall be 
made unless a claim therefor has been filed, and failure to file a claim 
within the time allowed shall constitute a waiver thereof.
    (2) Fees and expenses which may be awarded to prevailing party. The 
term ``fees and expenses,'' as used in section 7(a) of the Act, 
includes:
    (i) Reasonable fees of an attorney or authorized representative for 
appearance at the hearing and for the taking of depositions necessary 
for introduction at the hearing; (ii) fees and mileage for necessary 
witnesses at the rates provided for witnesses in the courts of the 
United States; (iii) fees for the notarizing of a deposition and its 
reduction to writing; (iv) fees for serving subpenas; and (v) other fees 
and expenses necessarily incurred in connection with the oral hearing. 
Fees and expenses which are not considered to be reasonable or 
necessarily incurred in connection with the oral hearing will not be 
awarded.
    (3) Form of claim. A claim for fees and expenses shall be in the 
form of a written itemized statement of the fees and expenses claimed, 
which shall include an explanation of how each item was computed, to 
which there shall be attached an affidavit, made by the party or the 
party's authorized attorney or agent having knowledge of the facts, that 
each such item is correct and has been necessarily incurred in 
connection with the oral hearing in the proceeding and that the services 
for which fees are claimed were actually and necessarily performed.
    (4) Service of claim. A copy of each such claim filed shall be 
served by the examiner on the other party or parties to the proceeding.
    (5) Objections to claim. Within 20 days after being served with a 
copy of a claim for fees and expenses, the party so served may file with 
the examiner written objections to the allowance of any or all of the 
items claimed. If evidence is offered in support of an objection it must 
be in affidavit form. A copy of any such objections shall be served by 
the examiner on the other party or parties.
    (6) Reply to objections to claim. A claimant who is served with a 
copy of objections to his or her claim may, within 20 days after such 
service, file with the examiner a reply to such objection. If evidence 
is offered in support of a reply it must be in affidavit form. A copy of 
any such reply shall be served by the examiner on the other party or 
parties.
    (7) Further inquiry by examiner. Whenever it is deemed desirable or 
necessary for the proper disposition of a claim, the examiner may 
request statements as to specific matters from either or both parties. 
Any statements so furnished shall be served by the examiner on the other 
party.
    (8) Number of copies. All documents or papers authorized by this 
paragraph to be filed with the examiner shall be filed in triplicate: 
Provided, That, where there are more than two parties to the proceeding 
an additional copy shall be filed for each additional party.
    (e) The examiner's report. The examiner, with the assistance and 
collaboration of such employees of the Department as may be assigned for 
the purpose, and within a reasonable time after the termination of the 
periods allowed for the filing of the submissions of the parties allowed 
by this section, shall prepare, upon the basis of the evidence received 
at the hearing and with due consideration of submissions of the parties 
filed pursuant to this section, his or her report. Such report shall be 
filed with the hearing clerk and shall be prepared in the form of a 
final order for the signature of the Secretary, but shall not be served 
upon the parties, unless and until it shall have been

[[Page 317]]

signed by the Secretary, as hereinafter provided.

FR 175, Jan. 3, 1991; 60 FR 8462, Feb. 14, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 47.20  Shortened procedure.

    (a) In general. The shortened procedure described in this section 
shall, whenever it is applicable as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section, take the place and serve in lieu of the oral hearing procedure 
hereinbefore provided. Under the shortened procedure, the pleadings of 
the parties, if verified in accordance with paragraph (h) of this 
section, and any report of investigation filed with the hearing clerk 
pursuant to Sec. 47.7, will be considered as evidence in the proceeding. 
In addition, the parties may submit written proof in support of the 
complaint, answer, or reply, as the case may be, in the form of verified 
statements or depositions. After the close of the evidence, the parties 
may file briefs.
    (b) When applicable--(1) Where damages claimed do not exceed 
$15,000. The shortened procedure provided for in this section shall 
(except as provided in Sec. 47.15(a)) be used in all reparation 
proceedings in which the amount of damages claimed, either in the 
complaint or in the counterclaim, does not exceed $15,000.
    (2) Where damages claimed exceed $15,000. In any proceeding in which 
the amount of damages claimed, either in the complaint or in the 
counterclaim, is greater than $15,000, the examiner, whenever he or she 
is of the opinion that proof may be fairly and adequately presented by 
use of the shortened procedure provided for in this section, shall 
suggest to the parties that they consent to the use of such procedure. 
Parties are free to consent to such procedure if they choose, and 
declination of consent will not affect or prejudice the rights or 
interests of any party. A party, if he or she has not waived oral 
hearing, may consent to the use of the shortened procedure on the 
condition that depositions rather than affidavits be used. In such case, 
if the other party agrees, deposition shall be required to be filed in 
lieu of verified statements. If any party who has not waived oral 
hearing does not consent to the use of the shortened procedure, the 
proceeding will be set for oral hearing. The suggestion that the 
shortened procedure be used need not originate with the examiner. Any 
party may address a request to the examiner asking that the shortened 
procedure be used.
    (c) Complainant's opening statement. Within twenty (20) days after 
service of respondent's answer, complainant may file a verified opening 
statement, accompanied by any pertinent documents, which documents must 
be identified in the statement. If the answer is verified, complainant's 
evidence concerning the allegations of the answer should be included in 
the opening statement.
    (d) Respondent's answering statement. Within twenty (20) days after 
service of complainants' opening statement or service of notice by the 
examiner that complainant has not filed an opening statement, respondent 
may file a verified answering statement, accompanied by any pertinent 
documents, which documents must be identified in the statement.
    (e) Complainant's statement in reply. If respondent files an 
answering statement, complainant may, within twenty (20) days after 
service thereof upon complainant, file a verified statement in reply, 
accompanied by any pertinent documents, which documents must be 
identified in the statement.
    (f) Use of depositions in lieu of verified statements. Depositions 
may be used in lieu of verified statements under paragraphs (c), (d), 
and (e) of this section.
    (g) Briefs. Promptly after the conclusion of the presentation of 
evidence, the examiner shall notify the parties that they may file 
briefs within twenty (20) days after the receipt of such notice.
    (h) Verification. Verification shall be made under oath of any facts 
set forth in the pleading or statement, by the person who signs the 
pleading or statement. The form of verification may be substantially as 
follows:

    --------------------, being first duly sworn, says that he (or she) 
has read the foregoing document and knows the contents thereof and that 
the facts set forth therein are true, except as to matters therein 
stated on information and belief, and as to such matters he

[[Page 318]]

believes them to be true, and that he (or she) is duly authorized to 
sign the document.


    Subscribed and sworn to before me this ------ day of ----------, 
19--.

                                                         (Notary Public)

    (i) Stipulations. In addition to or in lieu of the statements 
referred to in this section, the parties may file with the hearing clerk 
stipulations of fact signed by the parties or their representatives. 
Such stipulations filed with the hearing clerk shall become a part of 
the record.
    (j) Waiver of right to file. Failure to file, within the time 
prescribed, any document authorized by this section shall constitute a 
waiver of the right to file such document.
    (k) The examiner's report. Within a reasonable time after the time 
allowed for filing briefs, the examiner shall prepare his or her report 
in the manner prescribed in Sec. 47.19(d).
    (l) Assignment for oral hearing. Whenever it is deemed desirable or 
necessary for the proper disposition of the proceeding, the examiner, 
upon his or her own or any party's motion, may order the proceeding set 
down for oral hearing at any stage of the proceeding.

and rulings thereon; the report of investigation conducted by the

    (b) Briefs. The Secretary will consider any proposed findings of 
fact, conclusions, and orders, statements of objections, and briefs 
filed as provided in Sec. 47.19(b). Briefs filed in accordance with 
Sec. 47.19(c) and those filed in support of statements of fact will also 
be considered by the Secretary.

Sec. 47.23  Issuance of order.

    As soon as practicable after the receipt of the record from the 
hearing clerk, the Secretary, upon the basis of and after due 
consideration of the record, shall issue his or her order in the 
proceeding. Unless the Secretary disagrees with the order as drafted for 
his or her signature by the examiner, as provided in Sec. 47.19(d), the 
Secretary shall issue as his or her order the order so prepared by the 
examiner. If the Secretary deems it advisable to do so, the Secretary 
may direct that the order be served upon the parties as a tentative 
order and that the parties be allowed such period of time, not to exceed 
20 days, as the Secretary may specify, within which to file exceptions 
thereto and written argument or briefs in support of such exceptions.

<R05>
Sec. 47.24  Rehearing, reargument, reconsideration of orders, and reopening of hearings.

    (a) Petitions to rehear, reargue, and reconsider. A petition for 
rehearing or reargument of the proceeding, or for reconsideration of the 
order, shall be made by petition to the Secretary filed with the 
Division within 20 days after the date of service of the order. Every 
such petition shall state specifically

[[Page 319]]

the matters claimed to have been erroneously decided and the alleged 
errors. If the Secretary concludes that the questions raised by the 
petition have been sufficiently considered in the issuance of the order, 
the Secretary shall dismiss the petition without service on the other 
party. Otherwise the Secretary shall direct that a copy of the petition 
be served upon such party. The filing of a petition to rehear or reargue 
a proceeding, or to reconsider an order, shall automatically operate to 
set aside the order pending final action on the petition.
    (b) Petition to reopen. A petition to reopen the hearing to take 
further evidence may be filed with the examiner at any time prior to the 
issuance of the final order. Every such petition shall state briefly the 
nature and purpose of the evidence to be adduced, shall show that such 
evidence is not merely cumulative, and shall set forth a good reason why 
such evidence was not adduced at the hearing. Every such petition shall 
be served by the hearing clerk on the other party in the proceeding.
    (c) Procedure for disposition of petitions. Within 20 days following 
the service of any petition provided for in this section, the other 
party to the proceeding may file with the hearing clerk an answer 
thereto. In the event that any such petition is granted the applicable 
rules of practice shall be followed.

<R05>
Sec. 47.25  Filing; extensions of time; effective date of filing; computations of time; reopening after default; official notice.

    (a) Filing, number of copies. Except as is provided otherwise 
herein, all documents or papers required or authorized by these rules to 
be filed with the hearing clerk shall be filed in triplicate: Provided, 
That, where there are more than two parties to the proceeding, a 
sufficient number of copies shall be filed so as to provide for service 
upon all the parties to the proceeding. Any document or paper required 
or authorized by the regulations in this part to be filed with the 
hearing clerk shall, during the course of an oral hearing, be filed with 
the examiner.
    (b) Extensions of time. The time for the filing of any document or 
paper (except an informal complaint) required or authorized under the 
regulations in this part to be filed may be extended by the examiner 
(before the transmittal of the record to the Secretary) or by the 
Secretary (after such transmittal), if, in the judgment of the examiner 
or the Secretary, as the case may be, there is good reason for the 
extension.
    (c) Effective date of filing. Any document or paper required or 
authorized under the regulations in this part to be filed shall be 
deemed to be filed when it reaches the Department in Washington, D.C.; 
or, if filed with any officer or employee of the Regulatory Branch of 
the Division at any place outside the District of Columbia, it shall be 
deemed to be filed at the time when it is received by such officer or 
employee.
    (d) Computation of time. Sundays and holidays shall be included in 
computing the time allowed for the filing of any document or paper: 
Provided, That, when such time expires on a Sunday or Federal holiday, 
such period shall be extended to include the next following business 
day.
    (e) Reopening after default. A default in the filing of an answer 
required or authorized under this part to be filed may be set aside and 
the party in default allowed 20 days within which to file an answer by 
the examiner (before the record is transmitted to the Secretary) or by 
the Secretary (after the record is transmitted to him or her) upon 
motion made within a reasonable time after the time for filing the 
answer has expired if, in the judgment of the examiner or the Secretary, 
as the case may be, after notice to and consideration of the views of 
the other party, there is good reason for granting such relief.
    (f) Official notice. In any proceeding official notice may be taken 
of (1) such matters as are judicially noticed by the courts of the 
United States; (2) any other matter of technical, scientific, or

[[Page 320]]

commercial fact of established character; and (3) relevant publications

the gross sales as well as all selling charges and all other charges or

Secretary and the Deputy Administrator, such duties as the Secretary or

    Any person receiving produce in interstate commerce or in the 
District of Columbia for or on behalf of another who, without good and 
sufficient cause, shall destroy or abandon, discard as refuse, or dump 
any produce, directly or indirectly or through collusion with any 
person, shall be considered to have violated the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 48.5  False report or statement.

                        Justification for Dumping


<R05>
Sec. 48.7  Evidence to justify dumping.

    Any person, receiving produce in interstate commerce or in the 
District of Columbia, having reason to destroy, abandon, discard as 
refuse or dump such produce, should, prior to such destroying, 
abandoning, discarding or dumping, obtain a dumping certificate or other 
evidence of justification for such action. Certification, showing that 
the produce has no commercial value, should be obtained from:
    (a) An inspector authorized by the United States Department of 
Agriculture to inspect produce; or (b) a health officer, or food 
inspector of any State, county, parish, city or municipality or of the 
District of Columbia. When no inspector or health officer, as designated 
in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section is available, affidavits as to 
the condition of the produce should be obtained from two disinterested 
persons having no financial interest in the produce involved or in the 
business of a person financially interested therein, and who are 
unrelated by blood or marriage to any such financially interested 
person, and who, at the time of certification, and for a period of at 
least one year immediately prior thereto, have been engaged in the 
handling of the same general kind or class of produce with respect to 
which such affidavits are to be made. The certificate or affidavit 
obtained for justifying dumping should identify the produce to be dumped 
by giving the name of the shipper, any identifying marks or brands on 
the original container, the type of container, the commodity, the 
quantity, the date of inspection, and contain a short description of the 
condition of the produce to be dumped at the time of inspection. The 
name, address and title of the person or persons making such inspection 
should also be designated on the certificate or affidavit.

                               Complaints


<R05>
Sec. 48.8  Filing of complaints.

    Any person having reason to believe that the Act or the regulations 
in this part have been violated should submit promptly all available 
facts with respect thereto to the Director for investigation and 
appropriate action.

    The applicant shall cause the products for which inspection is 
requested to be made reasonably accessible for sampling or inspection 
and to be so placed as to disclose their quality or condition. Samples

conditions as, in the opinion of the inspector, will permit a true and 
correct determination to be made of their quality or condition.


<R05>
Sec. 51.13  Basis of service.

    Inspection and certification service for quality and/or condition 
shall be based upon the appropriate standards promulgated by the U.S.

of any governmental agency, written buyer and seller contract 
specifications, or any written specification by an applicant which is 
approved by the Administrator: Provided, That if such product is 
regulated pursuant to the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, 
as amended (7 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), or the comparable laws of any State, 
such inspection and certification shall be on the basis of the 
standards, if any, prescribed in, or pursuant to, the marketing order 
and/or agreement effective thereunder.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 51.16  Postponing inspection service.

    If the inspector has reason to believe that, because of latent 
defects due to climatic or other conditions, he is unable to determine 
the true quality or condition of the product, he shall postpone 
examination for such period as may, in his judgment, be reasonably 
necessary to enable him to determine its true quality or condition.

characteristic of the variety: Provided, That an apple having color of a 
lighter shade of solid red or striped red than that considered as a good 
shade of red characteristic of the variety may be admitted to a grade, 
provided it has sufficient additional area covered so that the apple has 
as good an appearance as one with the minimum percentage of good red 
characteristic of the variety required for the grade. For the striped 
red varieties the percentage stated refers to the area of the surface in 
which the stripes of a good shade of red characteristic of the variety 
shall predominate over stripes of lighter red, green, or yellow. 
However, an apple having color of a lighter shade than that considered 
as a good shade of red characteristic of the variety may be admitted to 
a grade, provided it has sufficient additional area covered so that the 
apple has as good an appearance as one with the minimum percentage of 
stripes of a good red characteristic of the variety required for the 
grade. Faded brown stripes shall not be considered as color except in 
the case of the Gray Baldwin variety.
    (a) Color standards USDA Visual Aid APL-L-1 (including plates (A), 
(B), (C), (D), (E), and (F)) consist of a folder containing the color

more than 1 percent for apples affected by decay or internal breakdown.
    (b) When applying the foregoing tolerances to Combination grades no 
part of any tolerance shall be allowed to reduce, for the lot as a 
whole, the 50 percent of apples of the higher grade required in the 
combination but individual containers shall have not less than 40

<R05>
Sec. 51.690  Sample for grade or size determination.

    Each sample shall consist of 50 oranges. When individual packages 
contain at least 50 oranges, the sample is drawn from one package; when 
individual packages contain less than 50 oranges, a sufficient number of 
adjoining packages are opened to form a 50-count sample. When 
practicable, at point of packaging, the sample may be obtained from the 
grading belt or bins after sorting has been completed.

[[Page 405]]

    (a) The following shall be considered as damage to the individual 
berry:
    (1) Scarring such as that caused by thrips, mildew, rubs, and 
similar injuries when materially detracting from the appearance of the 
berry;

of the skin materially detracts from the appearance of the berry: 
Provided, That ``sunkissed'' berries of the white Malaga variety which 
show discoloration of amber or light brown color shall not be considered 
as damaged. ``Buckskin'' berries of the Tokay variety, and similar 
injury to other varieties, shall be considered as damaged by 
discoloration;

<R05>
Sec. 51.1000  U.S. No. 1.

    ``U.S. No. 1'' consists of Persian limes which are firm, fairly well 
formed, of fairly smooth texture, which are free

[[Page 407]]

from decay, stylar end breakdown or other internal discoloration, broken 
skins which are not healed, bruises (except those incident to proper 
handling and packing), hard or dry skins, and free from damage caused by 
freezing, dryness or mushy condition, sprayburn, exanthema 
(ammoniation), scars, thorn scratches, scale, sunburn, scab, blanching, 
yellow color, discoloration, buckskin, dirt or other foreign material, 
disease, insects or mechanical or other means.
    (a) Each fruit in this grade shall have not less than an aggregate 
area of three-fourths of the surface of the fruit which shows good green 
color characteristic of the Persian lime: Provided, That lots of limes 
which fail to meet the U.S. No. 1 grade requirements only because of 
blanching shall be designated as ``U.S. No. 1, Mixed Color'': And 
provided further, That lots of limes which fail to meet the U.S. No. 1 
or U.S. No. 1 Mixed Color grade requirements only because of turning 
yellow or yellow color, caused by the ripening process, shall be 
designated as ``U.S. No. 1, Turning''.
    (b) The fruit shall have a juice content of not less than 42 
percent, by volume.
    (c) In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and 
handling, not more than 10 percent, by count, of the fruit in any lot 
may fail to meet the color requirements. In addition, not more than 10 
percent, by count, of the fruit in any lot may be below the remaining 
requirements of this grade, but not more than one-half of this amount, 
or 5 percent, shall be allowed for decay, stylar end breakdown, broken 
skins which are not healed, or defects causing serious damage including 
not more than one-half of 1 percent for decay at shipping point: 
Provided, That an additional tolerance of 2\1/2\ percent, or a total of 
not more than 3 percent, shall be allowed for decay en route or at 
destination.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1001  U.S. Combination.

    ``U.S. Combination'' consists of a combination of U.S. No. 1 and 
U.S. No. 2 limes: Provided, That at least 60 percent, by count, of the 
limes in the lot meet the requirements of U.S. No. 1 grade.
    (a) In this grade the U.S. No. 1 limes shall meet the color 
requirements of the U.S. No. 1 grade and the U.S. No. 2 limes shall meet 
the color requirements of the U.S. No. 2 grade: Provided, That lots of 
limes which fail to meet the U.S. Combination grade requirements only 
because of blanching shall be designated as ``U.S. Combination, Mixed 
Color'': And provided further, That lots of limes which fail to meet the 
U.S. Combination or U.S. Combination Mixed Color grade requirements only 
because of turning yellow or yellow color, caused by the ripening 
process, shall be designated as ``U.S. Combination, Turning''.
    (b) In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and 
handling, not more than 10 percent, by count, of the fruit in any lot 
may fail to meet the color requirements. In addition, not more than 10 
percent, by count, of the fruit in any lot may be below the remaining 
requirements of the lower grade in the combination, but not more than 
one-half of this amount, or 5 percent, shall be allowed for limes 
affected by decay, stylar end breakdown and broken skins which are not 
healed, including not more than one-half of 1 percent for decay at 
shipping point: Provided, That an additional tolerance of 2\1/2\ 
percent, or a total of not more than 3 percent, shall be allowed for 
decay en route or at destination.
    (c) No part of the above tolerances shall be allowed to reduce for 
the lot as a whole, the 60 percent of U.S. No. 1 limes required in the

sunburn,

[[Page 408]]

scab, blanching, yellow color, discoloration, buckskin, dirt or other 
foreign material, disease, insects or mechanical or other means.
    (a) Each fruit in this grade shall have not less than an aggregate 
area of one-half of the surface of the fruit which shows good green 
color characteristic of the Persian lime: Provided, That lots of limes 
which fail to meet the U.S. No. 2 grade requirements only because of 
blanching shall be designated as ``U.S. No. 2, Mixed Color''; And 
provided further, That lots of limes which fail to meet the U.S. No. 2

<R05>
Sec. 51.1003  Unclassified.

    ``Unclassified'' consists of Persian limes which have not been 
classified in accordance with any of the foregoing grades. The term 
``unclassified'' is not a grade within the meaning of these standards 
but is provided as a designation to show that no grade has been applied 
to the lot.

                        Application of Tolerances


<R05>
Sec. 51.1004  Application of tolerances.

    (a) The contents of individual packages in the lot, based on sample 
inspection, are subject to the following limitations: Provided, That the 
averages for the entire lot are within the tolerances specified for the 
grade:
    (1) For packages which contain more than 3 pounds and a tolerance of 
10 percent or more is provided, individual packages in any lot shall 
have not more than one and one-half times the tolerance specified. For 
packages which contain more than 3 pounds and a tolerance of less than 
10 percent is provided, individual packages in any lot shall have not 
more than double the tolerance specified, except that at least one 
decayed fruit may be permitted in any package; and,
    (2) For packages which contain 3 pounds or less, individual packages

                              Standard Pack


<R05>
Sec. 51.1005  Standard pack.

    (a) Fruit shall be fairly uniform in size, and when place packed in 
crates or cartons, the fruit shall be arranged according to the approved 
and recognized methods.
    (b) All packages shall be well filled but the contents shall not 
show excessive or unnecessary bruising because of over-filled packages.
    (c) ``Fairly uniform in size'' means that not more than 10 percent, 
by count of the fruit in any container may vary more than four-
sixteenths of an inch in diameter.
    (d) In order to allow for variations, other than sizing, incident to 
proper packing, not more than 5 percent of the packages in any lot may 
fail to meet the requirements of standard pack.

                               Definitions


<R05>
Sec. 51.1006  Firm.

    Firm means that the fruit is not soft or flabby.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1007  Fairly well formed.

    Fairly well formed means that the fruit shows normal characteristic 
shape for the Persian variety and is not materially flattened on one 
side.

[[Page 409]]


<R05>
Sec. 51.1008  Fairly smooth texture.

    Fairly smooth texture means that the fruit is comparatively free 
from lumpiness and that pebbling is not abnormally coarse. Coarse 
pebbling is not objectionable as it is indicative of good keeping 
quality and is characteristic of the fruit, especially that from young 
trees.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1009  Stylar end breakdown.

    Stylar end breakdown is a physiological breakdown starting at the 
base of the nipple as a grayish tan water-soaked spot. A brownish 
discoloration develops in the rind. As it progresses the color of the 
affected area becomes darker and usually sinks below the healthy 
surface, but the area remains firm unless infected with secondary 
organisms that cause soft decay.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1010  Damage.

    Damage means any defect which materially affects the appearance, or 
the edible or shipping quality of the fruit. Any one of the following 
defects, or any combination of defects the seriousness of which exceeds 
the maximum allowed for any one defect, shall be considered as damage:
    (a) Dryness or mushy condition which extends into all segments more 
than one-eighth of an inch at the stem end, or more than the equivalent 
of this amount, by volume, when occurring in other portions of the 
fruit;
    (b) Sprayburn which changes the color to such an extent that the 
appearance of the fruit is materially affected, or which causes scarring 
that in the aggregate exceeds the area of a circle one-fourth inch in 
diameter;
    (c) Exanthema (ammoniation) which materially detracts from the 
appearance of the fruit, or which occurs as small, thinly scattered 
spots over more than 10 percent of the fruit surface, or as solid 
scarring (not cracked) or depressions which in the aggregate exceed the 
area of a circle one-half inch in diameter;
    (d) Scars which are dark, rough, or deep and in the aggregate exceed 
the area of a circle one-fourth inch in diameter, or scars which are 
fairly light in color, slightly rough, or of slight depth and in the 
aggregate exceed the area of a circle one-half inch in diameter, or 
scars which are light colored, fairly smooth, with no depth and 
aggregate more than 10 percent of the fruit surface;
    (e) Thorn scratches when the injury is not well healed, or when dark 
colored, rough or deep and in the aggregate exceeds the area of a circle 
one-fourth inch in diameter, or when light colored, fairly smooth and 
concentrated and in the aggregate exceeds the area of a circle one-half 
inch in diameter, or light colored and scattered thorn injury which 
detracts from the appearance of the fruit to a greater extent than the 
aggregate area of one-half inch permitted for light colored concentrated 
injury;
    (f) Scale when the appearance of the fruit is affected to a greater 
extent than that of a lime which has 10 medium to large California red 
or purple scale attached;
    (g) Sunburn which causes appreciable flattening of the fruit, drying 
of the skin, material change in the color of the skin, appreciable 
drying of the flesh underneath the affected area, or which affects more 
than 5 percent of the fruit surface;
    (h) Scab which materially affects the shape or texture;
    (i) Blanching when more than 25 percent, in the aggregate, of the 
fruit surface shows a whitish to yellowish green area or areas because 
of shading, resting on the surface of the ground, or contact with other 
fruit on the tree. Such areas are not to be confused with limes which 
are turning yellow due to the ripening process;
    (j) Yellow color when plainly visible and caused by the ripening 
process;
    (k) Discoloration caused by rust mite, melanose or other means, when 
fairly smooth and more than 10 percent of the fruit surface is affected, 
or when slightly rough and in the aggregate exceeds the area of a circle 
one-half inch in diameter; and,
    (l) Buckskin when more unsightly than the maximum discoloration 
allowed, or the fruit texture is materially affected.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1011  Good green color.

    Good green color means that the skin of the lime is of a good green 
color characteristic of the Persian variety.

[[Page 410]]


<R05>
Sec. 51.1012  Fairly firm.

    Fairly firm means that the fruit is not soft or excessively flabby.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1013  Badly deformed.

    Badly deformed means that the fruit is seriously misshapen from any 
cause.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1014  Excessively rough texture.

    Excessively rough texture means that the skin is badly ridged or 
very decidedly lumpy.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1015  Serious damage.

    Serious damage means any defect which seriously affects the 
appearance, or the edible or shipping quality of the fruit. Any one of 
the following defects, or any combination of defects the seriousness of 
which exceeds the maximum allowed for any one defect, shall be 
considered as serious damage:
    (a) Dryness or mushy condition which extends into all segments more 
than one-fourth of an inch at the stem end, or more than the equivalent 
of this amount, by volume, when occurring in other portions of the 
fruit;
    (b) Sprayburn which changes the color to such an extent that the 
appearance of the fruit is seriously injured or which causes scarring 
that in the aggregate exceeds the area of a circle one-half inch in 
diameter;
    (c) Exanthema (ammoniation) which occurs as small spots over more 
than 25 percent of the fruit surface, or as solid scarring (not cracked) 
or depressions which aggregate more than 10 percent of the fruit 
surface;
    (d) Scars which are dark, rough, or deep and aggregate more than 5 
percent of the fruit surface, or scars which are fairly light in color, 
slightly rough, or of slight depth and aggregate more than 10 percent of 
the fruit surface, or scars which are light colored, fairly smooth, with 
no depth and aggregate more than 25 percent of the fruit surface;
    (e) Thorn scratches when the injury is not well healed, or when dark 
colored, rough or deep and aggregates more than 5 percent of the fruit 
surface, or when light colored, fairly smooth and concentrated and 
aggregates more than 10 percent of the fruit surface, or light colored 
and scattered thorn injury which detracts from the appearance of the 
fruit to a greater extent than the 10 percent light colored concentrated 
injury;
    (f) Scale when the appearance of the fruit is affected to a greater 
extent than that of a lime which has a blotch the area of a circle one-
half inch in diameter;
    (g) Sunburn which causes decided flattening of the fruit, marked 
drying or dark discoloration of the skin, material drying of the flesh 
underneath the affected area, or which affects more than 10 percent of 
the fruit surface;
    (h) Scab which seriously affects shape or texture;
    (i) Blanching when more than 50 percent, in the aggregate, of the 
fruit surface shows a whitish to yellowish green area or areas because 
of shading, resting on the surface of the ground, or contact with other 
fruit on the tree. Such areas are not to be confused with limes which 
are turning yellow due to the ripening process;
    (j) Yellow color when plainly visible and caused by the ripening 
process;
    (k) Discoloration caused by rust mite, melanose or other means, when 
fairly smooth and more than 50 percent of the fruit surface is affected, 
or when slightly rough and more than 25 percent of the fruit surface is 
affected; and,
    (l) Buckskin when more unsightly than the maximum discoloration 
allowed, or the fruit texture is seriously affected.

<R05>
Sec. 51.1210  U.S. Fancy.

    U.S. Fancy consists of peaches of one variety which are mature but 
not soft or overripe, well formed and which are free from decay, 
bacterial spot, cuts which are not healed, growth cracks, hail injury, 
scab, scale, split pits, worms, worm holes, leaf or limb rub injury; and 
free from damage caused by bruises, dirt or other foreign material, 
other disease, insects or mechanical or other means.
    (a) In addition to the above requirements, each peach shall have not 
less than one-third of its surface showing blushed, pink or red color.
    (b) In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and 
handling, not more than 10 percent, by count, of the peaches in any lot 
may fail to meet the requirements of this grade other than for color, 
but not more than one-half of this amount, or 5 percent, shall be 
allowed for defects causing serious damage, and not more than one-fifth 
of this amount, or 1 percent, shall be allowed for decay at shipping 
point: Provided, That an additional tolerance of 2 percent shall be 
allowed for soft, over-ripe, or decayed peaches en route or at 
destination. In addition, not more than 10 percent, by count, of the 
peaches in any lot may be below the specified color requirement.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1211  U.S. Extra No. 1.

    Any lot of peaches may be designated ``U.S. Extra No. 1'' when the 
peaches meet the requirements of U.S. No. 1 grade: Provided, That in 
addition to these requirements, 50 percent, by count, of the peaches in 
any lot shall have not less than one-fourth of the surface showing 
blushed, pink or red color.
    (a) In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and 
handling, not more than 10 percent, by count, of the peaches in any lot 
may fail to meet the requirements of U.S. No. 1 grade, but not more than 
one-half of this amount, or 5 percent, shall be allowed for defects 
causing serious damage, and not more than one-fifth of this amount, or 1 
percent, shall be allowed for decay at shipping point: Provided, That an 
additional tolerance of 2 percent shall be allowed for soft, over-ripe 
or decayed peaches en route or at destination. No part of any tolerance 
shall be used to reduce for the lot as a whole the 50 percent of peaches 
required to have not less than one-fourth of the surface showing 
blushed, pink or red color, but individual packages may contain not less 
than 40 percent of peaches having this amount of color: Provided, That 
the entire lot averages not less than 50 percent.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1212  U.S. No. 1.

    U.S. No. 1 consists of peaches of one variety which are mature but 
not soft or overripe, well formed, and which are free from decay, growth 
cracks, cuts which are not healed, worms, worm holes, and free from 
damage caused by bruises, dirt, or other foreign material, bacterial 
spot, scab, scale, hail injury, leaf or limb rubs, split pits, other 
disease, insects or mechanical or other means.
    (a) In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and 
handling, not more than 10 percent, by count, of the peaches in any lot 
may fail to meet the requirements of this grade, but not more than one-
half of this amount, or 5 percent, shall be allowed for defects causing 
serious damage, and not more than one-fifth of this amount, or 1 
percent, shall be allowed for decay at shipping point: Provided, That an 
additional tolerance of 2 percent shall be

[[Page 420]]

allowed for soft, overripe, or decayed peaches en route, or at 
destination.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1213  U.S. No. 2.

    U.S. No. 2 consists of peaches of one variety which are mature but 
not soft or overripe, not badly misshapen, and which are free from 
decay, cuts which are not healed, worms, worm holes, and free from 
serious damage caused by bruises, dirt or other foreign material, 
bacterial spot, scab, scale, growth cracks, hail injury, leaf or limb 
rubs, split pits, other disease, insects, or mechanical or other means.
    (a) In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and 
handling, not more than 10 percent, by count, of the peaches in any lot 
may fail to meet the requirements of this grade, but not more than one-
tenth of this amount, or 1 percent, shall be allowed for decay at 
shipping point: Provided, That an additional tolerance of 2 percent 
shall be allowed for soft, overripe, or decayed peaches en route or at 
destination.

                              Unclassified


<R05>
Sec. 51.1214  Unclassified.

    Unclassified consists of peaches which have not been classified in 
accordance with any of the foregoing grades. The term ``unclassified'' 
is not a grade within the meaning of these standards but is provided as 
a designation to show that no definite grade has been applied to the 
lot.

                        Application of Tolerances


<R05>
Sec. 51.1215  Application of tolerances to individual packages.

    (a) The contents of individual packages in the lot, based on sample 
inspection, are subject to the following limitations, provided the 
averages for the entire lot are within the tolerances specified for the 
grade:
    (1) For packages which contain more than 10 pounds, and a tolerance 
of 10 percent or more is provided (as in the case of oversize, where a 
tolerance of 15 percent is provided), individual packages in any lot 
shall have not more than one and one-half times the tolerance specified. 
For packages which contain more than 10 pounds and a tolerance of less 
than 10 percent is provided, individual packages in any lot shall have 
not more than double the tolerance specified, except that at least one 
peach which is seriously damaged by insects or affected by decay may be 
permitted in any package.
    (2) For packages which contain 10 pounds or less, individual 
packages in any lot are not restricted as to the percentage of defects: 
Provided, That not more than one peach which is seriously damaged by 
insects or affected by decay may be permitted in any package.

                                  Size


<R05>
Sec. 51.1216  Size requirements.

    (a) The numerical count or the minimum diameter of the peaches 
packed in a closed container shall be indicated on the container.
    (b) When the numerical count is not shown the minimum diameter shall 
be plainly stamped, stenciled, or otherwise marked on the container in 
terms of whole inches, whole and half inches, whole and quarter inches, 
or whole and eight inches, as 2 inches minimum, 2\1/4\ inches minimum, 
1\7/8\ inches minimum, in accordance with the facts. The minimum and 
maximum diameters may both be stated, as 1\7/8\ to 2 inches, or 2 to 
2\1/4\ inches, in accordance with the facts.
    (c) Diameter means the greatest dimension measured at right angles 
to a line from stem to blossom end of the fruit.
    (d) In order to allow for variations incident to proper sizing, not 
more than 10 percent, by count, of peaches in any lot may be below the 
specified minimum size and not more than 15 percent may be above any 
specified maximum size.

                              Unclassified


<R05>
Sec. 51.1305  Unclassified.

    ``Unclassified'' consists of pears which have not been classified in 
accordance with any of the foregoing grades. The term ``unclassified'' 
is not a grade within the meaning of these standards, but is provided as 
a designation to show that no grade has been applied to the lot.

                               Tolerances


<R05>
Sec. 51.1306  Tolerances.

    (a) In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and 
handling, not more than a total of 10 percent of the pears in any lot 
may fail to meet the requirements of grade: Provided, That not more than 
5 percent shall be

[[Page 429]]

seriously damaged by insects, and not more than 1 percent shall be 
allowed for decay or internal breakdown.
    (b) When applying the foregoing tolerances to the combination grade 
no part of any tolerance shall be used to reduce the percentage of U. S. 
No. 1 pears required in the combination, but individual containers may 
have not more than 10 percent less than the percentage of U.S. No. 1 
required: Provided, That the entire lot averages within the percentage 
specified.

                        Application of Tolerances


<R05>
Sec. 51.1307  Application of tolerances.

    (a) The contents of individual packages in the lot, based on sample 
inspection, are subject to the following limitations, provided the 
averages for the entire lot are within the tolerances specified for the 
grade:
    (1) For packages which contain more than 10 pounds, and a tolerance 
of 10 percent or more is provided, individual packages in any lot shall 
have not more than one and one-half times the tolerance specified. For 
packages which contain more than 10 pounds and a tolerance of less than 
10 percent is provided, individual packages in any lot shall have not 
more than double the tolerance specified, except that at least one pear 
which is seriously damaged by insects or affected by decay or internal 
breakdown may be permitted in any package.
    (2) For packages which contain 10 pounds or less, individual 
packages in any lot are not restricted as to the percentage of defects 
or off-size: Provided, That not more than four times the tolerance 
specified may be permitted in any package for pears which are seriously 
damaged by insects or affected by decay or internal breakdown except 
that at least one defective pear may be permitted in any package.

                    Basis for Calculating Percentages


<R05>
Sec. 51.1308  Basis for calculating percentages.

    (a) When the numerical count is marked in the container or when 
pears are packed in a container to weigh 5 pounds or less, percentages 
shall be calculated on the basis of count.
    (b) When the minimum diameter or minimum and maximum diameters are 
marked on a container packed to weigh more than 5 pounds or when the 
pears are jumbled in a container packed to weigh more than 5 pounds, 
percentages shall be calculated on the basis of weight or an equivalent 
basis.

                   Condition After Storage or Transit


<R05>
Sec. 51.1309  Condition after storage or transit.

    Decay, scald or other deterioration which may have developed on 
pears after they have been in storage or transit shall be considered as 
affecting condition and not the grade.

                              Standard Pack


<R05>
Sec. 51.1310  Sizing.

    (a) The numerical count, or the minimum size of the pears packed in 
closed containers shall be indicated on the package. The number of pears 
in the box shall not vary more than 3 from the number indicated on the 
box.
    (b) When the numerical count is marked on western standard pear 
boxes the pears shall not vary more than three-eighths inch in their 
transverse diameter for counts 120 or less; one-fourth inch for counts 
135 to 180, inclusive; and three-sixteenths inch for counts 193 or more.
    (c) When the numerical count is marked on western standard half 
boxes or special half boxes packed three tiers deep, the pears shall not 
vary more than three-eighths inch for coutns 75 or less; one-fourth inch 
for counts 80 to 110, inclusive; and three-sixteenths inch for counts 
115 or more.
    (d) When the numerical count is marked on western standard half 
boxes or special half boxes packed two tiers deep, the pears shall not 
vary more than three-eighths inch for counts 50 or less; one-fourth inch 
for counts 55 to 70, inclusive; and three-sixteenths inch for counts 80 
or more.
    (e) When the numerical count is not shown, the minimum size shall be 
plainly stamped, stenciled or otherwise marked on the container in terms 
of whole inches, whole and half inches, whole and quarter inches, or 
whole and eighth inches, as 2\1/2\ inches minimum,

[[Page 430]]

2\1/4\ inches minimum, or 2\5/8\ inches minimum, in accordance with the 
facts. It is suggested that both minimum and maximum sizes be marked on 
the container, as 2\1/4\ to 2\3/4\ inches, 2\1/2\ to 2\3/4\ inches, as 
such marking is especially desirable for pears marketed in the export 
trade.
    (f) ``Size'' means the greatest transverse diameter of the pear 
taken at right angles to a line running from the stem to the blossom 
end.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1311  Packing.

    (a) Each package shall be packed so that the pears in the shown face 
shall be reasonably representative in size and quality of the contents 
of the package.
    (b) Pears packed in any container shall be tightly packed. All 
packages shall be well filled but the contents shall not show excessive 
or unnecessary bruising because of overfilled packages.
    (c) Pears packed in boxes shall be arranged in containers according 
to the approved and recognized methods with the pears packed lengthwise. 
A bridge shall not be allowed in any standard pack. When wrapped, each 
pear shall be fairly well enclosed by its individual wrapper.
    (d) Pears packed in round stave bushel baskets, tubs, or in barrels 
shall be ring faced.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1312  Tolerances for standard pack.

    (a) In order to allow for variations incident to proper sizing, not 
more than 5 percent of the pears in any lot may fail to meet the size 
requirements: Provided, That when the maximum and minimum sizes are both 
stated, an additional 10 percent tolerance shall be allowed for pears 
which are larger than the maximum size stated.
    (b) In order to allow for variations incident to proper packing, not 
more than 10 percent of the containers in any lot may fail to meet these 
requirements but no part of this tolerance shall be allowed for bridge 
packs, or for packs with different sizes and arrangements such as layers 
of 195 size and arrangement, and layers of 180 size and arrangement 
packed in the same box.

<R05>
Sec. 51.1313  Mature.

    (a) Mature means that the pear has reached the stage of maturity 
which will insure the proper completion of the ripening process.
    (b) Before a mature pear becomes overripe it will show varying 
degrees of firmness depending upon the stage of the ripening process. 
Therefore, a statement of firmness should be given in order to indicate 
the stage of the ripening process. A description of the ground color 
should also be given.
    (1) The following terms should be used for describing the ground 
color: Green, Light Green, Yellowish Green, and Yellow.
    (2) The following terms should be used for describing the firmness 
of pears:
    (i) Hard means that the flesh of the pear is solid and does not 
yield appreciably even to considerable pressure.
    (ii) Firm means that the flesh of the pear is fairly solid but 
yields somewhat to moderate pressure.
    (iii) Firm ripe means that the flesh of the pear yields readily to 
moderate pressure.
    (iv) Ripe means that the pear is at the stage where it is in its 
most desirable condition for eating.

<R05>
Sec. 51.1346  U.S. No. 1.

    ``U.S. No. 1'' consists of pears of one variety which are mature, 
handpicked, firm, well formed, free from scald, hard end, black end, 
internal breakdown, decay, worms and worm holes, and from damage caused 
by broken skins, limbrubs, sprayburn, sunburn, scab, russeting, bruises, 
hail, frost, drought spot, disease, insects, mechanical or other means. 
Unless otherwise specified, the pears shall not be further advanced than 
yellowish green. Tree-ripened pears and pears grown from late blooms

                       Kernel Color Classification


<R05>
Sec. 51.1403  Kernel color classification.

    (a) The skin color of pecan kernels may be described in terms of the 
color classifications provided in this section. When the color of 
kernels in a lot generally conforms to the ``light'' or ``light amber'' 
classification, that color classification may be used to describe the 
lot in connection with the grade.
    (1) ``Light'' means that the outer surface of the kernel is mostly 
golden color or lighter, with not more than 25 percent of the outer 
surface darker than golden, none of which is darker than light brown.
    (2) ``Light amber'' means that more than 25 percent of the outer 
surface of the kernel is light brown, with not more than 25 percent of 
the outer surface darker than light brown, none of which is darker than 
medium brown.
    (3) ``Amber'' means that more than 25 percent of the outer surface 
of the kernel is medium brown, with not more than 25 percent of the 
outer surface darker than medium brown, none of which is darker than 
dark brown (very dark-brown or blackish-brown discoloration).
    (4) ``Dark amber'' means that more than 25 percent of the outer 
surface of the kernel is dark brown, with not more than 25 percent of 
the outer surface darker than dark brown (very dark-brown or blackish-
brown discoloration).
    (b) U.S. Department of Agriculture kernel color standards, Pec-MC-1, 
consisting of plastic models of pecan kernels, illustrate the color 
intensities implied by the terms ``golden,'' ``light brown,'' ``medium 
brown'' and ``dark brown'' referred to in paragraph (a) of this section. 
These color standards may be examined in the Fruit and Vegetable 
Division, AMS, U.S. Department of Agriculture, South Building, 
Washington, D.C. 20250; in any field office of the Fresh Fruit and 
Vegetable Inspection Service; or upon request of any authorized 
inspector of such service. Duplicates of the color standards may be

requirements for the grade or for any specified color classification, 
but which are not seriously damaged by dark discoloration of the skin: 
Provided, That these kernels meet the requirements for the grade other 
than for skin color.
    (3) For loose extraneous or foreign material, by weight. (i) 0.5 
percent (one-half of 1 percent).
    (b) U.S. No. 2--(1) For shell defects, by count. (i) 10 percent for 
pecans with damaged shells, including therein not more than 3 percent

<R05>
Sec. 51.1406  Sample for grade or size determination.

    Each sample shall consist of 100 pecans. The individual sample shall 
be drawn at random from a sufficient number of packages to form a 100-
count composite sample. The number of such individual 100-count samples 
drawn for grade or size determination will vary with the size of the 
lot. When practicable, at point of packaging the sample may be obtained 
from the grading belt after sorting has been completed.

                         Optional Determinations


<R05>
Sec. 51.1416  Optional determinations.

    The determinations set forth herein are not requirements of these 
standards. They may be performed upon request in connection with the 
grade determination or as a separate determination. Samples of pecans 
for these determinations shall be taken at random from a composite 
sample drawn throughout the lot.
    (a) Edible kernel content. A minimum sample of at least 500 grams of 
in-shell pecans shall be used for determination of edible kernel 
content. After the sample is weighed and shelled, edible appearing half 
kernels and pieces of kernels shall be separated from shells, center 
wall, and other non-kernel material, and inedible kernels (see 
Sec. 51.1415) and pieces of kernels, and weighed to determine edible 
kernel content for the lot.
    (b) Poorly developed kernel content. A minimum sample of at least 
500 grams of in-shell pecans shall be used for determination of poorly 
developed kernel content. The amount of poorly developed kernels and 
pieces of kernels shall be weighed to determine poorly developed kernel 
content of the lot (see Sec. 51.1411 and Figure 1).
    (c) Edible kernel content color classification. The amount of 
``Light,'' ``Light amber,'' ``Amber,'' ``Dark amber'' and darker shades 
of skin color shall be determined according to Sec. 51.1403, Kernel 
Color Classification. The total weight of edible kernels and pieces of 
kernels shall be the basis for determining color classification content 
for the lot.
    (d) Kernel moisture content. The sample of pecans for determination 
of kernel moisture content shall be shelled immediately before analysis 
and all shells, center wall and other non-kernel material removed. The 
air-oven or other methods or devices which give equivalent results shall 
be used for moisture content determination.

                         Tolerances for Defects


<R05>
Sec. 51.1439  Tolerances for defects.

    In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and 
handling in each of the foregoing grades, the following tolerances, by 
weight, are provided as specified:
    (a) U.S. No. 1 Halves, U.S. No. 1 Halves and Pieces, and U.S. No. 1 
Pieces grades:
    (1) 0.05 percent for shell, center wall, and foreign material;
    (2) 3 percent for portions of kernels which are ``dark amber'' or 
darker color, or darker than any specified lighter color classification 
but which are not otherwise defective; and,
    (3) 3 percent for portions of kernels which fail to meet the 
remaining requirements of the grade, including therein not more than 
0.50 percent for defects causing serious damage: Provided, That any 
unused portion of this tolerance may be applied to increase the 
tolerance for kernels which are ``dark amber'' or darker color, or 
darker than any specified lighter color classification.
    (b) U.S. Commercial Halves, U.S. Commercial Halves and Pieces, and 
U.S. Commercial Pieces grades:
    (1) 0.15 percent for shell, center wall, and foreign material;
    (2) 25 percent for portions of kernels which are ``dark amber'' or 
darker color, or darker than any specified lighter color classification, 
but which are not otherwise defective; and,
    (3) 8 percent for portions of kernels which fail to meet the 
remaining requirements of the grade, including

[[Page 443]]

therein not more than 1 percent for defects causing serious damage.

                        Application of Standards


<R05>
Sec. 51.1440  Application of standards.

    The grade of a lot of shelled pecans shall be determined on the 
basis of a composite sample drawn at random from containers in various 
locations in the lot. However, any identifiable container or number of 
containers in which the pecans are obviously of a quality or size 
materially different from that in the majority of containers, shall be 
considered as a separate lot, and shall be sampled and graded 
separately.

                               Definitions


<R05>
Sec. 51.1441  Half-kernel.

    Half-kernel means one of the separated halves of an entire pecan 
kernel with not more than one-eighth of its original volume missing, 
exclusive of the portion which formerly connected the two halves of the 
kernel.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1442  Piece.

    Piece means a portion of a kernel which is less than seven-eighths 
of a half-kernel, but which will not pass through a round opening two-
sixteenths inch in diameter.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1443  Particles and dust.

    Particles and dust means, for all size designations except ``midget 
pieces'' and ``granules,'' fragments of kernels which will pass through 
a round opening two-sixteenths inch in diameter.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1444  Well dried.

    Well dried means that the portion of kernel is firm and crisp, not 
pliable or leathery.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1445  Fairly well developed.

    Fairly well developed means that the kernel has at least a moderate 
amount of meat in proportion to its width and length. (See Figure 1.)


<R05>
Sec. 51.1446  Poorly developed.

    Poorly developed means that the kernel has a small amount of meat in 
proportion to its width and length. (See Figure 1.)


<R05>
Sec. 51.1447  Fairly uniform in color.

    Fairly uniform in color means that 90 percent or more of the kernels 
in the lot have skin color within the range of one or two color 
classifications.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1448  Fairly uniform in size.

    Fairly uniform in size means that, in a representative sample of 100 
halves, the 10 smallest halves weigh not less than one-half as much as 
the 10 largest halves.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1449  Damage.

    Damage means any specific defect described in this section; or an 
equally objectionable variation of any one of these defects, or any 
other defect, or any combination of defects, which materially detracts 
from the appearance or the edible or marketing quality of the individual 
portion of the kernel or of the lot as a whole. The following defects 
should be considered as damage:
    (a) Adhering material from inside the shell when attached to more 
than one-fourth of the surface on one side of the half-kernel or piece;
    (b) Dust or dirt adhering to the kernel when conspicuous;
    (c) Kernel which is not well dried;
    (d) Kernel which is ``dark amber'' or darker color;
    (e) Kernel having more than one dark kernel spot, or one dark kernel 
spot more than one-eighth inch in greatest dimension;
    (f) Shriveling when the surface of the kernel is very conspicuously 
wrinkled;
    (g) Internal flesh discoloration of a medium shade of gray or brown 
extending more than one-fourth the length of the half-kernel or piece, 
or lesser areas of dark discoloration affecting the appearance to an 
equal or greater extent; and,
    (h) Poorly developed kernel. (See Figure 1.)


<R05>
Sec. 51.1450  Serious damage.

    Serious damage means any specific defect described in this section; 
or an equally objectionable variation of any one of these defects, or 
any other defect, or any combination of defects, which seriously 
detracts from the appearance or the edible or marketing quality of the 
individual portion of

[[Page 444]]

kernel or of the lot as a whole. The following defects shall be 
considered as serious damage:
    (a) Any plainly visible mold;
    (b) Rancidity when the kernel is distinctly rancid to the taste. 
Staleness of flavor shall not be classed as rancidity;
    (c) Decay affecting any portion of the kernel;
    (d) Insects, web, or frass or any distinct evidence of insect 
feeding on the kernel;
    (e) Internal discoloration which is dark gray, dark brown, or black 
and extends more than one-third the length of the half-kernel or piece;
    (f) Adhering material from inside the shell when attached to more 
than one-half of the surface on one side of the half-kernel or piece;
    (g) Dark kernel spots when more than three are on the kernel, or 
when any dark kernel spot or the aggregate of two or more spots affect 
an area of more than 10 percent of the surface of the half-kernel or 
piece;
    (h) Dark skin discoloration, darker than ``dark brown,'' when 
covering more than one-fourth of the surface of the half-kernel or 
piece; and,
    (i) Undeveloped kernel. (See Figure 1.)

Sec. 51.1526  Application of tolerances.

    The contents of individual packages in the lot, based on sample 
inspection, are subject to the following limitations:
    (a) A package may contain not more than double any specified 
tolerance except that at least two defective and two off-size specimens 
may be permitted in any package: Provided, That the averages for the 
entire lot are

[[Page 447]]

within the tolerances specified for the grade.

                              Standard Pack


<R05>
Sec. 51.1527  Standard pack.

    (a) Packing. (1) All packages shall be tightly packed or well 
filled, according to the approved and recognized methods.
    (2) The plums or prunes in the top layer of any package shall be 
reasonably representative in quality and size of those in the remainder 
of the package.
    (3) Four-basket crates. Four-basket crates shall not be packed more 
than three layers deep.
    (i) The arrangement of the bottom layer shall be one row less one 
way, and may be one row less each way than the arrangement of the top 
layer; the arrangement of the middle layer may be the same as the top 
layer, or may be one row less one way than the arrangement of the top 
layer.
    (ii) In the 3\1/2\--4x5 and 3\1/2\--4x4 packs the face of each half 
of the crate shall be packed as a unit, with no shim between the two 
baskets.
    (b) Marking. (1) The size of plums or prunes shall be marked on each 
package, and shall be indicated in terms of minimum diameter, or number 
of fruit per package, or in accordance with the arrangement of the top 
layer of fruit in the package or subcontainer, or in terms of the four-
basket crate designation for fruit of equivalent sizes. Size may also be 
shown in terms of maximum number of fruit for a specified weight, such 
as ``8 per pound,'' ``6.4 per pound'' or ``7\2/3\ per pound.''
    (i) Four-basket crates. The size of plums packed in four-basket 
crates shall be indicated in accordance with the arrangement in the top 
layer of the baskets, as follows: 6x6, 5x5, or 4x4 (square packs); 5x6, 
4x5, or 3x4 (offset packs); 3\1/2\--4x5, 3--4x5, 3\1/2\--4x4, or 3--4x4 
(diagonal packs).
    (ii) California peach boxes, lug boxes and small consumer packages. 
In layer-packed California peach boxes or lug boxes, and in small 
consumer packages, the count of the entire contents shall be marked on 
the package. The number of plums or prunes in California peach boxes or 
lug boxes shall not vary more than 4 from the number indicated on the 
package.
    (iii) Face and fill packs in cartons and lug boxes. In face and fill 
packs in cartons and lug boxes the number of rows in the face shall be 
marked on the package, as ``6 row'', ``8 row'', etc.
    (c) Sizing. (1) Not more than 5 percent, by count, of the plums or 
prunes in any package may vary more than one-fourth inch in diameter.
    (2) When size is indicated in terms of minimum diameter, not more 
than 5 percent, by count, of the fruit in any package may be smaller 
than the size marked.
    (d) Tolerance for standard pack. In order to allow for variations 
incident to proper sizing and packing, not more than 10 percent, by 
count, of the packages in any lot may fail to meet the requirements for 
standard pack.

    (b) For off-size. (1) Not more than 3 percent of the potatoes in any 
lot may be smaller than the required or specified minimum size except 
that a tolerance of 5 percent shall be allowed for potatoes packed to 
meet a minimum size of 2\1/4\ inches or larger in diameter or 5 ounces 
or more in weight. In addition, not more than 10 percent may be larger 
than any required or specified maximum size. See Sec. 51.1547.
    (2) When a percentage of the potatoes is specified to be of a 
certain size and larger, individual samples shall have not less than

    Individual samples shall have not more than double the tolerances 
specified, except that at least one defective and one off-size potato 
may be permitted in any sample: Provided, That en route or at 
destination one-tenth of the samples may contain three times the 
tolerance permitted for potatoes which are frozen or affected by soft 
rot or wet breakdown: And provided further, That the averages for the 
entire lot are within the tolerances specified for the grade.

                Samples for Grade and Size Determination


<R05>
Sec. 51.1548  Samples for grade and size determination.

    Individual samples shall consist of at least 20 pounds. When 
individual packages contain at least 20 pounds, each individual sample 
is drawn from one package; when packages contain less than 20 pounds, a 
sufficient number of adjoining packages are opened to provide at least a 
20-pound sample. The number of such individual samples drawn for grade 
and size determination will vary with the size of the lot.

                                 Grades


<R05>
Sec. 51.1575  U.S. Grade A Small; U.S. Grade A Medium; U.S. Grade A Medium to Large; U.S. Grade A Large.

    Potatoes of each of these grades shall be of one variety or similar 
varietal characteristics which are fairly well shaped, fairly clean, 
free from freezing injury, blackheart, late blight, and soft rot or wet 
breakdown, and from damage caused by sunburn, second growth, growth 
cracks, air cracks, hollowheart, internal discoloration, cuts, 
shriveling, sprouting, scab, dry rot, rhizoctonia, other diseases, 
wireworm, other insects, or mechanical or other means. Potatoes of these 
grades shall also be mature: Provided, That potatoes which are not 
mature and the outer skin loosens or ``feathers'' readily under the 
usual handling practices need not meet this requirement if they are firm 
and are further designated as ``Early'' in connection with the grade, as 
for example ``U.S. Grade A Medium-Early.'' Potatoes on the shown face 
shall be reasonably representative in size and quality of the contents 
of the containers. (See Sec. 51.5177.)
    (a) Tolerances. Incident to proper grading and handling, except for 
the tolerances for size, not more than a total of 5 percent, by weight, 
of the potatoes in any lot may fail to meet the requirements of the 
grade, including not more than 1 percent for potatoes affected by soft 
rot or wet breakdown. (See Sec. 51.1579.)

[[Page 456]]


<R05>
Sec. 51.1576  U.S. Grade B Small; U.S. Grade B Medium; U.S. Grade B Medium to Large; U.S. Grade B Large.

    Potatoes of each of these grades shall meet the requirements for 
U.S. Grade A Small; U.S. Grade A Medium; U.S. Grade A Medium to Large; 
and U.S. Grade A Large, except for the increased tolerance for defects 
specified below. (See Sec. 51.1577.)
    (a) Tolerances. Incident to proper grading and handling, except for 
the tolerance for size, not more than a total of 20 percent, by weight, 
of the potaotes in any lot may fail to meet the requirements of the 
grade, but not more than 5 percent shall be allowed for potatoes which 
are seriously damaged by any cause, including not more than 1 percent 
for potatoes affected by soft rot or wet breakdown. (See Sec. 51.1579.)

                                  Size


<R05>
Sec. 51.1577  Size range requirements.

    In addition to the quality requirements specified for the above 
grades, potatoes shall also meet the requirements for minimum and 
maximum diameter or weight, and the tolerances as specified for the 
various grades in the table appearing in this section. Potatoes 
specified as meeting one of the grades may be of any size within its 
size range requirements, except that it is not permissible to specify a 
lot as ``U.S. Grade A Medium to Large,'' or ``U.S. Grade B Medium to 
Large,'' unless more than 15 percent, by weight, of the potatoes are 
larger than the maxiumum size required for U.S. Grade A Medium, or U.S. 
Grade B Medium, respectively. For example, a lot of round or 
intermediate-shaped potatoes to be specified as ``U.S. Grade A Medium to 
Large'' must have more than 15 percent, by weight, of potatoes from 3 to 
4 inches in diameter.

                        Application of Tolerances


<R05>
Sec. 51.1579  Application of tolerances to individual containers.

    (a) Based on sample inspection, the contents of individual 
containers in the lot are subject to the following limitations: 
Provided, That the averages for the entire lot are within the tolerances 
specified for the grade:
    (1) When a tolerance is 10 percent or more, not more than one-tenth 
of the individual containers in any lot may contain more than one and 
one-half times the tolerance specified, except that at least one 
defective and one off-sized specimen may be permitted in a container.
    (2) When a tolerance is less than 10 percent, not more than one-
tenth of the individual containers in any lot may contain more than 
double the tolerance specified, but no package may contain more than 
four times the tolerance for soft rot or wet breakdown, except that at 
least one defective and one off-sized specimen may be permitted in a 
container.

[[Page 457]]

                               Definitions


<R05>
Sec. 51.1580  Fairly well shaped.

    Fairly well shaped means that the appearance of the individual 
potato or the general appearance of the potatoes in the container is not 
materially injured by pointed, dumbbell-shaped or otherwise ill-formed 
potatoes.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1581  Fairly clean.

    Fairly clean means that from the viewpoint of general appearance, 
the potatoes in the container are reasonably free from dirt or other 
foreign matter, and that individual potatoes are not materially caked 
with dirt or materially stained.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1582  Soft rot or wet breakdown.

    Soft rot or wet breakdown means any soft, mushy, or leaky condition 
of the tissue such as slimy soft rot, leak, or wet breakdown following 
freezing injury, scald, or other injury.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1583  Damage.

    Damage means any injury or defect which materially injures the 
edible or shipping quality, or the appearance of the individual potato 
or the general appearance of the potatoes in the container, or which 
cannot be removed without a loss of more than 5 percent of the total 
weight of the potato including peel covering defective area. Loss of 
outer skin (epidermis) shall not be considered as damage when the 
potatoes are designated as ``Early'' unless the skinned surface is 
materially affected by dark discoloration. Any one of the following 
defects, or any combination of defects, the seriousness of which exceeds 
the maximum allowed for any one defect, shall be considered as damage:
    (a) Second growth or growth cracks which have developed to such an 
extent as to materially injure the appearance of the individual potato 
or the general appearance of the potatoes in the container.
    (b) Air cracks which are deep, or shallow air cracks which 
materially injure the appearance of the individual potato or the general 
appearance of the potatoes in the container.
    (c) Shriveling, when the potato is more than moderately shriveled, 
spongy, or flabby.
    (d) Sprouting, when the sprouts are not dried and are more than one-
half inch long.
    (e) Surface scab which covers an area of more than 5 percent of the 
surface of the potato in the aggregate.
    (f) Pitted scab which affects the appearance of the potato to a 
greater extent than the amount of surface scab permitted or causes a 
loss of more than 5 percent of the total weight of the potato including 
peel covering defective area.
    (g) Rhizoctonia, when the general appearance of the potatoes in the 
container is materially injured or when individual potatoes are badly 
infected.
    (h) Wireworm, grass root or similar injury, when any hole on 
potatoes ranging in size from 6 to 8 ounces is longer than three-fourths 
inch, or when the aggregate length of all holes is more than one and 
one-fourth inches; smaller potatoes shall have lesser amounts and larger 
potatoes may have greater amounts, provided, that the removal of the 
injury by proper trimming does not cause the appearance of such potatoes 
to be injured to a greater extent than that caused by the proper 
trimming of such injury permitted on a 6 to 8 ounce potato.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1584  Internal discoloration.

    Internal discoloration means discoloration such as is caused by net 
necrosis or any other type of necrosis, stem-end browning, internal 
brown spot, or other similar types of discoloration not visible 
externally.

the edible or shipping quality, or the appearance of the individual 
potato or the general appearance of the potatoes in the container, or 
which cannot be removed without a loss of more than 10

[[Page 458]]

percent of the total weight of the potato including peel covering 
defective area. Any one of the following defects or any combination of 
defects the seriousness of which exceeds the maximum allowed for any one 
defect shall be considered as serious damage:
    (a) Fairly smooth cuts such as are made by the digger, or by a knife 
to remove injury when both ends are clipped, or when more than an 
estimated one-fourth of the potato is cut away, or, in the case of long 
varieties, when the remaining portion of the clipped potato weighs less 
than 6 ounces; irregular types of cuts which seriously affect the 
appearance of the individual potato, or which cannot be removed without 
a loss of more than 10 percent of the total weight of the potato 
including peel covering defective area.
    (b) Shriveling, when the potato is excessively shriveled, spongy, or 
flabby.
    (c) Surface scab which covers an area of more than 50 percent of the 
surface of the potato in the aggregate.
    (d) Pitted scab which affects the appearance of the potato to a 
greater extent than the amount of surface scab permitted or causes a 
loss of more than 10 percent of the total weight of the potato including 
peel covering defective area.
    (e) Wireworm, grass root or similar injury, when any hole on 
potatoes ranging in size from 6 to 8 ounces is longer than one and one-
fourth inches, or when the aggregate length of all holes is more than 
two inches; smaller potatoes shall have lesser amounts and larger 
potatoes may have greater amounts: Provided, That the removal of the

                    Size and Maturity Classification


<R05>
Sec. 51.1903  Size classification.

    The following terms may be used for describing the size of the 
tomatoes in any lot:

Over 6 to 10 oz., inc.....................  Over 10 oz.                 
                                                                        

    (a) The tomatoes may also be classed in terms of combinations of the 
above sizes, as ``Small to Medium,'' ``Medium to Large,'' ``Small to 
Very Large,'' etc., in accordance with the facts.
    (b) Incident to proper sizing, not more than 10 percent, by count, 
of the tomatoes in any lot may vary from the size specified.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1904  Maturity classification.

    Tomatoes which are characteristically red when ripe, but are not 
overripe or soft, may be classified for maturity as follows:
    (a) Turning, when at least some part of the surface of the tomato, 
but less than one-half of the surface in the aggregate, is covered with 
pink color.
    (b) Pink, when the tomato shows from one-half to three-fourths of 
the surface in the aggregate covered with pink or red color.
    (c) Hard ripe, when the tomato shows three-fourths or more of the 
surface in the aggregate covered with pink or red color.
    (d) Firm ripe, when the tomato shows three-fourths or more of the 
surface in the aggregate covered with red color characteristic of 
reasonably well ripened tomatoes.
    (e) Incident to proper maturity determination, not more than a total 
of 10 percent, by count, of the tomatoes in any lot may fail to meet the 
maturity specified: Provided, That not more than 5 percent shall be 
allowed for tomatoes which are immature or are overripe or soft.

                                Off-Grade


<R05>
Sec. 51.1905  Off-Grade tomatoes.

    Tomatoes which fail to meet the requirements of either of the 
foregoing grades shall be Off-Grade tomatoes.

                               Definitions


<R05>
Sec. 51.1906  Similar varietal characteristics.

    Similar varietal characteristics means that the tomatoes are alike 
as to color, i.e., bright red varieties shall not be mixed with 
varieties which have a purplish tinge.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1907  Mature.

    Mature means that the tomato has reached the stage of development 
which will insure a proper completion of the ripening process.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1908  Well developed.

    Well developed means that the tomato shows normal growth. Tomatoes 
which are ridged and peaked at the stem end, contain dry tissue and 
usually open spaces, are not considered well developed.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1909  Fairly well formed.

    Fairly well formed means that the tomato is not decidedly kidney-
shaped, lopsided, elongated, angular, or otherwise deformed.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1910  Fairly smooth.

    Fairly smooth means that the tomato is not conspicuously ridged or 
rough.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1911  Damaged.

    Damaged means any defect which materially affects the appearance, or 
edible, shipping or keeping quality of the tomatoes. Any one of the 
following defects or any combination thereof, the seriousness of which 
exceeds the maximum allowed for any one defect, shall be considered as 
damage:
    (a) Cuts which are not shallow, not well healed, or when more than 
\1/2\ inch in length.
    (b) Puffiness if the open space in one or more locules materially 
affects the appearance when the tomato is cut

[[Page 471]]

through the center at right angles to a line running from the stem to 
the blossom end.
    (c) Catfaces. These are irregular, dark, leathery scars at the 
blossom end of the fruit. Such scars damage the tomato when they are 
rough or deep, or when channels extend into the locule, or when they are 
fairly smooth and greater in area than a circle \3/8\ inch in diameter 
on a 2\1/2\ inch tomato. Smaller tomatoes shall have lesser areas of 
fairly smooth catfaces and larger tomatoes may have greater areas, 
provided that such catfaces do not affect the appearance of the tomatoes 
to a greater extent than that caused by fairly smooth catfaces which are 
permitted on a 2\1/2\ inch tomato.
    (d) Growth cracks. These are ruptures or cracks radiating from the 
stem scar, or concentric to the stem scar. They damage the tomato when 
not well healed, or when more than \1/2\ inch in length measured from 
the margin of the stem scar; except that very narrow, well healed cracks 
concentric to the stem scar shall not be considered as damage unless 
they are so numerous as to damage the appearance of the fruit.
    (e) Scars (except catfaces), when dark colored and shallow and 
aggregating more than \1/4\ inch in diameter on a tomato 2\1/2\ inches 
in diameter, or lighter colored shallow scars covering a greater area 
when they detract from the appearance to a greater extent than a dark-
colored, shallow scar \1/4\ inch in diameter. Smaller tomatoes shall 
have lesser areas of scars and larger tomatoes may have greater areas: 
Provided, That such scars do not affect the appearance of the tomatoes 
to a greater extent than that caused by scars which are permitted on a 
2\1/2\-inch tomato. A scar which penetrates the wall of the tomato shall 
be considered as damage.
    (f) Dry rot such as dry type Macrosporium or Phoma, when the spot is 
not adjacent to the stem scar, or when adjacent to the stem scar and 
more than \3/16\ inch in diameter.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1912  Badly misshapen.

    Badly misshapen means that the tomato is so badly deformed that its 
appearance is seriously affected.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1913  Serious damage.

    Serious damage means any defect which seriously affects the 
appearance, or edible, shipping, or keeping quality of the tomatoes. Any 
one of the following defects or any combination thereof, the seriousness 
of which exceeds the maximum allowed for any one defect, shall be 
considered as serious damage:
    (a) Soft ripe tomatoes or tomatoes affected by the soft rot.
    (b) Fresh holes or cuts, or any holes or cuts through the tomato 
wall, or healed cuts which seriously affect the appearance of the 
tomato.
    (c) Tomatoes showing any effects of freezing.
    (d) Puffiness which causes the tomato to be distinctly light in 
weight.
    (e) Growth cracks, when not well healed, or when so extensive, deep 
or discolored that the appearance of the tomato is seriously affected.
    (f) Scars (except catfaces), when dark colored and shallow and 
aggregating more than \1/2\ inch in diameter on a tomato 2\1/2\ inches 
in diameter, or lighter colored, shallow scars covering a greater area 
when they detract from the appearance to a greater extent than a 
darkcolored, shallow scar \1/2\ inch in diameter. Smaller tomatoes shall 
have lesser areas of scars and larger tomatoes may have greater areas: 
Provided, That such scars do not affect the appearance of the tomatoes 
to a greater extent than that caused by scars which are permitted on a 
2\1/2\-inch tomato.
    (g) Dry rot such as dry type Macrosporium or Phoma, when the spot is 
not adjacent to the stem scar, or when adjacent to the stem scar and 
more than \1/4\ inch in diameter.
    (h) Fruit actually infested with worms.

                        Application of Standards


<R05>
Sec. 51.1996  Application of standards.

    (a) The grade of a lot of filberts shall be determined on the basis 
of a composite sample drawn from containers in various locations in the 
lot. However, any container or group of cantainers in which the filberts 
are obviously of a quality, type or size materially different from that 
in the majority of containers shall be considered a separate lot, and 
shall be sampled separately.
    (b) In grading the sample, each filbert shall be examined for 
defects of the shell before being cracked for kernel examination. A 
filbert shall be classed as only one defective nut even though it may be 
defective externally and internally.

                               Definitions


<R05>
Sec. 51.1997  Similar type.

    Similar type means that the filberts in each container are of the 
same general type and appearance. For example, nuts of the round type 
shall not be mixed with those of the long type in the same container.


<R05>
Sec. 51.1998  Dry.

    Dry means that the shell is free from surface moisture, and that the 
shells and kernels combined do not contain more than 10 percent 
moisture.

    Damage means any specific defect described in this section; or an 
equally objectionable variation of any one of these defects, any other 
defect, or any combination of defects which materially detracts from the 
appearance, or the edible or marketing quality of the filberts. The 
following specific defects shall be considered as damage:
    (a) Stains which are dark and materially affect the appearance of 
the individual shell.
    (b) Adhering husk when covering more than 5 percent of the surface 
of the shell in the aggregate.

material. The shells are clean, fairly bright, fairly uniform color, and 
free from damage caused by discoloration, adhering hulls, broken shells 
or other means. The kernels are well dried, free from decay, rancidity, 
and free from damage caused by insects, mold, gum, skin discoloration, 
shriveling, brown spot or other means.
    (a) Unless otherwise specified, the almonds are of a size not less 
than \28/64\ of an inch (11.1 mm) in thickness.
    (b) In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and 
handling, the following tolerances are provided as specified:
    (1) For external (shell) defects. 10 percent, by count, for almonds 
which fail

[[Page 474]]

to meet the requirements of this grade other than for variety and size;
    (2) For dissimilar varieties. 5 percent, by count, including therein 
not more than 1 percent for bitter almonds mixed with sweet almonds;
    (3) For size. 5 percent, by count, for almonds which are smaller 
than the specified minimum thickness;
    (4) For loose extraneous and foreign material. 2 percent, by weight, 
including therein not more than 1 percent which can pass through a round 
opening \24/64\ inch (9.5 mm) in diameter: Provided, that such material 
is practically free from insect infestation; and,
    (5) For internal (kernel) defects. 10 percent, by count, for almonds 
with kernels failing to meet the requirements of this grade: Provided, 
that not more than one-half of this tolerance or 5 percent shall be 
allowed for kernels affected by decay or rancidity, damaged by insects 
or mold or seriously damaged by shriveling: And provided further, that

throughout the lot.

                         Determination of Grade


<R05>
Sec. 51.2080  Determination of grade.

    In grading the inspection sample, the percentage of loose hulls, 
pieces of shell, chaff and foreign material is determined on the basis 
of weight. Next, the percentages of nuts which are of dissimilar 
varieties, undersize or have adhering hulls or defective shells are 
determined by count, using an adequate portion of the total sample. 
Finally, the nuts in that portion of the sample are cracked, and the 
percentage having internal defects is determined on the basis of count.

                               Definitions


<R05>
Sec. 51.2081  Similar varietal characteristics.

    Similar varietal characteristics means that the almonds are similar 
in shape, and are reasonably uniform in degree of hardness of the 
shells, and that bitter almonds are not mixed with sweet almonds. For 
example, hard-shelled varieties, semi-soft shelled varieties, soft-
shelled varieties and paper-shelled varieties are not mixed together, 
nor are any two of these types mixed under this definition.


<R05>
Sec. 51.2082  Loose extraneous and foreign material.

    Loose extraneous and foreign material means loose hulls, empty 
broken shells, pieces of shells, external insect infestation and any 
substance other than almonds in the shell or almond kernels.

    Clean means that the shell is practically free from dirt and other 
adhering foreign material.


<R05>
Sec. 51.2084  Fairly bright.

    Fairly bright means that the shells show good characteristic color.


<R05>
Sec. 51.2085  Fairly uniform color.

    Fairly uniform color means that the shells do not show excessive 
variation in color, whether bleached or natural.

    Well dried means that the kernel is firm and brittle, not pliable or 
leathery.


<R05>
Sec. 51.2087  Decay.

    Decay means that part or all of the kernel has become decomposed.


<R05>
Sec. 51.2088  Rancidity.

    Rancidity means that the kernel is noticeably rancid to taste.


<R05>
Sec. 51.2089  Damage.

    Damage means any defect which materially detracts from the 
appearance of the individual kernel, or the edible or shipping quality 
of the almond. Any one of the following defects or combination thereof, 
the seriousness of which exceeds the maximum allowed for any one defect 
shall be considered as damage:
    (a) Discoloration of the shell which is medium gray to black and 
affects more than one-eighth of the surface in the aggregate. Normal 
variations of a reddish or brownish color shall not be considered 
discoloration;
    (b) Adhering hulls which cover more than 5 percent of the shell 
surface in the aggregate;

    The size may be specified in terms of range in count of whole almond 
kernels per ounce or in terms of minimum, or minimum and maximum 
diameter. When a range in count is specified, the whole kernels shall be 
fairly uniform in size, and the average count per ounce shall be within 
the range specified. Doubles and broken kernels shall not be used in 
determining counts. Count ranges per ounce commonly used are shown 
below, but other ranges may be specified: Provided, that the kernels are 
fairly uniform in size.

16 to 18, inclusive.
18 to 20, inclusive.
20 to 22, inclusive.

specified.

                        Application of Tolerances


<R05>
Sec. 51.2115   Application of tolerances.

    The tolerances for the grades are to be applied to the entire lot,

<R05>
Sec. 51.2116   Similar varietal characteristics.

    Similar varietal characteristics means that the kernels are similar 
in shape and appearance. For example, long types shall not be mixed with 
short types, or broad types mixed with narrow types, and bitter almonds 
shall not be mixed with sweet almonds. Color of the kernels shall not be 
considered, since there is often a marked difference in skin color of 
kernels of the same variety.
    (a) When a lot is specified as ``one type,'' all kernels shall be 
the same in shape and appearance; and,
    (b) When a lot is specified and carton marked as ``California,'' 
kernels present may include any one or a combination of blanchable 
varieties within the ``California'' Marketing Classification. In 
addition, Nonpareil or similar types may be included provided that it 
does not exceed twenty-five percent (25%), by weight, of the lot.

individual kernel aggregates more than the equivalent of a circle one-
eighth inch (3.2 mm) in diameter.


<R05>
Sec. 51.2128  Damage.

    Damage means any defect which materially detracts from the 
appearance of the individual kernel, or the edible or shipping quality 
of the almonds. Any one of the following defects or combination thereof, 
the seriousness of which exceeds the maximum allowed for any one defect 
shall be considered as damage:
    (a) Chipped and scratched kernels, when the affected area on an 
individual kernel aggregates more than the equivalent of a circle one-
quarter inch (6.4 mm) in diameter;
    (b) Mold, when visible on the kernel, except when white or gray and 
easily rubbed off with the fingers;
    (c) Gum, when a film of shiny, resinous appearing substance affects

Sec. 51.2131  Fairly uniform in size.

    Fairly uniform in size means that, in a representative sample, the 
weight of 10 percent, by count, of the largest whole kernels shall not 
exceed 1.70 times the weight of 10 percent, by count, of the smallest 
whole kernels.

<R05>
Sec. 51.2284  Size classification.

    The following classifications are provided to describe the size of 
any lot: ``Halves'', ``Pieces and Halves'', ``Pieces'' or ``Small 
Pieces''. The size of portions of kernels in the lot shall conform to 
the requirements of the specified classification as defined below:
    (a) Halves. Lot consists of 85 percent or more, by weight, half 
kernels, and the remainder three-fourths half kernels. (See 
Sec. 51.2285.)
    (b) Pieces and halves. Lot consists of 20 percent or more, by 
weight, half kernels, and the remainder portions of kernels that cannot 
pass through a sieve with \24/64\ inch round openings. When a lot 
exceeds this minimum requirement, the actual percentage of halves may be 
specified. (See Sec. 51.2285.)
    (c) Pieces. Lot consists of portions of kernels that cannot pass 
through a sieve with \24/64\ inch round openings. (See Sec. 51.2285.)

[[Page 482]]

    (d) Small pieces. Lot consists of portions of kernels that pass 
through a sieve with \24/64\ inch round openings, but that cannot pass 
through a sieve with \8/64\ inch round openings. When desired, the 
actual size ranges within such size ranges may be specified. (See 
Sec. 51.2285.)

Sec. 51.2543  Application of tolerances.

    The tolerances for the grades apply to the entire lot and shall be 
based on a composite sample drawn from containers throughout the lot. 
Any container or group of containers which have nuts obviously different 
in quality or size from those in the majority of containers shall be 
considered a separate lot and shall be sampled separately.


<R05>
Sec. 51.2544  Size.

    Nuts may be considered as meeting a size designation specified in 
Table IV or a range in number of nuts per ounce, provided, the weight of 
10 percent, by count, of the largest nuts in a sample does not exceed 
1.70 times the weight of 10 percent, by count, of the smallest and the 
average number of nuts per ounce is not more than one-half nut above or 
below the extremes of the range specified.

<R05>
Sec. 51.2947  Method of inspection.

    In determining the grade of a lot of walnuts, all of the nuts in the 
sample first should be graded for size and then examined for external 
defects. The same nuts then should be cracked and examined for internal 
defects. The nuts must meet the requirements for both external and 
internal quality in order to meet a designated grade.

                        Application of Tolerances


<R05>
Sec. 51.2955  Application of tolerances.

    The tolerances provided in these standards are on a lot basis, and 
they shall be applied to a composite sample representative of the lot. 
However, any identifiable container or group of containers in which the 
walnuts are obviously of a quality materially different from that in the 
majority of the containers shall be considered as a separate lot, and 
shall be sampled separately.

                               Definitions


<R05>
Sec. 51.2956  Practically clean.

    Practically clean means that, from the viewpoint of general 
appearance, the walnuts are practically free from adhering dirt or other 
foreign matter, and that individual walnuts are not damaged by such 
means. A slightly chalky deposit on the shell is characteristic of many 
bleached nuts and shall not be considered as dirt or foreign matter.


<R05>
Sec. 51.2957  Bright.

    Bright means a fairly light, attractive appearance. A slight chalky 
deposit on the shell shall not be considered as affecting brightness.


<R05>
Sec. 51.2958  Splits.

    Splits means walnuts with the seam opened completely around the nut 
so that the two halves of the shell are held together only by the 
kernel.


<R05>
Sec. 51.2959  Injury by discoloration.

    Injury by discoloration means that the color of the affected portion 
of the shell objectionably contrasts with the color of the rest of the 
shell of the individual nut.


<R05>
Sec. 51.2960  Damage.

    Damage means any specific defect mentioned in this section; or any 
equally objectionable variation of any one of these defects, any other 
defect, or any combination of defects which materially detracts from the 
appearance or the edible or shipping quality of the individual walnut or 
the lot as a whole. The following specific defects shall be considered 
as damage:

[[Page 511]]

    (a) Broken shells when the area from which a portion of the shell is 
missing is greater than the area of a circle one-fourth inch in 
diameter; or when the two halves of the shell have become completely 
broken apart and separated from each other;
    (b) Perforated shells when the area affected aggregates more than 
that of a circle one-fourth inch in diameter. The term ``perforated 
shells'' means imperfectly developed areas on the shell resembling 
abrasions and usually including small holes penetrating the shell wall;
    (c) Adhering hulls when affecting more than 5 percent of the shell 
surface;
    (d) Discoloration (or stain) which covers, in the aggregate, one-
fifth or more of the surface of the shell of an individual nut, and

the lot is not seriously damaged by adhering dirt or other foreign 
matter, and that individual walnuts are not coated or caked with dirt or 
foreign matter. Both the amount of surface affected and the color of the 
dirt shall be taken into consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 51.2966  Serious damage.

    Serious damage means any specific defect mentioned in this section; 
or an equally objectionable variation of any one of these defects, any 
other defect, or any combination of defects which seriously detracts

when both halves are affected over a greater area by lesser degrees of 
shriveling producing an equally objectionable appearance. When one of 
the halves of the kernel shows no shriveling, the kernel shall not be 
considered seriously damaged unless the other half shows shriveling to 
the extent that over 50 percent of its surface is severely shriveled, or 
a greater area is affected by lesser degrees of shriveling producing an 
equally objectionable appearance. Kernels which are thin in cross 
section, but which are otherwise normally developed shall not be 
considered as damaged;
    (e) Rancidity or decay; and,
    (f) Uncured kernels which are wet, rubbery and ``green''.

weight, are provided as specified:
    (a) For defects:
    (1) U.S. No. 1 and U.S. No. 2 grades. Not more than 10 percent of 
the onions in a lot may fail to meet the requirements of these grades, 
but not more than one-fifth of this tolerance, or 2 percent, may be 
allowed for onions which are affected by decay or wet sunscald.
    (2) U.S. Combination grade. When applying the foregoing tolerances 
to this grade no part of any tolerance shall be allowed to reduce, for 
the lot as a whole, the 50 percent of onions of the U.S. No. 1 grade, 
but individual containers shall have not less than 40 percent of the 
U.S. No. 1 grade.
    (b) For size:
    (1) Not more than 5 percent of the onions in a lot may be smaller 
than the minimum diameter specified. In addition, not more than 10 
percent of the onions in a lot may be larger than the maximum diameter 
specified.
    (2) When a percentage of the onions is specified to be a certain 
size and larger, individual packages containing more than 10 pounds may 
have not less than one-half of the percentage specified: Provided, that 
the entire lot averages within the percentage specified.

                Samples for Grade and Size Determination


<R05>
Sec. 51.3200  Samples for grade and size determination.

    Individual samples shall consist of at least 20 pounds for onions 
packed to meet larger than 2\1/4\ inches maximum diameter. When 
individual packages contain 20 pounds or more and the onions are packed 
for Large or Jumbo size or larger the package shall be the sample. When 
individual packages contain less than 20 pounds, a sufficient number of 
adjoining packages are opened to provide at least a 20 pound sample, 
except that for onions packed to meet 2\1/4\ inches maximum diameter or 
smaller, the sample may consist of either 20 pounds or the individual 
package.

                        Application of Tolerances


<R05>
Sec. 51.3201  Application of tolerances.

    Individual samples are subject to the following limitations:
    (a) Samples which contain more than 20 pounds shall have not more 
than one and one half times a specified tolerance of 10 percent or more, 
and not more than double a specified tolerance of less than 10 percent, 
except that at least one defective and one off-size onion may be 
permitted in any sample: Provided, that en-route or at destination when 
onions in containers of 50 pounds or more are packed to a minimum size 
of 3 inches or larger not more than three onions or more than 4 percent 
(whichever is the larger amount) may be affected by decay or wet 
sunscald: And provided further, that the averages for the entire lot are 
within the tolerances specified for the grade; and,
    (b) Samples which contain 20 pounds or less shall have not more than 
double the tolerance specified, except that at least one defective and 
one off-size onion may be permitted in any sample: Provided, that the 
averages for the entire lot are within the tolerances specified for the 
grade.

therein not more than 2 percent for potatoes which are frozen or 
affected by soft rot or wet breakdown.
    (2) U.S. No. 2 Processing. 10 percent for potatoes which fail to 
meet the requirements of this grade including not more than one-half of 
this tolerance, or 5 percent, for potatoes which are seriously damaged 
by internal defects occurring entirely within the vascular ring, 
including therein not more than 2 percent for potatoes which are frozen 
or affected by soft rot or wet breakdown.
    (b) For loose sprouts, dirt and foreign material: 2 percent.

Sec. 51.3417  Optional test for specific gravity.

    Tests to determine specific gravity shall be made in accordance with 
the procedures set forth in this section.
    (a) The potatoes used for such determinations shall be:
    (1) Taken at random from a composite sample drawn from containers 
representative of the lot.
    (2) A comparable sample from a bulk load or storage bin.
    (3) From a portion of the divided sample initially drawn or 
submitted for determination of grade or contract compliance.
    (4) Representative of the lot with respect to size and quality.

The specific gravity for any lot of potatoes shall be the average of at 
least 3 corrected readings on separate tests from the composite sample. 
Specific gravity may also be determined, if requested, in accordance 
with size classifications or weighted value in proportion to size and/or 
grade separations in the lot.
    (b) Specific gravity shall be determined by either;
    (1) Calculation from the weights of the sample in air and in water 
made with USDA approved equipment. The reading obtained from each test 
shall be corrected for temperature variations using Table I.
    (2) A hydrometer specifically designed for determining the specific 
gravity of potatoes.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


    \3\ The hydrometer is available from the Potato Chip/Snack Food 
Association, Crystal Square-3, Suite 903, 1735 Jefferson Davis Highway, 
Arlington, VA 22202.

The pulp temperature of the potatoes and the temperature of water shall 
be recorded immediately before testing and the specific gravity reading 
corrected using Table I.

<R05>
Sec. 51.3744  Tolerances.

    In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and 
handling in each of the foregoing grades, the following tolerances, by 
count, are provided as specified:
    (a) U.S. No. 1. 10 percent for melons in any lot which fail to meet 
the requirements of the grade: Provided, That not more than one-half of 
this amount, or 5 percent, shall be allowed for defects causing serious 
damage, including in this latter amount not more than 1 percent for 
melons affected by decay.
    (b) U.S. Commercial. 20 percent for melons in any lot which fail to 
meet the requirements of this grade: Provided, That not more than one-
fourth of this amount, or 5 percent, shall be allowed for defects 
causing serious damage, including in this latter amount not more than 1 
percent for melons affected by decay.
    (c) U.S. No. 2. 10 percent for melons in any lot which fail to meet 
the requirements of this grade including not more than 1 percent for 
melons affected by decay.

                        Application of Tolerances


<R05>
Sec. 51.3745  Application of tolerances.

    The contents of individual packages in the lot, based on sample 
inspection, are subject to the following limitations:
    (a) For a tolerance of 10 percent or more, individual packages shall 
have not more than 1\1/2\ times the tolerance specified: Provided, That 
when the package contains 15 specimens or less, any individual package 
shall have not more than double the tolerance specified, except that at 
least one defective specimen may be permitted in any package: And 
provided further, That the averages for the entire lot are within the 
tolerances specified for the grade.
    (b) For a tolerance of less than 10 percent, individual packages in 
any lot shall have not more than double the tolerance specified, except 
that at least one defective specimen may be permitted in any package: 
Provided, That the averages for the entire lot are within the tolerances 
specified for the grade.

                               Definitions


<R05>

    Mature means that the melon has reached the stage of maturity which 
will insure the proper completion of the normal ripening process.


<R05>
Sec. 51.3747  Well formed.

    Well formed means that the melon has the normal shape characteristic 
of the variety.


<R05>
Sec. 51.3748  Damage.

    Damage means any specific defect described in this section; or an 
equally objectionable variation of any one of these defects, any other 
defect, or any combination of defects, which materially detracts from 
the appearance, or the edible or marketing quality of the melon.
    (a) The following specific defects shall be considered as damage:
    (1) Sunburn which causes the rind to become brownish in color, hard, 
tough, or thin; and,
    (2) Bruising when the size or color of the affected area materially 
detracts from the appearance.
    (b) The following blemishes shall not be considered as damage:
    (1) Slight bruising caused by light pressure of the weight of other 
melons or from lidding of the crate;

[[Page 531]]

    (2) Yellow spots;
    (3) Superficial hail spots;
    (4) Slight surface scratches caused by picking or packing; or,
    (5) Netting, either raised or occurring as very shallow cracks in 
the skin.

Sec. 52.12  Disposition of inspected sample.

    Any sample of a processed product that has been used for inspection 
may be returned to the applicant, at his request and expense; otherwise 
it shall be destroyed, or disposed of to a charitable institution.


<R05>
Sec. 52.13  Basis of inspection and grade or compliance determination.

    (a) Inspection service shall be performed on the basis of the 
appropriate United States standards for grades of processed products, 
Federal, Military, Veterans Administration or other government agency 
specifications, written contract specifications, or any written 
specification or instruction which is approved by the Administrator.
    (b) Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, compliance with 
such grade standards, specifications, or instructions shall be 
determined by evaluating the product, or sample, in accordance with the 
requirements of such standards, specifications or instructions: 
Provided, That when inspection for quality is based on any U.S. grade 
standard which contains a scoring system, the grade to be assigned to a 
lot

[[Page 539]]

is the grade indicated by the average of the total of the scores of the 
respective sample units: Provided further, That--
    (1) Such sample complies with the applicable standards of quality 
promulgated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act;
    (2) Such sample complies with the product description;
    (3) Such sample meets the indicated grade with respect to factors of 
quality which are not rated by score points; and
    (4) With respect to those factors of quality which are rated by 
score points, each of the following requirements is met:
    (i) None of the sample units falls more than one grade below the 
indicated grade because of any quality factor to which a limiting rule 
applies;
    (ii) None of the sample units falls more than 4 score points below 
the minimum total score for the indicated grade;
    (iii) The number of deviants does not exceed the applicable 
acceptance number indicated in the sampling plans contained in 
Sec. 52.38 (``deviants'', as used in this paragraph, means sample units 
that fall into the next grade below the indicated grade but do not score 
more than 4 points below the minimum total score for the indicated 
grade);
    (5) If any of the provisions contained in paragraphs (b) (3) and (4) 
of this section are not met, the grade is determined by considering such 
provisions in connection with succeedingly lower grades until the grade 
of the lot, if assignable, is established; and
    (6) When it is determined that a portion of a lot bearing a 
particular identification mark is of lower quality or deficient in other 
factors, the grade or compliance of the lot shall be no higher than that 
of the portion bearing the particular identification mark.

Sec. 52.14  Order of inspection service.

    Inspection service shall be performed, insofar as practicable, in 
the order in which applications therefor are made except that precedence 
may be given to any such applications which are made by the United 
States (including, but not being limited to, any instrumentality or 
agency thereof) and to any application for an appeal inspection.


<R05>
Sec. 52.15  Postponing inspection service.

    If the inspector determines that it is not possible to accurately 
ascertain the quality or condition of a processed product immediately 
after processing because the product has not reached equilibrium in 
color, sirup density, or drained weight, or for any other substantial 
reason, he may postpone inspection service for such period as may be 
necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 52.16  Financial interest of inspector.

    No inspector shall inspect any processed product in which he is 
directly or indirectly financially interested.


<R05>
Sec. 52.17  Forms of certificates.

power of attorney by the inspector who performed the inspection and 
authorized by the Administrator to affix the inspector's signature to an 
inspection certificate.
    (3) An inspector designated as the ``inspector in charge,'' when the 
certificate represents composite inspection of several persons.

In all cases the inspection certificate shall be prepared in accordance 
with the facts set forth in the official memoranda made by the inspector 
or inspectors in connection with the inspection. Whenever a certificate 
is signed by a person under a power of attorney the certificate should 
so indicate. The signature of the holder of the power shall appear under 
the name of the inspector who personally inspected the product, and 
whenever a certificate

[[Page 540]]

issued is signed by an inspector in charge that title must appear in 
connection with the signature.
    (b) A certificate of loading shall be issued and signed by the 
inspector or licensed sampler authorized to check the loading of a 
specific lot of processed products: Provided, That, another employee of 
the inspection service may sign such certificate of loading covering any 
processed product checkloaded by an inspector or licensed sampler when 
given power of attorney by such inspector or licensed sampler and 
authorized by the Administrator to affix the inspector's or licensed 
sampler's signature to a certificate of loading which has been prepared 
in accordance with the facts set forth in the notes made by the 
inspector or licensed sampler in connection with the checkloading of a 
specific lot of processed products.

Sec. 52.19  Issuance of corrected certificates.

    A corrected inspection certificate may be issued by the inspector 
who issued the original certificate after distribution of a certificate 
if errors, such as incorrect dates, code marks, grade statements, lot or 
car numbers, container sizes, net or drained weights, quantities, or 
errors in any other pertinent information require the issuance of a 
corrected certificate. Whenever a corrected certificate is issued, such 
certificate shall supersede the inspection certificate which was issued 
in error and the superseded certificate shall become null and void after 
the issuance of the corrected certificate.


<R05>
Sec. 52.20  Issuance of an inspection report in lieu of an inspection certificate.

    A letter report in lieu of an inspection certificate may be issued

<R05>
Sec. 52.26  When appeal inspection may be refused.

    An application for an appeal inspection may be refused if:
    (a) The reasons for the appeal inspection are frivolous or not 
substantial;
    (b) The quality or condition of the processed product has undergone 
a material change since the inspection covering the processed product on 
which the appeal inspection is requested;
    (c) The lot in question is not, or cannot be made accessible for the 
selection of officially drawn samples;
    (d) The lot relative to which appeal inspection is requested cannot 
be positively identified by the inspector as the lot from which 
officially drawn samples were previously inspected; or
    (e) There is noncompliance with the regulations in this part. Such 
applicant shall be notified promptly of the reason for such refusal.


<R05>
Sec. 52.27  Who shall perform appeal inspection.

    An appeal inspection shall be performed by an inspector or 
inspectors (other than the one from whose inspection the appeal is 
requested) authorized for this purpose by the Administrator and, 
whenever practical, such appeal inspection shall be conducted jointly by 
two such inspectors: Provided, That, the inspector who made the 
inspection on which the appeal is requested may be authorized to draw 
the samples when another inspector or licensed sampler is not available 
in the area where the product is located.


<R05>
Sec. 52.28  Appeal inspection certificate.

    After an appeal inspection has been completed, the lot(s) cannot be 
further appealed unless authorized by the Administrator. An appeal 
inspection certificate shall be issued, showing the results of such 
appeal inspection; and such certificate shall supersede the inspection 
certificate previously issued for the processed product involved. Each 
appeal inspection certificate shall clearly identify the number and date 
of the inspection certificate which it supersedes. The superseded 
certificate shall become null and void upon the issuance of the appeal 
inspection certificate and shall no longer represent the quality or 
condition of the processed product described therein. The inspector or 
inspectors issuing an appeal inspection certificate shall forward notice 
of such issuance to such persons as he considers necessary to prevent 
misuse of the superseded certificate if the original and all copies of 
such superseded certificate have not previously been delivered to the 
inspector or inspectors issuing the appeal inspection certificate. The 
provisions in the regulations in this part concerning forms and 
certificates, issuance of certificates, and disposition of certificates 
shall apply to appeal inspection certificates, except that copies of 
such appeal inspection certificates shall be furnished to all interested 
parties who received copies of the superseded certificate.

<R05>
Sec. 52.29  Who may become licensed sampler.

    Any person deemed to have the necessary qualifications may be 
licensed as a licensed sampler to draw samples for the purpose of 
inspection under the regulations in this part. Such a license shall bear 
the printed signature of the Secretary, and shall be countersigned by an 
authorized employee of the Department. Licensed samplers shall have no 
authority to inspect processed products under the regulations in this 
part except as to identification and condition of the containers in a 
lot. A licensed sampler shall perform his duties pursuant to the 
regulations in this part as directed by the Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 52.30  Application to become a licensed sampler.

    Application to become a licensed sampler shall be made to the 
Administrator on forms furnished for that purpose. Each such application 
shall be signed by the applicant in his own handwriting, and the 
information contained therein shall be certified by him to be true, 
complete, and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief, and the 
application shall contain or be accompanied by:
    (a) A statement showing his present and previous occupations, 
together with names of all employers for whom he has worked, with 
periods of service, during the ten years previous to the date of his 
application;
    (b) A statement that, in his capacity as a licensed sampler, he will 
not draw samples from any lot of processed products with respect to 
which he or his employer is an interested party;
    (c) A statement that he agrees to comply with all terms and 
conditions of the regulations in this part relating to duties of 
licensed samplers; and
    (d) Such other information as may be requested.


<R05>
Sec. 52.31  Inspectors.

    Inspections will ordinarily be performed by employees under the 
Administrator who are employed as Federal Government employees for that 
purpose. However, any person employed under any joint Federal-State 
inspection service arrangement may be licensed, if otherwise qualified, 
by the Secretary to make inspections in accordance with this part on 
such processed products as may be specified in his license. Such license 
shall be issued only in a case where the Administrator is satisfied that 
the particular person is qualified to perform adequately the inspection 
service for which such person is to be licensed. Each such license shall 
bear the printed signature of the Secretary and shall be countersigned 
by an authorized employee of the Department. An inspector shall perform 
his duties pursuant to the regulations in this part as directed by the 
Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 52.32  Suspension or revocation of license of licensed sampler or licensed inspector.

    Pending final action by the Secretary, the Administrator may, 
whenever he deems such action necessary, suspend the license of any 
licensed sampler, or licensed inspector, issued pursuant to the 
regulations in this part, by giving notice of such suspension to the 
respective licensee, accompanied by a statement of the reasons therefor. 
Within seven days after the receipt of the aforesaid notice and 
statement of reasons by such licensee, he may file an appeal, in 
writing, with the Secretary supported by any argument or evidence that 
he may wish to offer as to why his license should not be suspended or 
revoked. After the expiration of the aforesaid seven days period and 
consideration of such argument and evidence, the Secretary shall take 
such action as he deems appropriate with respect to such suspension or 
revocation.


<R05>
Sec. 52.33  Surrender of license.

    Upon termination of his services as a licensed sampler or licensed 
inspector, or suspension or revocation of his license, such licensee 
shall surrender his license immediately to the office of inspection 
serving the area in which he is located. These same provisions shall 
apply in a case of an expired license.

                                Sampling


<R05>
Sec. 52.34  How samples are drawn by inspectors or licensed samplers.

    An inspector or a licensed sampler shall select samples, upon 
request, from designated lots of processed products which are so placed 
as to permit thorough and proper sampling in accordance with the 
regulations in this part. Such person shall, unless otherwise directed 
by the Administrator, select sample units of such products at random, 
and from various locations in each lot in such manner and number, not 
inconsistent with the regulations in this part, as to secure a 
representative sample of the lot. Samples drawn for inspection shall be 
furnished by the applicant at no cost to the Department.


<R05>
Sec. 52.35  Accessibility for sampling.

    Each applicant shall cause the processed products for which 
inspection is requested to be made accessible for proper sampling. 
Failure to make any lot accessible for proper sampling shall be 
sufficient cause for postponing inspection service until such time as 
such lot is made accessible for proper sampling.


<R05>
Sec. 52.36  How officially drawn samples are to be identified.

    Officially drawn samples shall be marked by the inspector or 
licensed sampler so such samples can be properly identified for 
inspection.


<R05>
Sec. 52.37  How official samples are to be identified and shipped.

    Unless otherwise directed by the Administrator, samples which are to 
be shipped to any office of inspection shall be forwarded to the office 
of inspection serving the area in which the processed products from 
which the samples were drawn is located. Such samples shall be shipped 
in a manner to avoid any material change in the quality or condition of 
the sample of the processed product. Containers shall be identified and 
properly sealed with tape. A facsimile of the ``Officially Sampled'' 
stamp shall be placed over the taped container. All transportation 
charges in connection with such shipments of samples shall be at the 
expense of the applicant.
[51 FR 20439, June 5, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 52.38  Sampling plans and procedures for determining lot compliance.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided for in this section in connection 
with in-plant inspection and unless otherwise approved by the 
Administrator, samples shall be selected from each lot in the exact 
number of sample units indicated for the lot size in the applicable 
sampling plans. The lot size is to correspond to a sample size with a 
maximum of 29 sample units: Provided, that at the discretion of the 
inspection service, the number of sample units selected may be increased 
to the exact number of sample units indicated for any one of the larger 
sample sizes provided for in the appropriate plans. The samples size may 
be increased beyond 29 sample units in accordance with the following 
sampling plan:

                                                                        
                                                                        
                                                                        
Sample Size.....................................      38      48      60
Acceptance Number...............................       5       6       7
                                                                        

    (b) Under the sampling plans with respect to any specified 
requirement:
    (1) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirement) in the sample does not exceed the acceptance 
number prescribed for the sample size, the lot meets the requirement;
    (2) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirement) in the sample exceeds the acceptance number 
prescribed for the sample size, the lot fails the requirement.
    (c) If in the conduct of on-line in-plant inspection of a product 
covered by a grade standard which does not contain sampling plans, the 
sample is examined before the lot size is known and the number of sample 
units exceeds the prescribed sample size for such lot, but does not 
equal any of the prescribed larger sample sizes, the lot may be deemed 
to meet or fail a specific requirement in accordance with the following 
procedure:
    (1) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirement) in the nonprescribed sample does not exceed the 
acceptance

[[Page 544]]

number of the next smaller sample size, the lot meets the requirement;
    (2) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirement) in the nonprescribed sample equals the acceptance 
number prescribed for the next larger sample size, additional sample 
units shall be selected to increase the sample to the next larger 
prescribed sample size;
    (3) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirement) in the nonprescribed sample exceeds the acceptance 
number prescribed for the next larger sample size, the lot fails the 
requirement.
    (d) In the conduct of on-line in-plant inspection, sampling may be 
performed on a time interval basis. The sampling frequency shall be 
specified in an applicable grade standard or other procedural 
instruction approved by the Administrator.
    (e) In the event that the lot compliance determination provisions of 
a standard or specification are based on the number of specified 
deviations instead of deviants the procedures set forth in this section 
may be applied by substituting the word ``deviation'' for the word 
``deviant'' wherever it appears.
    (f) Sampling plans referred to in this section are those contained 
in Tables I, II, III, IV, and V and (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section 
which follow or any other plans which are applicable. For processed 
products not included in these tables, the minimum sample size shall be 
the exact number of sample units prescribed in the table, container 
group, and lot size that, as determined by the inspector, most closely 
resembles the product, type, container, size and amount of product to be 
sampled. The maximum sample size in tables I, II, III, IV, V, (g)(1), 
(g)(2) and processed products not included in these tables is 29 sample 
units.
    (g)(1) Sampling plan for dried figs. For each 10,000 pounds (or 
fraction of 10,000 pounds) of product--6 sample units of approximately 
35 figs each accumulated into 1 composite (at least 200 figs). Each 
composite will be examined separately, and all must meet the requirement 
for the U.S. Grade.
    (2) Sampling plan for dried fruits other than dates and figs. For 
each 15,000 pounds (or fraction of 15,000 pounds) of product--sample 
units of approximately 16 ounces each accumulated into 1 composite (at 
least 100 ounces) Each composite will be examined separately and all 
must meet the requirements for the U.S. Grade.

<R05>
Sec. 52.38a  Definitions of terms applicable to statistical sampling.

    (a) Terms applicable to both on-line inspection and lot inspection.
    (1) Acceptable Quality Level (AQL). The maximum percent of defective 
units of product or the maximum number of defects per hundred units of 
product which are acceptable as a process average. At the AQL's 
contained in the statistical sampling plans of this subpart, production 
has a probability of acceptance (``Pa'') of approximately 95 percent.
    (2) Acceptance sampling. Sampling inspection in which decisions are 
made to accept or reject product.
    (3) Attributes. A method of measurement whereby units of product are 
examined for the presence or absence of specified characteristics in 
each unit in the sample.
    (4) Defect. Any nonconformance of a unit of product from specified 
requirements of a single quality characteristic. Defects are classed as 
``minor,'' ``major,'' ``severe'' or ``critical'' depending upon the 
severity and undesirability of the defect.
    (5) Defective. A unit of product that has one or more defects.
    (6) Inspection by attributes. Inspection whereby a unit of product 
is classified as defective or nondefective or the number or defects in 
the unit of product is counted.
    (7) Standard sample unit size. A specified amount of product to be 
used for inspection.
    (b) Terms applicable to on-line inspection only.
    (1) Basic inspection period. A specified period of consecutive 
production designated for on-line inspection.
    (2) Cumulative Sum Sampling (CuSum) Plan. An on-line sampling plan 
that accumulates the number of defects (or defectives), which exceed the 
sample

[[Page 547]]

unit tolerance (``T''), in a series of consecutive samples. Terms 
specific to the CuSum sampling plan are:
    (i) Acceptance limit (``L''). The maximum accumulation of defects 
(or defectives) allowed to exceed the sample unit tolerance (``T'') in 
any sample unit or consecutive group of sample units.
    (ii) CuSum value. The accumulated number of defects (or defectives) 
that exceed the sample unit tolerance (``T'').
    (iii) Sample unit tolerance (``T''). The allowable number of defects 
(or defectives) in any sample unit.
    (iv) Starting value (``S''). The initial CuSum value used to begin a 
CuSum sampling plan.
    (3) On-line sampling inspection. The random selection and subsequent 
inspection of sample units from a production line.
    (4) Probability of acceptance (``Pa''). The probability that a 
portion of production, with a given level of quality, will be accepted. 
In on-line sampling inspection, the probability of acceptance of any 
portion of production depends on the sample results obtained from the 
preceding portions. The probability of acceptance values associated with 
these procedures are the values which would be expected if a large 
number of sample units are to be inspected. For the CuSum plans 
referenced in these procedures, the probability of acceptance at the 
Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) is approximately 95 percent. The starting 
value (``S'') associated with each CuSum plan helps to make the 
probability of acceptance of the first portions of production of a basic 
inspection period as close as possible to 95 percent.
    (c) Terms applicable to lot inspection only.
    (1) Acceptance number. The largest number of defects (or defectives) 
in the sample that will permit acceptance of the inspection lot.
    (2) Inspection lot. Any number of containers of the same size and 
type which contain a processed product of the same type and style, 
manufactured or processed under essentially the same conditions, offered 
for inspection and acceptance at one time.
    (3) Probability of acceptance (``Pa''). The probability that an 
inspection lot, with a given level of quality, will be accepted.

Sec. 52.38b  Statistical sampling procedures for on-line inspection by attributes of processed fruits and vegetables.

    (a) General. The Cumulative Sum Sampling Plan, hereinafter referred 
to as ``CuSum,'' shall be used as the on-line sampling plan for 
attributes standards under the following conditions.
    (1) The producer has designated the intended grade for the basic 
inspection period prior to the start of production.
    (2) Inspection of the product shall be made during the basic 
inspection period at a point after which all product characteristics, 
subject to inspection, are fixed and will not be subject to change 
during final packaging.
    (3) A shift to CuSum sampling plans from lot sampling plans during a 
basic inspection period is not permitted (or vice versa).
    (b) Sampling rate/frequency. The minimum number of standard sample 
units to be drawn at random shall be determined by the applicable 
sampling procedure as approved by the Administrator.
    (c) Determining CuSum values. At the beginning of the basic 
inspection period, the CuSum value is set equal to the starting value 
(``S'') for the specified CuSum plan. The CuSum value is then determined 
for each consecutive sample unit as follows:
    (1) Add the number of defects (or defectives) for the present sample 
unit to the CuSum value of the previous sample unit.
    (2) Subtract the sample unit tolerance (``T'').
    (3) The CuSum value is reset in the following situations. However, 
determine compliance with the designated grade (see paragraph (d) of 
this section) prior to resetting the CuSum value:
    (i) Reset the CuSum value to zero (0) if the CuSum value is less 
than zero (0).
    (ii) Reset the CuSum value to the acceptance limit (``L'') if the 
CuSum value exceeds the acceptance limit (``L'').

[[Page 548]]

    (d) Determining compliance for a designated grade. (1) A portion of 
production meets the designated grade if the CuSum value, calculated 
from the sample unit representing that portion, is equal to or less than 
the acceptance limit (``L'') for all classes of defects.
    (2) A portion of production fails the designated grade if the CuSum 
value, calculated from the sample unit representing that portion, 
exceeds the acceptance limit (``L'') for one or more classes of defects.
    (e) Evaluation of production failing a designated grade. Production 
failing a designated grade shall be reevaluated by procedures approved 
by the USDA.
    (f) Assigning a grade. (1) All similarly identified (e.g., codes, 
subcodes, etc.) production will be assigned the same grade.
    (2) The grade assigned to similarly identified production will be 
the lowest grade assigned to any portion of that similarly identified 
production.
    (g) Redesignation of producer's intended grade. If the intended 
grade is redesignated during a basic inspection period, a new CuSum 
sampling plan shall be instituted for each class of defects (or 
defectives).
    (h) Cumulative Sum Sampling (CuSum) Plans for processed fruits and 
vegetables. (1) Tables VI through X contain the CuSum sampling plans for 
each of five different standard sample unit sizes. The plans within each 
table are listed according to increasing values of Acceptable Quality 
Levels (AQL's).
    (2) AQL values of 10.0 or less may be expressed either in ``defects 
per hundred units'' or in ``percent defective units.'' The same sampling 
plans are used for both. Separate sampling plans must be used for AQL 
values greater than 10.0.
    (3) These tables also provide the quality levels associated with 50 
percent and 10 percent probabilities of acceptance for each of the 
plans. These quality levels are expressed in the same units as the 
corresponding AQL values.
    (4) A separate CuSum sampling plan is chosen for each class of 
defects (or defectives) by first specifying the desired AQL and then 
selecting the appropriate standard sample unit size. The quality levels 
associated with 50 percent and 10 percent probabilities of acceptance 
may be used as guides to help determine a suitable standard sample unit 
size.

Sec. 52.38c  Statistical sampling procedures for lot inspection of processed fruits and vegetables by attributes.

    (a) General. Single sampling plans shall be used as the lot sampling 
plan for attributes standards under either of the following conditions:
    (1) Sampling of the product shall be made during the production 
period. No grade will be assigned to individual sample units. One grade 
determination only will be made at the end of the production period for 
the inspection lot.
    (2) Sampling of the product shall be made when the inspection lot is 
located in a warehouse, truck, railroad car, or other similar 
conveyance.
    (b) Sample size. Samples shall be randomly selected from each 
inspection lot in the exact number of sample units indicated for the lot 
size in tables XI through XIV as applicable for canned, frozen, dried, 
or dehydrated fruits and vegetables.

    (c) Determining compliance. (1) An inspection lot meets the 
requirements of a quality grade if the number of defects (or defectives) 
is equal to or less than the acceptance numbers of all classes of 
defects.
    (2) An inspection lot fails the requirements of a quality grade if 
the number of defects (or defectives) exceeds the acceptance number for 
one or more classes of defects.
    (d) Lot single sampling plans for processed fruits and vegetables. 
(1) Tables XV through XIX contain the lot single sampling plans for each 
of five different standard sample unit sizes. The

[[Page 552]]

plans within each table are listed according to increasing values of 
Acceptable Quality Levels (AQL's).
    (2) AQL values of 10.0 or less may be expressed either in ``defects 
per hundred units'' or in ``percent defective units.'' The same sampling 
plans are used for both. Separate sampling plans must be used for AQL 
values greater than 10.0.
    (3) A separate lot single sampling plan is chosen for each class of 
defects (or defectives) by first specifying the desired AQL, the 
appropriate standard sample unit size, and the number of sample units as 
specified in Sec. 52.38c (b) of this subpart. The quality levels 
associated with the Pa=50% and Pa=10% levels are given in the 
instructional manual.

    (f) Removal of labels bearing approved grade or inspection marks. 
(1) At the time a lot of processed products bearing approved grade or 
inspection marks is found to be mislabeled, the processor shall separate 
and retain such lot for relabeling. Removal and replacement of labels 
shall be done, under the supervision of a USDA inspector, within the 
time specified by the Administrator or as may be mutually agreed by the 
processor and the Administrator.
    (2) The processor shall be held accountable to the Department for 
all mislabeled products until the products have been properly labeled.
    (3) Clearance for the release of the relabeled product shall be 
obtained, by the processor, from the inspector.
    (g) Licensing and identification of certain official devices. The 
Administrator may issue licenses permitting the manufacture, 
identification, and sale of any official device designated as a USDA 
color standard, defect guide or other similar aid under such terms and 
conditions as may be specified by the Administrator. Licenses shall be 
available to all persons meeting conditions prescribed by the 
Administrator, shall be nonexclusive, and shall be recoverable for 
cause. No person shall manufacture, identify, distribute or sell any 
such official device except at the direction of

other descriptive material that incorporates, resembles, simulates, or 
alludes to, any official U.S. Department of Agriculture certificate of 
quality or loading, grade mark, grade statement (except honey and maple 
syrup which may bear such grade mark or statement), continuous 
inspection mark, continuous inspection statement, sampling mark or 
sampling statement, or combinations of one or more thereof.
    (i) Disposition of labels bearing approved grade or inspection marks 
when a contract is cancelled. Upon cancellation of a contract, labels 
bearing approved grade or inspection marks shall remain under the

                   Liquid Media and Brix Measurements


<R05>
Sec. 52.773  Liquid media and Brix measurements.

    (a) Brix measurement requirements for the liquid media in canned red 
tart pitted cherries are not incorporated in the grades of the finished 
product since sirup, or any other liquid medium, as such, is not a 
factor of quality for the purpose of the grades. The designation of 
liquid packing media and Brix measurements, where applicable, are as 
follows:

 sweetened fruit juice(s) and water;'' or    than 45 deg..              
 ``Extra heavily sweetened fruit                                        
 juice(s).''.                                                           
``Heavy sirup;'' or ``Heavily sweetened     22 deg. or more but less    
 fruit juice(s) and water;'' or ``Heavily    than 28 deg..              
 sweetened fruit juice(s).''.

    (b) The densities of the packing media, as listed in this section, 
are measured on the refractometer, expressed as percent by weight 
sucrose (degrees Brix) with correction for temperature to the equivalent 
at 20 deg. C. (68 deg. F.), but without correction for invert sugars or 
other substances. The Brix measurement of the packing media

[[Page 564]]

may be determined by any other method which gives equivalent results.
    (c) Brix determination is made on the packing media 15 days or more 
after the cherries are canned or on the blended homogenized slurry of 
the comminuted entire contents of the container if canned for less than 
15 days.

                            Fill of Container


<R05>
Sec. 52.774  Fill of container.

    (a) FDA requirements. Canned red tart pitted cherries shall meet the 
fill of container requirements as set forth in the regulations of the 
Food and Drug Administration (21 CFR 145.125(c)).
    (b) Recommended minimum drained weights--(1) General. The minimum 
drained weight recommendations for the various container sizes and types 
of packing media as listed in Table I of this section are not 
incorporated in the grades of the finished product since drained weight, 
as such, is not a factor of quality for the purpose of these grades.

    (2) Definitions.

    Sample average--Average of all the drained weights of the sample 
containers representing a lot.
    X<INF>d</INF>--A specified minimum sample average drained weight.
    LL--Lower limit for individual container drained weight.

    (3) Method for ascertaining drained weight. The drained weight of 
canned red tart pitted cherries is determined by emptying the contents 
of the container upon a U.S. Standard No. 8 circular sieve of proper 
diameter containing eight meshes to the inch (0.0937 inch (2.3 mm), 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>3 percent, square openings) so as to distribute the 
product evenly over the sieve. Without shifting the product, incline the 
sieve at an angle of 17 deg. to 20 deg. to facilitate drainage and allow 
to drain for two minutes. The weight of drained cherries is the weight 
of the sieve and product less the weight of the dry sieve. A sieve eight 
inches in diameter is used for No. 3 size containers (404  x  414) and 
smaller, and a sieve 12 inches in diameter is used for containers larger 
than No. 3 size containers.
    (4) Compliance with recommended minimum drained weights. A lot of 
canned red tart pitted cherries is considered as meeting the minimum 
drained weight recommendations when the following criteria are met:
    (i) The sample average meets the specified minimum sample average 
drained weight (designated as ``X<INF>d</INF>'' in Table I); and
    (ii) The number of sample containers which fail to meet the minimum 
drained weight for individual containers (designated as ``LL'' in Table 
I) does not exceed the applicable acceptance number specified in Table 
II.
    (c) Recommended fill weights--(1) General. The minimum fill weight 
recommendations for the various container sizes in Table III of this 
section are not incorporated in the grades of the finished product since 
fill weight, as such, is not a factor of quality for the purpose of 
these grades.

                            Sample Unit Size


<R05>
Sec. 52.775  Sample unit size.

    Compliance with requirements for the size and the various quality 
factors is based on the following sample unit sizes for the applicable 
factor:
    (a) Size, color, pits, and character--20 ounces of drained cherries.
    (b) Defects (other than harmless extraneous material)--100 cherries.
    (c) Harmless extraneous material--The total contents of each 
container in the sample.

                           Factors of Quality


<R05>
Sec. 52.776  Ascertaining the grade of a sample unit.

    (a) General. The grade of a sample unit of canned red tart pitted 
cherries is ascertained by considering the factor of flavor and odor of 
the product and the requirement for size (in U.S. Grade A and U.S. Grade 
B) which are not scored; the ratings for the factors of color, freedom 
from pits, defects, and character, which are scored; and the limiting 
rules which may be applicable.
    (b) Factors rated by score points. The relative importance of each 
factor which is scored is expressed numerically on the scale of 100. The 
maximum number of points that may be given each factor is:

                                                                        
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             Factors                              Points
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Color...........................................................      20
Freedom from pits...............................................      20
Defects.........................................................      30
Character.......................................................      30
                                                                 -------
  Total score...................................................     100
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Definition. ``Normal flavor and odor'' means that the flavor and 
odor are characteristic of canned red tart pitted cherries and that the 
product is free from objectionable flavors and objectionable odors of 
any kind.


<R05>
Sec. 52.777  Ascertaining the rating for the factors which are scored.

    The essential variations within each factor which is scored are so 
described that the value may be ascertained for each factor and 
expressed numerically. The numerical range within each factor which is 
scored is inclusive (for example, ``18 to 20 points'' means 18, 19, or 
20 points).


<R05>
Sec. 52.778  Color.

    (a) (A) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that have a 
good color may be given a score of 18 to 20 points. ``Good color'' means 
a practically uniform color that is bright and typical of canned red 
tart pitted cherries which have been prepared and processed from 
properly ripened cherries.
    (b) (B) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that have a 
reasonably good color may be given a score of 16 or 17 points. 
``Reasonably good color''

[[Page 566]]

means a reasonably uniform color, typical of canned red tart pitted 
cherries which have been properly prepared and processed and which color 
may range from a slight yellowish-red color to a slightly mottled 
reddish brown.
    (c) (C) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that have a 
fairly good color may be given a score of 14 or 15 points. Canned red 
tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall not be 
graded above U.S. Grade C, regardless of the total score for the product 
(this is a limiting rule). ``Fairly good color'' means a fairly uniform 
color typical of canned red tart pitted cherries which have been 
properly processed and which color may range from a brownish cast to 
mottled shades of brown.
    (d) (SStd.) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that 
fail to meet the color requirements for U.S. Grade C may be given a 
score of 0 to 15 points and shall not be graded above Substandard, 
regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).


<R05>
Sec. 52.779  Freedom from pits.

    (a) General. The factor of freedom from pits refers to the incidence 
of pits and pit fragments.
    (b) Definitions. (1) A pit, for the purposes of the allowances in 
this section, is a whole cherry pit or portions of pits computed as 
follows:
    (i) A single piece of pit shell, whether or not within or attached 
to a whole cherry, that is larger than one-half pit shell is considered 
as one pit;
    (ii) A single piece of pit shell, whether or not within or attached 
to a whole cherry, that is not larger than one-half pit shell is 
considered as one-half pit;
    (iii) Pieces of pit shell, within or attached to a whole cherry, 
when their combined size is larger than one-half pit shell are 
considered as one pit; and
    (iv) Pieces of pit shell, within or attached to a whole cherry, when 
their combined size is not larger than one-half pit shell are considered 
as one-half pit.
    (2) Drained cherries means pitted cherries that have been drained of 
packing medium by the method prescribed in this subpart.
    (c) (A) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that are 
practically free from pits may be given a score of 18 to 20 points. 
``Practically free from pits'' means that the number of pits that may be 
present in the drained cherries does not exceed the allowances for this 
classification as set forth in Table IV.
    (d) (B) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that are 
reasonably free from pits may be given a score of 16 or 17 points. 
Canned red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall 
not be graded above U.S. Grade B, regardless of the total score for the 
product (this is a limiting rule). ``Reasonably free from pits'' means 
that the number of pits that may be present does not exceed the 
allowances for this classification as set forth in Table IV.
    (e) (C) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that are 
fairly free from pits may be given a score of 14 or 15 points. Canned 
red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall not be 
graded above U.S. Grade C, regardless of the total score for the product 
(this is a limiting rule). ``Fairly free from pits'' means that the 
number of pits that may be present in the drained cherries does not 
exceed the allowances for this classification as set forth in Table IV.
    (f) (SStd.) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that 
fail to meet the requirements of U.S. Grade C may be given a score of 0 
to 13 points and shall not be graded above Substandard, regardless of 
the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).


<R05>
Sec. 52.780  Defects.

    (a) General. The factor of defects refers to the degree of freedom 
from harmless extraneous material, mutilated cherries, and cherries 
blemished by scab, hail injury, discoloration, scar tissue, or by other 
means.
    (1) Cherry means a whole cherry, whether or not pitted, or portions 
of such cherries which in the aggregate approximate the average size of 
the cherries.
    (2) Harmless extraneous material means any vegetable substance 
(including, but not being limited to, a leaf or a stem, and any portions 
thereof) that is harmless.
    (3) Mutilated cherry means a cherry that is so pitter-torn or 
damaged by other means that the entire pit cavity

[[Page 567]]

is exposed and the appearance of the cherry is seriously affected.
    (4) Minor blemished cherry means any cherry blemished with skin 
discoloration (other than scald) having an aggregate area of a circle 9/
32 inch (7 mm) or less in diameter which more than slightly affects the 
appearance of the cherry but does not extend into the fruit tissue.
    (5) Blemished cherry means any cherry blemished by skin 
discoloration (other than scald) which in the aggregate exceeds the area 
of a circle 9/32 inch (7 mm) in diameter. A cherry affected by skin 
discoloration extending into the fruit tissue or by scab, hail injury, 
scar tissue, or other abnormality, regardless of size, is considered a 
blemished cherry.
    (b) (A) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that are 
practically free from defects may be given a score of 27 to 30 points. 
``Practically free from defects'' means that the number of defects that 
may be present does not exceed the number specified for the type of 
defects in Table IV.
    (c) (B) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that are 
reasonably free from defects may be given a score of 24 to 26 points.

product (this is a limiting rule). ``Reasonably free from defects'' 
means that the number of defects that may be present does not exceed the 
number specified for the type of defects in Table IV.
    (d) (C) classification. If the canned red tart pitted cherries are 
fairly free from defects, a score of 21 to 23 points may be given. 
Canned red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall 
not be graded above U.S. Grade C, regardless of the total score for the 
product (this is a limiting rule). ``Fairly free from defects'' means 
that the number of defects that may be present does not exceed the 
number specified for the type of defects in Table IV.
    (e) (SStd.) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that 
fail to meet the requirements for Grade C for any reason may be given a 
score of 0 to 20 points and shall not be graded above Substandard, 
regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).


<R05>
Sec. 52.781  Character.

    (a) General. The factor of character refers to the physical 
characteristics of the flesh of the cherries.
    (b) (A) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that have a 
good character may be given a score of 27 to 30 points. ``Good 
character'' means that the cherries are thick-fleshed and have a firm, 
tender texture.
    (c) (B) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that have a 
reasonably good character may be given a score of 24 to 26 points. 
Canned red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall 
not be graded above U.S. Grade B, regardless of the total score for the 
product (this is a limiting rule). ``Reasonably good character'' means 
that the cherries may be reasonably thick-fleshed and may be slightly 
soft.
    (d) (C) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that have a 
fairly good character may be given a score of 21 to 23 points. Canned 
red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall not be 
graded above U.S. Grade C, regardless of the total score for the product 
(this is a limiting rule). ``Fairly good character'' means that the

                     Product Description and Grades


<R05>
Sec. 52.801  Product description.

    Frozen red tart pitted cherries is the food prepared from properly 
matured cherries of the domestic (Prunus cerasus) red sour varietal 
group which have been washed, pitted, sorted, and properly drained; may 
be packed with or without a nutritive sweetened packing medium or any 
other substance permitted under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act, and are frozen

[[Page 569]]

and stored at temperatures necessary for the preservation of the 
product.


<R05>
Sec. 52.802  Grades of frozen red tart pitted cherries.

    (a) ``U.S. Grade A'' (or ``U.S. Fancy'') is the quality of frozen 
red tart pitted cherries of which not more than five (5) cherries per 
sample unit may be less than \9/16\ inch (14 mm) in diameter, and that:
    (1) Possess a good red color;
    (2) Are practically free from pits;
    (3) Are practically free from defects;
    (4) Have a good character;
    (5) Possess a normal flavor; and
    (6) Score not less than 90 points when scored in accordance with the 
scoring system outlined in this subpart.
    (b) ``U.S. Grade B'' (or ``U.S. Choice'') is the quality of frozen 
red tart pitted cherries of which not more than ten (10) cherries per 
sample unit may be less than \9/16\ inch (14 mm) in diameter, and that:
    (1) Possess a reasonably good red color;
    (2) Are reasonably free from pits;
    (3) Are reasonably free from defects;
    (4) Have a reasonably good character:
    (5) Possess a normal flavor; and

red tart pitted cherries that:
    (1) Possess a fairly good red color;
    (2) Are fairly free from pits;
    (3) Are fairly free from defects;
    (4) Have a fairly good character;
    (5) Possess a normal flavor; and
    (6) Score not less than 70 points when scored in accordance with the 
scoring system outlined in this subpart.

cherries that fail to meet the requirements of U.S. Grade C.

                            Sample Unit Size


<R05>
Sec. 52.803  Sample unit size.

    Compliance with requirements for size and the various quality 
factors is based on the following sample unit sizes for the applicable 
factor:
    (a) Pits, character, and harmless extraneous material--20 ounces of 
drained cherries.
    (b) Size, color, and defects (other than harmless extraneous 
material)--100 cherries.

                           Factors of Quality


<R05>
Sec. 52.804  Ascertaining the grade of a sample unit.

    (a) The grade of frozen red tart pitted cherries is determined 
immediately after thawing to the extent that the cherries may be 
separated easily and the cherries are free from ice and solidified 
packing media. The grade is determined by considering in addition to the 
requirements of the respective grade (including the requirement of the 
size in U.S. Grade A and U.S. Grade B), the respective ratings of the 
factors of color, pits, absence of defects, character, the total score, 
and the limiting rules which may be applicable.
    (b) The relative importance of each factor is expressed numerically 
on a scale of 100. The maximum number of points that may be given each 
factor is:

                                                                        
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Total score...................................................     100
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Normal flavor means that the flavor is characteristic of frozen 
red tart pitted cherries and that the product is free from objectionable 
flavors of any kind.


<R05>
Sec. 52.805  Ascertaining the rating for each factor.

    The essential variations within each factor are so described that 
the value may be ascertained for each factor and expressed numerically. 
The numerical range for the rating of each factor is inclusive (for 
example, ``27 to 30 points'' means 27, 28, 29 or 30 points).


<R05>
Sec. 52.806  Color.

    (a) (A) Classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that possess 
a good red color may be given a score of 27 to 30 points. ``Good red 
color'' means that the frozen cherries possess a color that is bright 
and typical of properly ripened cherries and that is practically uniform 
in that the number of cherries

[[Page 570]]

that vary markedly from this color due to oxidation, improper 
processing, or other causes, or that are undercolored, does not exceed 
the number specified in Table I.
    (b) (B) Classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that possess 
a reasonably good red color may be given a score of 24 to 26 points. 
Frozen red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall 
not be graded above U.S. Grade B, regardless of the total score for the 
product (this is a limiting rule). ``Reasonably good red color'' means 
that the cherries possess a color that is reasonably bright and typical 
of properly ripened cherries and that is reasonably uniform in that the 
number of cherries that vary markedly from this color due to oxidation, 
improper processing, or other causes, or that are undercolored, does not 
exceed the number specified in Table I.
    (c) (C) Classification. If the frozen red tart pitted cherries 
possess a fairly good red color, a score of 21 to 23 points may be 
given. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that fall into this 
classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade C, regardless of the 
total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). ``Fairly good red 
color'' means that the frozen cherries possess a color that is fairly 
bright and typical of properly ripened cherries and that is fairly 
uniform in that the number of cherries that vary markedly from this 
color due to oxidation, improper processing, or other causes, or that 
are undercolored, does not exceed the number specified in Table I.
    (d) (SStd.) Classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that 
fail to meet the requirements of U.S. Grade C may be given a score of 0 
to 20 points and shall not be graded above Substandard, regardless of 
the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).


<R05>
Sec. 52.807  Freedom from pits.

    (a) General. The factor of freedom from pits refers to the incidence 
of pits and pit fragments.
    (b) Definitions. (1) A ``pit'' for the purpose of the allowances in 
this subpart is a whole pit or portions of pits computed as follows:
    (i) A single piece of pit shell, whether or not within or attached 
to a whole cherry, that is larger than one-half pit shell is considered 
as one pit;
    (ii) A single piece of pit shell, whether or not within or attached 
to a whole cherry, that is not larger than one-half pit shell is 
considered as one-half pit;
    (iii) Pieces of pit shell, within or attached to a whole cherry, 
when their combined size is larger than one-half pit shell are 
considered as one pit; and
    (iv) Pieces of pit shell, within or attached to a whole cherry, when 
their combined size is not larger than one-half pit shell are considered 
as one-half pit.
    (2) Drained cherries means pitted cherries that are substantially 
free from any adhering sirup, sugar, or other packing medium.
    (c) (A) Classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that are 
practically free from pits may be given a score of 18 to 20 points. 
``Practically free from pits'' means that the number of pits that may be 
present does not exceed the allowances for this classification specified 
in Table I.
    (d) (B) Classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that are 
reasonably free from pits may be given a score of 16 or 17 points. 
Frozen red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall 
not be graded above U.S. Grade B, regardless of the total score for the 
product (this is a limiting rule). ``Reasonably free from pits'' means 
that the number of pits that may be present does not exceed the number 
specified in Table I.
    (e) (C) Classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that are 
fairly free from pits may be given a score of 14 or 15 points. Frozen 
red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall not be 
graded above U.S. Grade C, regardless of the total score for the product 
(this is a limiting rule). ``Fairly free from pits'' means that the 
number of pits that may be present does not exceed the number specified 
in Table I.
    (f) (SStd.) Classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that 
fail to meet the requirements for U.S. Grade C may be given a score of 0 
to 13 points and shall not be graded above Substandard, regardless of 
the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).

<R05>
Sec. 52.808  Freedom from defects.

    (a) General. The factor of freedom from defects refers to the degree 
of freedom from harmless extraneous material, mutilated cherries, and 
cherries blemished by scab, hail injury, discoloration, scar tissue, or 
by other means.
    (1) Cherry means a whole cherry, whether or not pitted, or portions 
of such cherries which in the aggregate approximate the average size of 
the cherries.
    (2) Harmless extraneous material means any vegetable substance 
(including, but not being limited to, a leaf or a stem and any portions 
thereof) that is harmless.
    (3) Mutilated cherry means a cherry that is so pitter-torn or 
damaged by other means that the entire pit cavity is exposed and the 
appearance of the cherry is seriously affected.
    (4) Minor blemished cherry means any cherry blemished with 
discoloration (other than scald) having an aggregate area of a circle 
\9/32\ inch (7 mm) or less in diameter which more than slightly affects 
the appearance of the cherry but does not extend into the fruit tissue.
    (5) Blemished cherry means any cherry blemished by skin 
discoloration (other than scald) which in the aggregate exceeds the area 
of a circle \9/32\ inch (7 mm) in diameter. A cherry affected by skin 
discoloration extending into the fruit tissue or by scab, hail injury, 
scar tissue, or other abnormality, regardless of size, is considered a 
blemished cherry.
    (b) (A) Classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that are 
practically free from defects may be given a score of 18 to 20 points. 
``Practically free from defects'' means that the number of defects that 
may be present does not exceed the number specified for the applicable 
type of defect in Table I.
    (c) (B) Classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that are 
reasonably free from defects may be given a score of 16 or 17 points. 
Frozen red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall 
not be graded above U.S. Grade B, regardless of the total score for the 
product (this is a limiting rule). ``Reasonably free from defects'' 
means that the number of defects that may be present does not exceed the 
number specified for the applicable type of defect in Table I.
    (d) (C) Classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that are 
fairly free from defects may be given a score of 14 or 15 points. Frozen 
red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall not be 
graded above U.S. Grade C, regardless of the total score for the product 
(this is a limiting rule). ``Fairly free from defects'' means that the 
number of defects that may be present does not exceed the number 
specified for the applicable type of defect in Table I.
    (e) (SStd.) Classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that 
fail to meet the requirements for Grade C may be given a score of 0 to 
13 points and shall not be graded above Substandard, regardless of the 
total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).


<R05>
Sec. 52.809  Character.

    (a) General. The factor of character refers to the physical 
characteristics of the flesh of the cherries.
    (b) (A) Classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that have a 
good character may be given a score of 27 to 30 points. ``Good 
character'' means that the cherries are thick-fleshed and have a firm, 
tender texture.
    (c) (B) Classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that have a 
reasonably good character may be given a score of 24 to 26 points. 
Frozen red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall 
not be graded above U.S. Grade B, regardless of the total score for the 
product (this is a limiting rule). ``Reasonably good character'' means 
that the cherries may be reasonably thick-fleshed and slightly soft.
    (d) (C) Classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that have a 
fairly good character may be given a score of 21 to 23 points. Frozen 
red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall not be 
graded above U.S. Grade C, regardless of the total score for the product 
(this is a limiting rule). ``Fairly good character'' means that the 
cherries may be thin-fleshed and may be soft but not mushy, or slightly 
tough but not leathery.
    (e) (SStd.) Classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that 
fail to meet the requirements for Grade C may be given a score of 0 to 
20 points and shall

[[Page 572]]

not be graded above Substandard, regardless of the total score for the 
product (this is a limiting rule).

          Subpart--United States Standards for Grades of Dates

    Source: 20 FR 5755, Aug. 10, 1955, unless otherwise noted. 
Redesignated at 42 FR 32514, June 27, 1977 and at 46 FR 63203, Dec. 31, 
1981.

                 Product Description, Styles, and Grades


<R05>
Sec. 52.1001  Product description.

    Dates are the properly cured fresh fruit of the date tree (Phoenix 
dactylifera) which may or may not be softened by hydration. For the 
purposes of the standards in this subpart, dates, when referred to as 
``dry dates for processing,'' means that the dates are dry and have not 
been softened by hydration.

[[Page 573]]


<R05>
Sec. 52.1002  Styles of dates.

    (a) Whole or whole dates means whole unpitted dates from which the 
pits have not been removed and which may be slit longitudinally.
    (b) Pitted or pitted dates means whole dates from which the pits 
have been removed.
    (c) Pieces or date pieces means dates that have been cut or sliced 
into small pieces and that can be handled as individual units.
    (d) Macerated or macerated dates means dates that have been ground, 
chopped, mashed, or broken or that have been cut or sliced into small 
pieces and that cannot be handled as individual units.


<R05>
Sec. 52.1003  Grades of dates.

    (a) U.S. Grade A or U.S. Fancy is the quality of whole or pitted 
dates that are of one variety, that possess a good color, that are 
practically uniform in size, that are practically free from defects, 
that possess a good character, and that score not less than 90 points 
when scored in accordance with the scoring system outlined in this 
subpart.
    (b) U.S. Grade B or U.S. Choice is the quality of whole or pitted 
dates other than whole dry dates for processing that are of one variety, 
that possess a reasonably good color, that are reasonably uniform in 
size, that are reasonably free from defects, that possess a reasonably 
good character, and that score not less than 80 points when scored in 
accordance with the scoring system outlined in this subpart.
    (c) U.S. Grade B (Dry) or U.S. Choice (Dry) is the quality of whole 
dry dates for processing that are of one variety, that possess a 
reasonably good color, that are reasonably uniform in size, that are 
reasonably free from defects, that possess a reasonably good character, 
and that score not less than 80 points when scored in accordance with 
the scoring system outlined in this subpart.
    (d) U.S. Grade C or U.S. Stand- ard is the quality of whole or 
pitted dates other than whole dry dates for processing that are of one 
variety or of date pieces or macerated dates that possess a fairly good 
color, that are fairly uniform in size except for date pieces or 
macerated dates, that are fairly free from defects, that possess a 
fairly good character, and that score not less than 70 points when 
scored in accordance with the scoring system outlined in this subpart.
    (e) U.S. Grade C (Dry) or U.S. Standard (Dry) is the quality of 
whole dry dates for processing that are of one variety, that possess a 
fairly good color, that are fairly uniform in size, that are fairly free 
from defects, that possess a fairly good character, and that score not 
less than 70 points when scored in accordance with the scoring system 
outlined in this subpart.
    (f) Substandard is the quality of dates that fail to meet the 
requirements of U.S. Grade C or U.S. Stand- ard or U.S. Grade C (Dry) or 
U.S. Standard (Dry), whichever is applicable.

                           Factors of Quality


<R05>
Sec. 52.1004  Ascertaining the grade.

    In addition to considering other requirements outlined in the 
standards, the following quality factors are evaluated:
    (a) Factor not related by score points. (1) Varietal requirement.
    (b) Factors rated by score points. The relative importance of each 
factor which is scored is expressed numerically on the scale of 100. The 
maximum number of points that may be given such factors are:

                                                                  Points
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Color.......................................................      20
(2) Uniformity of size..........................................      10
(3) Absence of defects..........................................      30
(4) Character...................................................      40
                                                                 -------
  Total score...................................................     100
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 52.1005  Ascertaining the rating for the factors which are scored.

    The essential variations within each factor which is scored are so 
described that the value may be ascertained for each factor and 
expressed numerically. The numerical range within each factor which is 
scored is inclusive (for example, ``18 to 20 points'' means 18, 19, or 
20 points).


<R05>
Sec. 52.1006  Color.

    (a) (A) classification. Whole or pitted dates that possess a good 
color may be

[[Page 574]]

given a score of 18 to 20 points. ``Good color'' means that the color of 
the dates is practically uniform; and, with respect to dates that are 
predominantly light amber in color, there may be not more than 5 percent 
by count of dates that are dark amber in color; and, with respect to 
dates that are predominantly dark amber in color, there may be not more 
than 5 percent by count of dates that are light amber in color.
    (b) (B) classification. If the whole or pitted dates or whole dry 
dates for processing possess a reasonably good color, a score of 16 or 
17 points may be given. Dates that fall into this classification shall 
not be graded above U.S. Grade B or U.S. Choice or U.S. Grade B (Dry) or 
U.S. Choice (Dry), whichever is applicable, regardless of the total 
score for the product (this is a limiting rule). ``Reasonably good 
color'' means that the color of the whole or pitted dates or whole dry 
dates for processing is reasonably uniform for the type; and, with 
respect to dates that are predominantly light amber in color, there may 
be not more than 10 percent by count of dates that are dark amber in 
color; and, with respect to dates that are predominantly dark amber in 
color, there may be not more than 10 percent by count of dates that are 
light amber in color.
    (c) (C) classification. If the whole or pitted dates, whole dry 
dates for processing, date pieces, or macerated dates possess a fairly 
good color, a score of 14 or 15 points may be given. Dates that fall 
into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade C or U.S. 
Standard or U.S. Grade C (Dry) or U.S. Standard (Dry), whichever is 
applicable, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a 
limiting rule). ``Fairly good color'' has the following meanings with 
respect to the following styles:
    (1) Whole; pitted. The color of the whole or pitted dates or whole 
dry dates for processing is fairly uniform for the type; and, with 
respect to dates that are predominantly light amber in color, there may 
be not more than 20 percent by count of dates that are dark amber in 
color; and, with respect to dates that are predominantly dark amber in 
color, there may be not more than 20 percent by count of dates that are 
light amber in color.
    (2) Pieces; macerated. The color may be variable throughout the 
units or mass, may be slightly dull but not off-color, and is typical of 
properly prepared dates of these styles.
    (d) (SStd) classification. Dates that fail to meet the requirements 
of paragraph (c) of this section may be given a score of 0 to 13 points 
and shall not be graded above Substandard, regardless of the total score 
for the product (this is a limiting rule).


<R05>
Sec. 52.1007  Uniformity of size.

    (a) General. The factor of uniformity of size applies only to whole 
and pitted styles. The factor of uniformity of size in the styles of 
date pieces and macerated dates is not based on any detailed 
requirements and is not scored; the other three factors (color, absence 
of defects, and character is applicable) are scored and the total is 
multiplied by 100 and divided by 90, dropping any fractions to determine 
the total score.
    (b) (A) classification. Whole or pitted dates that are practically 
uniform in size may be given a score of 9 or 10 points. ``Practically 
uniform in size'' means that not more than a total of 10 percent, by 
weight, of the whole or pitted dates may be conspicuously larger or 
smaller than the approximate average size of the dates in the container.
    (c) (B) classification. If the whole or pitted dates or whole dry 
dates for processing are reasonably uniform in size, a score of 8 points 
may be given. Dates that fall into this classification shall not be 
graded above U.S. Grade B or U.S. Choice or U.S. Grade B (Dry) or U.S. 
Choice (Dry), whichever is applicable, regardless of the total score for 
the product (this is a limiting rule). ``Reasonably uniform in size'' 
means that not more than a total of 15 percent, by weight, of the whole 
or pitted dates may be conspicuously larger or smaller than the 
approximate average size of the dates in the container.
    (d) (C) classification. If the whole or pitted dates or whole dry 
dates for processing are fairly uniform in size, a score of 7 points may 
be given. Dates that fall into this classification shall not be graded 
above U.S. Grade C or U.S. Standard or U.S. Grade C (Dry) or

[[Page 575]]

U.S. Standard (Dry), whichever is applicable, regardless of the total 
score for the product (this is a limiting rule). ``Fairly uniform in 
size'' means that not more than a total of 20 percent, by weight, of the 
whole or pitted dates may be conspicuously larger or smaller than the 
approximate average size of the dates in the container.
    (e) (SStd) classification. Whole or pitted dates or whole dry dates 
for processing that fail to meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of 
this section may be given a score of 0 to 6 points and shall not be 
graded above Substandard, regardless of the total score for the product 
(this is a limiting rule).


<R05>
Sec. 52.1008  Absence of defects.

    (a) Definitions of defects. Unless otherwise stated specifically, 
the following definitions of defects or defective units apply only to 
whole or pitted dates or whole dry dates for processing, as applicable 
for the type:
    (1) Damaged by discoloration is the presence of a dark area in the 
flesh of the date, which dark area is visible through the skin and is 
more than one-fourth (\1/4\) inch in width and extends more than the 
equivalent of half the length of the date, such darkening being of 
natural origin and not caused by mold or other organism.
    (2) Damaged by broken skin is any rupture of the skin in a manner to 
expose the flesh of the date, the short- est dimension of such exposed 
area being not less than three-sixteenths (\3/16\) inch.
    (3) Damaged by checking is the presence of fine lines, resulting 
from water injury, affecting the surface of the skin over an area not 
less than one-fourth of the total surface of the date.
    (4) Seriously damaged by checking is the presence of heavy lines, 
resulting from water injury, seriously affecting the surface of the skin 
over an area not less than one-fourth of the total surface of the date.
    (5) Damaged by deformity is any abnormal shape sufficient to produce 
an appearance discernibly at variance with the normal shape that is 
typical of the variety.
    (6) Damaged by puffiness is the condition of a date of which the 
skin is soft and pliable and from which the skin is separated from the 
flesh in a balloon-like fashion, over an area not less than one-half of 
the total surface of the date. Soft skins which have returned and adhere 
to the flesh of the date are not considered ``damaged by puffiness.''
    (7) Seriously damaged by puffiness is the condition of a date of 
which the skin is dry, hard, and brittle and from which the skin is 
separated from the flesh over an area not less than one-half of the 
total surface of the date.
    (8) Damaged by scars are any blemishes that affect the exterior of 
the date and which are not less than three-sixteenths (\3/16\) inch in 
the shortest dimension.
    (9) Damaged by sunburn is an area, usually light in color, scarred 
by the heat of the sun, such area being not less than three-sixteenths 
(\3/16\) inch in the shortest dimension.
    (10) Damaged by insect injury is any blemish, resulting from the 
activity of insects or mites, distributed over an area of not less than 
one-fourth of the total surface of the date or any similar blemish that 
materially affects the appearance or edibility of the unit, regardless 
of the area affected.
    (11) Damaged by improper hydrating means that the date has been 
injured by excessive heat or that the hydrating process is incomplete.
    (12) Damaged by mashing means any physical injury to the flesh and 
skin of the date leaving the date partially mangled but otherwise whole.
    (13) Damaged by mechanical injury means excessive trimming or 
similar injury that damages the appearance or that damages or affects 
the eating quality of the whole date.
    (14) Damaged by lack of pollination means, with respect to whole 
dates, that pollination of the date was not accomplished, such condition 
being manifested by the absence of a pit in the whole dates or by thin, 
immature appearance of the date.
    (15) Damaged by blacknose is severe checking in which the flesh 
becomes dark, crusty, and dry and which severe checking affects an area 
greater than one-eighth of the total surface of the date.
    (16) Damaged by side spot means a very dark area, which generally is 
circular in appearance, extending into the flesh of the date, and, when 
decayed

[[Page 576]]

tissue or mold is not present, affecting in the aggregate an area not 
less than the area of a circle three-sixteenths (\3/16\) inch in 
diameter.
    (17) Damaged by black scald means the collapse, death, and 
blackening of the flesh along the side of the date, usually accompanied 
by a bitter taste in the affected area.
    (18) Damage by improper ripening means pronounced evidence of 
``green shrivel'' of the date or that the date possesses a puffy flesh 
or a decidedly rubbery texture resulting from failure of the tissue of 
the date to reach a desirable state of maturity due to climatic or 
cultural injury, or both.
    (19) Damaged by other defects means any injury or defect or group of 
defects not defined in this section (such as, but not limited to, heavy 
sugaring, and excessive scars not described in the definition ``damaged 
by scars,'') which materially affect the appearance, edibility, or 
keeping quality of the dates.
    (20) Affected by scouring is evidenced by the breakdown of the 
sugars into alcohol and acetic acid by yeasts and bacteria.
    (21) Affected by mold is the presence of visible mold.
    (22) Affected by dirt is the presence of any quantity of such 
substance.
    (23) Affected by insect infestation is the presence of dead insects, 
insect parts, or excreta. (No live insects are permitted.)
    (24) Affected by foreign material is the presence of any quantity of 
such substance.
    (25) Affected by decay is a state of decomposition.
    (b) (A) classification. Whole or pitted dates that are practically 
free from defects may be given a score of 27 to 30 points. ``Practically 
free from defects'' means that in pitted dates there may be present not 
more than one whole pit or two pit fragments for each 25 ounces of 
pitted dates; and that the whole or pitted dates do not exceed the total 
allowances and limitations shown in Chart I of this subpart.
    (c) (B) classification. If the whole or pitted dates or whole dry 
dates for processing are reasonably free from defects, a score of 24 to 
26 points may be given. Dates that fall into this classification shall 
not be graded above U.S. Grade B or U.S. Choice or U.S. Grade B (Dry) or 
U.S. Choice (Dry), whichever is applicable, regardless of the total 
score for the product (this is a limiting rule). ``Reasonably free from 
defects'' means that in pitted dates there may be present not more than 
one whole pit or two pit fragments for each 25 ounces of pitted dates; 
and that the whole or pitted dates or whole dry dates for processing do 
not exceed the total allowances and limitations shown in Chart II of 
this subpart.
    (d) (C) classification. If the whole or pitted dates, whole dry 
dates for processing, date pieces, or macerated dates are fairly free

Sec. 52.1009  Character.

    (a) (A) classification. Whole or pitted dates that possess a good 
character may be given a score of 36 to 40 points. ``Good character'' 
means that not less than 75 percent, by weight, of the dates are well 
developed, well fleshed, and soft, or at the time of packing are in a 
state of ripeness that within 15 days will develop into such character; 
and the remainder may possess a reasonably good character including not 
more than a total of 2 percent, by weight, of the dates that may possess 
semi-dry calyx ends and none may possess dry calyx ends.
    (b) (B) classification. If the whole or pitted dates or whole dry 
dates for processing possess a reasonably good character, a score of 32 
to 35 points may be given. Dates that fall into this classification 
shall not be graded above U.S. Grade B or U.S. Choice or U.S. Grade B 
(Dry) or U.S. Choice (Dry), whichever is applicable, regardless of the 
total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).
    (1) ``Reasonably good character'' with respect to whole or pitted 
dates other than whole dry dates for processing means that the dates are 
pliable; that not less than 75 percent, by weight, of the dates are 
reasonably well developed and reasonably well fleshed, or at time of 
packing are in a state of ripeness that within 15 days will develop into 
such character and the remainder may possess a fairly good character 
including not more than 10 percent, by weight, of the dates that may 
possess semi-dry calyx ends and dry calyx ends: Provided, That not more 
than 2 percent, by weight, of the dates may possess dry calyx ends.
    (2) ``Reasonably good character'' with respect to whole dry dates 
for processing means that the dates may be firm and dry; that not less 
than 75 percent, by weight, of the dates are reasonably

[[Page 579]]

well developed and reasonably well fleshed and that the remainder are 
fairly well developed and fairly well fleshed.
    (c) (C) classification. If the whole or pitted dates, whole dry 
dates for processing, date pieces, or macerated dates possess a fairly 
good character, a score of 28 to 31 points may be given. Dates that fall 
into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade C or U.S. 
Standard or U.S. Grade C (Dry) or U.S. Standard (Dry), whichever is 
applicable, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a 
limiting rule). ``Fairly good character'' has the following meanings 
with respect to the following styles:
    (1) Whole; pitted. (i) In whole or pitted dates other than whole dry 
dates for processing the dates may be firm but are pliable; may possess 
semi-dry calyx ends; and not less than 80 percent, by weight, of the 
dates are fairly well developed and are fairly well fleshed, or at time 
of packing are in a state of ripeness that within 15 days will develop 
into such character and the remainder may fail to possess such fairly 
good character or may possess dry calyx ends.
    (ii) In whole dry dates for processing the dates may be firm and dry 
but are fairly well developed and fairly well fleshed.
    (2) Pieces; macerated. The character may be variable throughout the 
units or mass but not seriously affected by dry calyx end material or 
inedible portions of dates.
    (d) (SStd) classification. Dates that fail to meet the requirements 
of paragraph (c) of this section may be given a score of 0 to 27 points 
and shall not be graded above Substandard, regardless of the total score 
for the product (this is a limiting rule).

of raisins prepared from well-matured grapes with not less than 80 
percent, by weight, of raisins that are well-matured or reasonably well-
matured; that contain not more than 18 percent, by weight, of moisture 
for all varieties of seedless raisins except the Monukka variety, which 
may contain not more than 19 percent, by weight, of moisture; and that 
meet the additional requirements outlined in Table I of this subpart.

                    Type II--Golden Seedless Raisins


<R05>
Sec. 52.1847  Colors of golden seedless raisins.

    The color of Golden Seedless Raisins is not a factor of quality for 
the purpose of these grades. The color requirements applicable to the 
respective color designations are as follows:
    (a) ``Well colored'' means that the raisins are practically uniform 
in color and may range from yellow or golden to light amber color with a 
predominating yellow or golden color and that not more than \1/2\ of 1 
percent, by weight, of all the raisins may be definitely dark berries.
    (b) ``Reasonably well colored'' means that the raisins are 
reasonably uniform in color and may range from yellow or golden or 
greenish yellow to light amber wherein the predominating color may be 
greenish yellow or light amber and that not more than 3 percent, by 
weight, of all the raisins may be definitely dark berries.
    (c) ``Fairly well colored'' means that the raisins are fairly 
uniform in color and may range from yellow or greenish yellow to amber 
or light greenish amber and that not more than 6 percent, by weight, of 
all the raisins may be definitely dark berries.
    (d) ``Colored'' means that the raisins may be variable in color and 
may range from yellowish green to dark amber or dark greenish amber; 
that not more than 20 percent, by weight, of all the raisins may be 
definitely dark berries.
    (e) ``Definitely dark berries'' means raisins which are definitely 
darker than dark amber and characteristic of naturally ``raisined'' 
grapes.


<R05>
Sec. 52.1848  Sizes of golden seedless raisins.

    The size designations and measurement requirements for the 
respective

[[Page 583]]

sizes of Golden Seedless Raisins are the same as for Seedless Raisins 
(See Sec. 52.1845).


<R05>
Sec. 52.1849  Grades of golden seedless raisins.

    Except for color, the grades of Golden Seedless Raisins are the same 
as for Seedless Raisins (See Sec. 52.1846 and Table I).

                      Type III--Raisins With Seeds


<R05>
Sec. 52.1850  Sizes of raisins with seeds--except layer or cluster.

    The sizes of Raisins with Seeds--except for Layer or Cluster Raisins 
with Seeds, are not incorporated in the grades of the finished product 
since size, as such, is not a factor of quality for the purposes of 
these grades. The common size designations and measurement requirements 
applicable thereto include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (a) Seeded. (1) Select size raisins means that not more than 70 
percent, by weight, of the raisins will pass through round perforations 
\34/64\-inch in diameter; and not more than 5 percent, by weight, of the 
raisins will pass through round perforations \22/64\-inch in diameter.
    (2) Small or midget size raisins means that all of the raisins will 
pass through round perforations \34/64\-inch in diameter and not less 
than 90 percent, by weight, of all the raisins will pass through round 
perforations \22/64\-inch in diameter.
    (3) Mixed size raisins means a mixture which does not meet either 
the requirements for ``select'' size or for ``small'' (or ``midget'') 
size.
    (b) Unseeded. (1) 4 Crown means raisins that will not pass through 
round perforations \42/64\-inch in diameter.
    (2) 3 Crown means raisins that will pass through round perforations 
\42/64\-inch in diameter but will not pass through round perforations 
\34/64\-inch in diameter.
    (3) 2 Crown means raisins that will pass through round perforations 
\34/64\-inch in diameter but will not pass through round perforations 
\24/64\-inch in diameter.
    (4) 1 Crown means raisins that will pass through round perforations 
\24/64\-inch in diameter.


<R05>
Sec. 52.1851  Sizes of raisins with seeds--layer or cluster.

    The size of Layer or Cluster Raisins with Seeds is incorporated in 
the grades of the finished product. The size designation and measurement 
as applicable to layer or cluster raisins with seeds are:
    (a) 3 Crown size or larger. ``3 Crown size or larger'' in Layer or 
Cluster Raisins with Seeds means that the raisins, exclusive of stems 
and branches, are such a size that they will not pass through round 
perforations \34/64\-inch in diameter.


<R05>
Sec. 52.1852  Grades of raisins with seeds--except layer or cluster.

    (a) ``U.S. Grade A'' is the quality of Raisins with Seeds that have 
similar varietal characteristics; that have a good typical color with 
not more than 10 percent, by weight, that may be dark reddish-brown 
berries; that have a good characteristic flavor; that show development 
characteristics of raisins prepared from well-matured grapes; with not 
less than 80 percent, by weight, of raisins that are well-matured or 
reasonably well-matured; that contain not more than 18 percent, by 
weight, of moisture, except that any seeded raisins may contain not more 
than 19 percent, by weight, of moisture; and meet the additional 
requirements as outlined in Table II of this subpart.
    (b) ``U.S. Grade B'' is the quality of Raisins with Seeds that have 
similar varietal characteristics; that have a reasonably good typical 
color with not more than 15 percent, by weight, that may be dark 
reddish-brown berries; that have a good characteristic flavor; that show 
development characteristics of raisins prepared from reasonably well-
matured grapes; with not less than 70 percent, by weight, of raisins 
that are well-matured or reasonably well matured; that contain not more 
than 18 percent, by weight, of moisture, except that any seeded raisins 
may contain not more than 19 percent, by weight, of moisture; and meet 
the

[[Page 584]]

additional requirements as outlined in Table II of this subpart.
    (c) ``U.S. Grade C'' is the quality of Raisins with Seeds that have 
similar varietal characteristics; that have a fairly good typical color 
with not more than 20 percent, by weight, that may be dark reddish-brown 
berries; that have a fairly good flavor; that show development 
characteristics of raisins prepared from fairly well-matured grapes; 
that contain not more than 18 percent, by weight, of moisture, except 
that any seeded raisins may contain not more than 19 percent, by weight, 
of moisture; and meet the additional requirements as outlined in Table 
II of this subpart.
    (d) ``Substandard'' is the quality of Raisins with Seeds that fail 
to meet the requirements of U.S. Grade C.

    (a) Count-sizes. Except for U.S. Grade A or U.S. Fancy, the count-
sizes of dried prunes are not incorporated in the grades of dried 
prunes. The count-sizes of dried prunes in this subpart refer to the 
count (or number) of prunes per pound of dried prunes. The various sizes 
of dried prunes for the respective varietal types are commonly 
designated as follows, but may be designated by other numerical 
expressions:
    (1) Type I; Type IV. 30/40, 40/50, 50/60, 60/70, 70/80, 80/90, 90/
100, 100/120, 120 and over.

characteristics; that are fairly uniform in size; that meet the 
applicable moisture limits in Table IV of this subpart but regardless of 
size and kind of packaging are reasonably uniform in moisture; and that 
do not exceed the total allowances and limitations for defects shown in 
Table III of this subpart
    (d) ``Substandard'' is the quality of dried prunes that meet the 
applicable moisture limits in Table IV of this subpart but regardless of 
size and kind of packaging are reasonably uniform in moisture; and that 
may fail to meet other requirements for U.S. Grade C or U.S. Standard, 
but not more than 5 percent, by weight, of the dried prunes may be 
affected by mold, dirt, foreign material, insect infestation, or decay: 
Provided, That not more than 1 percent, by weight, of the dried prunes 
may be affected by decay.

                  Moisture, Uniformity of Size, Defects


<R05>
Sec. 52.3185  Moisture limits.

    Dried prunes shall not exceed the moisture limits for the applicable 
grades and kind and size of packaging as designated in Table IV of this 
subpart except there is no moisture limit when safe and suitable 
preservatives have been added. ``Moisture'' means the percentage by 
weight of the finished dried prunes, exclusive of pits, that is moisture 
when determined by the Dried Fruit Moisture Tester Method or in 
accordance with methods that give equivalent results. The moisture 
limits in Table IV apply only to so-called ``bulk packs'' of dried 
prunes packaged in non-hermetically sealed containers holding 10 pounds 
or more of dried prunes when safe and suitable preservatives have not 
been added. Such containers include, but are not limited to, wood boxes 
or fiber boxes.

and at 46 FR 63203, Dec. 31, 1981]


<R05>
Sec. 52.3186  Definitions for uniformity of size.

    (a) Fairly uniform in size. ``Fairly uniform in size'' means that in 
a sample of 100 ounces:
    (1) For prunes that average 53 prunes or less per pound, the count 
per pound of 10 ounces of the smallest prunes does not vary from the 
count per pound of 10 ounces of the largest prunes by more than 25 
points; or
    (2) For prunes that average 54 prunes or more per pound, the count 
per pound of 10 ounces of the smallest prunes does not vary from the 
count per pound of 10 ounces of the largest prunes by more than 45 
points.


<R05>
Sec. 52.3187  Definitions and explanations of defects.

    Dried prunes damaged or affected by the following are scorable as 
defects:
    (a) Off-color. ``Off-color'' means a skin color different from 
characteristic black, blue-black, reddish-purple, or other 
characteristic skin color for the type.
    (b) Poor texture. ``Poor texture'' means porous, woody, or fibrous 
flesh or immature prunes or prunes possessing flesh interspersed with 
excessive air pockets in which the texture of the flesh is noticeably 
different from the flesh of mature prunes which have been properly 
dried, handled, and processed. ``Excessive air pockets'' means that the 
prunes are affected by air pockets to the extent that the appearance and 
eating quality is seriously affected.
    (c) End cracks. ``End cracks'' means callous apex-end cracks which, 
singly or in the aggregate on a prune, are more than \3/8\ inch in 
length but not more than \1/2\ inch in length.
    (d) Skin or flesh damage. ``Skin or flesh damage'' in the case of 
``Whole Unpitted'' style means:
    (1) Callous growth cracks (other than callous apex-end cracks) 
which, singly

[[Page 591]]

or in the aggregate on a prune, exceed \3/8\ inch in length; and callous 
apex-end cracks which, singly or in the aggregate on a prune, exceed \1/
2\ inch in length.
    (2) Splits or skin breaks not having callous edges when the flesh is 
mashed out beyond the protecting skin so as to affect materially the 
normal appearance of the prune;
    (3) Any cracks, splits, or skin breaks open to the pit;
    (4) Any skin damage from multiple short skin breaks giving a very 
``rough'' appearance to the prune such as may result from over-dipping, 
rain damage, processing, or other causes which in Type I dried prunes 
affect materially the appearance or edibility of the prune, or which in 
other types or other mixtures affect markedly the appearance or 
edibility of the prune.
    (e) Fermentation. ``Fermentation'' means that the prune is fermented 
as evidenced by a distinct sour taste or odor or by darkening in color 
characteristic of fermentation or souring.
    (f) Scars. ``Scars'' mean:
    (1) Tough or thick scab which, singly or in combination on a prune, 
exceeds the area of a circle \3/8\ inch in diameter such as may result 
from thrip injury, mildew, leaf chafing, limb rubs, or other means; or
    (2) Scab which is not tough or thick and which, singly or in 
combination on a prune, exceeds the area of a circle \3/4\ inch in 
diameter and which is inconsequential but unsightly though practically 
blending in color with the skin on the portion of the prune not 
affected.
    (g) Heat damage. ``Heat damage'' means burning or scorching from the 
sun or in dehydration so as to damage materially the skin or flesh, or 
both, of the prune.
    (h) Insect injury. ``Insect injury'' means healed or unhealed 
surface blemishes and healed or unhealed blemishes extending into the 
flesh which affect materially the appearance, edibility, or keeping 
quality of the prune but which do not possess evidence of insect 
infestation.
    (i) Other means. ``Other means'' includes damage by any injury or 
defect or group of defects not specifically mentioned in this section 
which materially affects the appearance, edibility, or keeping quality 
of the fruit, but ``other means'' does not include defects of a nature 
such as defined in paragraph (j), (k), (l), (m), or (n) of this section.
    (j) Mold. ``Mold'' means a characteristic fungus growth as evidenced 
by a moldy or smutty condition and which, singly or in the aggregate on 
a prune, is equal to or exceeds the area of a circle \3/16\ inch in 
diameter.
    (k) Dirt. ``Dirt'' means the presence of any quantity of such 
substance, whether imbedded or adhering to the prune, which gives the 
prune a dirty, smudgy appearance and which may not be removed readily by 
washing.
    (l) Foreign material. ``Foreign material'' means leaves, twigs, 
pieces of wood, and similar extraneous materials which are 
objectionable.
    (m) Insect infestation. ``Insect infestation'' means the presence of 
dead insects, insect fragments, or insect remains. (No live insects are 
permitted).
    (n) Decay. ``Decay'' means a state of decomposition, wholly or in 
part, of the prune.

             Product Description, Types, Styles, and Grades


<R05>
Sec. 52.3751  Product description.

    Canned ripe olives are prepared from properly matured olives which 
have first been properly treated to remove the characteristic 
bitterness; are packed in a solution of sodium chloride, with or without 
spices, and are sufficiently processed by heat in hermetically sealed 
containers. Canned olives which are not oxidized in processing and which 
possess a tan to light bronze color indicative of preparation from 
olives of advanced maturity and commonly referred to as ``tree-ripened'' 
or ``home-cured'' are not covered by the standards in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 52.3752  Types of canned ripe olives.

    Canned ripe olives are processed as two distinct types. Unless a 
specific type is stated in this subpart, ``canned ripe olives'' refers 
to olives of either ``ripe-type'' or ``green-ripe type.''
    (a) Ripe type. ``Ripe type'' olives are those which have been 
treated and oxidized in processing to produce a typical dark brown to 
black color.
    (b) Green-ripe type. ``Green-ripe type'' olives are those which have 
not been oxidized in processing; which range in color from yellow-green; 
green-yellow or other greenish casts; and which may be mottled.

[[Page 593]]


<R05>
Sec. 52.3753  Styles of canned ripe olives.

    (a) Whole. ``Whole'' olives are those which have not been pitted.
    (b) Pitted. ``Pitted'' olives are those from which pits have been 
removed.
    (c) Halved. ``Halved'' olives are pitted olives in which each olive 
is cut lengthwise into two approximately equal parts.
    (d) Segmented. ``Segmented'' olives are pitted olives in which each 
olive is cut lengthwise into three or more approximately equal parts.
    (e) Sliced. ``Sliced'' olives consist of parallel slices of fairly 
uniform thickness prepared from pitted olives.
    (f) Chopped. ``Chopped'' olives are random-size cut pieces or cut 
bits prepared from pitted olives.
    (g) Broken pitted. ``Broken pitted'' olives consist substantially of 
large pieces that may have been broken in pitting but have not been 
sliced or cut.


<R05>
Sec. 52.3754  Size designations for whole and pitted styles.

    (a) General. (1) ``Average count'' for canned whole ripe olives is 
determined from all containers in the sample and is calculated on the 
basis of the drained weight of the olives.
    (2) Diameters of canned whole and pitted ripe olives are determined 
by measuring the smallest diameters at the largest circumferences at 
right angles to the longitudinal axes of the olives. The longitudinal 
axis is a line running from the stem to the apex of the olive.
    (b) Size determination. Size of canned whole or pitted olives shall 
conform to the applicable count per pound range indicated in Table I in 
the case of whole olives, or conform closely to the applicable 
illustration in Table I in the case of pitted olives. When the count per 
pound of whole olives falls between two count ranges, the size 
designation shall be the next smaller size.

<R05>
Sec. 52.3755  Minimum drained weights.

    (a) General. (1) The minimum drained weights for the various 
applicable styles in Table II and III are not incorporated in the grade 
of the finished product since drained weight, as such, is not a factor 
of quality for the purposes of these grades.
    (2) The minimum drained weights are based on equalization of the 
product 30 days or more after the product has been canned.
    (b) Method for determining drained weight. The drained weight of 
canned ripe olives is determined by emptying the contents of the 
container upon a U.S. Standard No. 8 circular sieve of proper diameter 
containing eight meshes to the inch (2.3 mm (0.0937 inch), 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>3 percent, square openings) so as to distribute the 
product evenly over the sieve. Without shifting the product, incline the 
sieve at an angle of 17 degrees to 20 degrees to facilitate drainage and 
allow to drain for 2 minutes. The weight of drained olives is the weight 
of the sieve and product less the weight of the dry sieve. A sieve 20 mm 
(8 inches) in diameter is used for containers with total contents of 1.5 
kg

[[Page 595]]

(3.3 lbs) and less, and a sieve 30 mm (12 inches) in diameter is used 
for containers with total contents greater than 1.5 kg (3.3 lbs).
    (c) Compliance with minimum drained weights. A lot of canned ripe 
olives is considered as meeting the minimum drained weights if the 
following criteria are met:
    (1) The average of the drained weights from all the sample units in 
the sample is equal to or greater than the acceptance value for drained 
weights for the size (designated as ``X<INF>2</INF>'' in Tables II and 
III); and
    (2) There shall be no unreasonable shortage in any individual 
container.

and amended at 48 FR 41013, Sept. 13, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 52.3757  Standard sample unit size.

    Compliance with requirements for the various quality factors except 
``size designation'' is based on the following standard sample unit size 
for the applicable style:
    (a) Whole and pitted--50 olives.
    (b) Halved--100 units.
    (c) All other styles--255 g (9 ounces).


<R05>
Sec. 52.3758  Determining the grade of a sample unit.

    (a) General. In addition to considering other requirements outlined 
in the standards the following quality factors are evaluated:
    (1) Factors not rated by score points. (i) Flavor; (ii) Uniformity 
of size (styles of whole and pitted only).
    (2) Factors rated by score points. The relative importance of each 
factor which is scored is expressed numerically on the scale of 100. The 
maximum

[[Page 597]]

number of points that may be given such factors are:

                                                                        
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                  Points
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(i) Color.......................................................      30
(ii) Absence of defects.........................................      40
(iii) Character.................................................      30
                                                                 -------
  Total score...................................................     100
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Definition of flavor--(1) Good flavor. (i) ``Good flavor'' in 
ripe type means a distinctive flavor characteristic of ripe type olives 
(including that of properly spiced olives) which have been properly 
prepared and processed and which are free from objectionable flavors of 
any kind.
    (ii) ``Good Flavor'' in green-ripe type means a distinctive mellow 
flavor characteristic of green-ripe type olives which have been properly 
prepared and processed and which are free from objectionable flavors of 
any kind.
    (2) Reasonably good flavor. ``Reasonably good flavor'' in either 
ripe type or green-ripe type (including that of properly spiced olives) 
means that the flavor may be slightly lacking in distinctly 
characteristic flavor for the respective type but the olives are free 
from objectionable flavors of any kind.


<R05>
Sec. 52.3759  Determining the rating for the factors which are scored.

    The essential variations within each factor which is scored are so 
described that the value may be determined for each factor and expressed 
numerically. The numerical range within each factor which is scored is 
inclusive (for example ``27 to 30 points'' means 27, 28, 29, and 30 
points).


<R05>
Sec. 52.3760  Color.

    (a) General. The evaluation of color shall be determined within five 
minutes after the olives are removed from the container and is based 
upon the uniformity of the exterior color or general appearance as to 
color of the olives within the container. The evaluation of color in 
``halved'' style is based on the uncut surfaces.
    (b) Color measurement of ripe type. The color of ripe type is 
determined by comparison with a spinning disc of variations in 
percentages of the following Munsell color discs: Red (5R 4/14), Yellow 
(2.5Y 8/12), and Black (N/1 Glossy).
    (c) Composite color standards. Composite USDA Color Standards for 
Canned Ripe Olives are available and are comparable to the colors 
produced by the spinning discs.
    (d) Color appearance of green-ripe type. Normal color for green-ripe 
type olives is yellow-green, green-yellow, or other greenish casts, any 
of which may have a mottled appearance that is typical of green-ripe 
type olives. Off-color means dark brown, dark purple or black olives.
    (e) The USDA spinning color discs and the USDA composite color 
standards cited in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are available 
from the USDA licensed supplier:

Munsell Color Company, Inc., 2441 North Calvert Street, Baltimore, Md. 
21218.

    (f) Grade A. Canned ripe olives that have a good color may be given 
a score of 27 to 30 points. ``Good color'' has the following meanings 
with respect to the applicable type and style:
    (1) Ripe type--(i) Whole; pitted; halved. The olives or units have a 
practically uniform black or dark brown color. Not less than 90 percent, 
by count, of the olives or units have a color equal to or darker than 
the appropriate USDA Composite Color Standard or that produced by 
spinning the Munsell discs specified in paragraph (b) of this section in 
the following combination: 3\1/2\ percent Red, 3\1/2\ percent Yellow, 
and 93 percent Black.
    (ii) Segmented; sliced, chopped. The general color impression of the 
olive as a mass is normal and typical of these styles prepared from 
olives with good color.
    (2) Green-ripe type. The general color appearance of the olives 
shall be normal. Not less than 90 percent, by count, shall be 
practically uniform in such normal color for the type, and no off-color 
olives may be present.
    (g) Grade B. If the canned ripe olives have a reasonably good color, 
a score of 24 to 26 points may be given. ``Reasonably good color'' has 
the following meanings with respect to the applicable type and style:
    (1) Ripe type--(i) Whole; pitted; halved. The olives or units have a 
reasonably

[[Page 598]]

uniform black, dark brown or reddish-brown color. Not less than 80 
percent, by count, of the olives or units have a color equal to or 
darker than the appropriate USDA Composite Color Standard or that 
produced by spinning the Munsell color discs specified in paragraph (b) 
of this section in the following combination: 6 percent Red, 6 percent 
Yellow, and 88 percent Black.
    (ii) Segmented; sliced; chopped. The general color impression of the 
olives as a mass is normal and typical of these styles prepared from 
olives with reasonably good color.
    (2) Green-ripe type. The general color appearance of the olives 
shall be normal. Not less than 80 percent, by count, shall be reasonably 
uniform in such normal color for the type, and no off-color olives may 
be present.
    (h) Grade C. If the ripe olives have a fairly good color, a score of 
21 to 23 points may be given. Canned ripe olives that fall into this 
classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade C regardless of the 
total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). ``Fairly good 
color'' has the following meanings with respect to the applicable type 
and style:
    (1) Ripe type--(i) Whole; pitted; halved. The olives or units have a 
fairly uniform black, dark brown or reddish-brown color. Not less than 
60 percent, by count, of the olives or units have a color equal to or 
darker than the appropriate USDA Composite Color Standard or that 
produced by spinning the Munsell color discs specified in paragraph (b) 
of this section in the following combination: 6 percent Red, 6 percent 
Yellow, and 88 percent Black.
    (ii) Segmented; sliced; chopped. The general color impression of the 
olives as a mass is normal and typical of these styles prepared from 
olives of fairly good color.
    (iii) Broken pitted. The general color impression of the olives as a 
mass is normal and may be variable, but is typical of this style 
prepared from olives of good, reasonably good, or fairly good color.
    (2) Green-ripe type. The general color impression of the olives 
shall be normal but may vary markedly for the type. No more than 10 
percent, by count, of off-color olives may be present.
    (i) Substandard (SStd.). Canned ripe olives that are abnormal in 
color for any reason or that fail to meet the requirements of paragraph 
(h) of this section may be given a score of 0 to 20 points and shall not 
be graded above Substandard, regardless of the total score for the 
product (this is a limiting rule).


<R05>
Sec. 52.3761  Defects.

    (a) General. The factor of absence of defects refers to the degree 
of freedom from harmless extraneous vegetable material, stems, and 
portions thereof, blemishes, wrinkles, mutilated olives, and from any 
other defects which affect the appearance or edibility of the product.
    (b) Definition of defects--(1) Blemishes mean dark-colored surface 
marks in either ripe type or green-ripe olives which may or may not 
penetrate into the flesh. Olives or pieces of olives affected by 
blemishes are classified as follows:
    (i) Minor blemishes mean surface discolorations on olives or pieces 
of olives which individually or collectively materially affect the 
appearance of the unit.
    (ii) Major blemishes mean surface discolorations or black flesh 
(oxidized) on olives or pieces of olives which may or may not be 
associated with a soft texture below the skin and which individually or 
collectively seriously affect the appearance or edibility of the unit.
    (iii) Severe blemishes mean dark brown, dark purple, or black 
surface areas on olives or pieces of olives of the green-ripe type; or 
any other blemishes, whether or not specifically defined, which severely 
affect the appearance or edibility of the unit.
    (2) Blowout refers to a soft pitted olive in which the pit has been 
pushed out instead of cut out leaving an irregular ring of flesh that 
materially affects its appearance.
    (3) Broken piece in halved, segmented, and sliced style olives means 
any piece of olive flesh that appears to be less than three-fourths of a 
full unit. Also included are poorly cut units and end slices less than 
one-half the average size slice.

[[Page 599]]

    (4) Cross pitted refers to olives pitted along an axis other than 
the stem-flower axis. A defect is a unit where the angle of these two 
axes exceeds 45 degrees.
    (5) Harmless extraneous vegetable material. Harmless extraneous 
vegetable material (HEVM), harmless extraneous material (HEM), and 
extraneous vegetable material (EVM), are synonymous terms and mean any 
vegetable substance that is harmless.
    (6) Mechanically damaged means a unit in whole, pitted, and halved 
styles that is punctured, cut or damaged by means other than pitting so 
that its appearance is materially affected.
    (7) Misshapen refers to an olive that does not have a normal shape 
for a given variety.
    (8) Mutilated refers to an olive in whole or pitted styles that is 
so pitter-torn or damaged by other means that the entire pit cavity is 
exposed or the appearance of the olive is seriously affected.
    (9) Obvious split pit means a pit in an olive that can be determined 
visually as split.
    (10) Pitter damage means a loss of skin and flesh from a pitted 
olive caused by the pitter on the cut end exceeding the area of a circle 
3 mm in diameter but is not mutilated.
    (11) Plunger damage means a loss of skin and flesh from a pitted 
olive equal to or exceeding the area of a circle 5 mm in diameter.
    (12) Stem means a stem that measures 3 mm or more from the shoulder 
of the olive. Stems are classified as follows:
    (i) Minor stem is a stem that measures more than 3 mm but not more 
than 4 mm from the shoulder of the olive.
    (ii) Major stem is a stem that measures more than 4 mm from the 
shoulder of the olive.
    (iii) Detached stem, when it measures 4 mm or more, is a defect 
which shall be scored as a minor stem for whole pitted, halved, and 
broken pitted style olives and a major stem for segmented, sliced, and 
chopped style olives.
    (13) Wrinkles are grooves 0.5 mm or more in width. Classification of 
wrinkles shall be determined immediately after removing surface moisture 
and any increase in wrinkles due to dehydration after removing from the 
container shall not be considered. Olives or pieces of olives affected 
by wrinkles are classified as follows:
    (i) Minor wrinkles are wrinkles which collectively do not more than 
materially affect the appearance of the unit.
    (ii) Major wrinkles are wrinkles which collectively more than 
materially affect the appearance of the unit.
    (c) Grade A. Canned ripe olives of whole, pitted, halved, segmented, 
sliced, and chopped styles that are practically free from defects may be 
given a score of 36 to 40 points. ``Practically free from defects'' 
means that any defects present, but not specifically limited in Table 
IV, may not more than slightly affect the appearance or edibility of the 
olives; and, in addition, specified defects may be present in all other 
styles except ``broken pitted'' not to exceed the allowances for grade A 
provided in Table IV.
    (d) Grade B. If canned ripe olives of whole, pitted, halved, 
segmented, sliced, and chopped styles are reasonably free from defects, 
a score of 32 to 35 points may be given. Canned ripe olives that fall 
into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade B 
regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). 
``Reasonably free from defects'' means that any defects present but not 
specifically limited in Table V may not more than materially affect the 
appearance or edibility of the olives; and in addition, specified 
defects may be present in all other styles except ``broken pitted'' not 
to exceed the allowances for grade B provided in Table V.
    (e) Grade C. If canned ripe olives of whole, pitted, halved, 
segmented, sliced, chopped, and broken pitted styles are fairly free 
from defects, a score of 28 to 31 points may be given. Canned ripe 
olives that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. 
Grade C, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a 
limiting rule). ``Fairly free from defects'' means that any defects 
present but not specifically limited in Table VI may more than 
materially affect the appearance and edibility of the olives; and in 
addition, specified defects may be present in all other styles not to 
exceed the allowances for grade C provided in Table VI.

[[Page 600]]

    (f) Substandard (SStd.). Canned ripe olives that fail to meet the 
requirements of paragraph (e) of this section may be given a score of 0 
to 27 points and shall not be graded above Substandard, regardless of 
the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).

Sec. 52.3762  Character.

    (a) General. The factor of character refers to the firmness, 
tenderness, and texture characteristics for the variety and type.
    (b) Grade A. Canned ripe olives of whole, pitted, halved, segmented, 
sliced, and chopped styles that have a good character may be given a 
score of 27 to 30 points. ``Good character'' means that, for the type, 
the olives have a fleshy texture characteristic for the variety and 
size; that not less than 95 percent, by count, of whole, pitted and 
halved olives and by weight of other style olives are practically 
uniform in texture and are tender but not soft. The remaining 5 percent 
may be soft but not excessively soft.
    (c) Grade B. If canned ripe olives of whole, pitted, halved, 
segmented, sliced and chopped styles have a reasonably good character, a 
score of 24 to 26 points may be given. Canned ripe olives that fall into 
this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade B regardless of 
the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). ``Reasonably 
good character'' means that, for the type, the olives generally have a 
fleshy texture characteristic for the variety and size; that not less 
than 90 percent, by count, of whole, pitted and halved olives, and by 
weight of other style olives are practically uniform in texture and are 
tender but not soft. The 10 percent may be soft but not more than \1/2\, 
or 5 percent, may be excessively soft.
    (d) Grade C. If canned ripe olives of whole, pitted, halved, 
segmented, sliced, chopped and broken pitted styles have a fairly good 
character, a score of 21 to 23 points may be given. Canned ripe olives 
that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade 
C regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting 
rule). ``Fairly good character'' means that the olives generally have a 
fleshy texture characteristic for the variety and size; that not less 
than 80 percent, by count, of whole, pitted and halved olives and by 
weight of other style olives are practically uniform in texture and are 
tender but not soft. The remaining 20 percent may be soft but not more 
than \1/2\, or 10 percent, may be excessively soft.
    (e) Substandard (SStd). Canned ripe olives that fail to meet the 
requirements of paragraph (d) of this section may be given a score of 0 
to 20 points and shall not be graded above Substandard, regardless of 
the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).
