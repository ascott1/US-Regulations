              the Federal Register (44 U.S.C. 1510).

          It is prohibited to use NARA's official seal and the stylized Code 
              of Federal Regulations logo on any republication of this 
              material without the express, written permission of the 
              Archivist of the United States or the Archivist's designee. 
              Any person using NARA's official seals and logos in a manner 
              inconsistent with the provisions of 36 CFR part 1200 is 
              subject to the penalties specified in 18 U.S.C. 506, 701, and

                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2008), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

regulations implementing the Federal acquisition regulations in chapter 
1 and are numerically keyed to them. Parts 70 to 99 in chapters 2 
through 99 contain agency regulations supplementing the Federal 
acquisition regulations.

Washington, DC 20301-3062; datafax (703) 602-0350:

    I. PROBLEM: Succinctly state the problem created by current FAR and/
or DFARS coverage and describe the factual and/or legal reasons 
necessitating the change to the regulation.
    II. Recommendation: Identify the FAR and/or DFARS citations to be 
revised. Attach as TAB A a copy of the text of the existing coverage, 
conformed to include the proposed additions and deletions. Indicate 
deleted coverage with dashed lines through the current words being 
deleted and insert proposed language in brackets at the appropriate 
locations within the existing coverage. If the proposed deleted portion 
is extensive, it may be outlined by lines forming a box with diagonal 
lines drawn connecting the corners.
    III. Discussion: Include a complete, convincing explanation of why 
the change is necessary and how the recommended revision will solve the 
problem. Address advantages and disadvantages of the proposed revision, 
as well as any cost or administrative impact on Government activities 
and contractors. Identify any potential impact of the change on 
automated systems, e.g., automated financial and procurement systems. 
Provide any other background information that would be helpful in 
explaining the issue.
    IV. Collaterals: Address the need for public comment (FAR 1.301(b) 
and subpart 1.5), the Paperwork Reduction Act, and the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (FAR 1.301(c)).
    V. Deviations: If a recommended revision of DFARS is a FAR 
deviation, identify the deviation and include under separate TAB a 
justification for the deviation that addresses the requirements of 
201.402(2). The justification should be in the form of a memorandum for 
the Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy, Office of 
the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics).

    (ii) The public may offer proposed revisions of FAR or DFARS by 
submission of a memorandum, in the format (including all of the 
information) prescribed in paragraph (d)(i) of this subsection, to the 
Director of the DAR Council.

201.301  Policy.

    (a)(1) DoD implementation and supplementation of the FAR is issued 
in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) under 
authorization and subject to the authority, direction, and control of 
the Secretary of Defense. The DFARS contains--
    (i) Requirements of law;
    (ii) DoD-wide policies;
    (iii) Delegations of FAR authorities;
    (iv) Deviations from FAR requirements; and
    (v) Policies/procedures that have a significant effect beyond the 
internal operating procedures of DoD or a significant cost or 
administrative impact on contractors or offerors.
    (2) Relevant procedures, guidance, and information that do not meet 
the criteria in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are issued in the DFARS 
Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI).
    (b) When Federal Register publication is required for any policy, 
procedure, clause, or form, the department or agency requesting Under 
Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (USD 
(AT&L)) approval for use of the policy, procedure, clause, or form (see 
201.304(1)) must include an analysis of the public comments in the 
request for approval.

[[Page 9]]


<R05>
201.303  Publication and codification.

    (a)(i) The DFARS is codified under chapter 2 in title 48, Code of 
Federal Regulations.
    (ii) To the extent possible, all DFARS text (whether implemental or 
supplemental) is numbered as if it were implemental. Supplemental 
numbering is used only when the text cannot be integrated intelligibly 
with its FAR counterpart.
    (A) Implemental numbering is the same as its FAR counterpart, except 
when the text exceeds one paragraph, the subdivisions are numbered by 
skipping a unit in the FAR 1.105-2(b)(2) prescribed numbering sequence. 
For example, three paragraphs implementing FAR 19.501 would be numbered 
219.501 (1), (2), and (3) rather than (a), (b), and (c). Three 
paragraphs implementing FAR 19.501(a) would be numbered 219.501(a) (i), 
(ii), and (iii) rather than (a) (1), (2), and (3). Further subdivision 
of the paragraphs follows the prescribed numbering sequence, e.g., 
219.501(1)(i)(A)(1)(i).
    (B) Supplemental numbering is the same as its FAR counterpart, with 
the addition of a number of 70 and up or (S-70) and up. Parts, subparts, 
sections, or subsections are supplemented by the addition of a number of 
70 and up. Lower divisions are supplemented by the addition of a number 
of (S-70) and up. When text exceeds one paragraph, the subdivisions are 
numbered using the FAR 1.105-2(b)(2) prescribed sequence, without 
skipping a unit. For example, DFARS text supplementing FAR 19.501 would 
be numbered 219.501-70. Its subdivisions would be numbered 219.501-70 
(a), (b), and (c).
    (C) Subdivision numbering below the 4th level does not repeat the 
numbering sequence. It uses italicized Arabic numbers and then 
italicized lower case Roman numerals.
    (D) An example of DFARS numbering is in Table 1-1, DFARS Numbering.
    (iii) Department/agency and component supplements must parallel the 
FAR and DFARS numbering, except department/agency supplemental numbering 
uses subsection numbering of 90 and up, instead of 70 and up.

filling higher positions, these oversight duties shall not be accrued at 
the top.

conducted to assess and improve acquisition and management processes, 
roles, and structures. The scope of the reviews should include--
    (1) Distribution of acquisition roles and responsibilities among 
personnel;
    (2) Processes for reporting concerns about unusual or inappropriate 
actions; and

[[Page 16]]

    (3) Application of DoD Instruction 5000.2, Operation of the Defense 
Acquisition System, and the disciplines in the Defense Acquisition 
Guidebook.
    (d) Source selection processes shall be--
    (1) Reviewed and approved by cognizant organizations responsible for 
oversight;
    (2) Documented by the head of the contracting activity or at the 
agency level; and
    (3) Periodically reviewed by outside officials independent of that 
office or agency.
    (e) Legal review of documentation of major acquisition system source 
selection shall be conducted prior to contract award, including the 
supporting documentation of the source selection evaluation board, 
source selection advisory council, and source selection authority.
    (f) Procurement management reviews shall determine whether clearance 
threshold authorities are clear and that independent review is provided 
for acquisitions exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.

    (A) Any future awards provided for under the terms of the 
predecessor contract (e.g., issuance of orders or exercise of options) 
will be accomplished under the continued contract; and
    (B) Supplies and services already acquired under the predecessor 
contract shall remain solely under that contract for purposes of 
Government inspection, acceptance, payment, and closeout; and
    (ii) Follow the procedures at PGI 204.7001(c).

[71 FR 27640, May 12, 2006]


<R05>
204.7002  Procedures.

    (a) In assigning PII numbers--
    (1) Use only the alpha-numeric characters, as prescribed in this 
subpart; and
    (2) Do not use the letter ``I'' or ``O''.
    (b) If department/agency procedures require other identification on 
the solicitation, contract, or other related instrument forms, enter it 
in such a location so as to separate it clearly from the PII number.
    (c) Enter the basic PII number, including Federal supply contract 
numbers and any supplementary numbers, in the spaces provided on the 
solicitation, contract, or related instrument forms. Separate the major 
elements by dashes, e.g., N00023-90-D-0009 (not necessary in electronic 
transmission). If there is no space provided on the form, enter the 
number in the upper right corner of the form and identify what it is 
(e.g., Supplementary Number N00023-90-F-0120).

<R05>
204.7004  Supplementary PII numbers.

    (a) Uses of the supplementary number. Use supplementary numbers with 
the basic PII number, to identify--
    (1) Amendments to solicitations;
    (2) Modifications to contracts and agreements, including provisioned 
item orders; and
    (3) Calls or orders under contracts, basic ordering agreements, or 
blanket purchase agreements, issued by the contracting office or by a 
DoD activity other than the contracting office, including DoD orders 
against Federal supply schedules.
    (b) Amendments to solicitations. Number amendments to solicitations 
sequentially using a four position numeric serial number added to the 
basic PII number and beginning with 0001, e.g., N00062-91-R-1234-0001.
    (c) Modifications to contracts and agreements. (1) Number 
modifications to contracts and agreements using a six position alpha-
numeric added to the basic PII number.
    (2) Position 1. Identify the office issuing the modification--
    (i) Contract administration office--A
    (ii) Contracting office--P
    (3) Positions 2 through 3. These are the first two digits in a 
serial number. They may be either alpha or numeric. Use the letters K, 
L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, or Z only in the second position and 
only in the following circumstances--
    (i) Use K, L, M, N, P, and Q in the second position only if the 
modification is issued by the Air Force and is a provisioned item order.
    (ii) Use S, and only S, in the second position to identify 
modifications issued to provide initial or amended shipping instructions 
when--
    (A) The contract has either FOB origin or destination delivery 
terms; and
    (B) The price changes.
    (iii) Use T, U, V, W, X, or Y, and only those characters, in the 
second position to identify modifications issued to provide initial or 
amended shipping instructions when--
    (A) The contract has FOB origin delivery terms; and
    (B) The price does not change.
    (iv) Only use Z in the second position to identify a modification 
which definitizes a letter contract.
    (4) Positions 4 through 6. These positions are always numeric. Use a 
separate series of serial numbers for each type of modification listed 
in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Examples of proper numbering for 
positions 2-6 (the first position will be either ``A'' or ``P'') are as 
follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (5) If the contract administration office is changing the contract 
administration or disbursement office for the first time and is using 
computer generated modifications to notify many offices, it uses the six 
position supplementary number ARZ999. If either office has to be changed 
again during the life of the contract, the supplementary number will be 
ARZ998, and on down as needed.
    (6) Each office authorized to issue modifications shall assign the 
supplementary identification numbers in sequence. Do not assign the 
numbers until it has been determined that a modification is to be 
issued.
    (d) Delivery orders under indefinite delivery contracts, orders 
under basic ordering agreements, and calls under blanket purchase 
agreements. (1) Calls or orders issued by the office issuing the 
contract or agreement. Use a four position alpha-numeric call or order 
serial number added to the basic PII number. These shall be identified 
by using serial numbers beginning 0001 through 9999. When the numeric 
identifiers run out, use alpha characters in the third and fourth 
positions. Never use alpha characters in the first and second positions.
    (2) Orders placed against another activity's contract or agreement.
    (i) If the office placing the order or call is different from the 
office identified in the basic PII number, assign a serial number to the 
order or call. The first and second positions contain the call/order 
code assigned to the ordering office in accordance with 204.7005. Do not 
use the letters A or P in the first position. The third and fourth 
positions are a two position serial number assigned by the ordering 
office. The series will begin with 01. When the numbers exceed 99, the 
office will assign a uniform series of identifiers containing alpha and/
or numeric characters, e.g., Basic <greek-i>: N00383-91-D-0001 serial 
<greek-i>: TU01.
    (ii) If an office is placing calls or orders with NIB, NISH, or 
UNICOR, the office shall identify the instrument with a 13 position 
supplementary PII number using an F in the 9th position. Modifications 
to these calls or orders shall be numbered in accordance with paragraph 
(c) of this section, e.g., Order <greek-i>: DLA100-91-F-0001 
modification <greek-i>: A00001.
    (e) Modifications to calls or orders. Use a two position alpha-
numeric suffix, known as a call or order modification indicator, to 
identify a modification to a call or order.
    (1) Modifications to a call or order issued by a purchasing office 
begin with 01, 02, and so on through 99, then B1 through B9, BA through 
BZ, C1 through C9, and so on through ZZ.
    (2) Modifications to a call or order issued by a contract 
administration office begin with 1A, 1B, and so on through 9Z, followed 
by A1, A2, and so on to A9, then AA, AB, and so on through AZ.

       Subpart 204.71_Uniform Contract Line Item Numbering System


<R05>
204.7100  Scope.

    This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for assigning 
contract line item numbers.


<R05>
204.7101  Definitions.

    Accounting classification reference number (ACRN) means any 
combination of a two position alpha/numeric code used as a method of 
relating the accounting classification citation to detailed line item 
information contained in the schedule.
    Attachment means any documentation, appended to a contract or 
incorporated by reference, which does not establish a requirement for 
deliverables.
    Definitized item, as used in this subpart, means an item for which a 
firm price has been established in the basic contract or by 
modification.
    Exhibit means a document, referred to in a contract, which is 
attached and establishes requirements for deliverables. The term shall 
not be used to refer to any other kind of attachment to a contract. The 
DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List, is always an exhibit, 
rather than an attachment.
    Nonseverable deliverable, as used in this subpart, means a 
deliverable item that is a single end product or undertaking, entire in 
nature, that cannot be feasibly subdivided into discrete elements or 
phases without losing its identity.
    Undefinitized item, as used in this subpart, means an item for which 
a price has not been established in the basic contract or by 
modification.

    (1) Solicitations;
    (2) Solicitation line and subline item numbers;
    (3) Contracts as defined in FAR Subpart 2.1;
    (4) Contract line and subline item numbers;
    (5) Exhibits;
    (6) Exhibit line and subline items; and
    (7) Any other document expected to become part of the contract.
    (b) The numbering procedures are mandatory for all contracts where 
separate contract line item numbers are assigned, unless--
    (1) The contract is an indefinite-delivery type for petroleum 
products against which posts, camps, and stations issue delivery orders 
for products to be consumed by them; or
    (2) The contract is a communications service authorization issued by 
the Defense Information Systems Agency's Defense Information Technology 
Contracting Organization.

<R05>
204.7103  Contract line items.


<R05>
204.7103-1  Criteria for establishing.

    Contracts shall identify the items or services to be acquired as 
separate contract line items unless it is not feasible to do so.
    (a) Contract line items shall have all four of the following 
characteristics; however, there are exceptions within the 
characteristics, which may make establishing a separate contract line 
item appropriate even though one of the characteristics appears to be 
missing--
    (1) Single unit price. The item shall have a single unit price or a 
single total price, except--
    (i) If the item is not separately priced (NSP) but the price is 
included in the unit price of another contract line item, enter NSP 
instead of the unit price;
    (ii) When there are associated subline items, established for other 
than informational reasons, and those subline items are priced in 
accordance with 204.7104;
    (iii) When the items or services are being acquired on a cost-
reimbursement contract;
    (iv) When the contract is for maintenance and repair services (e.g., 
a labor hour contract) and firm prices have been established for 
elements of the total price of an item but the actual number and 
quantity of the elements are not known until performance. The 
contracting officer may structure these contracts to reflect a firm or 
estimated total amount for each line item;
    (v) When the contract line item is established to refer to an 
exhibit or an attachment (if management needs dictate that a unit price 
be entered, the price shall be set forth in the item description block 
and enclosed in parentheses); or
    (vi) When the contract is an indefinite delivery type contract and 
provides that the price of an item shall be determined at the time a 
delivery order is placed and the price is influenced by such factors as 
the quantity ordered (e.g., 10-99 @ $1.00, 100-249 @ $.98, 250+ @ $.95), 
the destination, the FOB point, or the type of packaging required.
    (2) Separately identifiable. A contract line item must be identified 
separately from any other items or services on the contract.
    (i) Supplies are separately identifiable if they have no more than 
one--
    (A) National stock number (NSN);
    (B) Item description; or
    (C) Manufacturer's part number.
    (ii) Services are separately identifiable if they have no more than 
one--
    (A) Scope of work; or
    (B) Description of services.
    (iii) This requirement does not apply if there are associated 
subline items, established for other than informational reasons, and 
those subline items include the actual detailed identification in 
accordance with 204.7104. Where this exception applies, use a general 
narrative description instead of the contract item description.
    (3) Separate delivery schedule. Each contract line item or service 
shall have its own delivery schedule, period of performance, or 
completion date expressly stated (``as required'' constitutes an 
expressly stated delivery term).
    (i) The fact that there is more than one delivery date, destination, 
performance date, or performance point may be a determining factor in 
the decision as to whether to establish more than one contract line 
item.
    (ii) If a contract line item has more than one destination or 
delivery date, the contracting officer may create individual contract 
line items for the different destinations or delivery dates, or may 
specify the different delivery dates for the units by destination in the 
delivery schedule.
    (4) Single accounting classification citation. (i) Each contract 
line item shall reference a single accounting classification citation 
except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this subsection.
    (ii) The use of multiple accounting classification citations for a 
contract line item is authorized in the following situations:
    (A) A single, nonseverable deliverable to be paid for with R&D or 
other funds properly incrementally obligated over several fiscal years 
in accordance with DoD policy;

[[Page 26]]

    (B) A single, nonseverable deliverable to be paid for with different 
authorizations or appropriations, such as in the acquisition of a 
satellite or the modification of production tooling used to produce 
items being acquired by several activities; or
    (C) A modification to an existing contract line item for a 
nonseverable deliverable that results in the delivery of a modified 
item(s) where the item(s) and modification are to be paid for with 
different accounting classification citations.
    (iii) When the use of multiple accounting classification citations 
is authorized for a single contract line item, establish informational 
subline items for each accounting classification citation in accordance 
with 204.7104-1(a).
    (b) All subline items and exhibit line items under one contract line 
item shall be the same contract type as the contract line item.
    (c) For a contract that contains a combination of fixed-price line 
items, time-and-materials/labor-hour line items, and/or cost-
reimbursement line items, identify the contract type for each contract 
line item in Section B, Supplies or Services and Prices/Costs, to 
facilitate appropriate payment.
    (d) Exhibits may be used as an alternative to putting a long list of 
contract line items in the schedule. If exhibits are used, create a 
contract line item citing the exhibit's identifier. See 204.7105(a).
    (e) If the contract involves a test model or a first article which 
must be approved, establish a separate contract line item or subline 
item for each item of supply or service which must be approved. If the 
test model or first article consists of a lot composed of a mixture of 
items, a single line item or subline item may be used for the lot.
    (f) If a supply or service involves ancillary functions, like 
packaging and handling, transportation, payment of state or local taxes, 
or use of reusable containers, and these functions are normally 
performed by the contractor and the contractor is normally entitled to 
reimbursement for performing these functions, do not establish a 
separate contract line item solely to account for these functions. 
However, do identify the functions in the contract schedule. If the 
offeror separately prices these functions, contracting officers may 
establish separate contract line items for the functions; however, the 
separate line items must conform to the requirements of paragraph (a) of 
this subsection.

    Follow the procedures at PGI 204.7103-2 for numbering contract line 
items.

[70 FR 58983, Oct. 11, 2005]


<R05>
204.7104  Contract subline items.


<R05>
204.7104-1  Criteria for establishing.

    Contract subline items provide flexibility to further identify 
elements within a contract line item for tracking performance or 
simplifying administration. There are only two kinds of subline items: 
those which are informational in nature and those which consist of more 
than one item that requires separate identification.
    (a) Informational subline items. (1) This type of subline item 
identifies information that relates directly to the contract line item 
and is an integral part of it (e.g., parts of an assembly or parts of a 
kit). These subline items shall not be scheduled separately for 
delivery, identified separately for shipment or performance, or priced 
separately for payment purposes.
    (2) The informational subline item may include quantities, prices, 
or amounts, if necessary to satisfy management requirements. However, 
these elements shall be included within the item description in the 
supplies/services column and enclosed in parentheses to prevent 
confusing them with quantities, prices, or amounts that have contractual 
significance. Do not enter these elements in the quantity and price 
columns.
    (3) Informational subline items shall be used to identify each 
accounting classification citation assigned to a single contract line 
item number when use of multiple citations is authorized (see 204.7103-
1(a)(4)(ii)).
    (b) Separately identified subline items. (1) Subline items will be 
used instead

[[Page 27]]

of contract line items to facilitate payment, delivery tracking, 
contract funds accounting, or other management purposes. Such subline 
items shall be used when items bought under one contract line item 
number--
    (i) Are to be paid for from more than one accounting classification. 
A subline item shall be established for the quantity associated with the 
single accounting classification citation. Establish a line item rather 
than a subline item if it is likely that a subline item may be assigned 
additional accounting classification citations at a later date. Identify 
the funding as described in 204.7104-1(a)(3);
    (ii) Are to be packaged in different sizes, each represented by its 
own NSN;
    (iii) Have collateral costs, such as packaging costs, but those 
costs are not a part of the unit price of the contract line item;
    (iv) Have different delivery dates or destinations or requisitions, 
or a combination of the three; or
    (v) Identify parts of an assembly or kit which--
    (A) Have to be separately identified at the time of shipment or 
performance; and
    (B) Are separately priced.
    (2) Each separately identified contract subline item shall have its 
own--
    (i) Delivery schedule, period of performance, or completion date;
    (ii) Unit price or single total price or amount (not separately 
priced (NSP) is acceptable as an entry for price or amount if the price 
is included in another subline item or a different contract line item). 
This requirement does not apply--
    (A) If the subline item was created to refer to an exhibit or an 
attachment. If management needs dictate that a unit price be entered, 
the price shall be set forth in the item description block of the 
schedule and enclosed in parentheses; or
    (B) In the case of indefinite delivery contracts described at 
204.7103-1(a)(1)(vi).
    (iii) Identification (e.g., NSN, item description, manufacturer's 
part number, scope of work, description of services).
    (3) Unit prices and extended amounts.
    (i) The unit price and total amount for all subline items may be 
entered at the contract line item number level if the unit price for the 
subline items is identical. If there is any variation, the subline item 
unit prices shall be entered at the subline item level only.
    (ii) The unit price and extended amounts may be entered at the 
subline items level.
    (iii) The two methods in paragraphs (b)(3) (i) and (ii) of this 
subsection shall not be combined in a contract line item.
    (iv) When the price for items not separately priced is included in 
the price of another subline item or contract line item, it may be 
necessary to withhold payment on the priced subline item until all the 
related subline items that are not separately priced have been 
delivered. In those cases, use the clause at 252.204-7002, Payment for 
Subline Items Not Separately Priced.

204.7106  Contract modifications.

    (a) If new items are added, assign new contract line or subline item 
numbers or exhibit line item numbers, in accordance with the procedures 
established at 204.7103, 204.7104, and 204.7105.
    (b) Modifications to existing contract line items or exhibit line 
items. (1) If the modification relates to existing contract line items 
or exhibit line items, the modification shall refer to those item 
numbers.
    (2) If the contracting officer decides to assign new identifications 
to existing contract or exhibit line items, the following rules apply--

[[Page 28]]

    (i) Definitized and undefinitized items. (A) The original line item 
or subline item number may be used if the modification applies to the 
total quantity of the original line item or subline.
    (B) The original line item or subline item number may be used if the 
modification makes only minor changes in the specifications of some of 
the items ordered on the original line item or subline item and the 
resulting changes in unit price can be averaged to provide a new single 
unit price for the total quantity. If the changes in the specifications 
make the item significantly distinguishable from the original item or 
the resulting changes in unit price cannot be averaged, create a new 
line item.
    (C) If the modification affects only a partial quantity of an 
existing contract or exhibit line item or subline item and the change 
does not involve either the delivery date or the ship-to/mark-for data, 
the original contract or exhibit line item or subline item number shall 
remain with the unchanged quantity. Assign the changed quantity the next 
available number.
    (ii) Undefinitized items. In addition to the rules in paragraph 
(b)(2)(i), the following additional rules apply to undefinitized items--
    (A) If the modification is undefinitized and increases the quantity 
of an existing definitized item, assign the undefinitized quantity the 
next available number.
    (B) If the modification increases the quantity of an existing 
undefinitized item, the original contract or exhibit line item or 
subline item may be used if the unit price for the new quantity is 
expected to be the same as the price for the original quantity. If the 
unit prices of the two quantities will be different, assign the new 
quantity the next available number.
    (C) If the modification both affects only a partial quantity of the 
existing contract or exhibit line or subline item and definitizes the 
price for the affected portion, the definitized portion shall retain the 
original item number. If there is any undefinitized portion of the item, 
assign it the next available number. However, if the modification 
definitizes the price for the whole quantity of the line item, and price 
impact of the changed work can be apportioned equally over the whole to 
arrive at a new unit price, the quantity with the changes can be added 
into the quantity of the existing item.
    (D) If the modification affects only a partial quantity of an 
existing contract or exhibit line or subline item but does not change 
the delivery schedule or definitize price, the unchanged portion shall 
retain the original contract or exhibit line or subline item number. 
Assign the changed portion the next available number.
    (3) If the modification will decrease the amount obligated--
    (i) There shall be coordination between the administrative and 
procuring contracting offices before issuance of the modification; and
    (ii) The contracting officer shall not issue the modification unless 
sufficient unliquidated obligation exists or the purpose is to recover 
monies owed to the Government.

204.7200  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes uniform policies and procedures for 
identification of commercial and Government entities when it is 
necessary to--
    (a) Exchange data with another contracting activity, including 
contract administration activities and contract payment activities, or 
comply with the reporting requirements of subpart 204.6; or
    (b) Identify contractors for the purpose of developing computerized 
acquisition systems or solicitation mailing lists.

[64 FR 43099, Aug. 9, 1999]


<R05>
204.7201  Definitions.

    (a) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code means--
    (1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service 
(DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or
    (2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO) that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master 
file. This type of code is known as an ``NCAGE code.''
    (b) Contractor identification code means a code that the contracting 
office uses to identify an offeror. The three types of contractor 
identification codes are CAGE codes, Data Universal Numbering System 
(DUNS) numbers, and Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINs).

<R05>
204.7202  General.


<R05>
204.7202-1  CAGE codes.

    (a) DLIS assigns or records and maintains CAGE codes to identify 
commercial and Government entities. DoD 4000.25-5-M, Military Standard 
Contract Administration Procedures (MILSCAP), and Volume 7 of DoD 
4100.39-M, Federal Logistics Information System (FLIS) Procedures 
Manual, prescribe use of CAGE codes.
    (b)(1) If a prospective contractor located in the United States must 
register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database (see FAR 
Subpart 4.11) and does not have a CAGE code, DLIS will assign a CAGE 
code when the prospective contractor submits its request for 
registration in the CCR database. Foreign registrants must obtain a 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization CAGE (NCAGE) code in order to 
register in the CCR database. NCAGE codes may be obtained from the 
Codification Bureau in the foreign registrant's country. Additional 
information on obtaining NCAGE codes is available at http://
www.dlis.dla.mil/Forms/Form--AC135.asp.
    (2) If registration in the CCR database is not required, the 
prospective contractor's CAGE code is not already available in the 
contracting office, and the prospective contractor does not respond to 
the provision at 252.204-7001, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) 
Code Reporting, use the following procedures:
    (i) To identify the prospective contractor's CAGE code, use--
    (A) The monthly H-series CD ROM that contains the H-4/H-8 CAGE 
master file issued by DLIS (Their address is: Customer Service, Federal 
Center, 74 Washington Avenue, North, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084. Their 
telephone number is: toll-free 1-888-352-9333);
    (B) The on-line access to the CAGE file through the Defense 
Logistics Information System;
    (C) The on-line access to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) CAGE 
file through the DLA Network or dial-up capability; or
    (D) The Internet to access the CAGE Lookup Server at http://
www.dlis.dla.mil/cage--welcome.asp.
    (ii) If no CAGE code is identified through use of the procedures in 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this subsection, ask DLIS to assign a CAGE code. 
Submit a DD Form 2051, Request for Assignment of a Commercial and 
Government Entity (CAGE) Code, (or electronic equivalent) to the address 
in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this subsection, ATTN: DLIS-SBB. The 
contracting office completes Section A of the DD Form 2051, and the 
contractor completes Section B. The contracting office must verify 
Section B before submitting the form.
    (c) Direct questions on obtaining computer tapes, electronic 
updates, or

    (c) The contracting officer responsible for execution of a change-
of-name agreement (see FAR subpart 42.12) must submit the agreement to 
DLIS-SBB. If there are no current contracts, each contracting and 
contract administration office receiving notification of changes from 
the commercial entity must forward a copy of the change notice annotated 
with the CAGE code to DLIS-SBB unless the change notice indicates that 
DLIS-SBB already has been notified.
    (d) Additional guidance for maintaining CAGE codes is in Volume 7 of 
DoD 4100.39-M, Federal Logistics Information System (FLIS) Procedures 
Manual.

    Contracting officers shall process and execute novation agreements 
in accordance with FAR Subpart 42.12, Novation and Change-of-Name 
Agreements. These actions are independent of code and name assignments 
made as a result of the occasion which created the need for the novation 
agreement. The maintenance activity will determine which entity(s) will 
retain the existing code(s) and which entities will be assigned new 
codes. The contracting officer responsible for processing the novation 
agreement shall provide the maintenance activity with the following 
information:

204.7206  Using CAGE codes to identify agents and brokers.

    Authorized agents and brokers are entities and, as such, may be 
assigned CAGE codes for identification and processing purposes.
    (a) A single CAGE code will be assigned to the agent/broker 
establishment in addition to any codes assigned to the entities 
represented by the agent/broker, i.e., only one code will be assigned to 
a specific agent/broker entity regardless of the number of firms 
represented by that agent/broker.
    (b) Additional codes may be assigned to an agent/broker if they meet 
the criteria for assigning additional codes for entities, e.g., 
different location.
    (c) Codes will not be assigned to an agent/broker in care of the 
entity being represented or in any way infer that the agent/broker is a 
separate establishment bearing the name of the entity represented by the 
agent/broker.

items are not expected to be involved.
    (b) Prior to issuance of a solicitation for supplies or services, 
the requiring activity shall notify the contracting officer in writing 
when--
    (1) Export-controlled items are expected to be involved; or
    (2) The requiring activity is unable to determine that export-
controlled items will not be involved. See PGI 204.7304 for guidance 
regarding this notification requirement.


<R05>
204.7305  Contract clauses.

    (a) Use the clause at 252.204-7008, Requirements for Contracts 
Involving Export-Controlled Items, in solicitations and contracts when

quantity at U.S. market prices.''
    (B) ``The exception at DFARS 225.7002-2(p) applies to this

    (a) Authority. (2)(i) Section 8059 of Pub. L. 101-511 and similar 
sections in subsequent defense appropriations acts prohibit departments 
and agencies from entering into contracts for studies, analyses, or 
consulting services (see FAR subpart 37.2) on the basis of an 
unsolicited proposal without providing for full and open competition, 
unless--
    (1) The head of the contracting activity, or a designee no lower 
than chief of the contracting office, determines that--
    (i) Following thorough technical evaluation, only one source is 
fully qualified to perform the proposed work;
    (ii) The unsolicited proposal offers significant scientific or 
technological promise, represents the product of original thinking, and 
was submitted in confidence; or

required if the head of the contracting activity prepares a document 
that describes the terms of an agreement or treaty or the written 
directions, such as a Letter of Offer and Acceptance, that have the 
effect of requiring the use of other than competitive procedures for the 
acquisition.

[63 FR 67803, Dec. 9, 1998]


<R05>
206.302-5  Authorized or required by statute.

    (2) Identifies the particular college or university involved, and
    (3) States that award is being made in contravention of 10 U.S.C. 
2361(a); and
    (B) The Secretary of Defense provides Congress written notice of 
intent to award. The contract cannot be awarded until 180 days have

total cost of all contracts for the acquisition program is estimated at 
$10 million or more;
    (B) Acquisitions for production or services when the total cost of 
all contracts for the acquisition program is estimated at $50 million or 
more for all years or $25 million or more for any fiscal year; and

[[Page 38]]

    (C) Any other acquisition considered appropriate by the department 
or agency.
    (ii) Written plans are not required in acquisitions for a final buy 
out or one-time buy. The terms ``final buy out'' and ``one-time buy'' 
refer to a single contract that covers all known present and future 
requirements. This exception does not apply to a multiyear contract or a 
contract with options or phases.
    (e) Prepare written acquisition plans for acquisition programs 
meeting the thresholds of paragraphs (d)(i)(A) and (B) of this section 
on a program basis. Other acquisition plans may be written on either a 
program or an individual contract basis.
    (g) The program manager, or other official responsible for the 
program, has overall responsibility for acquisition planning.
    (h) For procurement of conventional ammunition, as defined in DoDD 
5160.65, Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition (SMCA), the SMCA 
will review the acquisition plan to determine if it is consistent with 
retaining national technology and industrial base capabilities in 
accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3) and Section 806 of Public Law 105-
261. The department or agency--
    (i) Shall submit the acquisition plan to the address in PGI 
207.103(h); and
    (ii) Shall not proceed with the procurement until the SMCA provides 
written concurrence with the acquisition plan. In the case of a non-
concurrence, the SMCA will resolve issues with the Army Office of the 
Executive Director for Conventional Ammunition.

<R05>
207.106  Additional requirements for major systems.

    (b)(1)(A) The contracting officer is prohibited by 10 U.S.C. 
2305(d)(4)(A) from requiring offers for development or production of 
major systems that would enable the Government to use technical data to 
competitively reprocure identical items or components of the system if 
the item or component were developed exclusively at private expense, 
unless the contracting officer determines that--
    (1) The original supplier of the item or component will be unable to 
satisfy program schedule or delivery requirements;
    (2) Proposals by the original supplier of the item or component to 
meet mobilization requirements are insufficient to meet the agency's 
mobilization needs; or
    (3) The Government is otherwise entitled to unlimited rights in 
technical data.
    (B) If the contracting officer makes a determination, under 
paragraphs (b)(1)(A) (1) and (2) of this section, for a competitive 
solicitation, 10 U.S.C. 2305(d)(4)(B) requires that the evaluation of 
items developed at private expense be based on an analysis of the total 
value, in terms of innovative design, life-cycle costs, and other 
pertinent factors, of incorporating such items in the system.
    (S-70)(1) In accordance with Section 802(a) of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (Pub. L. 109-364) and DoD policy 
requirements, acquisition plans for major weapon systems and subsystems 
of major weapon systems shall--
    (i) Assess the long-term technical data and computer software needs 
of those systems and subsystems; and
    (ii) Establish acquisition strategies that provide for the technical 
data deliverables and associated license rights needed to sustain those 
systems and subsystems over their life cycle. The strategy may include--
    (A) The development of maintenance capabilities within DoD; or
    (B) Competition for contracts for sustainment of the systems or 
subsystems.
    (2) Assessments and corresponding acquisition strategies developed 
under this section shall--
    (i) Be developed before issuance of a solicitation for the weapon 
system or subsystem;

[[Page 39]]

    (ii) Address the merits of including a priced contract option for 
the future delivery of technical data and computer software, and 
associated license rights, that were not acquired upon initial contract 
award;
    (iii) Address the potential for changes in the sustainment plan over 
the life cycle of the weapon system or subsystem; and
    (iv) Apply to weapon systems and subsystems that are to be supported 
by performance-based logistics arrangements as well as to weapon systems 
and subsystems that are to be supported by other sustainment approaches.
    (S-71) See 209.570 for policy applicable to acquisition strategies 
that consider the use of lead system integrators.

[69 FR 55987, Sept. 17, 2004]


<R05>
207.170-2  Definitions.

    As used in this section--
    Consolidation of contract requirements means the use of a 
solicitation to obtain offers for a single contract or a multiple award 
contract to satisfy two or more requirements of a department, agency, or 
activity for supplies or services that previously have been provided to, 
or performed for, that department, agency, or activity under two or more 
separate contracts.
    Multiple award contract means-
    (1) Orders placed using a multiple award schedule issued by the 
General Services Administration as described in FAR Subpart 8.4;
    (2) A multiple award task order or delivery order contract issued in 
accordance with FAR Subpart 16.5; or
    (3) Any other indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract that 
an agency enters into with two or more sources for the same line item 
under the same solicitation.

[71 FR 14106, Mar. 21, 2006]


<R05>
207.170-3  Policy and procedures.

    (a) Agencies shall not consolidate contract requirements with an 
estimated total value exceeding $5.5 million unless the acquisition 
strategy includes--
    (1) The results of market research;
    (2) Identification of any alternative contracting approaches that 
would involve a lesser degree of consolidation; and
    (3) A determination by the senior procurement executive that the 
consolidation is necessary and justified.
    (i) Market research may indicate that consolidation of contract 
requirements is necessary and justified if the benefits of the 
acquisition strategy substantially exceed the benefits of each of the 
possible alternative contracting approaches. Benefits may include costs 
and, regardless of whether quantifiable in dollar amounts--
    (A) Quality;
    (B) Acquisition cycle;
    (C) Terms and conditions; and
    (D) Any other benefit.
    (ii) Savings in administrative or personnel costs alone do not 
constitute a sufficient justification for a consolidation of contract 
requirements unless the total amount of the cost savings is expected to 
be substantial in relation to the total cost of the procurement.
    (b) Include the determination made in accordance with paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section in the contract file.

<R05>
207.171  Component breakout.


<R05>
207.171-1  Scope.

    (a) This section provides policy for breaking out components of end 
items for future acquisitions so that the Government can purchase the 
components directly from the manufacturer or supplier and furnish them 
to the end item manufacturer as Government-furnished material.
    (b) This section does not apply to--

[[Page 40]]

    (1) The initial decisions on Government-furnished equipment or 
contractor-furnished equipment that are made at the inception of an 
acquisition program; or
    (2) Breakout of parts for replenishment (see Appendix E).

[71 FR 14102, Mar. 21, 2006]


<R05>
207.171-2  Definition.

    Component, as used in this section, includes subsystems, assemblies, 
subassemblies, and other major elements of an end item; it does not 
include elements of relatively small annual acquisition value.

[71 FR 14102, Mar. 21, 2006]


<R05>
207.171-3  Policy.

    DoD policy is to break out components of weapons systems or other 
major end items under certain circumstances.
    (a) When it is anticipated that a prime contract will be awarded 
without adequate price competition, and the prime contractor is expected 
to acquire any component without adequate price competition, the agency 
shall break out that component if--
    (1) Substantial net cost savings probably will be achieved; and
    (2) Breakout action will not jeopardize the quality, reliability, 
performance, or timely delivery of the end item.
    (b) Even when either or both the prime contract and the component 
will be acquired with adequate price competition, the agency shall 
consider breakout of the component if substantial net cost savings will 
result from--
    (1) Greater quantity acquisitions; or
    (2) Such factors as improved logistics support (through reduction in 
varieties of spare parts) and economies in operations and training 
(through standardization of design).
    (c) Breakout normally is not justified for a component that is not 
expected to exceed $1 million for the current year's requirement.

[71 FR 14102, Mar. 21, 2006]


<R05>
207.171-4  Procedures.

    Agencies shall follow the procedures at PGI 207.171-4 for component 
breakout.

<R05>
207.401  Acquisition considerations.

    If the equipment will be leased for more than 60 days, the requiring 
activity must prepare and provide the contracting officer with the 
justification supporting the decision to lease or purchase.


<R05>
207.470  Statutory requirements.

    (a) Limitation on contracts with terms of 18 months or more. As 
required by 10 U.S.C. 2401a, the contracting officer shall not enter 
into any contract for any vessel, aircraft, or vehicle, through a lease, 
charter, or similar agreement with a term of 18 months or more, or 
extend or renew any such contract for a term of 18 months or more, 
unless the head of the contracting activity has--
    (1) Considered all costs of such a contract (including estimated 
termination liability); and
    (2) Determined in writing that the contract is in the best interest 
of the Government.
    (b) Leasing of commercial vehicles and associated equipment. Except 
as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the contracting officer 
may use leasing in the acquisition of commercial vehicles and associated 
equipment whenever the contracting officer determines that leasing of 
such vehicles is practicable and efficient (10 US.C. 2401a).

    (a) Fund leases in accordance with DoD Financial Management 
Regulation (FMR) 7000.14-R, Volume 2A, Chapter 1.
    (b) DoD leases are either capital leases or operating leases. See 
FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 4, Chapter 7, Section 070207.

[[Page 41]]

    (c) Use procurement funds for capital leases, as these are 
essentially installment purchases of property.

     Subpart 207.70_Buy-to-Budget_Additional Quantities of End Items

    Source: 68 FR 43331, July 22, 2003, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
207.7001  Definition.

    End item, as used in this subpart, means a production product 
assembled, completed, and ready for issue or deployment.


<R05>
207.7002  Authority to acquire additional quantities of end items.

    10 U.S.C. 2308 authorizes DoD to use funds available for the 
acquisition of an end item to acquire a higher quantity of the end item 
than the quantity specified in a law providing for the funding of that 
acquisition, if the head of an agency determines that--
    (a) The agency has an established requirement for the end item that 
is expected to remain substantially unchanged throughout the period of 
the acquisition;
    (b) It is possible to acquire the higher quantity of the end item 
without additional funding because of production efficiencies or other 
cost reductions;
    (c) The amount of funds used for the acquisition of the higher 
quantity of the end item will not exceed the amount provided under that 
law for the acquisition of the end item; and
    (d) The amount provided under that law for the acquisition of the 
end item is sufficient to ensure that each unit of the end item acquired 
within the higher quantity is fully funded as a complete end item.


<R05>
207.7003  Limitation.

    For noncompetitive acquisitions, the acquisition of additional 
quantities is limited to not more than 10 percent of the quantity 
approved in the justification and approval prepared in accordance with 
FAR part 6 for the acquisition of the end item.

                 Subpart 208.70_Coordinated Acquisition


<R05>
208.7000  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes policy and procedures for acquisition of 
items for which contracting responsibility is assigned to one or more of 
the departments/agencies or the General Services Administration. 
Contracting responsibility is assigned through--
    (a) The Coordinated Acquisition Program (commodity assignments are 
listed in PGI 208.7006); or
    (b) The Integrated Materiel Management Program (assignments are in 
DoD 4140.26-M, Defense Integrated Materiel Management Manual for 
Consumable Items).

[56 FR 36306, July 31, 1991, as amended at 67 FR 77936, Dec. 20, 2002; 
71 FR 39004, July 11, 2006]


<R05>
208.7001  Definitions.

    For purposes of this subpart--
    Acquiring department means the department, agency, or General 
Services Administration which has contracting responsibility under the 
Coordinated Acquisition Program.
    Integrated materiel management means assignment of acquisition 
management responsibility to one department, agency, or the General 
Services Administration for all of DoD's requirements for the assigned 
item. Acquisition management normally includes computing requirements, 
funding, budgeting, storing, issuing, cataloging, standardizing, and 
contracting functions.
    Requiring department means the department or agency which has the 
requirement for an item.


<R05>
208.7002  Assignment authority.

    (a) Under the DoD Coordinated Acquisition Program, contracting 
responsibility for certain commodities is assigned to a single 
department, agency, or the General Services Administration (GSA). 
Commodity assignments are made--
    (1) To the departments and agencies, by the Deputy Under Secretary 
of Defense (Logistics);
    (2) To GSA, through agreement with GSA, by the Deputy Under 
Secretary of Defense (Logistics);
    (3) Outside the contiguous United States, by the Unified Commanders; 
and
    (4) For acquisitions to be made in the contiguous United States for 
commodities not assigned under paragraphs (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this 
section, by agreement of agency heads (10 U.S.C. 2311).
    (i) Agreement may be on either a one-time or a continuing basis. The 
submission of a military interdepartmental purchase request (MIPR) by a 
requiring activity and its acceptance by the contracting activity of 
another department, even though based on an oral communication, 
constitutes a one-time agreement.
    (ii) Consider repetitive delegated acquisition responsibilities for 
coordinated acquisition assignment. If not considered suitable for 
coordinated acquisition assignment, formalize continuing agreements and 
distribute them to all activities concerned.
    (b) Under the Integrated Materiel Management Program, assignments 
are made by the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Logistics)--
    (1) To the departments and agencies; and
    (2) To GSA, through agreement with GSA.

<R05>
208.7003  Applicability.


<R05>
208.7003-1  Assignments under integrated materiel management (IMM).

    (a) Acquire all items assigned for IMM from the IMM manager except--
    (1) Items purchased under circumstances of unusual and compelling 
urgency as defined in FAR 6.302-2. After such a purchase is made, the 
requiring activity must send one copy of the contract and a statement of 
the emergency to the IMM manager;
    (2) Items for which the IMM manager assigns a supply system code for 
local purchase or otherwise grants authority to purchase locally; or
    (3) When purchase by the requiring activity is in the best interest 
of the Government in terms of the combination of quality, timeliness, 
and cost that best meets the requirement. This exception does not apply 
to items--
    (i) Critical to the safe operation of a weapon system;
    (ii) With special security characteristics; or
    (iii) Which are dangerous (e.g., explosives, munitions).
    (b) Follow the procedures at PGI 208.7003-1(b) when an item assigned 
for IMM is to be acquired by the requiring department in accordance with 
paragraph (a)(3) of this subsection.

[60 FR 61593, Nov. 30, 1995, as amended at 64 FR 51075, Sept. 21, 1999; 
64 FR 61031, Nov. 9, 1999; 71 FR 39004, July 11, 2006]


<R05>
208.7003-2  Assignments under coordinated acquisition.

    Requiring departments must submit to the acquiring department all 
contracting requirements for items assigned for coordinated acquisition, 
except--
    (a) Items obtained through the sources in FAR 8.002(a)(1) (i) 
through (vii);
    (b) Items obtained under 208.7003-1(a);
    (c) Requirements not in excess of the simplified acquisition 
threshold in FAR part 2, when contracting by the requiring department is 
in the best interest of the Government;
    (d) In an emergency. When an emergency purchase is made, the 
requiring department must send one copy of the contract and a statement 
of the emergency to the contracting activity of the acquiring 
department;
    (e) Requirements for which the acquiring department's contracting 
activity delegates contracting authority to the requiring department;
    (f) Items in a research and development stage (as described in FAR 
part 35). Under this exception, the military departments may contract 
for research and development requirements, including quantities for 
testing purposes and items undergoing in-service evaluation (not yet in 
actual production, but beyond prototype). Generally, this exception 
applies only when research and development funds are used.
    (g) Items peculiar to nuclear ordnance material where design 
characteristics or test-inspection requirements are controlled by the 
Department of Energy (DoE) or by DoD to ensure reliability of nuclear 
weapons.
    (1) This exception applies to all items designed for and peculiar to 
nuclear ordnance regardless of agency control, or to any item which 
requires test or inspection conducted or controlled by DoE or DoD.
    (2) This exception does not cover items used for both nuclear 
ordnance and other purposes if the items are not subject to the special 
testing procedures.
    (h) Items to be acquired under FAR 6.302-6 (national security 
requires limitation of sources);
    (i) Items to be acquired under FAR 6.302-1 (supplies available only 
from the original source for follow-on contract);
    (j) Items directly related to a major system and which are design 
controlled by and acquired from either the system manufacturer or a 
manufacturer of a major subsystem;

[[Page 46]]

    (k) Items subject to rapid design changes, or to continuous redesign 
or modification during the production and/or operational use phases, 
which require continual contact between industry and the requiring 
department to ensure that the item meets the requirements:
    (1) This exception permits the requiring department to contract for 
items of highly unstable design. For use of this exception, it must be 
clearly impractical, both technically and contractually, to refer the 
acquisition to the acquiring department. Anticipation that contracting 
by negotiation will be appropriate, or that a number of design changes 
may occur during contract performance is not in itself sufficient reason 
for using this exception.
    (2) This exception also applies to items requiring compatibility 
testing, provided such testing requires continual contact between 
industry and the requiring department;
    (l) Containers acquired only with items for which they are designed;
    (m) One-time buy of a noncataloged item.
    (1) This exception permits the requiring departments to contract for 
a nonrecurring requirement for a noncataloged item. This exception could 
cover a part or component for a prototype which may be stock numbered at 
a later date.
    (2) This exception does not permit acquisitions of recurring 
requirements for an item, based solely on the fact that the item is not 
stock numbered, nor may it be used to acquire items which have only 
slightly different characteristics than previously cataloged items.

foreign ownership (include solicitation and other reference numbers to 
identify the action);

requirements;
    (3) Identification of the national security interests involved and 
the ways award of the contract helps advance those interests;
    (4) The availability of another entity with the capacity, capability

    (i) The waiver will advance the environmental restoration, 
remediation, or waste management objectives of DoD and will not harm the 
national security interests of the United States; and
    (ii) The entity to which the contract is awarded is controlled by a 
foreign government with which the Secretary is authorized to exchange 
Restricted Data under section 144c. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 
U.S.C. 2164(c)); and
    (2) Notifying Congress of the decision to grant the waiver. The 
contract may be awarded only after the end of the 45-day period 
beginning on the date the notification is received by the appropriate 
Congressional committees.

<R05>
211.274-1  General.

    Unique item identification and valuation is a system of marking and 
valuing items delivered to DoD that will enhance logistics, contracting, 
and financial business transactions supporting the United States and 
coalition troops. Through unique item identification policy, which 
capitalizes on leading practices and embraces open standards, DoD can--
    (a) Achieve lower life-cycle cost of item management and improve 
life-cycle property management;
    (b) Improve operational readiness;
    (c) Provide reliable accountability of property and asset visibility 
throughout the life cycle; and
    (d) Reduce the burden on the workforce through increased 
productivity and efficiency.

[70 FR 20836, Apr. 22, 2005]


<R05>
211.274-2  Policy for unique item identification.

    (a) It is DoD policy that DoD unique item identification, or a DoD 
recognized unique identification equivalent, is required for-
    (1) All delivered items for which the Government's unit acquisition 
cost is $5,000 or more;
    (2) Items for which the Government's unit acquisition cost is less 
than $5,000, when identified by the requiring activity as serially 
managed, mission essential, or controlled inventory;
    (3) Items for which the Government's unit acquisition cost is less 
than $5,000, when the requiring activity determines that permanent 
identification is required; and
    (4) Regardless of value--
    (i) Any DoD serially managed subassembly, component, or part 
embedded within a delivered item; and
    (ii) The parent item (as defined in 252.211-7003(a)) that contains 
the embedded subassembly, component, or part.
    (b) Exceptions. The Contractor will not be required to provide DoD 
unique item identification if--
    (1) The items, as determined by the head of the agency, are to be 
used to support a contingency operation or to

[[Page 58]]

facilitate defense against or recovery from nuclear, biological, 
chemical, or radiological attack; or
    (2) A determination and findings has been executed concluding that 
it is more cost effective for the Government requiring activity to 
assign, mark, and register the unique item identification after delivery 
of an item acquired from a small business concern or a commercial item 
acquired under FAR Part 12 or Part 8.
    (i) The determination and findings shall be executed by--
    (A) The Component Acquisition Executive for an acquisition category 
(ACAT) I program; or
    (B) The head of the contracting activity for all other programs.
    (ii) The DoD Unique Item Identification Program Office must receive 
a copy of the determination and findings required by paragraph (b)(2)(i) 
of this subsection. Send the copy to DPAP, SPEC ASST, 3060 Defense 
Pentagon, 3E1044, Washington, DC 20301-3060; or by facsimile to (703) 
695-7596.

[70 FR 20836, Apr. 22, 2005]


<R05>
211.274-3  Policy for valuation.

    (a) It is DoD policy that contractors shall be required to identify 
the Government's unit acquisition cost (as defined in 252.211-7003(a)) 
for all items delivered, even if none of the criteria for placing a 
unique item identification mark applies.
    (b) The Government's unit acquisition cost is--
    (1) For fixed-price type line, subline, or exhibit line items, the 
unit price identified in the contract at the time of delivery;
    (2) For cost-type or undefinitized line, subline, or exhibit line 
items, the contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost to the 
Government at the time of delivery; and
    (3) For items delivered under a time-and-materials contract, the 
contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost to the Government at the 
time of delivery.
    (c) The Government's unit acquisition cost of subassemblies, 
components, and parts embedded in delivered items need not be separately 
identified.

    (1) In the possession of the Government and furnished to a 
contractor for the performance of a contract; or
    (2) Directly acquired by the Government and subsequently furnished 
to a contractor for the performance of a contract.

to satisfy agency needs, negotiate for special license rights in 
accordance with 227.7103-5(d) and 227.7203-5(d).

solicitation with a tiered evaluation of offers unless--
    (1) The contracting officer conducts market research, in accordance 
with FAR Part 10 and Part 210, to determine--
    (i) Whether the criteria in FAR part 19 are met for setting aside 
the acquisition for small business; or
    (ii) For a task or delivery order, whether there are a sufficient 
number of qualified small business concerns available to justify 
limiting competition under the terms of the contract; and
    (2) If the contracting officer cannot determine whether the criteria 
in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are met, the contracting officer 
includes a written explanation in the contract file as to why such a 
determination could not be made (Section 816 of Public Law 109-163).

215.304  Evaluation factors and significant subfactors.

    (c)(i) In acquisitions that require use of the clause at FAR 52.219-
9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, other than those based on the 
lowest price technically acceptable source selection process (see FAR 
15.101-2), the extent of participation of small businesses and 
historically black colleges or universities and minority institutions in 
performance of the contract shall be addressed in source selection. The 
contracting officer shall evaluate the extent to which offerors identify 
and commit to small business and historically black college or 
university and minority institution performance of the contract, whether 
as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor.
    (A) See PGI 215.304(c)(i)(A) for examples of evaluation factors.
    (B) Proposals addressing the extent of small business and 
historically black college or university and minority institution 
performance may be separate from subcontracting plans submitted pursuant 
to the clause at FAR 52.219-9 and should be structured to allow for 
consideration of offers from small businesses.
    (C) When an evaluation assesses the extent that small businesses and 
historically black colleges or universities and minority institutions 
are specifically identified in proposals, the small businesses and 
historically black colleges or universities and minority institutions 
considered in the evaluation shall be listed in any subcontracting plan 
submitted pursuant to FAR 52.219-9 to facilitate compliance with 
252.219-7003(g).
    (ii) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2436, consider the purchase of 
capital assets (including machine tools) manufactured in the United

evaluation is required by FAR 15.304, and the solicitation includes the 
clause at FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns, the 
evaluation factors shall include the past performance of

[[Page 72]]

offerors in complying with requirements of that clause. When a past 
performance evaluation is required by FAR 15.304, and the solicitation 
includes the clause at FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan,

    (b) Exceptions to cost or pricing data requirements. Follow the 
procedures at PGI 215.403-1(b).
    (c) Standards for exceptions from cost or pricing data 
requirements--(1) Adequate price competition. For acquisitions under 
dual or multiple source programs:
    (A) The determination of adequate price competition must be made on 
a case-by-case basis. Even when adequate price competition exists, in 
certain cases it may be appropriate to obtain additional information to 
assist in price analysis.
    (B) Adequate price competition normally exists when--
    (i) Prices are solicited across a full range of step quantities, 
normally including a 0-100 percent split, from at least two offerors 
that are individually capable of producing the full quantity; and
    (ii) The reasonableness of all prices awarded is clearly established 
on the basis of price analysis (see FAR 15.404-1(b)).
    (3) Commercial items. (A) Follow the procedures at PGI 215.403-

Policy (DPAP), ATTN: DPAP/CPF, of all contracting officer determinations 
that commercial item exceptions apply under FAR 15.403-1(b)(3), during 
the previous fiscal year, for any contract, subcontract, or modification 
expected to have a value of $15,000,000 or more. See PGI 215.403-
1(c)(3)(B) for the format and guidance for the report. The Director, 
DPAP, will submit a consolidated report to the congressional defense 
committees.
    (4) Waivers. (A) The head of the contracting activity may, without 
power of delegation, apply the exceptional circumstances authority when 
a determination is made that--
    (1) The property or services cannot reasonably be obtained under the 
contract, subcontract, or modification, without the granting of the 
waiver;
    (2) The price can be determined to be fair and reasonable without 
the submission of certified cost or pricing data; and
    (3) There are demonstrated benefits to granting the waiver. Follow 
the procedures at PGI 215.403-1(c)(4)(A) for determining when an 
exceptional case waiver is appropriate, for approval of such waivers, 
for partial waivers, and for waivers applicable to unpriced supplies or 
services.
    (B) By November 30th of each year, departments and agencies shall 
provide a report to the Director, DPAP, ATTN: DPAP/CPF, of all waivers 
granted under FAR 15.403-1(b)(4), during the previous fiscal year, for 
any contract, subcontract, or modification expected to have a value of 
$15,000,000 or more. See PGI 215.403-1(c)(4)(B) for the format and 
guidance for the report. The Director, DPAP, will submit a consolidated 
report to the congressional defense committees.
    (C) DoD has waived the requirement for submission of cost or pricing 
data for the Canadian Commercial Corporation and its subcontractors.
    (D) DoD has waived cost or pricing data requirements for nonprofit 
organizations (including education institutions) on cost-reimbursement-
no-fee contracts. The contracting officer shall require--

[[Page 73]]

    (1) Submission of information other than cost or pricing data to the 
extent necessary to determine reasonableness and cost realism; and
    (2) Cost or pricing data from subcontractors that are not nonprofit 
organizations when the subcontractor's proposal exceeds the cost or 
pricing data threshold at FAR 15.403-4(a)(1).

215.404-1  Proposal analysis techniques.

    (1) Follow the procedures at PGI 215.404-1 for proposal analysis.
    (2) For spare parts or support equipment, perform an analysis of--
    (i) Those line items where the proposed price exceeds by 25 percent 
or more the lowest price the Government has paid within the most recent 
12-month period based on reasonably available information;
    (ii) Those line items where a comparison of the item description and 
the proposal price indicates a potential for overpricing;
    (iii) Significant high-dollar-value items. If there are no obvious 
high-dollar-value items, include an analysis of a random sample of 
items; and
    (iv) A random sample of the remaining low-dollar value items. Sample 
size may be determined by subjective judgment, e.g., experience with the 
offeror and the reliability of its estimating and accounting systems.

215.404-4  Profit.

    (b) Policy. (1) Contracting officers shall use a structured approach 
for developing a prenegotiation profit or fee objective on any 
negotiated contract action when cost or pricing data is obtained, except 
for cost-plus-award-fee contracts (see 215.404-74, 216.405-2, and FAR 
16.405-2) or contracts with Federally Funded Research and Development 
Centers (FFRDCs) (see 215.404-75). There are three structured 
approaches--
    (A) The weighted guidelines method;
    (B) The modified weighted guidelines method; and
    (C) An alternate structured approach.
    (c) Contracting officer responsibilities. (1) Also, do not perform a 
profit analysis when assessing cost realism in competitive acquisitions.
    (2) When using a structured approach, the contracting officer--
    (A) Shall use the weighted guidelines method (see 215.404-71), 
except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2)(B) and (c)(2)(C) of this 
subsection.
    (B) Shall use the modified weighted guidelines method (see 215.404-
72) on contract actions with nonprofit organizations other than FFRDCs.
    (C) May use an alternate structured approach (see 215.404-73) when--
    (1) The contract action is--
    (i) At or below the cost or pricing data threshold (see FAR 15.403-
4(a)(1));
    (ii) For architect-engineer or construction work;

[[Page 74]]

    (iii) Primarily for delivery of material from subcontractors; or
    (iv) A termination settlement; or
    (2) The weighted guidelines method does not produce a reasonable 
overall profit objective and the head of the contracting activity 
approves use of the alternate approach in writing.
    (D) Shall use the weighted guidelines method to establish a basic 
profit rate under a formula-type pricing agreement, and may then use the 
basic rate on all actions under the agreement, provided that conditions 
affecting profit do not change.
    (E) Shall document the profit analysis in the contract file.
    (5) Although specific agreement on the applied weights or values for 
individual profit factors shall not be attempted, the contracting 
officer may encourage the contractor to--
    (A) Present the details of its proposed profit amounts in the 
weighted guidelines format or similar structured approached; and
    (B) Use the weighted guidelines method in developing profit 
objectives for negotiated subcontracts.
    (6) The contracting officer must also verify that relevant variables 
have not materially changed (e.g., performance risk, interest rates, 
progress payment rates, distribution of facilities capital).
    (d) Profit-analysis factors--(1) Common factors. The common factors 
are embodied in the DoD structured approaches and need not be further 
considered by the contracting officer.

215.404-71  Weighted guidelines method.


<R05>
215.404-71-1  General.

    (a) The weighted guidelines method focuses on four profit factors--
    (1) Performance risk;
    (2) Contract type risk;
    (3) Facilities capital employed; and
    (4) Cost efficiency.
    (b) The contracting officer assigns values to each profit factor; 
the value multiplied by the base results in the profit objective for 
that factor. Except for the cost efficiency special factor, each profit 
factor has a normal value and a designated range of values. The normal 
value is representative of average conditions on the prospective 
contract when compared to all goods and services acquired by DoD. The 
designated range provides values based on above normal or below normal 
conditions. In the price negotiation documentation, the contracting 
officer need not explain assignment of the normal value, but should 
address conditions that justify assignment of other than the normal 
value. The cost efficiency special factor has no normal value. The 
contracting officer shall exercise sound business judgment in selecting 
a value when this special factor is used (see 215.404-71-5).

215.404-71-2  Performance risk.

    (a) Description. This profit factor addresses the contractor's 
degree of risk in fulfilling the contract requirements. The factor 
consists of two parts:
    (1) Technical--the technical uncertainties of performance.
    (2) Management/cost control--the degree of management effort 
necessary--
    (i) To ensure that contract requirements are met; and
    (ii) To reduce and control costs.
    (b) Determination. The following extract from the DD Form 1547 is 
annotated to describe the process.

Standard............................            5  3% to 7%
Technology Incentive................            9  7% to 11%
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) Standard. The standard designated range should apply to most 
contracts.
    (2) Technology incentive. For the technical factor only, contracting 
officers may use the technology incentive range for acquisitions that 
include development, production, or application of innovative new 
technologies. The technology incentive range does not apply to efforts 
restricted to studies, analyses, or demonstrations that have a technical 
report as their primary deliverable.
    (d) Evaluation criteria for technical. (1) Review the contract 
requirements and focus on the critical performance elements in the 
statement of work or specifications. Factors to consider include--
    (i) Technology being applied or developed by the contractor;
    (ii) Technical complexity;
    (iii) Program maturity;
    (iv) Performance specifications and tolerances;
    (v) Delivery schedule; and
    (vi) Extent of a warranty or guarantee.
    (2) Above normal conditions. (i) The contracting officer may assign 
a higher than normal value in those cases where there is a substantial 
technical risk. Indicators are--
    (A) Items are being manufactured using specifications with stringent 
tolerance limits;
    (B) The efforts require highly skilled personnel or require the use 
of state-of-the-art machinery;
    (C) The services and analytical efforts are extremely important to 
the Government and must be performed to exacting standards;
    (D) The contractor's independent development and investment has 
reduced the Government's risk or cost;
    (E) The contractor has accepted an accelerated delivery schedule to 
meet DoD requirements; or
    (F) The contractor has assumed additional risk through warranty 
provisions.
    (ii) Extremely complex, vital efforts to overcome difficult 
technical obstacles that require personnel with exceptional abilities, 
experience, and professional credentials may justify a value 
significantly above normal.
    (iii) The following may justify a maximum value--
    (A) Development or initial production of a new item, particularly if 
performance or quality specifications are tight; or
    (B) A high degree of development or production concurrency.
    (3) Below normal conditions. (i) The contracting officer may assign 
a lower than normal value in those cases where the technical risk is 
low. Indicators are--
    (A) Requirements are relatively simple;
    (B) Technology is not complex;
    (C) Efforts do not require highly skilled personnel;

[[Page 76]]

    (D) Efforts are routine;
    (E) Programs are mature; or
    (F) Acquisition is a follow-on effort or a repetitive type 
acquisition.
    (ii) The contracting officer may assign a value significantly below 
normal for--
    (A) Routine services;
    (B) Production of simple items;
    (C) Rote entry or routine integration of Government-furnished 
information; or
    (D) Simple operations with Government-furnished property.
    (4) Technology incentive range. (i) The contracting officer may 
assign values within the technology incentive range when contract 
performance includes the introduction of new, significant technological 
innovation. Use the technology incentive range only for the most 
innovative contract efforts. Innovation may be in the form of--
    (A) Development or application of new technology that fundamentally 
changes the characteristics of an existing product or system and that 
results in increased technical performance, improved reliability, or 
reduced costs; or
    (B) New products or systems that contain significant technological 
advances over the products or systems they are replacing.
    (ii) When selecting a value within the technology incentive range, 
the contracting officer should consider the relative value of the 
proposed innovation to the acquisition as a whole. When the innovation 
represents a minor benefit, the contracting officer should consider 
using values less than the norm. For innovative efforts that will have a 
major positive impact on the product or program, the contracting officer 
may use values above the norm.
    (e) Evaluation criteria for management/cost control. (1) The 
contracting officer should evaluate--
    (i) The contractor's management and internal control systems using 
contracting office information and reviews made by field contract 
administration offices or other DoD field offices;
    (ii) The management involvement expected on the prospective contract 
action;
    (iii) The degree of cost mix as an indication of the types of 
resources applied and value added by the contractor;
    (iv) The contractor's support of Federal socioeconomic programs;
    (v) The expected reliability of the contractor's cost estimates 
(including the contractor's cost estimating system);
    (vi) The adequacy of the contractor's management approach to 
controlling cost and schedule; and
    (vii) Any other factors that affect the contractor's ability to meet 
the cost targets (e.g., foreign currency exchange rates and inflation 
rates).
    (2) Above normal conditions. (i) The contracting officer may assign 
a higher than normal value when there is a high degree of management 
effort. Indicators of this are--
    (A) The contractor's value added is both considerable and reasonably 
difficult;
    (B) The effort involves a high degree of integration or 
coordination;
    (C) The contractor has a good record of past performance;
    (D) The contractor has a substantial record of active participation 
in Federal socioeconomic programs;
    (E) The contractor provides fully documented and reliable cost 
estimates;
    (F) The contractor makes appropriate make-or-buy decisions; or
    (G) The contractor has a proven record of cost tracking and control.
    (ii) The contracting officer may justify a maximum value when the 
effort--
    (A) Requires large scale integration of the most complex nature;
    (B) Involves major international activities with significant 
management coordination (e.g., offsets with foreign vendors); or
    (C) Has critically important milestones.
    (3) Below normal conditions. (i) The contracting officer may assign 
a lower than normal value when the management effort is minimal. 
Indicators of this are--
    (A) The program is mature and many end item deliveries have been 
made;
    (B) The contractor adds minimal value to an item;
    (C) The efforts are routine and require minimal supervision;

[[Page 77]]

    (D) The contractor provides poor quality, untimely proposals;
    (E) The contractor fails to provide an adequate analysis of 
subcontractor costs;
    (F) The contractor does not cooperate in the evaluation and 
negotiation of the proposal;
    (G) The contractor's cost estimating system is marginal;
    (H) The contractor has made minimal effort to initiate cost 
reduction programs;
    (I) The contractor's cost proposal is inadequate;
    (J) The contractor has a record of cost overruns or another 
indication of unreliable cost estimates and lack of cost control; or
    (K) The contractor has a poor record of past performance.
    (ii) The following may justify a value significantly below normal--
    (A) Reviews performed by the field contract administration offices 
disclose unsatisfactory management and internal control systems (e.g., 
quality assurance, property control, safety, security); or
    (B) The effort requires an unusually low degree of management 
involvement.

215.404-71-3  Contract type risk and working capital adjustment.

    (a) Description. The contract type risk factor focuses on the degree 
of cost risk accepted by the contractor under varying contract types. 
The working capital adjustment is an adjustment added to the profit 
objective for contract type risk. It only applies to fixed-price 
contracts that provide for progress payments. Though it uses a formula 
approach, it is not intended to be an exact calculation of the cost of 
working capital. Its purpose is to give general recognition to the 
contractor's cost of working capital under varying contract 
circumstances, financing policies, and the economic environment.
    (b) Determination. The following extract from the DD 1547 is 
annotated to explain the process.

    (1) Select a value from the list of contract types in paragraph (c) 
of this subsection using the evaluation criteria in paragraph (d) of 
this subsection.
    (2) Insert the amount from Block 20, i.e., the total allowable costs 
excluding facilities capital cost of money.
    (3) Multiply (1) by (2).
    (4) Only complete this block when the prospective contract is a 
fixed-price contract containing provisions for progress payments.
    (5) Insert the amount computed per paragraph (e) of this subsection.
    (6) Insert the appropriate figure from paragraph (f) of this 
subsection.
    (7) Use the interest rate established by the Secretary of the 
Treasury (see http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/rates/tcir/tcir--

    (1) ``No financing'' means either that the contract does not provide 
progress payments or performance-based payments, or that the contract 
provides them only on a limited basis, such as financing of first 
articles. Do not compute a working capital adjustment.
    (2) When the contract contains provisions for progress payments, 
compute a working capital adjustment (Block 25).
    (3) For the purposes of assigning profit values, treat a fixed-price 
contract with redetermination provisions as if it were a fixed-price 
incentive contract with below normal conditions.
    (4) Cost-plus contracts shall not receive the working capital 
adjustment.
    (5) These types of contracts are considered cost-plus-fixed-fee 
contracts for the purposes of assigning profit values. They shall not 
receive the working capital adjustment in Block 25. However, they may 
receive higher than normal values within the designated range to the 
extent that portions of cost are fixed.
    (6) When the contract contains provisions for performance-based 
payments, do not compute a working capital adjustment.
    (d) Evaluation criteria--(1) General. The contracting officer should 
consider elements that affect contract type risk such as--
    (i) Length of contract;
    (ii) Adequacy of cost data for projections;
    (iii) Economic environment;
    (iv) Nature and extent of subcontracted activity;
    (v) Protection provided to the contractor under contract provisions 
(e.g., economic price adjustment clauses);
    (vi) The ceilings and share lines contained in incentive provisions;
    (vii) Risks associated with contracts for foreign military sales 
(FMS) that are not funded by U.S. appropriations; and
    (viii) When the contract contains provisions for performance-based 
payments--
    (A) The frequency of payments;
    (B) The total amount of payments compared to the maximum allowable 
amount specified at FAR 32.1004(b)(2); and
    (C) The risk of the payment schedule to the contractor.
    (2) Mandatory. The contracting officer shall assess the extent to 
which costs have been incurred prior to the definitization of the 
contract action (also see 217.7404-6(a)). The assessment shall include 
any reduced contractor risk on both the contract before definitization 
and the remaining portion of the contract. When costs have been incurred 
prior to definitization, generally regard the contract type risk to be 
in the low end of the designated range. If a substantial portion of the 
costs have been incurred prior to definitization, the contracting 
officer may assign a value as low as 0 percent, regardless of contract 
type.
    (3) Above normal conditions. The contracting officer may assign a 
higher than normal value when there is substantial contract type risk. 
Indicators of this are--
    (i) Efforts where there is minimal cost history;
    (ii) Long-term contracts without provisions protecting the 
contractor, particularly when there is considerable economic 
uncertainty;
    (iii) Incentive provisions (e.g., cost and performance incentives) 
that place a high degree of risk on the contractor;
    (iv) FMS sales (other than those under DoD cooperative logistics 
support arrangements or those made from U.S. Government inventories or 
stocks) where the contractor can demonstrate

[[Page 79]]

that there are substantial risks above those normally present in DoD 
contracts for similar items; or
    (v) An aggressive performance-based payment schedule that increases 
risk.
    (4) Below normal conditions. The contracting officer may assign a 
lower than normal value when the contract type risk is low. Indicators 
of this are--
    (i) Very mature product line with extensive cost history;
    (ii) Relative short-term contracts;
    (iii) Contractual provisions that substantially reduce the 
contractor's risk;
    (iv) Incentive provisions that place a low degree of risk on the 
contractor;
    (v) Performance-based payments totaling the maximum allowable 
amount(s) specified at FAR 32.1004(b)(2); or
    (vi) A performance-based payment schedule that is routine with 
minimal risk.
    (e) Costs financed. (1) Costs financed equal total costs multiplied 
by the portion (percent) of costs financed by the contractor.
    (2) Total costs equal Block 20 (i.e., all allowable costs excluding 
facilities capital cost of money), reduced as appropriate when--
    (i) The contractor has little cash investment (e.g., subcontractor 
progress payments liquidated late in period of performance);
    (ii) Some costs are covered by special financing provisions, such as 
advance payments; or
    (iii) The contract is multiyear and there are special funding 
arrangements.
    (3) The portion that the contractor finances is generally the 
portion not covered by progress payments, i.e., 100 percent minus the 
customary progress payment rate (see FAR 32.501). For example, if a 
contractor receives progress payments at 80 percent, the portion that 
the contractor finances is 20 percent. On contracts that provide 
progress payments to small businesses, use the customary progress 
payment rate for large businesses.
    (f) Contract length factor. (1) This is the period of time that the 
contractor has a working capital investment in the contract. It--
    (i) Is based on the time necessary for the contractor to complete 
the substantive portion of the work;
    (ii) Is not necessarily the period of time between contract award 
and final delivery (or final payment), as periods of minimal effort 
should be excluded;
    (iii) Should not include periods of performance contained in option 
provisions; and
    (iv) Should not, for multiyear contracts, include periods of 
performance beyond that required to complete the initial program year's 
requirements.
    (2) The contracting officer--
    (i) Should use the following table to select the contract length 
factor;
    (ii) Should develop a weighted average contract length when the 
contract has multiple deliveries; and
    (iii) May use sampling techniques provided they produce a 
representative result.

215.404-71-4  Facilities capital employed.

    (a) Description. This factor focuses on encouraging and rewarding 
capital investment in facilities that benefit DoD. It recognizes both 
the facilities capital that the contractor will employ in contract 
performance and the contractor's commitment to improving productivity.

[[Page 80]]

    (b) Contract facilities capital estimates. The contracting officer 
shall estimate the facilities capital cost of money and capital employed 
using--
    (1) An analysis of the appropriate Forms CASB-CMF and cost of money 
factors (48 CFR 9904.414 and FAR 31.205-10); and
    (2) DD Form 1861, Contract Facilities Capital Cost of Money.
    (c) Use of DD Form 1861. See PGI 215.404-71-4(c) for obtaining field 
pricing support for preparing DD Form 1861.
    (1) Purpose. The DD Form 1861 provides a means of linking the Form 
CASB-CMF and DD Form 1547, Record of Weighted Guidelines Application. 
It--
    (i) Enables the contracting officer to differentiate profit 
objectives for various types of assets (land, buildings, equipment). The 
procedure is similar to applying overhead rates to appropriate overhead 
allocation bases to determine contract overhead costs.
    (ii) Is designed to record and compute the contract facilities 
capital cost of money and capital employed which is carried forward to 
DD Form 1547.
    (2) Completion instructions. Complete a DD Form 1861 only after 
evaluating the contractor's cost proposal, establishing cost of money 
factors, and establishing a prenegotiation objective on cost. Complete 
the form as follows:
    (i) List overhead pools and direct-charging service centers (if 
used) in the same structure as they appear on the contractor's cost 
proposal and Form CASB-CMF. The structure and allocation base units-of-
measure must be compatible on all three displays.
    (ii) Extract appropriate contract overhead allocation base data, by 
year, from the evaluated cost breakdown or prenegotiation cost objective 
and list against each overhead pool and direct-charging service center.
    (iii) Multiply each allocation base by its corresponding cost of 
money factor to get the facilities capital cost of money estimated to be 
incurred each year. The sum of these products represents the estimated 
contract facilities capital cost of money for the year's effort.
    (iv) Total contract facilities cost of money is the sum of the 
yearly amounts.
    (v) Since the facilities capital cost of money factors reflect the 
applicable cost of money rate in Column 1 of Form CASB-CMF, divide the 
contract cost of money by that same rate to determine the contract 
facilities capital employed.
    (d) Preaward facilities capital applications. To establish cost and 
price objectives, apply the facilities capital cost of money and capital 
employed as follows:
    (1) Cost of Money. (i) Cost Objective. Use the imputed facilities 
capital cost of money, with normal, booked costs, to establish a cost 
objective or the target cost when structuring an incentive type 
contract. Do not adjust target costs established at the outset even 
though actual cost of money rates become available during the period of 
contract performance.
    (ii) Profit Objective. When measuring the contractor's effort for 
the purpose of establishing a prenegotiation profit objective, restrict 
the cost base to normal, booked costs. Do not include cost of money as 
part of the cost base.
    (2) Facilities Capital Employed. Assess and weight the profit 
objective for risk associated with facilities capital employed in 
accordance with the profit guidelines at 215.404-71-4.
    (e) Determination. The following extract from the DD Form 1547 has 
been annotated to explain the process.

    (1) Select a value from the list in paragraph (c) of this subsection 
using the evaluation criteria in paragraph (d) of this subsection.

[[Page 81]]

    (2) Use the allocated facilities capital attributable to land, 
buildings, and equipment, as derived in DD Form 1861, Contract 
Facilities Capital Cost of Money.
    (i) In addition to the net book value of facilities capital 
employed, consider facilities capital that is part of a formal 
investment plan if the contractor submits reasonable evidence that--
    (A) Achievable benefits to DoD will result from the investment; and
    (B) The benefits of the investment are included in the forward 
pricing structure.
    (ii) If the value of intracompany transfers has been included in 
Block 20 at cost (i.e., excluding general and administrative (G&A) 
expenses and profit), add to the contractor's allocated facilities 
capital, the allocated facilities capital attributable to the buildings 
and equipment of those corporate divisions supplying the intracompany 
transfers. Do not make this addition if the value of intracompany 
transfers has been included in Block 20 at price (i.e., including G&A 
expenses and profit).
    (3) Multiply (1) by (2).
    (f) Values: Normal and designated ranges. These are the normal 
values and ranges. They apply to all situations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (g) Evaluation criteria. (1) In evaluating facilities capital 
employed, the contracting officer--
    (i) Should relate the usefulness of the facilities capital to the 
goods or services being acquired under the prospective contract;
    (ii) Should analyze the productivity improvements and other 
anticipated industrial base enhancing benefits resulting from the 
facilities capital investment, including--
    (A) The economic value of the facilities capital, such as physical 
age, undepreciated value, idleness, and expected contribution to future 
defense needs; and
    (B) The contractor's level of investment in defense related 
facilities as compared with the portion of the contractor's total 
business that is derived from DoD; and
    (iii) Should consider any contractual provisions that reduce the 
contractor's risk of investment recovery, such as termination protection 
clauses and capital investment indemnification.
    (2) Above normal conditions. (i) The contracting officer may assign 
a higher than normal value if the facilities capital investment has 
direct, identifiable, and exceptional benefits. Indicators are--
    (A) New investments in state-of-the-art technology that reduce 
acquisition cost or yield other tangible benefits such as improved 
product quality or accelerated deliveries; or
    (B) Investments in new equipment for research and development 
applications.
    (ii) The contracting officer may assign a value significantly above 
normal when there are direct and measurable benefits in efficiency and 
significantly reduced acquisition costs on the effort being priced. 
Maximum values apply only to those cases where the benefits of the 
facilities capital investment are substantially above normal.
    (3) Below normal conditions. (i) The contracting officer may assign 
a lower than normal value if the facilities capital investment has 
little benefit to DoD. Indicators are--
    (A) Allocations of capital apply predominantly to commercial item 
lines;
    (B) Investments are for such things as furniture and fixtures, home 
or group level administrative offices, corporate aircraft and hangars, 
gymnasiums; or
    (C) Facilities are old or extensively idle.
    (ii) The contracting officer may assign a value significantly below 
normal when a significant portion of defense manufacturing is done in an 
environment characterized by outdated, inefficient, and labor-intensive 
capital equipment.

215.404-71-5  Cost efficiency factor.

    (a) This special factor provides an incentive for contractors to 
reduce costs. To the extent that the contractor can demonstrate cost 
reduction efforts that benefit the pending contract, the contracting 
officer may increase the prenegotiation profit objective by an amount 
not to exceed 4 percent of total objective cost (Block 20 of the DD Form 
1547) to recognize these efforts (Block 29).
    (b) To determine if using this factor is appropriate, the 
contracting officer shall consider criteria, such as the following, to 
evaluate the benefit the contractor's cost reduction efforts will have 
on the pending contract:
    (1) The contractor's participation in Single Process Initiative 
improvements;
    (2) Actual cost reductions achieved on prior contracts;
    (3) Reduction or elimination of excess or idle facilities;
    (4) The contractor's cost reduction initiatives (e.g., competition 
advocacy programs, technical insertion programs, obsolete parts control 
programs, spare parts pricing reform, value engineering, outsourcing of 
functions such as information technology). Metrics developed by the 
contractor such as fully loaded labor hours (i.e., cost per labor hour, 
including all direct and indirect costs) or other productivity measures 
may provide the basis for assessing the effectiveness of the 
contractor's cost reduction initiatives over time;
    (5) The contractor's adoption of process improvements to reduce 
costs;
    (6) Subcontractor cost reduction efforts;
    (7) The contractor's effective incorporation of commercial items and 
processes; or
    (8) The contractor's investment in new facilities when such 
investments contribute to better asset utilization or improved 
productivity.
    (c) When selecting the percentage to use for this special factor, 
the contracting officer has maximum flexibility in determining the best 
way to evaluate the benefit the contractor's cost reduction efforts will 
have on the pending contract. However, the contracting officer shall 
consider the impact that quantity differences, learning, changes in 
scope, and economic factors such as inflation and deflation will have on 
cost reduction.

215.404-72  Modified weighted guidelines method for nonprofit organizations other than FFRDCs.

    (a) Definition. As used in this subpart, a nonprofit organization is 
a business entity--
    (1) That operates exclusively for charitable, scientific, or 
educational purposes;
    (2) Whose earnings do not benefit any private shareholder or 
individual;
    (3) Whose activities do not involve influencing legislation or 
political campaigning for any candidate for public office; and
    (4) That is exempted from Federal income taxation under section 501 
of the Internal Revenue Code.
    (b) For nonprofit organizations that are entities that have been 
identified by the Secretary of Defense or a Secretary of a Department as 
receiving sustaining support on a cost-plus-fixed-fee basis from a 
particular DoD department or agency, compute a fee objective for covered 
actions using the weighted guidelines method in 215.404-71, with the 
following modifications:
    (1) Modifications to performance risk (Blocks 21-23 of the DD Form 
1547). (i) If the contracting officer assigns a value from the standard 
designated range (see 215.404-71-2(c)), reduce the fee objective by an 
amount equal to 1 percent of the costs in Block 20 of the DD Form 1547. 
Show the net (reduced) amount on the DD Form 1547.
    (ii) Do not assign a value from the technology incentive designated 
range.
    (2) Modifications to contract type risk (Block 24 of the DD Form 
1547). Use a designated range of -1 percent to 0 percent instead of the 
values in 215.404-71-3. There is no normal value.
    (c) For all other nonprofit organizations except FFRDCs, compute a 
fee objective for covered actions using the weighted guidelines method 
in 215.404-

215.404-73  Alternate structured approaches.

    (a) The contracting officer may use an alternate structured approach 
under 215.404-4(c).
    (b) The contracting officer may design the structure of the 
alternate, but it shall include--
    (1) Consideration of the three basic components of profit--
performance risk, contract type risk (including working capital), and 
facilities capital employed. However, the contracting officer is not 
required to complete Blocks 21 through 30 of the DD Form 1547.
    (2) Offset for facilities capital cost of money.
    (i) The contracting officer shall reduce the overall prenegotiation 
profit objective by the amount of facilities capital cost of money under 
Cost Accounting Standard (CAS) 414, Cost of Money as an Element of the 
Cost of Facilities Capital (48 CFR 9904.414). Cost of money under CAS 
417, Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Capital Assets Under 
Construction (48 CFR 9904.417), should not be used to reduce the overall 
prenegotiation profit objective. The profit amount in the negotiation 
summary of the DD Form 1547 must be net of the offset.
    (ii) This adjustment is needed for the following reason: The values 
of the profit factors used in the weighted guidelines method were 
adjusted to recognize the shift in facilities capital cost of money from 
an element of profit to an element of contract cost (see FAR 31.205-10) 
and reductions were made directly to the profit factors for performance 
risk. In order to ensure that this policy is applied to all DoD 
contracts that allow facilities capital cost of money, similar 
adjustments shall be made to contracts that use alternate structured 
approaches.

215.404-74  Fee requirements for cost-plus-award-fee contracts.

    In developing a fee objective for cost-plus-award-fee contracts, the 
contracting officer shall--
    (a) Follow the guidance in FAR 16.405-2 and 216.405-2;
    (b) Not use the weighted guidelines method or alternate structured 
approach;
    (c) Apply the offset policy in 215.404-73(b)(2) for facilities 
capital cost of money, i.e., reduce the base fee by the amount of 
facilities capital cost of money; and
    (d) Not complete a DD Form 1547.

215.404-75  Fee requirements for FFRDCs.

    For nonprofit organizations that are FFRDCs, the contracting 
officer--
    (a) Should consider whether any fee is appropriate. Considerations 
shall include the FFRDC's--
    (1) Proportion of retained earnings (as established under generally 
accepted accounting methods) that relates to DoD contracted effort;
    (2) Facilities capital acquisition plans;
    (3) Working capital funding as assessed on operating cycle cash 
needs; and
    (4) Provision for funding unreimbursed costs deemed ordinary and 
necessary to the FFRDC.
    (b) Shall, when a fee is considered appropriate, establish the fee 
objective in accordance with FFRDC fee policies in the DoD FFRDC 
Management Plan.
    (c) Shall not use the weighted guidelines method or an alternate 
structured approach.

215.407-5  Estimating systems.


<R05>
215.407-5-70  Disclosure, maintenance, and review requirements.

    (a) Definitions. (1) Acceptable estimating system is defined in the 
clause at 252.215-7002, Cost Estimating System Requirements.
    (2) Contractor means a business unit as defined in FAR 2.101.
    (3) Estimating system is as defined in the clause at 252.215-7002, 
Cost Estimating System Requirements.
    (4) Significant estimating system deficiency means a shortcoming in 
the estimating system that is likely to consistently result in proposal 
estimates for total cost or a major cost element(s) that do not provide 
an acceptable basis for negotiation of fair and reasonable prices.
    (b) Applicability. (1) DoD policy is that all contractors have 
acceptable estimating systems that consistently produce well-supported 
proposals that are acceptable as a basis for negotiation of fair and 
reasonable prices.
    (2) A large business contractor is subject to estimating system 
disclosure, maintenance, and review requirements if--
    (i) In its preceding fiscal year, the contractor received DoD prime 
contracts or subcontracts totaling $50 million or more for which cost or 
pricing data were required; or
    (ii) In its preceding fiscal year, the contractor received DoD prime 
contracts or subcontracts totaling $10 million or more (but less than 
$50 million) for which cost or pricing data were required and the 
contracting officer, with concurrence or at the request of the ACO, 
determines it to be in the best interest of the Government (e.g., 
significant estimating problems are believed to exist or the 
contractor's sales are predominantly Government).
    (c) Responsibilities. (1) The contracting officer shall--
    (i) Through use of the clause at 252.215-7002, Cost Estimating 
System Requirements, apply the disclosure, maintenance, and review 
requirements to large business contractors meeting the criteria in 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this subsection;
    (ii) Consider whether to apply the disclosure, maintenance, and 
review requirements to large business contractors under paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii) of this subsection; and
    (iii) Not apply the disclosure, maintenance, and review requirements 
to other than large business contractors.
    (2) The cognizant ACO, for contractors subject to paragraph (b)(2) 
of this subsection, shall--
    (i) Determine the acceptability of the disclosure and system; and
    (ii) Pursue correction of any deficiencies.
    (3) The cognizant auditor, on behalf of the ACO, serves as team 
leader in conducting estimating system reviews.
    (4) A contractor subject to estimating system disclosure, 
maintenance, and review requirements shall--
    (i) Maintain an acceptable system;
    (ii) Describe its system to the ACO:
    (iii) Provide timely notice of changes in the system; and

[[Page 85]]

    (iv) Correct system deficiencies identified by the ACO.
    (d) Characteristics of an acceptable estimating system--(1) General. 
An acceptable system should provide for the use of appropriate source 
data, utilize sound estimating techniques and good judgment, maintain a 
consistent approach, and adhere to established policies and procedures.
    (2) Evaluation. In evaluating the acceptability of a contractor's 
estimating system, the ACO should consider whether the contractor's 
estimating system, for example--
    (i) Establishes clear responsibility for preparation, review, and 
approval of cost estimates;
    (ii) Provides a written description of the organization and duties 
of the personnel responsible for preparing, reviewing, and approving 
cost estimates;
    (iii) Assures that relevant personnel have sufficient training, 
experience, and guidance to perform estimating tasks in accordance with 
the contractor's established procedures;
    (iv) Identifies the sources of data and the estimating methods and 
rationale used in developing cost estimates;
    (v) Provides for appropriate supervision throughout the estimating 
process;
    (vi) Provides for consistent application of estimating techniques;
    (vii) Provides for detection and timely correction of errors;
    (viii) Protects against cost duplication and omissions;
    (ix) Provides for the use of historical experience, including 
historical vendor pricing information, where appropriate;
    (x) Requires use of appropriate analytical methods;
    (xi) Integrates information available from other management systems, 
where appropriate;
    (xii) Requires management review including verification that the 
company's estimating policies, procedures, and practices comply with 
this regulation;
    (xiii) Provides for internal review of and accountability for the 
acceptability of the estimating system, including the comparison of 
projected results to actual results and an analysis of any differences;
    (xiv) Provides procedures to update cost estimates in a timely 
manner throughout the negotiation process; and
    (xv) Addresses responsibility for review and analysis of the 
reasonableness of subcontract prices.
    (3) Indicators of potentially significant estimating deficiencies. 
The following examples indicate conditions that may produce or lead to 
significant estimating deficiencies--
    (i) Failure to ensure that historical experience is available to and 
utilized by cost estimators, where appropriate;
    (ii) Continuing failure to analyze material costs or failure to 
perform subcontractor cost reviews as required;
    (iii) Consistent absence of analytical support for significant 
proposed cost amounts;
    (iv) Excessive reliance on individual personal judgments where 
historical experience or commonly utilized standards are available;
    (v) Recurring significant defective pricing findings within the same 
cost element(s);
    (vi) Failure to integrate relevant parts of other management systems 
(e.g., production control or cost accounting) with the estimating system 
so that the ability to generate reliable cost estimates is impaired; and
    (vii) Failure to provide established policies, procedures, and 
practices to persons responsible for preparing and supporting estimates.
    (e) Review procedures. Follow the procedures at PGI 215.407-5-70(e) 
for establishing and conducting estimating system reviews.
    (f) Disposition of survey team findings. Follow the procedures at 
PGI 215.407-5-70(f) for disposition of the survey team findings.
    (g) Impact of estimating system deficiencies on specific proposals. 
(1) Field pricing teams will discuss identified estimating system 
deficiencies and their impact in all reports on contractor proposals 
until the deficiencies are resolved.
    (2) The contracting officer responsible for negotiation of a 
proposal generated by an estimating system with an identified deficiency 
shall evaluate

[[Page 86]]

whether the deficiency impacts the negotiations. If it does not, the 
contracting officer should proceed with negotiations. If it does, the 
contracting officer should consider other alternatives, e.g.--
    (i) Allowing the contractor additional time to correct the 
estimating system deficiency and submit a corrected proposal;
    (ii) Considering another type of contract, e.g., FPIF instead of 
FFP;
    (iii) Using additional cost analysis techniques to determine the 
reasonableness of the cost elements affected by the system's deficiency;
    (iv) Segregating the questionable areas as a cost reimbursable line 
item;
    (v) Reducing the negotiation objective for profit or fee; or
    (vi) Including a contract (reopener) clause that provides for 
adjustment of the contract amount after award.
    (3) The contracting officer who incorporates a reopener clause into 
the contract is responsible for negotiating price adjustments required 
by the clause. Any reopener clause necessitated by an estimating 
deficiency should--
    (i) Clearly identify the amounts and items that are in question at 
the time of negotiation;
    (ii) Indicate a specific time or subsequent event by which the 
contractor will submit a supplemental proposal, including cost or 
pricing data, identifying the cost impact adjustment necessitated by the 
deficient estimating system;
    (iii) Provide for the contracting officer to unilaterally adjust the 
contract price if the contractor fails to submit the supplemental 
proposal; and
    (iv) Provide that failure of the Government and the contractor to 
agree to the price adjustment shall be a dispute under the Disputes 
clause.

216.405-2  Cost-plus-award-fee contracts.

    (b) Application. The cost-plus-award-fee (CPAF) contract may include 
provisional award fee payments. A provisional award fee payment is a 
payment made within an evaluation period prior to a final evaluation for 
that period. The contracting officer may include provisional award fee 
payments in a CPAF contract on a case-by-case basis, provided those 
payments--
    (i) Are made no more frequently than monthly;
    (ii) Are limited to no more than--
    (A) For the initial award fee evaluation period, 50 percent of the 
award fee available for that period; and
    (B) For subsequent award fee evaluation periods, 80 percent of the 
evaluation score for the prior evaluation period times the award fee 
available for the current period, e.g., if the contractor received 90 
percent of the award fee available for the prior evaluation period, 
provisional payments for the current period shall not exceed 72 percent 
(90 percent x 80 percent) of the award fee available for the current 
period;
    (iii) Are superseded by an interim or final award fee evaluation for 
the applicable evaluation period. If provisional payments have exceeded 
the payment determined by the evaluation score for the applicable 
period, the contracting officer shall collect the debt in accordance 
with FAR 32.606; and
    (iv) May be discontinued, or reduced in such amounts deemed 
appropriate by the contracting officer, when the contracting officer 
determines that the contractor will not achieve a level of performance 
commensurate with the provisional payment. The contracting officer shall 
notify the contractor in writing of any discontinuance or reduction in 
provisional award fee payments.
    (c) Limitations.
    (i) The CPAF contract shall not be used--
    (A) To avoid--
    (1) Establishing cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts when the criteria for 
cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts apply; or
    (2) Developing objective targets so a cost-plus-incentive-fee 
contract can be used; or
    (B) For either engineering development or operational system 
development acquisitions that have specifications suitable for 
simultaneous research and development and production, except a CPAF 
contract may be used for individual engineering development or 
operational system development acquisitions ancillary to the development 
of a major weapon system or equipment, where--

[[Page 90]]

    (1) It is more advantageous; and
    (2) The purpose of the acquisition is clearly to determine or solve 
specific problems associated with the major weapon system or equipment.
    (ii) Do not apply the weighted guidelines method to CPAF contracts 
for either the base (fixed) fee or the award fee.
    (iii) The base fee shall not exceed 3 percent of the estimated cost 
of the contract exclusive of the fee.

70 if FAR 16.505(b)(2)(ii) or (iii) is deemed to apply.
    (c) An order exceeding $100,000 is placed on a competitive basis 
only if the contracting officer--
    (1) Provides a fair notice of the intent to make the purchase, 
including a description of the supplies to be delivered or the services 
to be performed and the basis upon which the contracting officer will 
make the selection, to all contractors offering the required supplies or 
services under the multiple award contract; and
    (2) Affords all contractors responding to the notice a fair 
opportunity to submit an offer and have that offer fairly considered.
    (d) When using the procedures in this subsection--

217.170  General.

    (a) Before awarding a multiyear contract, the head of the agency 
must compare the cost of that contract to the cost of an annual 
procurement approach, using a present value analysis. Do not award the 
multiyear contract unless the analysis shows that the multiyear contract 
will result in the lower cost (10 U.S.C. 2306b(l)(7); Section 8008(a) of 
Public Law 105-56 and similar sections in subsequent DoD appropriations 
acts).
    (b) The head of the agency must provide written notice to the 
congressional defense committees at least 10 days before termination of 
any multiyear contract (10 U.S.C. 2306b(l)(6); 10 U.S.C. 2306c(d)(3); 
Section 8008(a) of Public Law 105-56 and similar sections in subsequent 
DoD appropriations acts).
    (c) Every multiyear contract must comply with FAR 17.104(c), unless 
an exception is approved through the budget process in coordination with 
the cognizant comptroller.
    (d)(1) DoD must receive authorization from, or provide notification 
to, Congress before entering into a multiyear contract for certain 
procurements, including those expected to--
    (i) Exceed $500 million for supplies (see 217.172(c) and 
217.172(e)(4)) or $572.5 million for services (see 217.171(a)(6));
    (ii) Employ economic order quantity procurement in excess of $20 
million in any one year (see 217.174(a)(1));
    (iii) Employ an unfunded contingent liability in excess of $20 
million (see 217.171(a)(4)(i) and 217.172(d)(1));
    (iv) Involve a contract for advance procurement leading to a 
multiyear contract that employs economic order quantity procurement in 
excess of $20 million in any one year (see 217.174(a)(2)); or
    (v) Include a cancellation ceiling in excess of $100 million (see 
217.171(a)(4)(ii) and 217.172(d)(2)).
    (2) A DoD component must submit a request for authority to enter 
into multiyear contracts described in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iv) 
of this section as part of the component's budget submission for the 
fiscal year in which the multiyear contract will be initiated. DoD will 
include the request, for each candidate it supports, as part of the 
President's Budget for that year and in the Appendix to that budget as 
part of proposed legislative language for the appropriations bill for 
that year (Section 8008(b) of Public Law 105-56).
    (3) If the advisability of using a multiyear contract becomes 
apparent too late to satisfy the requirements in paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section, the request for authority to enter into a multiyear 
contract must be--
    (i) Formally submitted by the President as a budget amendment; or
    (ii) Made by the Secretary of Defense, in writing, to the 
congressional defense committees. (Section 8008(b) of Public Law 105-56)
    (4) Agencies must establish reporting procedures to meet the 
congressional notification requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section. The head of the agency must submit a copy of each notice to the 
Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy, Office of the 
Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) 
(OUSD(AT&L)DPAP), and to the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense 
(Comptroller) (Program/Budget) (OUSD (C) (P/B)).

217.171  Multiyear contracts for services.

    (a) 10 U.S.C. 2306c. (1) The head of the agency may enter into a 
multiyear contract for a period of not more than 5 years for the 
following types of services (and items of supply relating to such 
services), even though funds are limited by statute to obligation only

[[Page 94]]

during the fiscal year for which they were appropriated:
    (i) Operation, maintenance, and support of facilities and 
installations.
    (ii) Maintenance or modification of aircraft, ships, vehicles, and 
other highly complex military equipment.
    (iii) Specialized training requiring high quality instructor skills 
(e.g., training for pilots and aircrew members or foreign language 
training).
    (iv) Base services (e.g., ground maintenance, in-plane refueling, 
bus transportation, and refuse collection and disposal).
    (v) Environmental remediation services for--
    (A) An active military installation;
    (B) A military installation being closed or realigned under a base 
closure law as defined in 10 U.S.C. 2667(h)(2); or
    (C) A site formerly used by DoD.
    (2) The head of the agency must be guided by the following 
principles when entering into a multiyear contract for services:
    (i) The portion of the cost of any plant or equipment amortized as a 
cost of contract performance should not exceed the ratio between the 
period of contract performance and the anticipated useful commercial 
life of the plant or equipment. As used in this section, ``useful 
commercial life'' means the commercial utility of the facilities rather 
than the physical life, with due consideration given to such factors as 
the location, specialized nature, and obsolescence of the facilities.
    (ii) Consider the desirability of obtaining an option to extend the 
term of the contract for a reasonable period not to exceed 3 years at 
prices that do not include charges for plant, equipment, or other 
nonrecurring costs already amortized.
    (iii) Consider the desirability of reserving the right to take 
title, under the appropriate circumstances, to the plant or equipment 
upon payment of the unamortized portion of the cost.
    (3) Before entering into a multiyear contract for services, the head 
of the agency must make a written determination that--
    (i) There will be a continuing requirement for the services 
consistent with current plans for the proposed contract period;
    (ii) Furnishing the services will require--
    (A) A substantial initial investment in plant or equipment; or
    (B) The incurrence of substantial contingent liabilities for the 
assembly, training, or transportation of a specialized work force; and
    (iii) Using a multiyear contract will promote the best interests of 
the United States by encouraging effective competition and promoting 
economies in operations.
    (4) The head of the agency must provide written notice to the 
congressional defense committees at least 30 days before award of a 
multiyear contract for services that include--
    (i) An unfunded contingent liability in excess of $20 million 
(Section 8008(a) of Public Law 105-56 and similar sections in subsequent 
DoD appropriations acts); or
    (ii) A cancellation ceiling in excess of $100 million.
    (5) If the budget for a contract that contains a cancellation 
ceiling in excess of $100 million does not include proposed funding for 
the costs of contract cancellation up to the cancellation ceiling 
established in the contract--
    (i) The notification required by paragraph (a)(4) of this section 
shall include--
    (A) The cancellation ceiling amounts planned for each program year 
in the proposed multiyear contract, together with the reasons for the 
amounts planned;
    (B) The extent to which costs of contract cancellation are not 
included in the budget for the contract; and
    (C) A financial risk assessment of not including budgeting for costs 
of contract cancellation (10 U.S.C. 2306c(d)); and
    (ii) The head of the agency shall provide copies of the notification 
to the Office of Management and Budget at least 14 days before contract 
award in accordance with the procedures at PGI 217.1.
    (6) The head of the agency must not initiate a multiyear contract 
for services exceeding $572.5 million unless a law specifically provides 
authority for the contract.

[[Page 95]]

    (b) 10 U.S.C. 2829. (1) The head of the agency may enter into 
multiyear contracts for supplies and services required for management, 
maintenance, and operation of military family housing and may pay the 
costs of such contracts for each year from annual appropriations for 
that year.
    (2) The head of the agency may use this authority only if the term 
of the contract does not exceed 4 years.

authorized by law. For additional policies that apply only to multiyear 
contracts for weapon systems, see 217.173.
    (b) The head of the agency may enter into a multiyear contract for 
supplies if, in addition to the conditions listed in FAR 17.105-1(b), 
the use of such a contract will promote the national security of the 
United States (10 U.S.C. 2306b(a)(6)).
    (c) The head of the agency must not enter into or extend a multiyear 
contract that exceeds $500 million (when entered into or when extended) 
until the Secretary of Defense identifies the contract and any extension 
in a report submitted to the congressional defense committees (10 U.S.C. 
2306b(l)(5)).
    (d) The head of the agency must provide written notice to the 
congressional defense committees at least 30 days before award of a 
multiyear contract that includes--
    (1) An unfunded contingent liability in excess of $20 million (10 
U.S.C. 2306b(l)(1)(B)(i)(II); Section 8008(a) of Public Law 105-56 and 
similar sections in subsequent DoD appropriations acts); or
    (2) A cancellation ceiling in excess of $100 million (10 U.S.C. 
2306b(g)).
    (e) The head of the agency shall ensure that the following 
conditions are satisfied before awarding a multiyear contract under the 
authority described in paragraph (b) of this section:
    (1) The multiyear exhibits required by DoD 7000.14-R, Financial 
Management Regulation, are included in the agency's budget estimate 
submission and the President's budget request.
    (2) The Secretary of Defense certifies to Congress that the current 
5-year defense program fully funds the support costs associated with the 
multiyear program (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(1)(A)).
    (i) The head of the agency shall submit information supporting this 
certification to USD(C)(P/B) for transmission to Congress through the 
Secretary of Defense.
    (ii) In the case of a contract with a cancellation ceiling in excess 
of $100 million, if the budget for the contract does not include 
proposed funding for the costs of contract cancellation up to the 
cancellation ceiling established in the contract--
    (A) The head of the agency shall, as part of this certification, 
give written notification to the congressional defense committees of--
    (1) The cancellation ceiling amounts planned for each program year 
in the proposed multiyear contract, together with the reasons for the 
amounts planned;
    (2) The extent to which costs of contract cancellation are not 
included in the budget for the contract; and
    (3) A financial risk assessment of not including the budgeting for 
costs of contract cancellation (10 U.S.C. 2306b(g)); and
    (B) The head of the agency shall provide copies of the notification 
to the Office of Management and Budget at least 14 days before contract 
award in accordance with the procedures at PGI 217.1.
    (3) The proposed multiyear contract provides for production at not 
less than minimum economic rates, given the existing tooling and 
facilities (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(1)(B)). The head of the agency shall 
submit to USD(C)(P/B) information supporting the agency's determination 
that this requirement has been met.
    (4) If the value of a multiyear contract for a particular system or 
component exceeds $500 million, use of a multiyear contract is 
specifically authorized by--
    (i) An appropriations act (10 U.S.C. 2306b(l)(3)); and

[[Page 96]]

    (ii) A law other than an appropriations act (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3)).
    (5) The contract is for the procurement of a complete and usable end 
item (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(4)(A)).
    (6) Funds appropriated for any fiscal year for advance procurement 
are obligated only for the procurement of those long-lead items that are 
necessary in order to meet a planned delivery schedule for complete 
major end items that are programmed under the contract to be acquired 
with funds appropriated for a subsequent fiscal year (including an 
economic order quantity of such long-lead items when authorized by law 
(10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(4)(b)).
    (7) All other requirements of law are met and there are no other 
statutory restrictions on using a multiyear contract for the specific 
system or component (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(2)). One such restriction may be 
the achievement of specified cost savings. If the agency finds, after 
negotiations with the contractor(s), that the specified savings cannot 
be achieved, the head of the agency shall assess the savings that, 
nevertheless, could be achieved by using a multiyear contract. If the 
savings are substantial, the head of the agency may request relief from 
the law's specific savings requirement. The request shall--
    (i) Quantify the savings that can be achieved;
    (ii) Explain any other benefits to the Government of using the 
multiyear contract;
    (iii) Include details regarding the negotiated contract terms and 
conditions; and
    (iv) Be submitted to OUSD (AT&L) DPAP for transmission to Congress 
via the Secretary of Defense and the President.
    (f) The Secretary of Defense may instruct the head of the agency 
proposing a multiyear contract to include in that contract negotiated 
priced options for varying the quantities of end items to be procured 
over the life of the contract (10 U.S.C. 2306b(j)).
    (g) The head of an agency shall not award a multiyear contract using 
fiscal year 2005 appropriated funds unless--
    (1) The Secretary of Defense has submitted to Congress a budget 
request for full funding of units to be procured through the contract;
    (2) Cancellation provisions in the contract do not include 
consideration of recurring manufacturing costs of the contractor 
associated with the production of unfunded units to be delivered under 
the contract; and
    (3) The contract provides that payments to the contractor under the 
contract shall not be made in advance of incurred costs on funded units 
(Section 8008 of Pub. L. 108-287).
    (h) Do not award a multiyear contract using fiscal year 2005 
appropriated funds that provides for a price adjustment based on a 
failure to award a follow-on contract (Section 8008 of Public Law 108-
287).

property and application of the exchange allowance to the acquisition of 
similar property. This subpart does not authorize the sale of nonexcess 
personal property.


<R05>
217.7001  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart--
    (a) Exchange (trade-in) property means property which--
    (1) Is not excess but is eligible for replacement (because of 
obsolescence, unserviceability, or other reason); and
    (2) Is applied as whole or partial payment toward the acquisition of 
similar items (i.e., items designed and constructed for the same 
purpose).
    (b) Property means items that fall within one of the generic 
categories listed in DoD 4140.1-R, DoD Materiel Management Regulation, 
Chapter 6.2, Exchange or Sale of Nonexcess Personal Property.

<R05>
217.7002  Policy.

    DoD policy is to exchange, rather than replace, eligible nonexcess 
property whenever exchange promotes economical and efficient program 
accomplishment. Exchange policy, authority, and applicability are 
governed by--
    (a) The Federal Property Management Regulations issued by the 
Administrator of the General Services Administration; and
    (b) DoD 4140.1-R, Chapter 6.2.

<R05>
217.7003  Purchase request.

    Ensure that the requiring activity provides all of the following in 
support of the purchase request--
    (a) A certification that the property is eligible for exchange and 
complies

[[Page 99]]

with all conditions and limitations of DoD 4140.1-R, Chapter 6.2.
    (b) A written determination of economic advantage indicating--
    (1) The anticipated economic advantage to the Government from use of 
the exchange authority;
    (2) That exchange allowances shall be applied toward, or in partial 
payment of, the items to be acquired; and
    (3) That, if required, the exchange property has been rendered safe 
or innocuous or has been demilitarized;
    (c) All applicable approvals for the exchange; and
    (d) A description of the property available for exchange (e.g., 
nomenclature, location, serial number, estimated travel value).

[56 FR 36345, July 31, 1991, as amended at 65 FR 39705, June 27, 2000]


<R05>
217.7004  Solicitation and award.

    (a) Solicitations shall include a request for offerors to state 
prices--
    (1) For the new items being acquired without any exchange; and
    (2) For the new items with the exchange (trade-in allowance) for the 
exchange property listed.
    (b) The contracting officer is not obligated to award on an exchange 
basis. If the lowest evaluated offer is an offer for the new items 
without any exchange, the contracting officer may award on that basis 
and forgo the exchange.
    (c) Exchanges may be made only with the successful offeror. When the 
successful offer includes an exchange, award one contract for both the 
acquisition of the new property and the trade-in of the exchange 
property. The only exception is when the items must be acquired against 
a mandatory Federal supply schedule contract, in which case, award a 
separate contract for the exchange.


<R05>
217.7005  Solicitation provision.

    Use the provision at 252.217-7002, Offering Property for Exchange, 
when offering nonexcess personal property for exchange. Allow a minimum 
of 14 calendar days for the inspection period in paragraph (b) of the 
clause if the exchange property is in the contiguous United States. 
Allow at least 21 calendar days outside the contiguous United States.

    (1) Request ship repair work; and
    (2) Possess the organization and facilities to perform the work 
satisfactorily. (Issuance of a master agreement

[[Page 100]]

does not indicate approval of the contractor's facility for any 
particular acquisition and is not an affirmative determination of 
responsibility under FAR subpart 9.1 for any particular acquisition.)
    (b) Activities may use master agreements in work with prospective 
contractors located outside the United States and its outlying areas.
    (c) Activities may issue job orders under master agreements to

Subpart 217.72 [Reserved]


<R04>
           Subpart 217.73_Identification of Sources of Supply


<R05>
217.7300  Scope.

    This subpart implements 10 U.S.C. 2384. It contains policy and 
procedures for requiring contractors to identify the actual manufacturer 
of supplies furnished to DoD.


<R05>
217.7301  Policy.

    Contractors shall identify their sources of supply in contracts for 
supplies. Contractor identification of sources of supply enables 
solicitation, in subsequent acquisitions, of actual manufacturers or 
other suppliers of items. This enhances competition and potentially 
avoids payment of additional costs for no significant added value.


<R05>
217.7302  Procedures.

    (a) Whenever practicable, include a requirement for contractor 
identification of sources of supply in all contracts for the delivery of 
supplies. The identification shall include--
    (1) The item's actual manufacturer or producer, or all the 
contractor's sources for the item;
    (2) The item's national stock number (if there is one);
    (3) The item identification number used by--
    (i) The actual manufacturer or producer of the item; or
    (ii) Each of the contractor's sources for the item; and
    (4) The source of any technical data delivered under the contract.
    (b) The requirement in paragraph (a) of this section does not apply 
to contracts that are--
    (1) For commercial items; or
    (2) Valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold.

[56 FR 36345, July 31, 1991, as amended at 64 FR 2597, Jan. 15, 1999]


<R05>
217.7303  Solicitation provision.

    (a) Use the provision at 252.217-7026, Identification of Sources of 
Supply, or one substantially the same, in all solicitations for supplies 
when the acquisition is being conducted under other than full and open 
competition, except when--
    (1) Using FAR 6.302-5;
    (2) The contracting officer already has the information required by 
the provision (e.g., the information was obtained under other 
acquisitions);
    (3) The contract is for subsistence, clothing or textiles, fuels, or 
supplies purchased and used outside the United States;
    (4) The contracting officer determines that it would not be 
practicable to require offerors/contractors to provide the information, 
e.g., nonrepetitive local purchases; or
    (5) The contracting officer determines that the exception at 
217.7302(b) applies to all items under the solicitation.

[[Page 102]]

    (b) If appropriate, use the provision at 252.217-7026, 
Identification of Sources of Supply, or one substantially the same, in 
service contracts requiring the delivery of supplies.


<R04>
              Subpart 217.74_Undefinitized Contract Actions


<R05>
217.7400  Scope.

    This subpart prescribes policies and procedures implementing 10 
U.S.C. 2326.


<R05>
217.7401  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart--
    (a) Contract action means an action which results in a contract.
    (1) It includes contract modifications for additional supplies or 
services.
    (2) It does not include change orders, administrative changes, 
funding modifications, or any other contract modifications that are 
within the scope and under the terms of the contract, e.g., engineering 
change proposals, value engineering change proposals, and over and above 
work requests as described in subpart 217.77.
    (b) Definitization means the agreement on, or determination of, 
contract terms, specifications, and price, which converts the 
undefinitized contract action to a definitive contract.
    (c) Qualifying proposal means a proposal containing sufficient 
information for the DoD to do complete and meaningful analyses and 
audits of the--
    (1) Information in the proposal; and
    (2) Any other information that the contracting officer has 
determined DoD needs to review in connection with the contract.
    (d) Undefinitized contract action means any contract action for 
which the contract terms, specifications, or price are not agreed upon 
before performance is begun under the action. Examples are letter 
contracts, orders under basic ordering agreements, and provisioned item 
orders, for which the price has not been agreed upon before performance 
has begun.


<R05>
217.7402  Exceptions.

    The following undefinitized contract actions (UCAs) are not subject 
to this subpart, but the contracting officer should apply the policy to 
them (and to changes under the Changes clause) to the maximum extent 
practicable--
    (a) UCAs for foreign military sales;
    (b) Purchases at or below the simplified acquisition threshold;
    (c) Special access programs;
    (d) Congressionally mandated long-lead procurement contracts.

[56 FR 36345, July 31, 1991, as amended at 61 FR 7743, Feb. 29, 1996]


<R05>
217.7403  Policy.

    DoD policy is that undefinitized contract actions shall--
    (a) Be used only when--
    (1) The negotiation of a definitive contract action is not possible 
in sufficient time to meet the Government's requirements; and
    (2) The Government's interest demands that the contractor be given a 
binding commitment so that contract performance can begin immediately.
    (b) Be as complete and definite as practicable under the particular 
circumstances.


<R05>
217.7404  Limitations.


<R05>
217.7404-1  Authorization.

    The contracting officer shall obtain approval from the head of the 
contracting activity before--
    (a) Entering into a UCA. The request for approval must fully explain 
the need to begin performance before definitization, including the 
adverse impact on agency requirements resulting from delays in beginning 
performance.
    (b) Including requirements for non-urgent spare parts and support 
equipment in a UCA. The request should show that inclusion of the non-
urgent items is consistent with good business practices and in the best 
interest of the United States.
    (c) Modifying the scope of a UCA when performance has already begun. 
The request should show that the modification is consistent with good 
business practices and in the best interests of the United States.


<R05>
217.7404-2  Price ceiling.

    UCAs shall include a not-to-exceed price.

[[Page 103]]


<R05>
217.7404-3  Definitization schedule.

    (a) UCAs shall contain definitization schedules that provide for 
definitization by the earlier of--
    (1) The date that is 180 days after issuance of the action (this 
date may be extended but may not exceed the date that is 180 days after 
the contractor submits a qualifying proposal); or
    (2) The date on which the amount of funds obligated under the 
contract action is equal to more than 50 percent of the not-to-exceed 
price.
    (b) Submission of a qualifying proposal in accordance with the 
definitization schedule is a material element of the contract. If the 
contractor does not submit a timely qualifying proposal, the contracting 
officer may suspend or reduce progress payments under FAR 32.503-6, or 
take other appropriate action.

[56 FR 36345, July 31, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 29498, June 5, 1995; 63 
FR 67803, Dec. 9, 1998]


<R05>
217.7404-4  Limitations on obligations.

    The Government shall not obligate more than 50 percent of the not-
to-exceed price before definitization. However, if a contractor submits 
a qualifying proposal before 50 percent of the not-to-exceed price has 
been obligated by the Government, then the limitation on obligations 
before definitization may be increased to no more than 75 percent (see 
232.102-70 for coverage on provisional delivery payments).

[60 FR 29498, June 5, 1995]


<R05>
217.7404-5  Exceptions.

    (a) The limitations in 217.7404-2, 217.7404-3, and 217.7404-4 do not 
apply to UCAs for the purchase of initial spares.
    (b) The head of an agency may waive the limitations in 217.7404-2, 
217.7404-3, and 217.7404-4 for UCAs if the head of the agency determines 
that the waiver is necessary to support--
    (1) A contingency operation; or
    (2) A humanitarian or peacekeeping operation.

[60 FR 29498, June 5, 1995, as amended at 63 FR 67804, Dec. 9, 1998; 71 
FR 27643, May 12, 2006]


<R05>
217.7404-6  Allowable profit.

    When the final price of a UCA is negotiated after a substantial 
portion of the required performance has been completed, the head of the 
contracting activity shall ensure the profit allowed reflects--
    (a) Any reduced cost risk to the contractor for costs incurred 
during contract performance before negotiation of the final price; and
    (b) The contractor's reduced cost risk for costs incurred during 
performance of the remainder of the contract.

[56 FR 36345, July 31, 1991, as amended at 71 FR 27643, May 12, 2006]


<R05>
217.7405  Contract clauses.

    (a) Use the clause at FAR 52.216-24, Limitation of Government 
Liability, in all UCAs, solicitations associated with UCAs, basic 
ordering agreements, indefinite delivery contracts, and any other type 
of contract providing for the use of UCAs.
    (b) Use the clause at 252.217-7027, Contract Definitization, in all 
UCAs, solicitations associated with UCAs, basic ordering agreements, 
indefinite delivery contracts, and any other type of contract providing 
for the use of UCAs. Insert the applicable information in paragraphs 
(a), (b), and (d) of the clause. If, at the time of entering into the 
UCA, the contracting officer knows that the definitive contract action 
will meet the criteria of FAR 15.403-1, 15.403-2, or 15.403-3 for not 
requiring submission of cost or pricing data, the words ``and cost or 
pricing data'' may be deleted from paragraph (a) of the clause.

217.7501  Definition.

    Replenishment parts, as used in this subpart, means repairable or 
consumable parts acquired after the initial provisioning process.

[71 FR 27643, May 12, 2006]


<R05>
217.7502  General.

    Departments and agencies--
    (a) May acquire replenishment parts concurrently with production of 
the end item.
    (b) Shall provide for full and open competition when fully adequate 
drawings and any other needed data are available with the right to use 
for acquisition purposes (see part 227). However--
    (1) When data is not available for a competitive acquisition, use 
one of the procedures in PGI 217.7504.
    (2) Replenishment parts must be acquired so as to ensure the safe, 
dependable, and effective operation of the equipment. Where this 
assurance is not possible with new sources, competition may be limited 
to the original manufacturer of the equipment or other sources that have 
previously manufactured or furnished the parts as long as the action is 
justified. See 209.270 for requirements applicable to replenishment 
parts for aviation or ship critical safety items.
    (c) Shall follow the limitations on price increases in 217.7505.

217.7505  Limitations on price increases.

    This section provides implementing guidance for section 1215 of 
Public Law 98-94 (10 U.S.C. 2452 note).
    (a) The contracting officer shall not award, on a sole source basis, 
a contract for any centrally managed replenishment part when the price 
of the part has increased by 25 percent or more over the most recent 12-
month period.
    (1) Before computing the percentage difference between the current 
price and the prior price, adjust for quantity, escalation, and other 
factors necessary to achieve comparability.
    (2) Departments and agencies may specify an alternate percentage or 
percentages for contracts at or below the simplified acquisition 
threshold.
    (b) The contracting officer may award a contract for a part, the 
price of which exceeds the limitation in paragraph (a) of this section, 
if the contracting officer certifies in writing to the head of the 
contracting activity before award that--
    (1) The contracting officer has evaluated the price of the part and 
concluded that the price increase is fair and reasonable; or
    (2) The national security interests of the United States require 
purchase of the part despite the price increase.
    (c) The fact that a particular price has not exceeded the limitation 
in paragraph (a) of this section does not relieve the contracting 
officer of the responsibility for obtaining a fair and reasonable price.
    (d) Contracting officers may include a provision in sole source 
solicitations requiring that the offeror supply with its proposal, price 
and quantity data on any government orders for the replenishment part 
issued within the most recent 12 months.

<R05>
218.170  Additional acquisition flexibilities.

    Additional acquisition flexibilities available to DoD are as 
follows:
    (a) Circumstances permitting other than full and open competition. 
Use of the authority at FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and compelling urgency, may 
be appropriate under certain circumstances. See PGI 206.302-2.
    (b) Use of advance Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request 
(MIPR). For urgent requirements, the advance MIPR may be transmitted 
electronically. See PGI 208.7004-3.
    (c) Use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card. 
Governmentwide commercial purchase cards do not have to be used for 
purchases valued at or below the micro-purchase threshold if the place 
of performance is entirely outside the United States. See 213.270(c)(1).
    (d) Master agreement for repair and alteration of vessels. The 
contracting officer, without soliciting offers, may issue a written job 
order for emergency work to a contractor that has previously executed a 
master agreement, when delay would endanger a vessel, its cargo or 
stores, or when military necessity requires immediate work on a vessel. 
See 217.7103-4, 252.217-7010, and PGI 217.7103-4.
    (e) Spare parts breakout program. An urgent immediate buy need not 
be delayed if an evaluation of the additional information cannot be 
completed in time to meet the required delivery date. See PGI 217.7506, 
paragraph 1-105(e).
    (f) Storage and disposal of toxic and hazardous materials. Under 
certain emergency situations, exceptions apply with regard to the 
prohibition on storage or disposal of non-DoD-owned toxic or hazardous 
materials on DoD installations. See 223.7102(a)(3) and (7).
    (g) Authorization Acts, Appropriations Acts, and other statutory 
restrictions on foreign acquisition. Acquisitions in the following 
categories are not subject to the restrictions of 225.7002, Restrictions 
on food, clothing, fabrics, specialty metals, and hand or measuring 
tools: (1) Acquisitions at or below the simplified acquisition 
threshold; (2) Acquisitions outside the United States in support of 
combat operations; (3) Acquisitions of perishable foods by or for 
activities located outside the United States for personnel of those 
activities; (4) Acquisitions of food, specialty metals, or hand or 
measuring tools in support of contingency operations, or for which the 
use of other than competitive procedures has been approved on the basis 
of unusual and compelling urgency in accordance with FAR 6.302-2; (5) 
Emergency acquisitions by activities located outside the United States 
for personnel of those activities; and (6) Acquisitions by vessels in 
foreign waters. See 225.7002-2.
    (h) Rights in technical data. The agency head may notify a person 
asserting a restriction that urgent or compelling circumstances (e.g., 
emergency repair or overhaul) do not permit the Government to continue 
to respect the asserted restriction. See 227.7102-2; 227.7103-5; 
227.7103-13; 227.7104; 227.7203-13; 252.227-7013; 252.227-7014; 252.227-
7015; 252.227-7018; and 252.227-7037.

available and duty-free import of equipment or materials is urgent, the 
contracting officer may send the Joint United States Military Group 
copies of the Letter of Intent or a similar document indicating the 
pending award. See PGI 229.7001.
    (j) Electronic submission and processing of payment requests. 
Contractors do not have to submit payment requests in electronic form 
for awards made to foreign vendors for work performed outside the United 
States or for purchases to support unusual or compelling needs of the 
type described in FAR 6.302-2. See 232.7002(a)(2) and (5).
    (k) Mortuary services. In an epidemic or other emergency, the 
contracting activity may obtain services beyond

function by--
    (A) Reviewing and making recommendations for all acquisitions 
(including orders placed against Federal Supply Schedule contracts) over 
$10,000, except those under $100,000 that are totally set aside for

determining whether use of the price evaluation adjustment to achieve a 
small disadvantaged business goal has caused non-SDB firms in a 
particular North American Industry Classification System Industry 
Subsector to bear an undue burden or other inappropriate effect. A copy 
of each determination shall be forwarded to the Office of Small Business 
Programs, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, 
Technology, and Logistics), simultaneously with submittal to

<R05>
219.800  General.

    (a) By Partnership Agreement (PA) between the Small Business 
Administration (SBA) and the Department of Defense (DoD), the SBA has 
delegated to the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, 
and Logistics) its authority under paragraph 8(a)(1)(A) of the Small 
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)) to enter into 8(a) prime contracts, and 
its authority under 8(a)(1)(B) of the Small Business Act to award the 
performance of those contracts to eligible 8(a) Program participants. 
However, the SBA remains the prime contractor on all 8(a) contracts, 
continues to determine eligibility of concerns for contract award, and 
retains appeal rights under FAR 19.810. The SBA delegates only the 
authority to sign contracts on its behalf. Consistent with the 
provisions of the PA, this authority is hereby redelegated to DoD 
contracting officers. A copy of the PA, which includes the PA's 
expiration date, is available at PGI 219.800.
    (b) Contracts awarded under the PA may be awarded directly to the 
8(a) participant on either a sole source or competitive basis. An SBA 
signature on the contract is not required.
    (c) Notwithstanding the PA, the contracting officer may elect to 
award a contract pursuant to the provisions of FAR Subpart 19.8.

219.7104  Developmental assistance costs eligible for reimbursement or credit.

    (a) Developmental assistance provided under an approved mentor-
protege agreement is distinct from, and must not duplicate, any effort 
that is the normal and expected product of the award and administration 
of the mentor firm's subcontracts. The mentor firm must accumulate and 
charge costs associated with the latter in accordance with its approved 
accounting practices. Mentor firm costs that are eligible for 
reimbursement are set forth in appendix I.
    (b) Before incurring any costs under the Program, mentor firms must 
establish the accounting treatment of developmental assistance costs 
eligible for reimbursement or credit. Advance agreements are encouraged. 
To be eligible for reimbursement under the Program, the mentor firm must 
incur the costs before October 1, 2013.
    (c) If the mentor firm is suspended or debarred while performing 
under an approved mentor-protege agreement, the mentor firm may not be 
reimbursed or credited for developmental assistance costs incurred more 
than 30 days after the imposition of the suspension or debarment.
    (d) Developmental assistance costs incurred by a mentor firm before 
October 1, 2013, that are eligible for crediting under the Program, may 
be credited toward subcontracting plan goals as set forth in appendix I.

    The Defense Contract Management Agency will conduct annual 
performance reviews of all mentor-protege agreements as indicated in 
appendix I, section I-113. The determinations made in these reviews 
should be a major factor in determinations of amounts of reimbursement, 
if any, that the mentor firm is eligible to receive in the remaining 
years of the Program participation term under the agreement.

222.101-4  Removal of items from contractors' facilities affected by work stoppages.

    (a) When a contractor is unable to deliver urgent and critical items 
because of a work stoppage at its facility, the contracting officer, 
before removing any items from the facility, shall--
    (i) Before initiating any action, contact the labor advisor to 
obtain the opinion of the national office of the Federal Mediation and 
Conciliation Service or other mediation agency regarding the effect 
movement of the items would have on labor negotiations. Normally 
removals will not be made if they will adversely affect labor 
negotiations.
    (ii) Upon the recommendation of the labor advisor, provide a written 
request for removal of the material to the cognizant contract 
administration office. Include in the request the information specified 
at PGI 222.101-4(a)(ii).
    (iii) With the assistance of the labor advisor or the commander of 
the contract administration office, attempt to have both the management 
and the labor representatives involved agree to shipment of the material 
by normal means.
    (iv) If agreement for removal of the needed items cannot be reached 
following the procedures in paragraphs (a) (i) through (iii) of this 
subsection, the commander of the contract administration office, after 
obtaining approval from the labor advisor, may seek the concurrence of 
the parties to the dispute to permit movement of the material by 
military vehicles with military personnel. On receipt of such 
concurrences, the commander may proceed to make necessary arrangements 
to move the material.
    (v) If agreement for removal of the needed items cannot be reached 
following any of the procedures in paragraphs (a) (i) through (iv) of 
this subsection, refer the matter to the labor advisor with the 
information required by 222.101-3-70(b). If the labor advisor is 
unsuccessful in obtaining concurrence of the parties for the movement of 
the material and further action to obtain the material is deemed 
necessary, refer the matter to the agency head. Upon review and 
verification that the items are urgently or critically needed and cannot 
be moved with the consent of the parties, the agency head, on a 
nondelegable basis, may order removal of the items from the facility.

<R04>
       Subpart 222.3_Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act


<R05>
222.302  Liquidated damages and overtime pay.

    Upon receipt of notification of Contract Work Hours and Safety

agency official responsible for acting on such appeals; and
    (3) If funds available for withholding are insufficient to cover 
liquidated damages, ask the contractor to pay voluntarily such funds as 
are necessary to cover the total liquidated damage assessment.
    (d)(i) The assessment shall become the final administrative 
determination of contractor liability for liquidated damages when--
    (A) The contractor fails to appeal to the contracting agency within 
60 days from the date of the withholding of funds;
    (B) The department agency, following the contractor's appeals, 
issues a final order which affirms the assessment of liquidated damages

<R04>
   Subpart 222.4_Labor Standards for Contracts Involving Construction


<R05>
222.402  Applicability.


<R05>
222.402-70  Installation support contracts.

    (a) Apply both the Service Contract Act (SCA) and the Davis-Bacon 
Act (DBA) to installation support contracts if--
    (1) The contract is principally for services but also requires a 
substantial and segregable amount of construction, alteration, 
renovation, painting, or repair work; and
    (2) The aggregate dollar value of such construction work exceeds or 
is expected to exceed $2,000.
    (b) SCA coverage under the contract. Contract installation support 
requirements, such as plant operation and installation services (i.e., 
custodial, snow removal, etc.) are subject to the SCA. Apply SCA clauses 
and minimum wage and fringe benefit requirements to all contract service 
calls or orders for such maintenance and support work.
    (c) DBA coverage under the contract. Contract construction, 
alteration, renovation, painting, and repair requirements (i.e., roof 
shingling, building structural repair, paving repairs, etc.) are subject 
to the DBA. Apply DBA clauses and minimum wage requirements to all 
contract service calls or orders for construction, alteration, 
renovation, painting, or repairs to buildings or other works.
    (d) Repairs versus maintenance. Some contract work may be 
characterized as either DBA painting/repairs or SCA maintenance. For 
example, replacing broken windows, spot painting, or minor patching of a 
wall could be covered by either the DBA or the SCA. In those instances 
where a contract service call or order requires construction trade 
skills (i.e., carpenter, plumber, painter, etc.), but it is unclear 
whether the work required is SCA maintenance or DBA painting/repairs, 
apply the following rules--
    (1) Individual service calls or orders which will require a total of 
32 or more work-hours to perform shall be considered to be repair work 
subject to the DBA.
    (2) Individual service calls or orders which will require less than 
32 work-hours to perform shall be considered to be maintenance subject 
to the SCA.
    (3) Painting work of 200 square feet or more to be performed under 
an individual service call or order shall be considered to be subject to 
the DBA regardless of the total work-hours required.
    (e) The determination of labor standards application shall be made 
at the time the solicitation is prepared in those cases where 
requirements can be identified. Otherwise, the determination shall be 
made at the time the service call or order is placed against the 
contract. The service call or order shall identify the labor standards 
law and contract wage determination which will apply to the work 
required.
    (f) Contracting officers may not avoid application of the DBA by 
splitting individual tasks between orders or contracts.

    (B) The prime contractor experienced difficulty in complying with 
labor standards requirements on previous contracts; or
    (C) It is necessary to determine whether the contractor and its

    (B) If an appeal is received, the contracting officer shall process 
the appeal in accordance with department or agency regulations.
    (d) Contracting officer's report. Forward a detailed enforcement 
report or summary report to the agency head in accordance with agency 
procedures. Include in the report, as a minimum, the information

[56 FR 36358, July 31, 1991, as amended at 71 FR 18670, Apr. 12, 2006]


<R05>
222.406-9  Withholding from or suspension of contract payments.

    (a) Withholding from contract payments. The contracting officer 
shall contact the labor advisor for assistance when payments due a 
contractor are not available to satisfy that contractor's liability for 
Davis-Bacon or CWHSSA wage underpayments or liquidated damages.
    (c) Disposition of contract payments withheld or suspended.
    (3) Limitation on forwarding or returning funds. When disposition of

investigation or other administrative proceedings.
    (4) Liquidated damages. (A) The agency head may adjust liquidated 
damages of $500 or less when the amount assessed is incorrect or waive

contractor, its subcontractor, or their agents.
    (B) The agency head may recommend to the Administrator, Wage and

    Source: 68 FR 15618, Mar. 31, 2003, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
225.101  General.

    (a) For DoD, the following two-part test determines whether a 
manufactured end product is a domestic end product:
    (i) The end product is manufactured in the United States; and

[[Page 135]]

    (ii) The cost of its U.S. and qualifying country components exceeds 
50 percent of the cost of all its components. This test is applied to 
end products only and not to individual components.
    (c) Additional exceptions that allow the purchase of foreign end 
products are listed at 225.103.


<R05>
225.103  Exceptions.

    (a)(i)(A) Public interest exceptions for certain countries are in 
225.872.
    (B) For procurements covered by the World Trade Organization 
Government Procurement Agreement, the Under Secretary of Defense 
(Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) has determined that it is 
inconsistent with the public interest to apply the Buy American Act to 
end products that are substantially transformed in the United States.
    (ii)(A) Normally, use the evaluation procedures in Subpart 225.5, 
but consider recommending a public interest exception if the purposes of 
the Buy American Act are not served, or in order to meet a need set 
forth in 10 U.S.C. 2533. For example, a public interest exception may be 
appropriate--
    (1) If accepting the low domestic offer will involve substantial 
foreign expenditures, or accepting the low foreign offer will involve 
substantial domestic expenditures;
    (2) To ensure access to advanced state-of-the-art commercial 
technology; or
    (3) To maintain the same source of supply for spare and replacement 
parts (also see paragraph (b)(iii)(B) of this section)--
    (i) For an end item that qualifies as a domestic end product; or
    (ii) In order not to impair integration of the military and 
commercial industrial base.
    (B) Except as provided in PGI 225.872-4, process a determination for 
a public interest exception after consideration of the factors in 10 
U.S.C. 2533--
    (1) At a level above the contracting officer for acquisitions valued 
at or below the simplified acquisition threshold;
    (2) By the head of the contracting activity for acquisitions with a 
value greater than the simplified acquisition threshold but less than 
$1,000,000; or
    (3) By the agency head for acquisitions valued at $1,000,000 or 
more.
    (b)(i) A determination that an article, material, or supply is not 
reasonably available is required when domestic offers are insufficient 
to meet the requirement and award is to be made on other than a 
qualifying country or eligible end product.
    (ii) Except as provided in FAR 25.103(b)(3), the determination shall 
be approved--
    (A) At a level above the contracting officer for acquisitions valued 
at or below the simplified acquisition threshold;
    (B) By the chief of the contracting office for acquisitions with a 
value greater than the simplified acquisition threshold but less than 
$1,000,000; or
    (C) By the head of the contracting activity or immediate deputy for 
acquisitions valued at $1,000,000 or more.
    (iii) A separate determination as to whether an article is 
reasonably available is not required for the following articles. DoD has 
already determined that these articles are not reasonably available from 
domestic sources:
    (A) End products or components listed in 225.104(a).
    (B) Spare or replacement parts that must be acquired from the 
original foreign manufacturer or supplier.
    (C) Foreign drugs acquired by the Defense Supply Center, 
Philadelphia, when the Director, Pharmaceuticals Group, Directorate of 
Medical Materiel, determines that only the requested foreign drug will 
fulfill the requirements.
    (iv) Under coordinated acquisition (see Subpart 208.70), the 
determination is the responsibility of the requiring department when the 
requiring department specifies acquisition of a foreign end product.
    (c) The cost of a domestic end product is unreasonable if it is not 
the low evaluated offer when evaluated under Subpart 225.5.

    (i) Aluminum clad steel wire.
    (ii) Sperm oil.


<R05>

    (a)(2) A nonavailability determination is not required for 
construction materials listed in FAR 25.104(a) or in 225.104(a). For 
other materials, a nonavailability determination shall be approved at 
the levels specified in 225.103(b)(ii). Use the estimated value of the 
construction materials to determine the approval level.

<R05>
225.301-1  Scope.

    (a) Performance in a designated operational area, as used in this 
section, means performance of a service or construction, as required by 
the contract. For supply contracts, the term includes services 
associated with the acquisition of supplies (e.g., installation or 
maintenance), but does not include production of the supplies or 
associated overhead functions.
    (c) For DoD, this section also applies to all personal services 
contracts.


<R05>
225.301-4  Contract clause.

    (1) Use the clause at FAR 52.225-19, Contractor Personnel in a 
Designated Operational Area or Supporting a Diplomatic or Consular 
Mission Outside the United States, in accordance with the prescription 
at FAR 25.301-4, except that--
    (i) The clause shall also be used in personal services contracts 
with individuals; and
    (ii) The clause shall not be used when all contractor personnel 
performing outside the United States will be covered by the clause at 
252.225-7040.
    (2) When using the clause at FAR 52.225-19, the contracting officer 
shall inform the contractor that the Synchronized Predeployment and 
Operational Tracker (SPOT) is the appropriate automated system to use 
for the list of contractor personnel required by paragraph (g) of the 
clause. Information on the SPOT system is available at http://

<R05>
225.401  Exceptions.

    (a)(2) If a department or agency considers an individual acquisition 
of a product to be indispensable for national security or national 
defense purposes and appropriate for exclusion from the provisions of 
FAR Subpart 25.4, it may submit a request with supporting rationale to 
the Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy 
(OUSD(AT&L)DPAP). Approval by OUSD(AT&L)DPAP is not required if--
    (A) Purchase from foreign sources is restricted by statute (see 
Subpart 225.70);

[[Page 137]]

    (B) Another exception in FAR 25.401 applies to the acquisition; or
    (C) Competition from foreign sources is restricted under Subpart 
225.71.

225.401-70  End products subject to trade agreements.

    Acquisitions of end products in the following Federal supply groups 
(FSG) are covered by trade agreements if the value of the acquisition is 
at or above the applicable trade agreement threshold and no exception 
applies. If an end product is not in one of the listed groups, the trade 
agreements do not apply. The definition of Caribbean Basin country end 
products in FAR 25.003 excludes those end products that are not eligible 
for duty-free treatment under 19 U.S.C. 2703(b). Therefore certain 
watches, watch parts, and luggage from certain Caribbean Basin countries 
are not eligible products. However, 225.003 expands the definition of 
Caribbean Basin country end products to include petroleum and any 
product derived from petroleum, in accordance with Section 8094 of Pub. 
L. 103-139.

225.401-71  Products or services in support of operations in Iraq or Afghanistan.

    When acquiring products or services, other than small arms, in 
support of operations in Iraq or Afghanistan using a procedure specified 
in 225.7703-1(a), the purchase restriction at FAR 25.403(c) does not 
apply with regard to products or services from Iraq.

225.403  World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.

    (c) For acquisitions of supplies covered by the World Trade 
Organization Government Procurement Agreement, acquire only U.S.-made, 
qualifying country, or designated country end products unless--
    (i) The contracting officer determines that offers of U.S.-made, 
qualifying country, or designated country end products from responsive, 
responsible offerors are either--
    (A) Not received; or
    (B) Insufficient to fill the Government's requirements. In this 
case, accept all responsive, responsible offers of U.S.-made, qualifying 
country, and eligible products before accepting any other offers; or
    (ii) A national interest waiver under 19 U.S.C. 2512(b)(2) is 
granted on a case-by-case basis. Except as delegated in paragraphs 
(c)(i)(A) and (B) of this section, submit any request for a national 
interest waiver to the Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition 
Policy in accordance with department or agency procedures. Include 
supporting rationale with the request.
    (A) The head of the contracting activity may approve a national 
interest waiver for a purchase by an overseas purchasing activity, if 
the waiver is supported by a written statement from the requiring 
activity that the products being acquired are critical for the support 
of U.S. forces stationed abroad.
    (B) The Commander or Director, Defense Energy Support Center, may 
approve national interest waivers for purchases of fuel for use by U.S. 
forces overseas.

<R05>
225.502  Application.

    (b) Use the following procedures instead of the procedures in FAR 
25.502(b) for acquisitions subject to the World Trade Organization 
Government Procurement Agreement:
    (i) Consider only offers of U.S.-made, qualifying country, or 
designated country end products, except as permitted by 225.403 or 
225.7703-1.
    (ii) If price is the determining factor, award on the low offer.
    (c) Use the following procedures instead of those in FAR 25.502(c) 
for acquisitions subject to the Buy American Act or the Balance of 
Payments Program:
    (i)(A) If the acquisition is subject only to the Buy American Act or 
the Balance of Payments Program, then only qualifying country end 
products are exempt from application of the Buy American Act or Balance 
of Payments Program evaluation factor.
    (B) If the acquisition is also subject to a Free Trade Agreement, 
then eligible products of the applicable Free Trade Agreement country 
are also exempt from application of the Buy American Act or Balance of 
Payments Program evaluation factor.

[[Page 139]]

    (ii) If price is the determining factor, use the following 
procedures:
    (A) If the low offer is a domestic offer, award on that offer.
    (B) If there are no domestic offers, award on the low offer (see 
example in 225.504(1)).
    (C) If the low offer is a foreign offer that is exempt from 
application of the Buy American Act or Balance of Payments Program 
evaluation factor, award on that offer. (If the low offer is a 
qualifying country offer from a country listed at 225.872-1(b), execute 
a determination in accordance with 225.872-4.)
    (D) If the low offer is a foreign offer that is not exempt from 
application of the Buy American Act or Balance of Payments Program 
evaluation factor, and there is another foreign offer that is exempt and 
is lower than the lowest domestic offer, award on the low foreign offer 
(see example in 225.504(2)).
    (E) Otherwise, apply the 50 percent evaluation factor to the low 
foreign offer.
    (1) If the price of the low domestic offer is less than the 
evaluated price of the low foreign offer, award on the low domestic 
offer (see example in 225.504(3)).
    (2) If the evaluated price of the low foreign offer remains less 
than the low domestic offer, award on the low foreign offer (see example 
in 225.504(4)).
    (iii) If price is not the determining factor, use the following 
procedures:
    (A) If there are domestic offers, apply the 50 percent Buy American 
Act or Balance of Payments Program evaluation factor to all foreign 
offers unless an exemption applies.
    (B) Evaluate in accordance with the criteria of the solicitation.
    (C) If these procedures will not result in award on a domestic 
offer, reevaluate offers without the 50 percent factor. If this will 
result in award on an offer to which the Buy American Act or Balance of 
Payments Program applies, but evaluation in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(ii) of this section would result in award on a domestic offer, 
proceed with award only after execution of a determination in accordance 
with 225.103(a)(ii)(B), that domestic preference would be inconsistent 
with the public interest.
    (iv) If the solicitation includes the provision at 252.225-7023, 
Preference for Products or Services from Iraq or Afghanistan, use the 
evaluation procedures at 225.7703-3.

<R05>
225.872  Contracting with qualifying country sources.


<R05>
225.872-1  General.

    (a) As a result of memoranda of understanding and other 
international agreements, DoD has determined it inconsistent with the 
public interest to apply restrictions of the Buy American Act or the 
Balance of Payments Program to the acquisition of qualifying country end 
products from the following qualifying countries:

Australia

[[Page 144]]

Belgium
Canada
Denmark
Egypt
Federal Republic of Germany
France
Greece
Israel
Italy
Luxembourg
Netherlands
Norway
Portugal
Spain
Sweden
Switzerland
Turkey
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland

    (b) Individual acquisitions of qualifying country end products from 
the following qualifying countries may, on a purchase-by-purchase basis 
(see 225.872-4), be exempted from application of the Buy American Act 
and the Balance of Payments Program as inconsistent with the public 
interest:

Austria
Finland

    (c) The determination in paragraph (a) of this subsection does not 
limit the authority of the Secretary concerned to restrict acquisitions 
to domestic sources or reject an otherwise acceptable offer from a 
qualifying country source when considered necessary for national defense 
reasons.

[68 FR 15621, Mar. 31, 2003, as amended at 69 FR 8116, Feb. 23, 2004]


<R05>
225.872-2  Applicability.

    (a) This section applies to all acquisitions of supplies except 
those restricted by--
    (1) U.S. National Disclosure Policy, DoDD 5230.11, Disclosure of 
Classified Military Information to Foreign Governments and International 
Organizations;
    (2) U.S. defense mobilization base requirements purchased under the 
authority of FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(i), except for quantities in excess of 
that required to maintain the defense mobilization base. This 
restriction does not apply to Canadian planned producers.
    (i) Review individual solicitations to determine whether this 
restriction applies.
    (ii) Information concerning restricted items may be obtained from 
the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Industrial Affairs);
    (3) Other U.S. laws or regulations (e.g., the annual DoD 
appropriations act); and
    (4) U.S. industrial security requirements.
    (b) This section does not apply to construction contracts.


<R05>
225.872-3  Solicitation procedures.

    (a) Except for items developed under the U.S./Canadian Development 
Sharing Program, use the criteria for soliciting and awarding contracts 
to small business concerns under FAR Part 19 without regard to whether 
there are potential qualifying country sources for the end product. Do 
not consider an offer of a qualifying country end product if the 
solicitation is identified for the exclusive participation of small 
business concerns.
    (b) Send solicitations directly to qualifying country sources. 
Solicit Canadian sources through the Canadian Commercial Corporation in 
accordance with 225.870.
    (c) Use international air mail if solicitation destinations are 
outside the United States and security classification permits such use.
    (d) If unusual technical or security requirements preclude the 
acquisition of otherwise acceptable defense equipment from qualifying 
country sources, review the need for such requirements. Do not impose 
unusual technical or security requirements solely for the purpose of 
precluding the acquisition of defense equipment from qualifying 
countries.
    (e) Do not automatically exclude qualifying country sources from 
submitting offers because their supplies have not been tested and 
evaluated by the department or agency.
    (1) Consider the adequacy of qualifying country service testing on a 
case-by-case basis. Departments or agencies that must limit 
solicitations to sources whose items have been tested and evaluated by 
the department or agency shall consider supplies from qualifying country 
sources that have been tested and accepted by the qualifying country for 
service use.

[[Page 145]]

    (2) The department or agency may perform a confirmatory test, if 
necessary.
    (3) Apply U.S. test and evaluation standards, policies, and 
procedures when the department or agency decides that confirmatory tests 
of qualifying country end products are necessary.
    (4) If it appears that these provisions might adversely delay 
service programs, obtain the concurrence of the Under Secretary of 
Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics), before excluding the 
qualifying country source from consideration.
    (f) Permit industry representatives from a qualifying country to 
attend symposia, program briefings, prebid conferences (see FAR 14.207 
and 15.201(c)), and similar meetings that address U.S. defense equipment 
needs and requirements. When practical, structure these meetings to 
allow attendance by representatives of qualifying country concerns.

[68 FR 15621, Mar. 31, 2003, as amended at 72 FR 20758, Apr. 26, 2007]


<R05>
225.872-4  Individual determinations.

    If the offer of an end product from a qualifying country source 
listed in 225.872-1(b), as evaluated, is low or otherwise eligible for 
award, prepare a determination and findings exempting the acquisition 
from the Buy American Act and the Balance of Payments Program as 
inconsistent with the public interest, unless another exception such as 
the Trade Agreements Act applies. Follow the procedures at PGI 225.872-
4.

[70 FR 73155, Dec. 9, 2005]


<R05>
225.872-5  Contract administration.

    (a) Arrangements exist with some qualifying countries to provide 
reciprocal contract administration services. Some arrangements are at no 
cost to either government. To determine whether such an arrangement has 
been negotiated and what contract administration functions are covered, 
contact the Deputy Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition 
Policy (Contract Policy and International Contracting), ((703) 697-9351, 
DSN 227-9351).
    (b) Follow the contract administration procedures at PGI 225.872-
5(b).
    (c) Information on quality assurance delegations to foreign 
governments is in Subpart 246.4, Government Contract Quality Assurance.

FR 30278, May 31, 2007]


<R05>
225.872-6  Audit.

    (a) Memoranda of understanding with some qualifying countries 
contain annexes that provide for reciprocal ``no-cost'' audits of 
contracts and subcontracts (pre- and post-award).
    (b) To determine if such an annex is applicable to a particular 
qualifying country, contact the Deputy Director of Defense Procurement 
and Acquisition Policy (Contract Policy and International Contracting), 
((703) 697-9351, DSN 227-9351).
    (c) Handle requests for audits in qualifying countries in accordance 
with 215.404-2(c), but follow the additional procedures at PGI 225.872-
6(c).

SECNAV Instruction 5510.1H; for the Air Force by AFI 31-601; for the 
Defense Information Systems Agency by DCA Instruction 240-110-8; and for 
the National Imagery and Mapping Agency by NIMA Instruction 5220.22).


<R05>
225.872-8  Subcontracting with qualifying country sources.

    In reviewing contractor subcontracting procedures, the contracting 
officer shall ensure that the contract does not preclude qualifying 
country sources from competing for subcontracts, except when restricted 
by national security interest reasons, mobilization base considerations, 
or applicable U.S. laws or regulations (see the clause at 252.225-7002, 
Qualifying Country Sources as Subcontractors).

waive U.K. commercial exploitation levies and U.S. nonrecurring cost 
recoupment charges on a reciprocal basis. For U.K. levies to be waived,

officer shall request a waiver before award of the contract or 
subcontract under which the levies are charged.


<R05>
225.873-2  Procedures.

    When an offeror or a contractor identifies a levy included in an 
offered or contract price, follow the procedures at PGI 225.873-2.

<R05>
225.7003  Waiver of restrictions of 10 U.S.C. 2534.

    (a) The waiver procedures of this section apply only if specifically 
authorized by reference elsewhere in this subpart. The restrictions on 
certain foreign purchases under 10 U.S.C. 2534(a) may be waived as 
follows:
    (1)(i) The Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and 
Logistics), without power of delegation, may waive a restriction for a 
particular item for a particular foreign country upon determination 
that--
    (A) United States producers of the item would not be jeopardized by 
competition from a foreign country, and that country does not 
discriminate against defense items produced in the United States to a 
greater degree than the United States discriminates against defense 
items produced in that country; or
    (B) Application of the restriction would impede cooperative programs 
entered into between DoD and a foreign country, or would impede the 
reciprocal procurement of defense items under a memorandum of 
understanding providing for reciprocal procurement of defense items 
under 225.872, and that country does not discriminate against defense 
items produced in the United States to a greater degree than the United 
States discriminates against defense items produced in that country.
    (ii) A notice of the determination to exercise the waiver authority 
shall be published in the Federal Register and submitted to the 
congressional defense committees at least 15 days before the effective 
date of the waiver.
    (iii) The effective period of the waiver shall not exceed 1 year.
    (iv) For contracts entered into prior to the effective date of a 
waiver, provided adequate consideration is received to modify the 
contract, the waiver shall be applied as directed or authorized in the 
waiver to--

[[Page 152]]

    (A) Subcontracts entered into on or after the effective date of the 
waiver; and
    (B) Options for the procurement of items that are exercised after 
the effective date of the waiver, if the option prices are adjusted for 
any reason other than the application of the waiver.
    (2) The head of the contracting activity may waive a restriction on 
a case-by-case basis upon execution of a determination and findings that 
any of the following applies:
    (i) The restriction would cause unreasonable delays.
    (ii) Satisfactory quality items manufactured in the United States or 
Canada are not available.
    (iii) Application of the restriction would result in the existence 
of only one source for the item in the United States or Canada.
    (iv) Application of the restriction is not in the national security 
interests of the United States.
    (v) Application of the restriction would adversely affect a U.S. 
company.
    (3) A restriction is waived when it would cause unreasonable costs. 
The cost of an item of U.S. or Canadian origin is unreasonable if it 
exceeds 150 percent of the offered price, inclusive of duty, of items 
that are not of U.S. or Canadian origin.
    (b) In accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1)(i) 
through (iii) of this section, the Under Secretary of Defense 
(Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) has waived the restrictions of 
10 U.S.C. 2534(a) for certain items manufactured in the United Kingdom, 
including air circuit breakers for naval vessels (see 225.7006). This 
waiver applies to--
    (1) Procurements under solicitations issued on or after August 4, 
1998; and
    (2) Subcontracts and options under contracts entered into prior to 
August 4, 1998, under the conditions described in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) 
of this section.

225.7017-2  Restriction.

    In accordance with Section 222 of the DoD Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 (Pub. L. 100-180), do not use any funds 
appropriated to or for the use of DoD to enter into or carry out a 
contract with a foreign government or firm, including any contract 
awarded as a result of a broad agency announcement, if the contract 
provides for the conduct of research, development, test, and evaluation 
(RDT&E) in connection with the Ballistic Missile Defense Program.

[68 FR 15627, Mar. 31, 2003]


<R05>
225.7017-3  Exceptions.

    This restriction does not apply--

    (2) The contract is exclusively for RDT&E in connection with 
antitactical ballistic missile systems; or
    (3) The foreign government or firm agrees to share a substantial 
portion of the total contract cost. Consider the foreign share as 
substantial if it is equitable with respect to the relative benefits 
that the United States and the foreign parties will derive from the 
contract. For example, if the contract is more beneficial to the foreign 
party, its share of the cost should be correspondingly higher; or
    (b) If the head of the contracting activity certifies in writing, 
before contract award, that a U.S. firm cannot competently perform a 
contract for RDT&E at a price equal to or less than

[[Page 157]]

the price at which a foreign government or firm would perform the RDT&E. 
The contracting officer or source selection authority, as applicable, 
shall make a determination, in accordance with PGI 225.7017-3(b), that 
will be the basis for the certification.

         Subpart 225.73_Acquisitions for Foreign Military Sales


<R05>
225.7300  Scope of subpart.

    (a) This subpart contains policies and procedures for acquisitions 
for foreign military sales (FMS) under the Arms Export Control Act (22 
U.S.C. Chapter 39). Section 22 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 
2762) authorizes DoD to enter into contracts for resale to foreign 
countries or international organizations.
    (b) This subpart does not apply to--
    (1) FMS made from inventories or stocks;
    (2) Acquisitions for replenishment of inventories or stocks; or
    (3) Acquisitions made under DoD cooperative logistic supply support 
arrangements.

[63 FR 43889, Aug. 17, 1998]


<R05>
225.7301  General.

    (a) The U.S. Government sells defense articles and services to 
foreign governments or international organizations through FMS 
agreements. The agreement is documented in a Letter of Offer and 
Acceptance (LOA) (see DoD 5105.38-M, Security Assistance Management 
Manual).
    (b) Conduct FMS acquisitions under the same acquisition and contract 
management procedures used for other defense acquisitions.
    (c) Follow the additional procedures at PGI 225.7301(c) for 
preparation of solicitations and contracts that include FMS 
requirements.
    (d) See 229.170 for policy on contracts financed under U.S. 
assistance programs that involve payment of foreign country value added 
taxes or customs duties.

<R05>
225.7302  Guidance.

    For guidance on the role of the contracting officer in FMS programs 
that will require an acquisition, see PGI 225.7302.

[70 FR 73155, Dec. 9, 2005]


<R05>
225.7303  Pricing acquisitions for FMS.

    (a) Price FMS contracts using the same principles used in pricing 
other defense contracts. However, application of the pricing principles 
in FAR parts 15 and 31 to an FMS contract may result in prices that 
differ from other defense contract prices for the same item due to the 
considerations in this section.
    (b) If the foreign government has conducted a competition resulting 
in adequate price competition (see FAR 15.403-1(b)(1)), the contracting 
officer shall not require the submission of cost or pricing data. The 
contracting officer

[[Page 159]]

should consult with the foreign government through security assistance 
personnel to determine if adequate price competition has occurred.

[64 FR 49683, Sept. 14, 1999, as amended at 68 FR 15632, Mar. 31, 2003]


<R05>
225.7303-1  Contractor sales to other foreign customers.

    If the contractor has made sales of the item required for the 
foreign military sale to foreign customers under comparable conditions, 
including quantity and delivery, price the FMS contract in accordance 
with FAR part 15.


<R05>
225.7303-2  Cost of doing business with a foreign government or an international organization.

    (a) In pricing FMS contracts where non-U.S. Government prices as 
described in 225.7303-1 do not exist, except as provided in 225.7303-5, 
recognize the reasonable and allocable costs of doing business with a 
foreign government or international organization, even though such costs 
might not be recognized in the same amounts in pricing other defense 
contracts. Examples of such costs include, but are not limited to, the 
following:
    (1) Selling expenses (not otherwise limited by FAR Part 31), such 
as--
    (i) Maintaining international sales and service organizations;
    (ii) Sales commissions and fees in accordance with FAR Subpart 3.4;
    (iii) Sales promotions, demonstrations, and related travel for sales 
to foreign governments. Section 126.8 of the International Traffic in 
Arms Regulations (22 CFR 126.8) may require Government approval for 
these costs to be allowable, in which case the appropriate Government 
approval shall be obtained; and
    (iv) Configuration studies and related technical services undertaken 
as a direct selling effort to a foreign country.
    (2) Product support and post-delivery service expenses, such as--
    (i) Operations or maintenance training, training or tactics films, 
manuals, or other related data; and
    (ii) Technical field services provided in a foreign country related 
to accident investigations, weapon system problems, or operations/
tactics enhancement, and related travel to foreign countries.
    (3) Offset costs (also see 225.7306).
    (i) A U.S. defense contractor may recover all costs incurred for 
offset agreements with a foreign government or international 
organization if the LOA is financed wholly with customer cash or 
repayable foreign military finance credits.
    (ii) The U.S. Government assumes no obligation to satisfy or 
administer the offset requirement or to bear any of the associated 
costs.
    (4) Costs that are the subject of advance agreement under the 
appropriate provisions of FAR part 31; or where the advance 
understanding places a limit on the amounts of cost that will be 
recognized as allowable in defense contract pricing, and the agreement 
contemplated that it will apply only to DoD contracts for the U.S. 
Government's own requirement (as distinguished from contracts for FMS).
    (b) Costs not allowable under FAR part 31 are not allowable in 
pricing FMS contracts, except as noted in paragraph (c) of this 
subsection.
    (c) The limitations for major contractors on independent research 
and development and bid and proposal (IR&D/B&P) costs for projects that 
are of potential interest to DoD, in 231.205-18(c)(iii), do not apply to 
FMS contracts, except as provided in 225.7303-5. The allowability of 
IR&D/B&P costs on contracts for FMS not wholly paid for from funds made 
available on a nonrepayable basis is limited to the contract's allocable 
share of the contractor's total IR&D/B&P expenditures. In pricing 
contracts for such FMS--
    (1) Use the best estimate of reasonable costs in forward pricing; 
and
    (2) Use actual expenditures, to the extent that they are reasonable, 
in determining final cost.
    (d) Under paragraph (e)(1)(A) of Section 21 of the Arms Export 
Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2761), the United States must charge for 
administrative services to

[[Page 160]]

recover the estimated cost of administration of sales made under the 
Army Export Control Act.

<R05>
225.7303-3  Government-to-government agreements.

    If a government-to-government agreement between the United States 
and a foreign government for the sale, coproduction, or cooperative 
logistic support of a specifically defined weapon system, major end 
item, or support item, contains language in conflict with the provisions 
of this section, the language of the government-to-government agreement 
prevails.


<R05>
225.7303-4  Contingent fees.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, 
contingent fees are generally allowable under DoD contracts, provided--
    (1) The fees are paid to a bona fide employee or a bona fide 
established commercial or selling agency maintained by the prospective 
contractor for the purpose of securing business (see FAR Part 31 and FAR 
Subpart 3.4); and
    (2) The contracting officer determines that the fees are fair and 
reasonable.
    (b)(1) Under DoD 5105.38-M, LOAs for requirements for the 
governments of Australia, Taiwan, Egypt, Greece, Israel, Japan, Jordan, 
Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Pakistan, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, 
Thailand, or Venezuela (Air Force) shall provide that all U.S. 
Government contracts resulting from the LOAs prohibit the reimbursement 
of contingent fees as an allowable cost under the contract, unless the 
contractor identifies the payments and the foreign customer approves the 
payments in writing before contract award (see 225.7307(a)).
    (2) For FMS to countries not listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
subsection, contingent fees exceeding $50,000 per FMS case are 
unallowable under DoD contracts, unless the contractor identifies the 
payment and the foreign customer approves the payment in writing before 
contract award.

<R05>
225.7303-5  Aquisitions wholly paid for from nonrepayable funds.

    (a) In accordance with 22 U.S.C. 2762(d), price FMS wholly paid for 
from funds made available on a nonrepayable basis on the same costing 
basis with regard to profit, overhead, IR&D/B&P, and other costing 
elements as is applicable to acquisitions of like items purchased by DoD 
for its own use.
    (b) Direct costs associated with meeting a foreign customer's 
additional or unique requirements are allowable under such contracts. 
Indirect burden rates applicable to such direct costs are permitted at 
the same rates applicable to acquisitions of like items purchased by DoD 
for its own use.
    (c) A U.S. defense contractor may not recover costs incurred for 
offset agreements with a foreign government or international 
organization if the LOA is financed with funds made available on a 
nonrepayable basis.

[61 FR 18988, Apr. 30, 1996; 61 FR 49531, Sept. 20, 1996, as amended at

Mar. 31, 2003]


<R05>
225.7304  FMS customer involvement.

    (a) FMS customers may request that a defense article or defense 
service be obtained from a particular contractor. In such cases, FAR 
6.302-4 provides authority to contract without full and open 
competition. The FMS customer may also request that a subcontract be 
placed with a particular firm. The contracting officer shall honor such 
requests from the FMS customer only if the LOA or other written 
direction sufficiently fulfills the requirements of FAR Subpart 6.3.
    (b) FMS customers should be encouraged to participate with U.S. 
Government acquisition personnel in discussions with industry to--
    (1) Develop technical specifications;
    (2) Establish delivery schedules;
    (3) Identify any special warranty provisions or other requirements 
unique to the FMS customer; and

[[Page 161]]

    (4) Review prices of varying alternatives, quantities, and options 
needed to make price-performance tradeoffs.
    (c) Do not disclose to the FMS customer any data, including cost or 
pricing data, that is contractor proprietary unless the contractor 
authorizes its release.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the 
degree of FMS customer participation in contract negotiations is left to 
the discretion of the contracting officer after consultation with the 
contractor. The contracting officer shall provide an explanation to the 
FMS customer if its participation in negotiations will be limited. 
Factors that may limit FMS customer participation include situations 
where--
    (1) The contract includes requirements for more than one FMS 
customer;
    (2) The contract includes unique U.S. requirements; or
    (3) Contractor proprietary data is a subject of negotiations.
    (e) Do not allow representatives of the FMS customer to--
    (1) Direct the exclusion of certain firms from the solicitation 
process (they may suggest the inclusion of certain firms);
    (2) Interfere with a contractor's placement of subcontracts; or
    (3) Observe or participate in negotiations between the U.S. 
Government and the contractor involving cost or pricing data, unless a 
deviation is granted in accordance with Subpart 201.4.
    (f) Do not accept directions from the FMS customer on source 
selection decisions or contract terms (except that, upon timely notice, 
the contracting officer may attempt to obtain any special contract 
provisions, warranties, or other unique requirements requested by the 
FMS customer).
    (g) Do not honor any requests by the FMS customer to reject any bid 
or proposal.
    (h) If an FMS customer requests additional information concerning 
FMS contract prices, the contracting officer shall, after consultation 
with the contractor, provide sufficient information to demonstrate the 
reasonableness of the price and reasonable responses to relevant 
questions concerning contract price. This information--
    (1) May include tailored responses, top-level pricing summaries, 
historical prices, or an explanation of any significant differences 
between the actual contract price and the estimated contract price 
included in the initial LOA; and
    (2) May be provided orally, in writing, or by any other method 
acceptable to the contracting officer.

[67 FR 70325, Nov. 22, 2002]


<R05>
225.7305  Limitation of liability.

    Advise the contractor when the foreign customer will assume the risk 
for loss or damage under the appropriate limitation of liability 
clause(s) (see FAR Subpart 46.8). Consider the costs of necessary 
insurance, if any, obtained by the contractor to cover the risk of loss 
or damage in establishing the FMS contract price.

<R05>
225.7306  Offset arrangements.

    In accordance with the Presidential policy statement of April 16, 
1990, DoD does not encourage, enter into, or commit U.S. firms to FMS 
offset arrangements. The decision whether to engage in offsets, and the 
responsibility for negotiating and implementing offset arrangements, 
resides with the companies involved. (Also see 225.7303-2(a)(3).)

[70 FR 73155, Dec. 9, 2005]


<R05>
225.7307  Contract clauses.

    (a) Use the clause at 252.225-7027, Restriction on Contingent Fees 
for Foreign Military Sales, in solicitations and contracts for FMS. 
Insert in paragraph (b)(1) of the clause the name(s) of any foreign 
country customer(s) listed in 225.7303-4(b).
    (b) Use the clause at 252.225-7028, Exclusionary Policies and 
Practices of Foreign Governments, in solicitations and contracts for the 
purchase of supplies and services for international military education 
training and FMS.

<R05>
226.370-2  Definitions.

    Definitions of HBCUs and MIs are in the clause at 252.226-7000, 
Notice of Historically Black College or University and Minority

[[Page 169]]


<R05>
226.370-3  Policy.

    DoD will use outreach efforts, technical assistance programs, 
advance payments, HBCU/MI set-asides, and evaluation preferences to meet 
its contract and subcontract goals for use of HBCUs and MIs.


<R05>
226.370-4  Set-aside criteria.

    Set aside acquisitions for exclusive HBCU and MI participation when 
the acquisition is for research, studies, or services of the type 
normally acquired from higher educational institutions and there is a 
reasonable expectation that--
    (a) Offers will be submitted by at least two responsible HBCUs or 
MIs that can comply with the subcontracting limitations in the clause at 
FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting;
    (b) Award will be made at not more than 10 percent above fair market 
price; and
    (c) Scientific or technological talent consistent with the demands 
of the acquisition will be offered.


<R05>
226.370-5  Set-aside procedures.

    (a) As a general rule, use competitive negotiation for HBCU/MI set-
asides.
    (b) When using a broad agency announcement (FAR 35.016) for basic or 
applied research, make partial set-asides for HBCU/MIs as explained in 
235.016.
    (c) Follow the special synopsis instructions in 205.207(d). 
Interested HBCU/MIs must provide evidence of their capability to perform 
the contract, and a positive statement of their eligibility, within 15 
days of publication of the synopsis in order for the acquisition to 
proceed as an HBCU/MI set-aside.
    (d) Cancel the set-aside if the low responsible offer exceeds the 
fair market price (defined in FAR part 19) by more than 10 percent.


<R05>
226.370-6  Eligibility for award.

    (a) To be eligible for award as an HBCU or MI under the preference 
procedures of this subpart, an offeror must--
    (1) Be an HBCU or MI, as defined in the clause at 252.226-7000, 
Notice of Historically Black College or University and Minority 
Institution Set-Aside, at the time of submission of its initial offer 
including price; and
    (2) Provide the contracting officer with evidence of its HBCU or MI 
status upon request.
    (b) The contracting officer shall accept an offeror's HBCU or MI 
status under the provision at FAR 52.226-2, Historically Black College 
or University and Minority Institution Representation, unless--
    (1) Another offeror challenges the status; or
    (2) The contracting officer has reason to question the offeror's 
HBCU/MI status. (A list of HBCU/MIs is published periodically by the 
Department of Education.)


<R05>
226.370-7  Protesting a representation.

    Any offeror or other interested party may challenge an offeror's 
HBCU or MI representation by filing a protest with the contracting 
officer. The protest must contain specific detailed evidence supporting 
the basis for the challenge. Such protests are handled in accordance 
with FAR 33.103 and are decided by the contracting officer.


<R05>
226.370-8  Goals and incentives for subcontracting with HBCU/MIs.

    (a) In reviewing subcontracting plans submitted under the clause at 
FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, the contracting 
officer shall--
    (1) Ensure that the contractor included anticipated awards to HBCU/
MIs in the small disadvantaged business goal; and
    (2) Consider whether subcontracts are contemplated that involve 
research or studies of the type normally performed by higher educational 
institutions.
    (b) The contracting officer may, when contracting by negotiation, 
use in solicitations and contracts a clause similar to the clause at FAR 
52.219-10, Incentive Subcontracting Program, when a subcontracting plan 
is required and inclusion of a monetary incentive is, in the judgment of 
the contracting officer, necessary to increase subcontracting 
opportunities for HBCU/MIs. The clause should include a separate goal 
for HBCU/MIs.

[[Page 170]]


<R05>
226.370-9  Solicitation provision and contract clause.

    (a) Use the clause at 252.226-7000, Notice of Historically Black 
College or University and Minority Institution Set-Aside, in 
solicitations and contracts set aside for HBCU/MIs.
    (b) Use the provision at FAR 52.226-2, Historically Black College or 
University and Minority Institution Representation, in solicitations set 
aside for HBCU/MIs.

program (subpart 219.8 and FAR subpart 19.8) or in making set-aside 
decisions under subpart 219.5 and FAR subpart 19.5 for acquisitions in 
support of a base closure or realignment, the contracting officer 
shall--
    (a) Determine whether there is a reasonable expectation that offers 
will be received from responsible business concerns located in the 
vicinity of the military installation that is being closed or realigned.
    (b) If offers can not be expected from business concerns in the 
vicinity, proceed with section 8(a) or set-aside consideration as

offerors specifically identify and commit, in their proposals, to a plan 
to hire residents of the vicinity of the military installation that is 
being closed or realigned.

<R04>
    Subpart 227.6_Foreign License and Technical Assistance Agreements


<R05>
227.670  Scope.

    This subpart prescribes policy with respect to foreign license and 
technical assistance agreements.


<R05>
227.671  General.

    In furtherance of the Military Assistance Program or for other 
national defense purposes, the Government may undertake to develop or 
encourage the development of foreign additional sources of supply. The 
development of such sources may be accomplished by an agreement, often 
called a foreign licensing agreement or technical assistance agreement, 
wherein a domestic concern, referred to in this subpart as a ``primary 
source,'' agrees to furnish to a foreign concern or government, herein 
referred to as a ``second source;'' foreign patent rights; technical 
assistance in the form of data, know-how, trained personnel of the 
primary source, instruction and guidance of the personnel of the second 
source, jigs, dies, fixtures, or other manufacturing aids, or such other 
assistance, information, rights, or licenses as are needed to enable the 
second source to produce particular supplies or perform particular 
services. Agreements calling for one or more of the foregoing may be 
entered into between the primary source and the Government, a foreign 
government, or a foreign concern. The consideration for providing such 
foreign license and technical assistance may be in the form of a lump 
sum payment, payments for each item manufactured by the second source, 
an agreement to exchange data and patent rights on improvements made to 
the article or service, capital stock transactions, or any combination 
of these. The primary source's bases for computing such consideration 
may include actual costs; charges for the use of patents, data, or know-
how reflecting the primary source's investment in developing and 
engineering and production techniques; and the primary source's 
``price'' for setting up a second source. Such agreements often refer to 
the compensation to be paid as a royalty or license fee whether or not 
patent rights are involved.


<R05>
227.672  Policy.

    It is Government policy not to pay in connection with its contracts, 
and not to allow to be paid in connection with contracts made with funds 
derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the 
United States Government, charges for use of patents in which it holds a 
royalty-free license or charges for data which it has a right to use and 
disclose to others, or which is in the public domain, or which the 
Government has acquired without restriction upon its use and disclosure 
to others. This policy shall be applied by the Departments in 
negotiating contract prices for foreign license technical assistance 
contracts (227.675) or supply contracts with second sources (227.674); 
and in commenting on such agreements when they are referred to the 
Department of Defense by the Department of State pursuant to section 414 
of the Mutual Security Act of 1954 as amended (22 U.S.C. 1934) and the 
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (see 227.675).


<R05>
227.673  Foreign license and technical assistance agreements between the Government and domestic concerns.

    (a) Contracts between the Government and a primary source to provide

[[Page 174]]

technical assistance or patent rights to a second source for the 
manufacture of supplies or performance of services shall, to the extent 
practicable, specify the rights in patents and data and any other rights 
to be supplied to the second source. Each contract shall provide, in 
connection with any separate agreement between the primary source and 
the second source for patent rights or technical assistance relating to 
the articles or services involved in the contract, that--
    (1) The primary source and his subcontractors shall not make, on 
account of any purchases by the Government or by others with funds 
derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the 
Government, any charge to the second source for royalties or 
amortization for patents or inventions in which the Government holds a 
royalty-free license; or data which the Government has the right to 
possess, use, and disclose to others; or any technical assistance 
provided to the second source for which the Government has paid under a 
contract between the Government and the primary source; and
    (2) The separate agreement between the primary and second source 
shall include a statement referring to the contract between the 
Government and the primary source, and shall conform to the requirements 
of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (see 227.675-1).
    (b) The following factors, among others, shall be considered in 
negotiating the price to be paid the primary source under contracts 
within (a) of this section:
    (1) The actual cost of providing data, personnel, manufacturing 
aids, samples, spare parts, and the like;
    (2) The extent to which the Government has contributed to the 
development of the supplies or services, and to the methods of 
manufacture or performance, through past contracts for research and 
development or for manufacture of the supplies or performance of the 
services; and
    (3) The Government's patent rights and rights in data relating to 
the supplies or services and to the methods of manufacture or of 
performance.


<R05>
227.674  Supply contracts between the Government and a foreign government or concern.

    In negotiating contract prices with a second source, including the 
redetermination of contract prices, or in determining the allowability 
of costs under a cost-reimbursement contract with a second source, the 
contracting officer:
    (a) Shall obtain from the second source a detailed statement (see 
FAR 27.204-1(a)(2)) of royalties, license fees, and other compensation 
paid or to be paid to a primary source (or any of his subcontractors) 
for patent rights, rights in data, and other technical assistance 
provided to the second source, including identification and description 
of such patents, data, and technical assistance; and
    (b) Shall not accept or allow charges which in effect are--
    (1) For royalties or amortization for patents or inventions in which 
the Government holds a royalty-free license; or
    (2) For data which the Government has a right to possess, use, and 
disclose to others; or
    (3) For any technical assistance provided to the second source for 
which the Government has paid under a contract between the Government 
and a primary source.


<R05>
227.675  Foreign license and technical assistance agreements between a domestic concern and a foreign government or concern.


<R05>
227.675-1  International Traffic in Arms Regulations.

    Pursuant to section 414 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as 
amended (22 U.S.C. 1934), the Department of State controls the 
exportation of data relating to articles designated in the United States 
Munitions List as arms, ammunition, or munitions of war. (The Munitions 
List and pertinent procedures are set forth in the International Traffic 
in Arms Regulations, 22 CFR, et seq.) Before authorizing such 
exportation, the Department of State generally requests comments from 
the Department of Defense. On request of the Office of the Assistant 
Secretary of Defense (International Security Affairs), each Department 
shall submit comments

[[Page 175]]

thereon as the basis for a Department of Defense reply to the Department 
of State.


<R05>
227.675-2  Review of agreements.

    (a) In reviewing foreign license and technical assistance agreements 
between primary and second sources, the Department concerned shall, 
insofar as its interests are involved, indicate whether the agreement 
meets the requirements of Sec. Sec. 124.07-124.10 of the International 
Traffic in Arms Regulations or in what respects it is deficient. 
Paragraphs (b) through (g) of this subsection provide general guidance.
    (b) When it is reasonably anticipated that the Government will 
purchase from the second source the supplies or services involved in the 
agreement, or that Military Assistance Program funds will be provided 
for the procurement of the supplies or services, the following guidance 
applies.
    (1) If the agreement specifies a reduction in charges thereunder, 
with respect to purchases by or for the Government or by others with 
funds derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise 
through the Government, in recognition of the Government's rights in 
patents and data, the Department concerned shall evaluate the amount of 
the reduction to determine whether it is fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances, before indicating its approval.
    (2) If the agreement does not specify any reduction in charges or 
otherwise fails to give recognition to the Government's rights in the 
patents or data involved, approval shall be conditioned upon amendment 
of the agreement to reflect a reduction, evaluated by the Department 
concerned as acceptable to the Government, in any charge thereunder with 
respect to purchases made by or for the Government or by others with 
funds derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise 
through the Government, in accordance with Sec. 124.10 of the 
International Traffic in Arms Regulations.
    (3) If the agreement provides that no charge is to be made to the 
second source for data or patent rights to the extent of the 
Government's rights, the Department concerned shall evaluate the 
acceptability of the provision before indicating its approval.
    (4) If time or circumstances do not permit the evaluation called for 
in (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection, the guidance in (c) of this 
subsection shall be followed.
    (c) When it is not reasonably anticipated that the Government will 
purchase from the second source the supplies or services involved in the 
agreement nor that Military Assistance Program funds will be provided 
for the purchase of the supplies or services, then the following 
guidance applies.
    (1) If the agreement provides for charges to the second source for 
data or patent rights, it may suffice to fulfill the requirements of 
Sec. 124.10 insofar as the Department of Defense is concerned if:
    (i) The agreement requires the second source to advise the primary 
source when he has knowledge of any purchase made or to be made from him 
by or for the Government or by others with funds derived through the 
Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the Government;
    (ii) The primary source separately agrees with the Government that 
upon such advice to him from the second source or from the Government or 
otherwise as to any such a purchase or prospective purchase, he will 
negotiate with the Department concerned an appropriate reduction in his 
charges to the second source in recognition of any Government rights in 
patents or data; and
    (iii) The agreement between the primary and second sources further 
provides that in the event of any such purchase and resulting reduction 
in charges, the second source shall pass on this reduction to the 
Government by giving the Government a corresponding reduction in the 
purchase price of the article or service.
    (2) If the agreement provides that no charge is to be made to the 
second source for data or patent rights to the extent to which the 
Government has rights, the Department concerned shall:
    (i) Evaluate the acceptability of the provision before indicating 
its approval; or

[[Page 176]]

    (ii) Explicitly condition its approval on the right to evaluate the 
acceptability of the provision at a later time.
    (d) When there is a technical assistance agreement between the 
primary source and the Government related to the agreement between the 
primary and second sources that is under review, the latter agreement 
shall reflect the arrangements contemplated with respect thereto by the 
Government's technical assistance agreement with the primary source.
    (e) Every agreement shall provide that any license rights 
transferred under the agreement are subject to existing rights of the 
Government.
    (f) In connection with every agreement referred to in (b) of this 
section, a request shall be made to the primary source--
    (1) To identify the patents, data, and other technical assistance to 
be provided to the second source by the primary source or any of his 
subcontractors,
    (2) To identify any such patents and data in which, to the knowledge 
of the primary source, the Government may have rights, and
    (3) To segregate the charges made to the second source for each such 
category or item of patents, data, and other technical assistance.

Reviewing personnel shall verify this information or, where the primary 
source does not furnish it, obtain such information from Governmental 
sources so far as practicable.
    (g) The Department concerned shall make it clear that its approval 
of any agreement does not necessarily recognize the propriety of the 
charges or the amounts thereof, or constitute approval of any of the 
business arrangements in the agreement, unless the Department expressly 
intends by its approval to commit itself to the fairness and 
reasonableness of a particular charge or charges. In any event, a 
disclaimer should be made to charges or business terms not affecting any 
purchase made by or for the Government or by others with funds derived 
through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the 
Government.

his patent or patents are being infringed.
    (b) In addition to the information listed in (a) of this section, 
the following material and information is generally necessary in the 
course of processing a claim of patent infringement. Claimants are 
encouraged to furnish this information at the time of filing a claim to 
permit the most expeditious processing and settlement of the claim.
    (1) A copy of the asserted patent(s) and identification of all 
claims of the patent alleged to be infringed.
    (2) Identification of all procurements known to claimant which

Patent Office file, particularly publications and foreign art.

In addition in the foregoing, if claimant can provide a statement that 
the investigation may be limited to the specifically identified accused 
articles or processes, or to a specific procurement, it may materially 
expedite determination of the claim.
    (c) Any Department receiving an allegation of patent infringement 
which

[[Page 178]]

meets the requirements of this paragraph shall acknowledge the same and 
supply the other Departments which may have an interest therein with a

Sept. 21, 1999]


<R05>
227.7005  Indirect notice of patent infringement claims.

    (a) A communication by a patent owner to a Department of Defense 
contractor alleging that the contractor has committed acts of 
infringement in performance of a Government contract shall not be 
considered a claim within the meaning of 227.7004 until it meets the 
requirements specified therein.
    (b) Any Department receiving an allegation of patent infringement 
which meets the requirements of 227.7004 shall acknowledge the same and 
supply the other Departments (see 227.7004(c)) which may have an 
interest therein with a copy of such communication and the 
acknowledgement thereof.
    (c) If a communication covering an infringement claim or notice 
which does not meet the requirements of 227.7004(a) is received from a 
contractor, the patent owner shall be advised in writing as covered by 
the instructions of 227.7004(d).


<R05>
227.7006  Investigation and administrative disposition of claims.

    An investigation and administrative determination (denial or 
settlement) of each claim shall be made in accordance with instructions 
and procedures established by each Department, subject to the following:
    (a) When the procurement responsibility for the alleged infringing 
item or process is assigned to a single Department or only one 
Department is the purchaser of the alleged infringing item or process, 
and the funds of that Department only are to be charged in the 
settlement of the claim, that Department shall have the sole 
responsibility for the investigation and administrative determination of 
the claim and for the execution of any agreement in settlement of the 
claim. Where, however, funds of another Department are to be charged, in 
whole or in part, the approval of such Department shall be obtained as 
required by 208.7002. Any agreement in settlement of the claim, approved 
pursuant to 208.7002 shall be executed by each of the Departments 
concerned.
    (b) When two or more Departments are the respective purchasers of 
alleged infringing items or processes and the funds of those Departments 
are to be charged in the settlement of the claim, the investigation and 
administrative determination shall be the responsibility of the 
Department having the predominant financial interest in the claim or of 
the Department or Departments as jointly agreed upon by the Departments 
concerned. The Department responsible for negotiation shall, throughout 
the negotiation, coordinate with the other Departments concerned and 
keep them advised of the status of the negotiation. Any agreement in the

[[Page 179]]

settlement of the claim shall be executed by each Department concerned.


<R05>
227.7007  Notification and disclosure to claimants.

    When a claim is denied, the Department responsible for the 
administrative determination of the claim shall so notify the claimant 
or his authorized representative and provide the claimant a reasonable 
rationale of the basis for denying the claim. Disclosure of information 
or the rationale referred to above shall be subject to applicable 
statutes, regulations, and directives pertaining to security, access to 
official records, and the rights of others.


<R05>
227.7008  Settlement of indemnified claims.

    Settlement of claims involving payment for past infringement shall 
not be made without the consent of, and equitable contribution by, each 
indemnifying contractor involved, unless such settlement is determined 
to be in the best interests of the Government and is coordinated with 
the Department of Justice with a view to preserving any rights of the 
Government against the contractors involved. If consent of and equitable 
contribution by the contractors are obtained, the settlement need not be 
coordinated with the Department of Justice.


<R05>
227.7009  Patent releases, license agreements, and assignments.

    This section contains clauses for use in patent release and 
settlement agreements, license agreements, and assignments, executed by 
the Government, under which the Government acquires rights. Minor 
modifications of language (e.g., pluralization of ``Secretary'' or 
``Contracting Officer'') in multi-departmental agreements may be made if 
necessary.


<R05>
227.7009-1  Required clauses.

[56 FR 36389, July 31, 1991, as amended at 61 FR 50454, Sept. 26, 1996]


<R05>
227.7009-2  Clauses to be used when applicable.

    (a) Release of past infringement. The clause at 252.227-7001, 
Release of Past Infringement, is an example which may be modified or 
omitted as appropriate for particular circumstances, but only upon the 
advice of cognizant patent or legal counsel. (See footnotes at end of 
clause.)
    (b) Readjustment of payments. The clause at 252.227-7002, 
Readjustment of Payments, shall be inserted in contracts providing for 
payment of a running royalty.
    (c) Termination. The clause at 252.227-7003, Termination, is an 
example for use in contracts providing for the payment of a running 
royalty. This clause may be modified or omitted as appropriate for 
particular circumstances, but only upon the advice of cognizant patent 
or legal counsel (see 227.7004(c)).


<R05>
227.7009-3  Additional clauses--contracts except running royalty contracts.

    The following clauses are examples for use in patent release and 
settlement agreements, and license agreements not providing for payment 
by the Government of a running royalty.
    (a) License Grant. Insert the clause at 252.227-7004.
    (b) License Term. Insert one of the clauses at 252.227-7005 
Alternate I or Alternate II, as appropriate.


<R05>
227.7009-4  Additional clauses--contracts providing for payment of a running royalty.

    The clauses set forth below are examples which may be used in patent 
release and settlement agreements, and license agreements, when it is 
desired to cover the subject matter thereof and the contract provides 
for payment of a running royalty.
    (a) License grant--running royalty. No Department shall be obligated 
to pay royalties unless the contract is signed on behalf of such 
Department. Accordingly, the License Grant clause at 252.227-7006 should 
be limited to the

[[Page 180]]

practice of the invention by or for the signatory Department or 
Departments.
    (b) License term--running royalty. The clause at 252.227-7007 is a 
sample form for expressing the license term.
    (c) Computation of royalties. The clause at 252.227-7008 providing 
for the computation of royalties, may be of varying scope depending upon 
the nature of the royalty bearing article, the volume of procurement, 
and the type of contract pursuant to which the procurement is to be 
accomplished.
    (d) Reporting and payment of royalties. (1) The contract should 
contain a provision specifying the office designated within the specific 
Department involved to make any necessary reports to the contractor of 
the extent of use of the licensed subject matter by the entire 
Department, and such office shall be charged with the responsibility of 
obtaining from all procuring offices of that Department the information 
necessary to make the required reports and corresponding vouchers 
necessary to make the required payments. The clause at 252.227-7009 is a 
sample for expressing reporting and payment of royalties requirements.
    (2) Where more than one Department or Government Agency is licensed 
and there is a ceiling on the royalties payable in any reporting period, 
the licensing Departments or Agencies shall coordinate with respect to 
the pro rata share of royalties to be paid by each.
    (e) License to other government agencies. When it is intended that a 
license on the same terms and conditions be available to other 
departments and agencies of the Government, the clause at 252.227-7010 
is an example which may be used.


<R05>
227.7010  Assignments.

    (a) The clause at 252.227-7011 is an example which may be used in 
contracts of assignment of patent rights to the Government.
    (b) To facilitate proof of contracts of assignments, the 
acknowledgement of the contractor should be executed before a notary 
public or other officer authorized to administer oaths (35 U.S.C. 261).


<R05>
227.7011  Procurement of rights in inventions, patents, and copyrights.

    Even though no infringement has occurred or been alleged, it is the 
policy of the Department of Defense to procure rights under patents, 
patent applications, and copyrights whenever it is in the Government's 
interest to do so and the desired rights can be obtained at a fair 
price. The required and suggested clauses at 252.227-7004 and 252.227-
7010 shall be required and suggested clauses, respectively, for license 
agreements and assignments made under this paragraph. The instructions 
at 227.7009-3 and 227.7010 concerning the applicability and use of those 
clauses shall be followed insofar as they are pertinent.


<R05>
227.7012  Contract format.

    The format at 252.227-7012 appropriately modified where necessary, 
may be used for contracts of release, license, or assignment.


<R05>
227.7013  Recordation.

    Executive Order No. 9424 of 18 February 1944 requires all executive 
Departments and agencies of the Government to forward through 
appropriate channels to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, for 
recording, all Government interests in patents or applications for 
patents.

<R05>
227.7100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart--
    (a) Prescribes policies and procedures for the acquisition of 
technical data and the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, 
perform, display, or disclose technical data. It implements requirements 
in the following laws and Executive Order:
    (1) 10 U.S.C. 2302(4).
    (2) 10 U.S.C. 2305 (subsection (d)(4)).
    (3) 10 U.S.C. 2320.
    (4) 10 U.S.C. 2321.
    (5) 10 U.S.C. 2325.
    (6) Pub. L. 103-355.

[[Page 181]]

    (7) Executive Order 12591 (Subsection 1(b)(6)).
    (b) Does not apply to computer software or technical data that is 
computer software documentation (see subpart 227.72).


<R05>
227.7101  Definitions.

    (a) As used in this subpart, unless otherwise specifically 
indicated, the terms ``offeror'' and ``contractor'' include an offeror's 
or contractor's subcontractors, suppliers, or potential subcontractors 
or suppliers at any tier.
    (b) Other terms used in this subpart are defined in the clause at 
252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items.

[56 FR 36389, July 31, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 61598, Nov. 30, 1995]


<R05>
227.7102  Commercial items, components, or processes.

    Section 2320(b)(1) of Title 10 U.S.C. establishes a presumption that 
commercial items are developed at private expense whether or not a 
contractor submits a justification in response to a challenge notice. 
Therefore, do not challenge a contractor's assertion that a commercial 
item, component, or process was developed at private expense unless the 
Government can demonstrate that it contributed to development of the 
item, component or process. Follow the procedures in 227.7103-13 and the 
clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical 
Data, when information provided by the Department of Defense 
demonstrates that an item, component, or process was not developed 
exclusively at private expense. However, when a challenge is warranted, 
a contractor's or subcontractor's failure to respond to the challenge 
notice cannot be the sole basis for issuing a final decision denying the 
validity of an asserted restriction.


<R05>
227.7102-1  Policy.

    (a) DoD shall acquire only the technical data customarily provided 
to the public with a commercial item or process, except technical data 
that--
    (1) Are form, fit, or function data;
    (2) Are required for repair or maintenance of commercial items or 
processes, or for the proper installation, operating, or handling of a 
commercial item, either as a stand alone unit or as a part of a military 
system, when such data are not customarily provided to commercial users 
or the data provided to commercial users is not sufficient for military 
purposes; or
    (3) Describe the modifications made at Government expense to a 
commercial item or process in order to meet the requirements of a 
Government solicitation.
    (b) To encourage offerors and contractors to offer or use commercial 
products to satisfy military requirements, offerors, and contractors 
shall not be required, except for the technical data described in 
paragraph (a) of this subsection, to--
    (1) Furnish technical information related to commercial items or 
processes that is not customarily provided to the public; or
    (2) Relinquish to, or otherwise provide, the Government rights to 
use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical 
data pertaining to commercial items or processes except for a transfer 
of rights mutually agreed upon.


<R05>
227.7102-2  Rights in technical data.

    (a) The clause at 252.227-7015, Technical Data--Commercial Items, 
provides the Government specific license rights in technical data 
pertaining to commercial items or processes. DoD may use, modify, 
reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose data only within the 
Government. The data may not be used to manufacture additional 
quantities of the commercial items and, except for emergency repair or 
overhaul, may not be released or disclosed to, or used by, third parties 
without the contractor's written permission. Those restrictions do not 
apply to the technical data described in 227.7102-1(a).
    (b) If additional rights are needed, contracting activities must 
negotiate with the contractor to determine if there are acceptable terms 
for transferring such rights. The specific additional rights granted to 
the Government shall be enumerated in a license agreement made part of 
the contract.

[[Page 182]]


<R05>
227.7102-3  Contract clause.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, use the 
clause at 252.227-7015, Technical Data--Commercial Items, in all 
solicitations and contracts when the contractor will be required to 
deliver technical data pertaining to commercial items, components, or 
processes. Do not require the contractor to include this clause in its 
subcontracts.
    (b) Use the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data--
Noncommercial Items, in lieu of the clause at 252.227-7015 if the 
Government will pay any portion of the development costs. Do not require 
the contractor to include this clause in its subcontracts for commercial 
items or commercial components.
    (c) Use the clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive 
Markings on Technical Data, in all solicitations and contracts for 
commercial items that include the clause at 252.227-7015 or the clause 
at 252.227-7013. Do not require the contractor to include this clause in 
its subcontracts for commercial items or commercial components.

<R05>
227.7103  Noncommercial items or processes.


<R05>
227.7103-1  Policy.

    (a) DoD policy is to acquire only the technical data, and the rights 
in that data, necessary to satisfy agency needs.
    (b) Solicitations and contracts shall--
    (1) Specify the technical data to be delivered under a contract and 
delivery schedules for the data;
    (2) Establish or reference procedures for determining the 
acceptability of technical data;
    (3) Establish separate contract line items, to the extent 
practicable, for the technical data to be delivered under a contract and 
require offerors and contractors to price separately each deliverable 
data item; and
    (4) Require offerors to identify, to the extent practicable, 
technical data to be furnished with restrictions on the Government's 
rights and require contractors to identify technical data to be 
delivered with such restrictions prior to delivery.
    (c) Offerors shall not be required, either as a condition of being 
responsive to a solicitation or as a condition for award, to sell or 
otherwise relinquish to the Government any rights in technical data 
related to items, components or processes developed at private expense 
except for the data identified at 227.7103-5(a)(2) and (a)(4) through 
(9).
    (d) Offerors and contractors shall not be prohibited or discouraged 
from furnishing or offering to furnish items, components, or processes 
developed at private expense solely because the Government's rights to 
use, modify, release, reproduce, perform, display, or disclose technical 
data pertaining to those items may be restricted.
    (e) As provided in 10 U.S.C. 2305, solicitations for major systems 
development contracts shall not require offerors to submit proposals 
that would permit the Government to acquire competitively items 
identical to items developed at private expense unless a determination 
is made at a level above the contracting officer that--
    (1) The offeror will not be able to satisfy program schedule or 
delivery requirements; or
    (2) The offeror's proposal to meet mobilization requirements does 
not satisfy mobilization needs.
    (f) For acquisitions involving major weapon systems or subsystems of 
major weapon systems, the acquisition plan shall address acquisition 
strategies that provide for technical data and the associated license 
rights in accordance with 207.106(S-70).

<R05>
227.7103-2  Acquisition of technical data.

    (a) Contracting officers shall work closely with data managers and 
requirements personnel to assure that data requirements included in 
solicitations are consistent with the policy expressed in 227.7103-1.
    (b)(1) Data managers or other requirements personnel are responsible 
for identifying the Government's minimum needs for technical data. Data 
needs must be established giving consideration to the contractor's 
economic

[[Page 183]]

interests in data pertaining to items, components, or processes that 
have been developed at private expense; the Government's costs to 
acquire, maintain, store, retrieve, and protect the data; reprocurement 
needs; repair, maintenance and overhaul philosophies; spare and repair 
part considerations; and whether procurement of the items, components, 
or processes can be accomplished on a form, fit, or function basis. When 
it is anticipated that the Government will obtain unlimited or 
government purpose rights in technical data that will be required for 
competitive spare or repair parts procurements, such data should be 
identified as deliverable data items. Reprocurement needs may not be a 
sufficient reason to acquire detailed manufacturing or process data when 
items or components can be acquired using performance specifications, 
form, fit and function data, or when there are a sufficient number of 
alternate sources which can reasonably be expected to provide such items 
on a performance specification or form, fit, or function basis.
    (2) When reviewing offers received in response to a solicitation or 
other request for data, data managers must balance the original 
assessment of the Government's data needs with data prices contained in 
the offer.
    (c) Contracting officers are responsible for ensuring that, wherever 
practicable, solicitations and contracts--
    (1) Identify the type and quantity of the technical data to be 
delivered under the contract and the format and media in which the data 
will be delivered;
    (2) Establish each deliverable data item as a separate contract line 
item (this requirement may be satisfied by listing each deliverable data 
item on an exhibit to the contract);
    (3) Identify the prices established for each deliverable data item 
under a fixed-price type contract;
    (4) Include delivery schedules and acceptance criteria for each 
deliverable data item; and
    (5) Specifically identify the place of delivery for each deliverable 
item of technical data.


<R05>
227.7103-3  Early identification of technical data to be furnished to the Government with restrictions on use, reproduction or disclosure.

    (a) 10 U.S.C. 2320 requires, to the maximum extent practicable, an 
identification prior to delivery of any technical data to be delivered 
to the Government with restrictions on use.
    (b) Use the provision at 252.227-7017, Identification and Assertion 
of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions, in all solicitations that 
include the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data--
Noncommercial Items. The provision requires offerors to identify any 
technical data for which restrictions, other than copyright, on use, 
release, or disclosure are asserted and to attach the identification and 
assertions to the offer.
    (c) Subsequent to contract award, the clause at 252.277-7013 permits 
a contractor, under certain conditions, to make additional assertions of 
use, release, or disclosure restrictions. The prescription for the use 
of that clause and its alternate is at 227.7103-6 (a) and (b).


<R05>
227.7103-4  License rights.

    (a) Grant of license. The Government obtains rights in technical 
data, including a copyright license, under and irrevocable license 
granted or obtained for the Government by the contractor. The contractor 
or licensor retains all rights in the data not granted to the 
Government. For technical data that pertain to items, components, or 
processes, the scope of the license is generally determined by the 
source of funds used to develop the item, component, or process. When 
the technical data do not pertain to items, components, or processes, 
the scope of the license is determined by the source of funds used to 
create the data.
    (1) Techical data pertaining to items, components, or processes. 
Contractors or licensors may, with some exceptions (see 227.7103-5(a)(2) 
and (a)(4) through (9)), restrict the Government's rights to use, 
modify, release, reproduce, perform, display or disclose technical data 
pertaining to items, components, or processes developed exclusively at 
private expense (limited rights). They may not restrict the Government's

[[Page 184]]

rights in items, components, or processes developed exclusively at 
Government expense (unlimited rights) without the Government's approval. 
When an item, component, or process is developed with mixed funding, the 
Government may use, modify, release, reproduce, perform, display or 
disclose the data pertaining to such items, components, or processes 
within the Government without restriction but may release or disclose 
the data outside the Government only for government purposes (government 
purpose rights).
    (2) Technical data that do not pertain to items, components, or 
processes. Technical data may be created during the performance of a 
contract for a conceptual design or similar effort that does not require 
the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, 
components or processes. The Government generally obtains unlimited 
rights in such data when the data were created exclusively with 
Government funds, government purpose rights when the data were created 
with mixed funding, and limited rights when the data were created 
exclusively at private expense.
    (b) Source of funds determination. The determination of the source 
of development funds for technical data pertaining to items, components, 
or processes should be made at any practical sub-item or subcomponent 
level or for any segregable portion of a process. Contractors may assert 
limited rights in a segregable sub-item, sub-component, or portion of a 
process which otherwise qualifies for limited rights under the clause at 
252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items.


<R05>
227.7103-5  Government rights.

    The standard license rights that a licensor grants to the Government 
are unlimited rights, government purpose rights, or limited rights. 
Those rights are defined in the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in 
Technical Data--Noncommercial Items. In unusual situations, the 
standards rights may not satisfy the Government's needs or the 
Government may be willing to accept lesser rights in data in return for 
other consideration. In those cases, a special license may be 
negotiated. However, the licensor is not obligated to provide the 
Government greater rights and the contracting officer is not required to 
accept lesser rights than the rights provided in the standard grant of 
license. The situations under which a particular grant of license 
applies are enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection.
    (a) Unlimited rights. The Government obtains unlimited rights in 
technical data that are--
    (1) Data pertaining to an item, component, or process which has been 
or will be developed exclusively with Government funds;
    (2) Studies, analyses, test data, or similar data produced in the 
performance of a contract when the study, analysis, test, or similar 
work was specified as an element of performance;
    (3) Created exclusively with Government funds in the performance of 
a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, 
construction, or production of items, components, or processes;
    (4) Form, fit, and function data;
    (5) Necessary for installation, operation, maintenance, or training 
purposes (other than detailed manufacturing or process data);
    (6) Corrections or changes to technical data furnished to the 
contractor by the Government;
    (7) Publicly available or have been released or disclosed by the 
contractor or subcontractor without restrictions on further use, release 
or disclosure other than a release or disclosure resulting from the 
sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the software to 
another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business 
entity or its assets to another party;
    (8) Data in which the Government has obtained unlimited rights under 
another Government contract or as a result of negotiations; or
    (9) Data furnished to the Government, under a Government contract or 
subcontract thereunder, with--
    (i) Government purpose license rights or limited rights and the 
restrictive condition(s) has/have expired; or
    (ii) Government purpose rights and the contractor's exclusive right 
to use such data for commercial purposes has expired.

[[Page 185]]

    (b) Government purpose rights. (1) The Government obtains government 
purpose rights in technical data--
    (i) That pertain to items, components, or processes developed with 
mixed funding except when the Government is entitled to unlimited rights 
as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(4) through (9) of this 
subsection; or
    (ii) Created with mixed funding in the performance of a contract 
that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or 
production of items, components, or processes.
    (2) The period during which government purpose rights are effective 
is negotiable. The clause at 252.227-7013 provides a nominal five-year 
period. Either party may request a different period. Changes to the 
government purpose rights period may be made at any time prior to 
delivery of the technical data without consideration from either party. 
Longer periods should be negotiated when a five-year period does not 
provide sufficient time to apply the data for commercial purposes or 
when necessary to recognize subcontractors' interests in the data.
    (3) The government purpose rights period commences upon execution of 
the contract, subcontract, letter contract (or similar contractual 
instrument), contract modification, or option exercise that required the 
development. Upon expiration of the Government rights period, the 
Government has unlimited rights in the data including the right to 
authorize others to use the data for commercial purposes.
    (4) During the government purpose rights period, the government may 
not use, or authorize other persons to use, technical data marked with 
government purpose rights legends for commercial purposes. The 
Government shall not release or disclose data in which it has government 
purpose rights to any person, or authorize others to do so, unless--
    (i) Prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is 
subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7; or
    (ii) The intended recipient is a Government contractor receiving 
access to the data for performance of a Government contract that 
contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or 
Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive 
Legends.
    (5) When technical data marked with government purpose rights 
legends will be released or disclosed to a Government contractor 
performing a contract that does not include the clause at 252-227-7025, 
the contract may be modified, prior to release or disclosure, to include 
that clause in lieu of requiring the contractor to complete a use and 
non-disclosure agreement.
    (6) Contracting activities shall establish procedures to assure that 
technical data marked with government purpose rights legends are 
released or disclosed, including a release or disclosure through a 
Government solicitation, only to persons subject to the use and non-
disclosure restrictions. Public announcements in the Commerce Business 
Daily or other publications must provide notice of the use and non-
disclosure requirements. Class use and non-disclosure agreements (e.g., 
agreements covering all solicitations received by the XYZ company within 
a reasonable period) are authorized and may be obtained at any time 
prior to release or disclosure of the government purpose rights data. 
Documents transmitting government purpose rights data to persons under 
class agreements shall identify the technical data subject to government 
purpose rights and the class agreement under which such data are 
provided.
    (c) Limited rights. (1) The Government obtains limited rights in 
technical data--
    (i) That pertain to items, components, or processes developed 
exclusively at private expense except when the Government is entitled to 
unlimited rights as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(4) through (9) 
of this subsection; or
    (ii) Created exclusively at private expense in the performance of a 
contract that does not require the development, manufacture, 
construction, or production of items, components, or processes.
    (2) Data in which the Government has limited rights may not be used, 
released, or disclosed outside the Government without the permission of 
the

[[Page 186]]

contractor asserting the restriction except for a use, release or 
disclosure that is--
    (i) Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or
    (ii) To a foreign government, other than detailed manufacturing or 
process data, when use, release, or disclosure is in the interest of the 
United States and is required for evaluation or informational purposes.
    (3) The person asserting limited rights must be notified of the 
Government's intent to release, disclose, or authorize others to use 
such data prior to release or disclosure of the data except notification 
of an intended release, disclosure, or use for emergency repair or 
overhaul which shall be made as soon as practicable.
    (4) When the person asserting limited rights permits the Government 
to release, disclose, or have others use the data subject to 
restrictions on further use, release, or disclosure, or for a release 
under paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (ii) of this subsection, the intended 
recipient must complete the use and non-disclosure agreement at 
227.7103-7 prior to release or disclosure of the limited rights data.
    (d) Specifically negotiated license rights. (1) Negotiate specific 
licenses when the parties agree to modify the standard license rights 
granted to the government or when the government wants to obtain rights 
in data in which it does not have rights. When negotiating to obtain, 
relinquish, or increase the Government's rights in technical data, 
consider the acquisition strategy for the item, component, or process, 
including logistics support and other factors which may have relevance 
for a particular procurement. The Government may accept lesser rights 
when it has unlimited or government purpose rights in data but may not 
accept less than limited rights in such data. The negotiated license 
rights must stipulate what rights the Government has to release or 
disclose the data to other persons or to authorize others to use the 
data. Identify all negotiated rights in a license agreement made part of 
the contract.
    (2) When the Government needs additional rights in data acquired 
with government purpose or limited rights, the contracting officer must 
negotiate with the contractor to determine whether there are acceptable 
terms for transferring such rights. Generally, such negotiations should 
be conducted only when there is a need to disclose the data outside the 
Government or if the additional rights are required for competitive 
reprocurement and the anticipated savings expected to be obtained 
through competition are estimated to exceed the acquisition cost of the 
additional rights. Prior to negotiating for additional rights in limited 
rights data, consider alternatives such as--
    (i) Using performance specifications and form, fit, and function 
data to acquire or develop functionally equivalent items, components, or 
processes;
    (ii) Obtaining a contractor's contractual commitment to qualify 
additional sources and maintain adequate competition among the sources; 
or
    (iii) Reverse engineering, or providing items from Government 
inventories to contractors who request the items to facilitate the 
development of equivalent items through reverse engineering.


<R05>
227.7103-6  Contract clauses.

    (a) Use the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data--
Noncommercial Items, in solicitations and contracts when the successful 
offeror(s) will be required to deliver technical data to the Government. 
Do not use the clause when the only deliverable items are computer 
software or computer software documentation (see 227.72), commercial 
items (see 227.7102-3), existing works (see 227.7105), special works 
(see 227.7106), or when contracting under the Small Business Innovation 
Research Program (see 227.7104). Except as provided in 227.7107-2, do 
not use the clause in architect-engineer and construction contracts.
    (b) Use the clause at 252.227-7013 with its Alternate I in research 
contracts when the contracting officer determines, in consultation with 
counsel, that public dissemination by the contractor would be--
    (1) In the interest of the government; and
    (2) Facilitated by the Government relinquishing its right to publish 
the

[[Page 187]]

work for sale, or to have others publish the work for sale on behalf of 
the Government.
    (c) Use the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or 
Disclosure of Government Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive 
Legends, in solicitations and contracts when it is anticipated that the 
Government will provide the contractor, for performance of its contract, 
technical data marked with another contractor's restrictive legend(s).
    (d) Use the provision at 252.227-7028, Technical Data or Computer 
Software Previously Delivered to the Government, in solicitations when 
the resulting contract will require the contractor to deliver technical 
data. The provision requires offerors to identify any technical data 
specified in the solicitations as deliverable data items that are the 
same or substantially the same as data items the offeror has delivered 
or is obligated to deliver, either as a contractor or subcontractor, 
under any other federal agency contract.
    (e) Use the following clauses in solicitations and contracts that 
include the clause at 252.227-7013:
    (1) 252.227-7016, Rights in Bid or Proposal Information;
    (2) 252.227-7030, Technical Data--Withholding of Payment; and
    (3) 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical 
Data (paragraph (e) of the clause contains information that must be 
included in a challenge).

<R05>
227.7103-7  Use and non-disclosure agreement.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, 
technical data or computer software delivered to the Government with 
restrictions on use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, 
display, or disclosure may not be provided to third parties unless the 
intended recipient completes and signs the use and non-disclosure 
agreement at paragraph (c) of this subsection prior to release, or 
disclosure of the data.
    (1) The specific conditions under which an intended recipient will 
be authorized to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or 
disclose technical data subject to limited rights or computer software 
subject to restricted rights must be stipulated in an attachment to the 
use and non-disclosure agreement.
    (2) For an intended release, disclosure, or authorized use of 
technical data or computer software subject to special license rights, 
modify paragraph (1)(d) of the use and non-disclosure agreement to enter 
the conditions, consistent with the license requirements, governing the 
recipient's obligations regarding use, modification, reproduction, 
release, performance, display or disclosure of the data or software.
    (b) The requirement for use and non-disclosure agreements does not 
apply to Government contractors which require access to a third party's 
data or software for the performance of a Government contract that 
contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or 
Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive 
Legends.
    (c) The prescribed use and non-disclosure agreement is:

                    Use and Non-Disclosure Agreement

    The undersigned, ---------------- (Insert Name) ----------------, an 
authorized representative of the ---------------- (Insert Company Name) 
----------------, (which is hereinafter referred to as the 
``Recipient'') requests the Government to provide the Recipient with 
technical data or computer software (hereinafter referred to as 
``Data'') in which the Government's use, modification, reproduction, 
release, performance, display or disclosure rights are restricted. Those 
Data are identified in an attachment to this Agreement. In consideration 
for receiving such Data, the Recipient agrees to use the Data strictly 
in accordance with this Agreement:
    (1) The Recipient shall--
    (a) Use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose 
Data marked with government purpose rights or SBIR data rights legends 
only for government purposes and shall not do so for any commercial

    (d) Use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose 
Data marked with special license rights legends (To be completed by the 
contracting officer. See 227.7103-7(a)(2). Omit if none of the Data 
requested is marked with special license rights legends).
    (2) The Recipient agrees to adopt or establish operating procedures 
and physical security measures designed to protect these Data from 
inadvertent release or disclosure to unauthorized third parties.
    (3) The Recipient agrees to accept these Data ``as is'' without any 
Government representation as to suitability for intended use or warranty 
whatsoever. This disclaimer does not affect any obligation the 
Government may have regarding Data specified in a contract for the 
performance of that contract.
    (4) The Recipient may enter into any agreement directly with the 
Contractor with respect to the use, modification, reproduction, release, 
performance, display, or disclosure of these Data.
    (5) The Recipient agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the

227.7103-8  Deferred delivery and deferred ordering of technical data.

    (a) Deferred delivery. Use the clause at 252.227-7026, Deferred 
Delivery of Technical Data or Computer Software, when it is in the 
Government's interests to defer the delivery of technical data. The 
clause permits the contracting officer to require the delivery of 
technical data identified as ``deferred delivery'' data at any time 
until two years after acceptance by the Government of

[[Page 189]]

all items (other than technical data or computer software) under the 
contract or contract termination, whichever is later. The obligation of 
subcontractors or suppliers to deliver such technical data expires two 
years after the date the prime contractor accepts the last item from the 
subcontractor or supplier for use in the performance of the contract. 
The contract must specify which technical data is subject to deferred 
delivery. The contracting officer shall notify the contractor 
sufficiently in advance of the desired delivery date for such data to 
permit timely delivery.
    (b) Deferred ordering. Use the clause at 252.227-7027, Deferred 
Ordering of Technical Data or Computer Software, when a firm requirement 
for a particular data item(s) has not been established prior to contract 
award but there is a potential need for the data. Under this clause, the 
contracting officer may order any data that has been generated in the 
performance of the contract or any subcontract thereunder at any time 
until three years after acceptance of all items (other than technical 
data or computer software) under the contract or contract termination, 
whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors to deliver such 
data expires three years after the date the contractor accepts the last 
item under the subcontract. When the data are ordered, the delivery 
dates shall be negotiated and the contractor compensated only for 
converting the data into the prescribed form, reproduction costs, and 
delivery costs.


<R05>
227.7103-9  Copyright.

    (a) Copyright license. (1) The clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in 
Technical Data--Noncommercial Items, requires a contractor to grant or 
obtain for the Government license rights which permit the Government to 
reproduce data, distribute copies of the data, publicly perform or 
display the data or, through the right to modify data, prepare 
derivative works. The extent to which the Government, and others acting 
on its behalf, may exercise these rights varies for each of the standard 
data rights licenses obtained under the clause. When non-standard 
license rights in technical data will be negotiated, negotiate the 
extent of the copyright license concurrent with negotiations for the 
data rights license. Do not negotiate a copyright license that provides 
less rights than the standard limited rights license in technical data.
    (2) The clause at 252.227-7013 does not permit a contractor to 
incorporate a third party's copyrighted data into a deliverable data 
item unless the contractor has obtained an appropriate license for the 
Government and, when applicable, others acting on the Government's 
behalf, or has obtained the contracting officer's written approval to do 
so. Grant approval to use third party copyrighted data in which the 
Government will not receive a copyright license only when the 
Government's requirements cannot be satisfied without the third party 
material or when the use of the third party material will result in cost 
savings to the Government which outweigh the lack of a copyright

acquiring existing or special works.


<R05>
227.7103-10  Contractor identification and marking of technical data to be furnished with restrictive markings.

    (a) Identification requirements. (1) The solicitation provision at 
252.227-7017, Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or 
Disclosure Restrictions, requires offerors to identify to the 
contracting officer, prior to contract award, any technical data that 
the offeror asserts should be provided to the Government with 
restrictions on use, modification, reproduction, release or disclosure. 
This requirement does not apply to restrictions based solely on 
copyright. The notification and identification must be submitted as an 
attachment to the offer. If an offeror fails to submit the attachment or 
fails to complete the attachment in accordance with the requirements of 
the solicitation provision, such failure shall constitute a minor 
informality. Provide offerors an opportunity to remedy a minor 
informality in accordance with the procedures at FAR 14.405 or 15.607.

[[Page 190]]

An offeror's failure to correct the informality within the time 
prescribed by the contracting officer shall render the offer ineligible 
for award.
    (2) The procedures for correcting minor informalities shall not be 
used to obtain information regarding asserted restrictions or an 
offeror's suggested asserted rights category. Questions regarding the 
justification for an asserted restriction or asserted rights category 
must be pursued in accordance with the procedures at 227.7103-13.
    (3) The restrictions asserted by a successful offeror shall be 
attached to its contract unless, in accordance with the procedures at 
227.7103-13, the parties have agreed that an asserted restriction is not 
justified. The contract attachment shall provide the same information 
regarding identification of the technical data, the asserted rights 
category, the basis for the assertion, and the name of the person 
asserting the restrictions as required by paragraph (d) of the 
solicitation provision at 252.227-7017. Subsequent to contract award, 
the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial 
Items, permits the contractor to make additional assertions under 
certain conditions. The additional assertions must be made in accordance 
with the procedures and in the format prescribed by that clause.
    (4) Neither the pre- or post-award assertions made by the 
contractor, nor the fact that certain assertions are identified in the 
attachment to the contract, determine the respective rights of the 
parties. As provided at 227.7103-13, the Government has the right to 
review, verify, challenge and validate restrictive markings.
    (5) Information provided by offerors in response to the solicitation 
provision may be used in the source selection process to evaluate the 
impact on evaluation factors that may be created by restrictions on the 
Government's ability to use or disclose technical data. However, 
offerors shall not be prohibited from offering products for which the 
offeror is entitled to provide the Government limited rights in the 
technical data pertaining to such products and offerors shall not be 
required, either as a condition of being responsive to a solicitation or 
as a condition for award, to sell or otherwise relinquish any greater 
rights in technical data when the offeror is entitled to provide the 
technical data with limited rights.
    (b) Contractor marking requirements. The clause at 252.227-7013, 
Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items--
    (1) Requires a contractor that desires to restrict the Government's 
rights in technical data to place restrictive markings on the data, 
provides instructions for the placement of the restrictive markings, and 
authorizes the use of certain restrictive markings; and
    (2) Requires a contractor to deliver, furnish, or otherwise provide 
to the Government any technical data in which the Government has 
previously obtained rights with the Government's pre-existing rights in 
that data unless the parties have agreed otherwise or restrictions on 
the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, 
display, or disclose the data have expired. When restrictions are still 
applicable, the contractor is permitted to mark the data with the 
appropriate restrictive legend for which the data qualified.
    (c) Unmarked technical data. (1) Technical data delivered or 
otherwise provided under a contract without restrictive markings shall 
be presumed to have been delivered with unlimited rights and may be 
released or disclosed without restriction. To the extent practicable, if 
a contractor has requested permission (see paragraph (c)(2) of this 
subsection) to correct an inadvertent omission of markings, do not 
release or disclose the technical data pending evaluation of the 
request.
    (2) A contractor may request permission to have appropriate legends 
placed on unmarked technical data at its expense. The request must be 
received by the contracting officer within six months following the 
furnishing or delivery of such data, or any extension of that time 
approved by the contracting officer. The person making the request must:
    (i) Identify the technical data that should have been marked;

[[Page 191]]

    (ii) Demonstrate that the omission of the marking was inadvertent, 
the proposed marking is justified and conforms with the requirements for 
the marking of technical data contained in the clause at 252.227-7013; 
and
    (iii) Acknowledge, in writing, that the Government has no liability 
with respect to any disclosure, reproduction, or use of the technical 
data made prior to the addition of the marking or resulting from the 
omission of the marking.
    (3) Contracting officers should grant permission to mark only if the 
technical data were not distributed outside the Government or were 
distributed outside the Government with restrictions on further use or 
disclosure.


<R05>
227.7103-11  Contractor procedures and records.

    (a) The clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data--
Noncommercial Items, requires a contractor, and its subcontractors or 
suppliers that will deliver technical data with other than unlimited 
rights, to establish and follow written procedures to assure that 
restrictive markings are used only when authorized and to maintain 
records to justify the validity of asserted restrictions on delivered 
data.
    (b) The clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings 
on Technical Data requires contractors and their subcontractors at any 
tier to maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of 
restrictive markings on technical data delivered or to be delivered 
under a Government contract.


<R05>
227.7103-12  Government right to establish conformity of markings.

    (a) Nonconforming markings. (1) Authorized markings are identified 
in the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial 
Items. All other markings are nonconforming markings. An authorized 
marking that is not in the form, or differs in substance, from the 
marking requirements in the clause at 252.227-7013 is also a 
nonconforming marking.
    (2) The correction of nonconforming markings on technical data is 
not subject to 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on 
Technical Data. To the extent practicable, the contracting officer 
should return technical data bearing nonconforming markings to the 
person who has placed the nonconforming markings on such data to provide 
that person an opportunity to correct or strike the nonconforming 
marking at that person's expense. If that person fails to correct the 
nonconformity and return the corrected data within 60 days following the 
person's receipt of the data, the contracting officer may correct or 
strike the nonconformity at that person's expense. When it is 
impracticable to return technical data for correction, contracting 
officers may unilaterally correct any nonconforming markings at 
Government expense. Prior to correction, the data may be used in 
accordance with the proper restrictive marking.
    (b) Unjustified markings. (1) An unjustified marking is an 
authorized marking that does not depict accurately restrictions 
applicable to the Government's use, modification, reproduction, release, 
performance, display, or disclosure of the marked technical data. For 
example, a limited rights legend placed on technical data pertaining to 
items, components, or processes that were developed under a Government 
contract either exclusively at Government expense or with mixed funding 
(situations under which the Government obtains unlimited or government 
purpose rights) is an unjustified marking.
    (2) Contracting officers have the right to review and challenge the 
validity of unjustified markings. However, at any time during 
performance of a contract and notwithstanding existence of a challenge, 
the contracting officer and the person who has asserted a restrictive 
marking may agree that the restrictive marking is not justified. Upon 
such agreement, the contracting officer may, at his or her election, 
either--
    (i) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at that person's 
expense; or
    (ii) Return the technical data to the person asserting the 
restriction for correction at that person's expense. If the data are 
returned and that person fails to correct or strike the unjustified 
restriction and return the corrected data to the contracting officer 
within 60 days following receipt of the data, the

[[Page 192]]

unjustified marking shall be corrected or stricken at that person's 
expense.


<R05>
227.7103-13  Government right to review, verify, challenge and validate asserted restrictions.

    (a) General. An offeror's assertion(s) of restrictions on the 
Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, or disclose 
technical data do not, by themselves, determine the extent of the 
Government's rights in the technical data. Under 10 U.S.C. 2321, the 
Government has the right to challenge asserted restrictions when there 
are reasonable grounds to question the validity of the assertion and 
continued adherence to the assertion would make it impractical to later 
procure competitively the item to which the data pertain.
    (b) Pre-award considerations. The challenge procedures required by 
10 U.S.C. 2321 could significantly delay awards under competitive 
procurements. Therefore, avoid challenging asserted restrictions prior 
to a competitive contract award unless resolution of the assertion is 
essential for successful completion of the procurement.
    (c) Challenge and validation. Contracting officers must have 
reasonable grounds to challenge the current validity of an asserted 
restriction. Before issuing a challenge to an asserted restriction, 
carefully consider all available information pertaining to the 
assertion. All challenges must be made in accordance with the provisions 
of the clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on 
Technical Data.
    (1) Challenge period. Asserted restrictions should be reviewed 
before acceptance of technical data deliverable under the contract. 
Assertions must be challenged within three years after final payment 
under the contract or three years after delivery of the data, whichever 
is later. However, restrictive markings may be challenged at any time if 
the technical data--
    (i) Are publicly available without restrictions;
    (ii) Have been provided to the United States without restriction; or
    (iii) Have been otherwise made available without restriction other 
than a release or disclosure resulting from the sale, transfer, or other 
assignment of interest in the technical data to another party or the 
sale or transfer of some or all of a business entity or its assets to 
another party.
    (2) Pre-challenge requests for information. (i) After consideration 
of the situation described in paragraph (c)(3) of this subsection, 
contracting officers may request the person asserting a restriction to 
furnish a written explanation of the facts and supporting documentation 
for the assertion in sufficient detail to enable the contracting officer 
to ascertain the basis of the restrictive markings. Additional 
supporting documentation may be requested when the explanation provided 
by the person making the assertion does not, in the contracting 
officer's opinion, establish the validity of the assertion.
    (ii) If the person asserting the restriction fails to respond to the 
contracting officer's request for information or additional supporting 
documentation, or if the information submitted or any other available 
information pertaining to the validity of a restrictive marking does not 
justify the asserted restriction, a challenge should be considered.
    (3)Transacting matters directly with subcontracts. The clause at 
252.227-7037 obtains the contractor's agreement that the Government may 
transact matters under the clause directly with a subcontractor, at any 
tier, without creating or implying privity of contract. Contracting 
officers should permit a subcontractor or supplier to transact challenge 
and validation matters directly with the Government when--
    (i) A subcontractor's or supplier's business interests in its 
technical data would be compromised if the data were disclosed to a 
higher tier contractor;
    (ii) There is reason to believe that the contractor will not respond 
in a timely manner to a challenge and an untimely response would 
jeopardize a subcontractor's or suppliers right to assert restrictions; 
or
    (iii) Requested to do so by a subcontractor or supplier.
    (4) Challenge notice. Do not issue a challenge notice unless there 
are reasonable grounds to question the validity of an assertion. 
Assertions may be

[[Page 193]]

challenged whether or not supporting documentation was requested from 
the person asserting the restriction. Challenge notices must be in 
writing and issued to the contractor or, after consideration of the 
situations described in paragraph (c)(3) of this subsection, the person 
asserting the restriction. The challenge notice must include the 
information in paragraph (e) of the clause at 252.227-7037.
    (5) Extension of response time. The contracting officer, at his or 
her discretion, may extend the time for response contained in a 
challenge notice, as appropriate, if the contractor submits a timely 
written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a 
response.
    (6) Contracting officer's final decision. Contracting officers must 
issue a final decision for each challenged assertion, whether or not the 
assertion has been justified.
    (i) A contracting officer's final decision that an assertion is not 
justified must be issued a soon as practicable following the failure of 
the person asserting the restriction to respond to the contracting 
officer's challenge within 60 days, or any extension to that time 
granted by the contracting officer.
    (ii) A contracting officer who, following a challenge and response 
by the person asserting the restriction, determines that an asserted 
restriction is justified, shall issue a final decision sustaining the 
validity of the asserted restriction. If the asserted restriction was 
made subsequent to submission of the contractor's offer, add the 
asserted restriction to the contract attachment.
    (iii) A contracting officer who determine that the validity of an 
asserted restriction has not been justified shall issue a contracting 
officer's final decision within the time frames prescribed in 252.227-
7037. As provided in paragraph (g) of that clause, the Government is 
obligated to continue to respect the asserted restrictions through final 
disposition of any appeal unless the agency head notifies the person 
asserting the restriction that urgent or compelling circumstances do not 
permit the Government to continue to respect the asserted restriction.
    (7) Multiple challenges to an asserted restriction. When more than 
one contracting officer challenges an asserted restriction, the 
contracting officer who made the earliest challenge is responsible for 
coordinating the Government challenges. That contracting officer shall 
consult with all other contracting officers making challenges, verify 
that all challenges apply to the same asserted restriction and, after 
consulting with the contractor, subcontractor, or supplier asserting the 
restriction, issue a schedule that provides that person a reasonable 
opportunity to respond to each challenge.
    (8) Validation. Only a contracting officer's final decision, or 
actions of an agency board of contract appeals or a court of competent 
jurisdiction, that sustain the validity of an asserted restriction 
constitute validation of the asserted restriction.


<R05>
227.7103-14  Conformity, acceptance, and warranty of technical data.

    (a) Statutory requirements. 10 U.S.C. 2320--
    (1) Provides for the establishment of remedies applicable to 
technical data found to be incomplete, inadequate, or not to satisfy the 
requirements of the contract concerning such data; and
    (2) Authorizes agency heads to withhold payments (or exercise such 
other remedies an agency head considers appropriate) during any period 
if the contractor does not meet the requirements of the contract 
pertaining to the delivery of technical data.
    (b) Conformity and acceptance. (1) Solicitations and contracts 
requiring the delivery of technical data shall specify the requirements 
the data must satisfy to be acceptable. Contracting officers, or their 
authorized representatives, are responsible for determining whether 
technical data tendered for acceptance conform to the contractual 
requirements.
    (2) The clause at 252.227-7030, Technical Data--Withholding of 
Payment, provides for withholding up to 10 percent of the contract price 
pending correction or replacement of the nonconforming technical data or 
negotiation of an equitable reduction in contract price. The amount 
subject to withholding may be expressed as a fixed

[[Page 194]]

dollar amount or as a percentage of the contract price. In either case, 
the amount shall be determined giving consideration to the relative 
value and importance of the data. For example--
    (i) When the sole purpose of a contract is to produce the data, the 
relative value of that data may be considerably higher than the value of 
data produced under a contract where the production of the data is a 
secondary objective; or
    (ii) When the Government will maintain or repair items, repair and 
maintenance data may have a considerably higher relative value than data 
that merely describe the item or provide performance characteristics.
    (3) Do not accept technical data that do not conform to the 
contractual requirements in all respects. Except for nonconforming 
restrictive markings (see paragraph (b)(4) of this subsection), 
correction or replacement of nonconforming data or an equitable 
reduction in contract price when correction or replacement of the 
nonconforming data is not practicable or is not in the Government's 
interests, shall be accomplished in accordance with--
    (i) The provisions of a contract clause providing for inspection and 
acceptance of deliverables and remedies for nonconforming deliverables; 
or
    (ii) The procedures at FAR 46.407(c) through (g), if the contract 
does not contain an inspection clause providing remedies for 
nonconforming deliverables.
    (4) Follow the procedures at 227.7103-12(a)(2) if nonconforming 
markings are the sole reason technical data fail to conform to 
contractual requirements. The clause at 252.227-7030 may be used to 
withhold an amount for payment, consistent with the terms of the clause, 
pending correction of the nonconforming markings.
    (c) Warranty. (1) The intended use of the technical data and the 
cost, if any, to obtain the warranty should be considered before 
deciding to obtain a data warranty (see FAR 46.703). The fact that a 
particular item, component, or process is or is not warranted is not a 
consideration in determining whether or not to obtain a warranty for the 
technical data that pertain to the item, component, or process. For 
example, a data warranty should be considered if the Government intends 
to repair or maintain an item and defective repair or maintenance data 
would impair the Government's effective use of the item or result in 
increased costs to the Government.
    (2) As prescribed in 246.710, use the clause at 252.246-7001, 
Warranty of Data, and its alternates, or a substantially similar clause 
when the Government needs a specific warranty of technical data.

<R05>
227.7103-15  Subcontractor rights in technical data.

    (a) 10 U.S.C. 2320 provides subcontractors at all tiers the same 
protection for their rights in data as is provided to prime contractors. 
The clauses at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial 
Items, and 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical 
Data, implement the statutory requirements.
    (b) 10 U.S.C. 2321 permits a subcontractor to transact directly with 
the Government matters relating to the validation of its asserted 
restrictions on the Government's rights to use or disclose technical 
data. The clause at 252.227-7037 obtains a contractor's agreement that 
the direct transaction of validation or challenge matters with 
subcontractors at any tier does not establish or imply privity of 
contract. When a subcontractor or supplier exercise its right to 
transact validation matters directly with the Government, contracting 
officers shall deal directly with such persons, as provided at 227.7103-
13(c)(3).
    (c) Require prime contractors whose contracts include the following 
clauses to include those clauses, without modification except for 
appropriate identification of the parties, in contracts with 
subcontractors or suppliers, at all tiers, who will be furnishing 
technical data for non-commercial items in response to a Government 
requirement:
    (1) 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items;

[[Page 195]]

    (2) 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of 
Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends;
    (3) 252.227-7028, Technical Data or Computer Software Previously 
Delivered to the Government; and
    (4) 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical 
Data.
    (d) Do not require contractors to have their subcontractors or 
suppliers at any tier relinquish rights in technical data to the 
contractor, a higher tier subcontractor, or to the Government, as a 
condition for award of any contract, subcontract, purchase order, or 
similar instrument except for the rights obtained by the Government 
under the Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items clause contained 
in the contractor's contract with the Government.

<R05>
227.7103-16  Providing technical data to foreign governments, foreign contractors, or international organizations.

    Technical data may be released or disclosed to foreign governments, 
foreign contractors, or international organizations only if release or 
disclosure is otherwise permitted both by Federal export controls and 
other national security laws or regulations. Subject to such laws and 
regulations, the Department of Defense--
    (a) May release or disclose technical data in which it has obtained 
unlimited rights to such foreign entities or authorize the use of such 
data by those entities; and
    (b) Shall not release or disclose technical data for which 
restrictions on use, release, or disclosure have been asserted to 
foreign entities, or authorize the use of technical data by those 
entities, unless the intended recipient is subject to the same 
provisions as included in the use and non-disclosure agreement at 
227.7103-7 and the requirements of the clause at 252.227-7103, Rights in 
Technical Data--Noncommercial Items, governing use, modification, 
reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of such data 
have been satisfied.


<R05>
227.7103-17  Overseas contracts with foreign sources.

    (a) The clause at 252.227-7032, Rights in Technical Data and 
Computer Software (Foreign), may be used in contracts with foreign 
contractors to be performed overseas, except Canadian purchases (see 
paragraph (c) of this subsection), in lieu of the clause at 252.227-
7013, Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items, when the Government 
requires the unrestricted right to use, modify, reproduce, perform, 
display, release or disclose all technical data to be delivered under 
the contract. Do not use the clause in contracts for existing or special 
works.
    (b) When the Government does not require unlimited rights, the 
clause at 252.227-7032 may be modified to accommodate the needs of a 
specific overseas procurement situation. The Government should obtain 
rights in the technical data that are not less than the rights the 
Government would have obtained under the data rights clause(s) 
prescribed in this part for a comparable procurement performed within 
the United States or its outlying areas.
    (c) Contracts for Canadian purchases shall include the appropriate 
data rights clause prescribed in this part for a comparable procurement 
performed within the United States or its outlying areas.

227.7104  Contracts under the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program.

    (a) Use the clause at 252.227-7018, Rights in Noncommercial 
Technical Data and Computer Software--Small Business Innovation Research 
(SBIR) Program, when technical data or computer software will be 
generated during performance of contracts under the SBIR program.
    (b) Under the clause at 252.227-7018, the Government obtains a 
royalty-free license to use technical data marked with an SBIR data 
rights legend only for government purposes during the period commencing 
with contract award and ending five years after completion of the 
project under which the data were generated. Upon expiration of the

[[Page 196]]

five-year restrictive license, the Government has unlimited rights in 
the SBIR data. During the license period, the Government may not release 
or disclose SBIR data to any person other than its support services 
contractors except--
    (1) For evaluational purposes;
    (2) As expressly permitted by the contractor; or
    (3) A use, release, or disclosure that is necessary for emergency 
repair or overhaul of items operated by the Government.
    (c) Do not make any release or disclosure permitted by paragraph (b) 
of this section unless, prior to release or disclosure, the intended 
recipient is subject to the use and nondisclosure agreement at 227.7103-
7.
    (d) Use the clause at 252.227-7018 with its Alternate I in research 
contracts when the contracting officer determines, in consultation with 
counsel, that public dissemination by the contractor would be--
    (1) In the interest of the Government; and
    (2) Facilitated by the Government relinquishing its right to publish 
the work for sale, or to have others publish the work for sale on behalf 
of the Government.
    (e) Use the following provision and clauses in SBIR solicitations 
and contracts that include the clause at 252.227-7018:
    (1) 252.227-7016, Rights in Bid or Proposal Information;

    (4) 252.227-7030, Technical Data--Withholding of Payment; and
    (5) 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical 
Data (paragraph (e) of the clause contains information that must be 
included in a challenge).
    (f) Use the following clauses and provision in SBIR solicitations 
and contracts in accordance with the guidance at 227.7103-6 (c) and (d):
    (1) 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of 
Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends; and
    (2) 252.227-7028, Technical Data or Computer Software Previously

227.7105  Contracts for the acquisition of existing works.


<R05>
227.7105-1  General.

    (a) Existing works include motion pictures, television recordings, 
video recordings, and other audiovisual works in any medium; sound 
recordings in any medium; musical, dramatic, and literary works; 
pantomimes and choreographic works; pictorial, graphic, and sculptural 
works; and works of a similar nature. Usually, these or similar works 
were not first created, developed, generated, originated, prepared, or 
produced under a Government contract. Therefore, the Government must 
obtain a license in the work if it intends to reproduce the work, 
distribute copies of the work, prepare derivative works, or perform or 
display the work publicly. When the Government is not responsible for 
the content of an existing work, it should require the copyright owner 
to indemnify the Government for liabilities that may arise out of the 
content, performance, use, or disclosure of such data.
    (b) Follow the procedures at 227.7106 for works which will be first 
created, developed, generated, originated, prepared, or produced under a 
Government contract and the Government needs to control distribution of 
the work or has a specific need to obtain indemnity for liabilities that 
may arise out of the creation, content, performance, use, or disclosure 
of the work or from libelous or other unlawful material contained in the 
work. Follow the procedures at 227.7103 when the Government does not 
need to control distribution of such works or obtain such indemnities.

Items, in solicitations and contracts exclusively for existing works 
when--
    (1) The existing works will be acquired without modification; and
    (2) The Government requires the right to reproduce, prepare 
derivative works, or publicly perform or display the existing works; or
    (3) The Government has a specific need to obtain indemnity for 
liabilities that may arise out of the content, performance, use, or 
disclosure of such data.
    (b) The clause at 252.227-7021 provides the Government, and others 
acting on its behalf, a paid-up, non-exclusive, irrevocable, world-wide 
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works and publicly perform or 
display the works called for by a contract and to authorize others to do 
so for government purposes.
    (c) A contract clause is not required to acquire existing works such 
as books, magazines and periodicals, in any storage or retrieval medium, 
when the Government will not reproduce the books, magazines or 
periodicals, or prepare derivative works.


<R05>
227.7105-3  Acquisition of modified existing works.

    Use the clause at 252.227-7020, Rights in Special Works, in 
solicitations and contracts for modified existing works in lieu of the 
clause at 252.227-7021, Rights in Data--Existing Works.


<R05>
227.7106  Contracts for special works.

    (a) Use the clause at 252.227-7020, Rights in Special Works, in 
solicitations and contracts where the Government has a specific need to 
control the distribution of works first produced, created, or generated 
in the performance of a contract and required to be delivered under that 
contract, including controlling distribution by obtaining an assignment 
of copyright, or a specific need to obtain indemnity for liabilities 
that may arise out of the creation, delivery, use, modification, 
reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of such 
works. Use the clause--
    (1) In lieu of the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical 
Data--Noncommercial Items, when the Government must own or control 
copyright in all works first produced, created, or generated and 
required to be delivered under a contract; or
    (2) In addition to the clause at 252.227-7013 when the Government 
must own or control copyright in a portion of a work first produced, 
created, or generated and required to be delivered under a contract. The 
specific portion in which the Government must own or control copyright 
must be identified in a special contract requirement.
    (b) Although the Government obtains an assignment of copyright and 
unlimited rights in a special work under the clause at 252.227-7020, the 
contractor retains use and disclosure rights in that work. If the 
Government needs to restrict a contractor's rights to use or disclose a 
special work, it must also negotiate a special license which 
specifically restricts the contractor's use or disclosure rights.
    (c) The clause at 252.227-7020 does not permit a contractor to 
incorporate into a special work any works copyrighted by others unless 
the contractor obtains the contracting officer's permission to do so and 
obtains for the Government a non-exclusive, paid up, world-wide license 
to make and distribute copies of that work, to prepare derivative works, 
to perform or display publicly any portion of the work, and to permit 
others to do so for government purposes. Grant permission only when the 
Government's requirements cannot be satisfied unless the third party 
work is included in the deliverable work.
    (d) Examples of works which may be procured under the Rights in 
Special Works clause include, but are not limited, to audiovisual works, 
computer data bases, computer software documentation, scripts, 
soundtracks, musical compositions, and adaptations; histories of 
departments, agencies, services or units thereof; surveys of Government 
establishments; instructional works or guidance to Government officers 
and employees on the discharge of their official duties; reports, books, 
studies, surveys or similar documents; collections of data containing 
information pertaining to individuals that, if disclosed, would violate 
the right of privacy or publicity of the individuals to whom the 
information relates; or investigative reports.

    (6) Indemnify the Government from any liability to data owners or 
licensors resulting from, or as a consequence of, a release or 
disclosure of technical data made by the data repository contractor or 
its officers, employees, agents, or representatives.
    (b) If the contractor is or will be the data repository manager, the 
contractor's data management and distribution responsibilities must be 
identified in the contract or the contract must reference the agreement 
between the Government and the contractor that establishes those 
responsibilities.
    (c) If the contractor is not and will not be the data repository 
manager, do not require a contractor or subcontractor to deliver 
technical data marked with limited rights legends to a data repository 
managed by another contractor unless the contractor or subcontractor who 
has asserted limited rights agrees to release the data to the

[[Page 199]]

repository or has authorized, in writing, the Government to do so.
    (d) Repository procedures may provide for the acceptance, delivery, 
and subsequent distribution of technical data in storage media other 
than paper, including direct electronic exchange of data between two 
computers. The procedures must provide for the identification of any 
portions of the data provided with restrictive legends, when 
appropriate. The acceptance criteria must be consistent with the 
authorized delivery format.

[60 FR 33471, June 28, 1995 as amended at 72 FR 51189, Sept. 6, 2007]


<R05>
227.7203-2  Acquisition of noncommercial computer software and computer software documentation.

    (a) Contracting officers shall work closely with data managers and 
requirements personnel to assure that computer software and computer 
software documentation requirements included in solicitations are 
consistent with the policy expressed in 227.7203-1.
    (b)(1) Data managers or other requirements personnel are responsible 
for identifying the Government's minimum needs. In addition to desired 
software performance, compatibility, or other technical considerations, 
needs determinations should consider such factors as multiple site or 
shared use requirements, whether the Government's software maintenance 
philosophy will require the right to modify or have third parties modify 
the software, and any special computer software documentation 
requirements.
    (2) When reviewing offers received in response to a solicitation or 
other request for computer software or computer software documentation, 
data managers must balance the original assessment of the Government's 
needs with prices offered.
    (c) Contracting officers are responsible for ensuring that, wherever 
practicable, solicitations and contracts--
    (1) Identify the types of computer software and the quantity of 
computer programs and computer software documentation to be delivered, 
any requirements for multiple users at one site or

[[Page 201]]

multiple site licenses, and the format and media in which the software 
or documentation will be delivered;
    (2) Establish each type of computer software or computer software 
documentation to be delivered as a separate contract line item (this 
requirement may be satisfied by an exhibit to the contract);
    (3) Identify the prices established for each separately priced 
deliverable item of computer software or computer software documentation 
under a fixed-price type contract;
    (4) Include delivery schedules and acceptance criteria for each 
deliverable item; and
    (5) Specifically identify the place of delivery for each deliverable 
item.


<R05>
227.7203-3  Early identification of computer software or computer software documentation to be furnished to the Government with restrictions on use, 
          reproduction or disclosure.

    (a) Use the provision at 252.227-7017, Identification and Assertion 
of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions, in all solicitation that 
include the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer 
Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation. The 
provision requires offerors to identify any computer software or 
computer software documentation for which restrictions, other than 
copyright, on use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, 
display, or disclosure are asserted and to attach the identification and 
assertion to the offer.
    (b) Subsequent to contract award, the clause at 252.227-7014 permits 
a contractor, under certain conditions, to make additional assertions of 
restrictions. The prescriptions for the use of that clause and its 
alternates are at 227.7203-6(a).


<R05>
227.7203-4  License rights.

    (a) Grant of license. The Government obtains rights in computer 
software or computer software documentation, including a copyright 
license, under an irrevocable license granted or obtained by the 
contractor which developed the software or documentation or the licensor 
of the software or documentation if the development contractor is not 
the licensor. The contractor or licensor retains all rights in the 
software or documentation not granted to the Government. The scope of a 
computer software license is generally determined by the source of funds 
used to develop the software. Contractors or licensors may, with some 
exceptions, restrict the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, 
release, perform, display, or disclose computer software developed 
exclusively or partially at private expense (see 227.7203-5 (b) and 
(c)). They may not, without the Government's agreement (see 227.7203-
5(d)), restrict the Government's rights in computer software developed 
exclusively with Government funds or in computer software documentation 
required to be delivered under a contract.
    (b) Source of funds determination. The determination of the source 
of funds used to develop computer software should be made at the lowest 
practicable segregable portion of the software or documentation (e.g., a 
software sub-routine that performs a specific function). Contractors may 
assert restricted rights in a segregable portion of computer software 
which otherwise qualifies for restricted rights under the clause at 
252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and 
Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation.


<R05>
227.7203-5  Government rights.

    The standard license rights in computer software that a licensor 
grants to the Government are unlimited rights, government purpose 
rights, or restricted rights. The standard license in computer software 
documentation conveys unlimited rights. Those rights are defined in the 
clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and 
Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation. In unusual situations, 
the standard rights may not satisfy the Government's needs or the 
Government may be willing to accept lesser rights in return for other 
consideration. In those cases, a special license may be negotiated. 
However, the licensor is not obligated to provide the Government greater 
rights and the contracting officer is not required to accept lesser 
rights

[[Page 202]]

than the rights provided in the standard grant of license. The 
situations under which a particular grant of license applies are 
enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection.
    (a) Unlimited rights. The Government obtains an unlimited rights 
license in--
    (1) Computer software developed exclusively with Government funds;
    (2) Computer software documentation required to be delivered under a 
Government contract;
    (3) Corrections or changes to computer software or computer software 
documentation furnished to the contractor by the Government;
    (4) Computer software or computer software documentation that is 
otherwise publicly available or has been released or disclosed by the 
contractor or subcontractor without restrictions on further use, release 
or disclosure other than a release or disclosure resulting from the 
sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the software to 
another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business 
entity or it assets to another party;
    (5) Computer software or computer software documentation obtained 
with unlimited rights under another Government contract or as a result 
of negotiations; or
    (6) Computer software or computer software documentation furnished 
to the Government, under a Government contract or subcontract with--
    (i) Restricted rights in computer software, limited rights in 
technical data, or government purpose license rights and the restrictive 
conditions have expired; or
    (ii) Government purpose rights and the contractor's exclusive right 
to use such software or documentation for commercial purposes has 
expired.
    (b) Government purpose rights. (1) Except as provided in paragraph 
(a) of this subsection, the Government obtains government purpose rights 
in computer software developed with mixed funding.
    (2) The period during which government purpose rights are effective 
is negotiable. The clause at 252.227-7014 provides a nominal five-year 
period. Either party may request a different period. Changes to the 
government purpose rights period may be made at any time prior to 
delivery of the software without consideration from either party. Longer 
periods should be negotiated when a five-year period does not provide 
sufficient time to commercialize the software or, for software developed 
by subcontractors, when necessary to recognize the subcontractors' 
interests in the software.
    (3) The government purpose rights period commences upon execution of 
the contract, subcontract, letter contract (or similar contractual 
instrument), contract modification, or option exercise that required 
development of the computer software. Upon expiration of the government 
purpose rights period, the Government has unlimited rights in the 
software including the right to authorize others to use data for 
commercial purposes.
    (4) During the government purpose rights period, the Government may 
not use, or authorize other persons to use, computer software marked 
with government purpose rights legends for commercial purposes. The 
Government shall not release or disclose, or authorize others to release 
or disclose, computer software in which it has government purpose rights 
to any person unless--
    (i) Prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is 
subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7; or
    (ii) The intended recipient is a Government contractor receiving 
access to the software for performance of a Government contract that 
contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or 
Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive 
Legends.
    (5) When computer software marked with government purpose rights 
legends will be released or disclosed to a Government contractor 
performing a contract that does not include the clause at 252.227-7025, 
the contract may be modified, prior to release or disclosure, to include 
such clause in lieu of requiring the contractor to complete a use and 
non-disclosure agreement.
    (6) Contracting activities shall establish procedures to assure that 
computer software or computer software

[[Page 203]]

documentation marked with government purpose rights legends are released 
or disclosed, including a release or disclosure through a Government 
solicitation, only to persons subject to the use and non-disclosure 
restrictions. Public announcements in the Commerce Business Daily or 
other publications must provide notice of the use and non-disclosure 
requirements. Class use and non-disclosure agreements (e.g., agreements 
covering all solicitations received by the XYZ company within a 
reasonable period) are authorized and may be obtained at any time prior 
to release or disclosure of the government purpose rights software or 
documentation. Documents transmitting government purpose rights software 
or documentation to persons under class agreements shall identify the 
specific software or documentation subject to government purpose rights 
and the class agreement under which such software or documentation are 
provided.
    (c) Restricted rights. (1) The Government obtains restricted rights 
in noncommercial computer software required to be delivered or otherwise 
provided to the Government under a contract that were developed 
exclusively at private expense.
    (2) Contractors are not required to provide the Government 
additional rights in computer software delivered or otherwise provided 
to the Government with restricted rights. When the Government has a need 
for additional rights, the Government must negotiate with the contractor 
to determine if there are acceptable terms for transferring such rights. 
List or describe all software in which the contractor has granted the 
Government additional rights in a license agreement made part of the 
contract (see paragraph (d) of this subsection). The license shall 
enumerate the specific additional rights granted to the Government.
    (d) Specifically negotiated license rights. Negotiate specific 
licenses when the parties agree to modify the standard license rights 
granted to the Government or when the Government wants to obtain rights 
in computer software in which it does not have rights. When negotiating 
to obtain, relinquish, or increase the Government's rights in computer 
software, consider the planned software maintenance philosophy, 
anticipated time or user sharing requirements, and other factors which 
may have relevance for a particular procurement. If negotiating to 
relinquish rights in computer software documentation, consider the 
administrative burden associated with protecting documentation subject 
to restrictions from unauthorized release or disclosure. The negotiated 
license rights must stipulate the rights granted the Government to use, 
modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose the software 
or documentation and the extent to which the Government may authorize 
others to do so. Identify all negotiated rights in a license agreement 
made part of the contract.
    (e) Rights in derivative computer software or computer software 
documentation. The clause at 252.227-7014 protects the Government's 
rights in computer software, computer software documentation, or 
portions thereof that the contractor subsequently uses to prepare 
derivative software or subsequently embeds or includes in other software 
or documentation. The Government retains the rights it obtained under 
the development contract in the unmodified portions of the derivative 
software or documentation.


<R05>
227.7203-6  Contract clauses.

    (a)(1) Use the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial 
Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation, in 
solicitations and contracts when the successful offeror(s) will be 
required to deliver computer software or computer software 
documentation. Do not use the clause when the only deliverable items are 
technical data (other than computer software documentation), commercial 
computer software or commercial computer software documentation, 
commercial items (see 227.7102-3), special works (see 227.7205), or 
contracts under the Small Business Innovative Research Program (see 
227.7104), Except as provided in 227.7107-2, do not use the clause in 
architect-engineer and construction contracts.
    (2) Use the clause at 252.227-7014 with its Alternate I in research 
contracts

[[Page 204]]

when the contracting officer determines, in consultation with counsel, 
that public dissemination by the contractor would be--
    (i) In the interest of the Government; and
    (ii) Facilitated by the Government relinquishing its right to 
publish the work for sale, or to have others publish the work for sale 
on behalf of the Government.
    (b) Use the clause at 252.227-7016, Rights in Bid or Proposal 
Information, in solicitations and contracts that include the clause at 
252.227-7014.
    (c) Use the clause at 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted 
Restrictions--Computer Software, in solicitations and contracts that 
include the clause at 252.227-7014. The clause provides procedures for 
the validation of asserted restrictions on the Government's rights to 
use, release, or disclose computer software.
    (d) Use the provision at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or 
Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive 
Legends, in solicitations and contracts when it is anticipated that the 
Government will provide the contractor, for performance of its contract, 
computer software or computer software documentation marked with another 
contractor's restrictive legend(s).
    (e) Use the provision at 252.227-7028, Technical Data or Computer 
Software Previously Delivered to the Government, in solicitations when 
the resulting contract will require the contractor to deliver computer 
software or computer software documentation. The provision requires 
offerors to identify any software or documentation specified in the 
solicitation as deliverable items that are the same or substantially the 
same as software or documentation which the offeror has delivered or is 
obligated to deliver, either as a contractor or subcontractor, under any 
other federal agency contract.
    (f) Use the clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive 
Markings on Technical Data, in solicitations and contracts that include 
the clause at 252.227-7014 when the contractor will be required to 
deliver noncommercial computer software documentation (technical data). 
The clause implements statutory requirements under 10 U.S.C. 2321. 
Paragraph (e) of the clause contains information that must be included 
in a formal challenge.


<R05>
227.7203-7  [Reserved]


<R05>
227.7203-8  Deferred delivery and deferred ordering of computer software and computer software documentation.

    (a) Deferred delivery. Use the clause at 252.227-7026, Deferred 
Delivery of Technical Data or Computer Software, when it is in the 
Government's interests to defer the delivery of computer software or 
computer software documentation. The clause permits the contracting 
officer to require the delivery of data identified as ``deferred 
delivery'' data or computer software at any time until two years after 
acceptance by the Government of all items (other than technical data or 
computer software) under the contract or contract termination, whichever 
is later. The obligation of subcontractors or suppliers to deliver such 
data expires two years after the date the prime contractor accepts the 
last item from the subcontractor or supplier for use in the performance 
of the contract. The contract must specify the computer software or 
computer software documentation that is subject to deferred delivery. 
The contracting officer shall notify the contractor sufficiently in 
advance of the desired delivery date for such software or documentation 
to permit timely delivery.
    (b) Deferred ordering. Use the clause at 252.227-7027, Deferred 
Ordering of Technical Data or Computer Software, when a firm requirement 
for software or documentation has not been established prior to contract 
award but there is a potential need for computer software or computer 
software documentation. Under this clause the contracting officer may 
order any computer software or computer software documentation generated 
in the performance of the contract or any subcontract thereunder at any 
time until three years after acceptance of all items (other than 
technical data or computer software) under the contract or contract 
termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors to 
deliver such technical data or computer software expires three years 
after

[[Page 205]]

the date the contractor accepts the last item under the subcontract. 
When the software or documentation are ordered, the delivery dates shall 
be negotiated and the contractor compensated only for converting the 
software or documentation into the prescribed form, reproduction costs, 
and delivery costs.


<R05>
227.7203-9  Copyright.

    (a) Copyright license. (1) The clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in 
Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software 
Documentation, requires a contractor to grant, or obtain for the 
Government license rights which permit the Government to reproduce the 
software or documentation, distribute copies, perform or display the 
software or documentation and, through the right to modify data, prepare 
derivative works. The extent to which the Government, and others acting 
on its behalf, may exercise these rights varies for each of the standard 
data rights licenses obtained under the clause. When non-standard 
license rights in computer software or computer software documentation 
will be negotiated, negotiate the extent of the copyright license 
concurrent with negotiations for the data rights license. Do not 
negotiate copyright licenses for computer software that provide less 
rights than the standard restricted rights in computer software license. 
For computer software documentation, do not negotiate a copyright 
license that provides less rights than the standard limited rights in 
technical data license.
    (2) The clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data--
Noncommercial Items, does not permit a contractor to incorporate a third 
party's copyrighted software into a deliverable software item unless the 
contractor has obtained an appropriate license for the Government and, 
when applicable, others acting on the Government's behalf, or has 
obtained the contracting officer's written approval to do so. Grant 
approval to use third party copyrighted software in which the Government 
will not receive a copyright license only when the Government's 
requirements cannot be satisfied without the third party material or 
when the use of the third party material will result in cost savings to 
the Government which outweigh the lack of a copyright license.
    (b) Copyright considerations--special works. See 227.7205 for 
copyright considerations when acquiring special works.


<R05>
227.7203-10  Contractor identification and marking of computer software or computer software documentation to be furnished with restrictive markings.

    (a) Identification requirements. (1) The solicitation provision at 
252.227-7017, Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or 
Disclosure Restrictions, requires offerors to identify, prior to 
contract award, any computer software or computer software documentation 
that an offeror asserts should be provided to the Government with 
restrictions on use, modification, reproduction, release, or disclosure. 
This requirement does not apply to restrictions based solely on 
copyright. The notification and identification must be submitted as an 
attachment to the offer. If an offeror fails to submit the attachment or 
fails to complete the attachment in accordance with the requirements of 
the solicitation provision, such failure shall constitute a minor 
informality. Provide offerors an opportunity to remedy a minor 
informality in accordance with the procedures at FAR 14.405 or 
15.306(a). An offeror's failure to correct an informality within the 
time prescribed by the contracting officer shall render the offer 
ineligible for award.
    (2) The procedures for correcting minor informalities shall not be 
used to obtain information regarding asserted restrictions or an 
offeror's suggested asserted rights category. Questions regarding the 
justification for an asserted restriction or asserted rights category 
must be pursued in accordance with the procedures at 227.7203-13.
    (3) The restrictions asserted by a successful offeror shall be 
attached to its contract unless, in accordance with the procedures at 
227.7203-13, the parties have agreed that an asserted restriction is not 
justified. The contract attachment shall provide the same information 
regarding identification of the computer software or computer software 
documentation, the asserted

[[Page 206]]

rights category, the basis for the assertion, and the name of the person 
asserting the restrictions as required by paragraph (d) of the 
solicitation provision at 252.227-7017. Subsequent to contract award, 
the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software 
and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation, permits a contractor 
to make additional assertions under certain conditions. The additional 
assertions must be made in accordance with the procedures and in the 
format prescribed by that clause.
    (4) Neither the pre- or post-award assertions made by the contractor 
nor the fact that certain assertions are identified in the attachment to 
the contract, determine the respective rights of the parties. As 
provided at 227.7203-13, the Government has the right to review, verify, 
challenge and validate restrictive markings.
    (5) Information provided by offerors in response to the solicitation 
provision at 252.227-7017 may be used in the source selection process to 
evaluate the impact on evaluation factors that may be created by 
restrictions on the Government's ability to use or disclose computer 
software or computer software documentation.
    (b) Contractor marking requirements. The clause at 252.227-7014, 
Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer 
Software Documentation--
    (1) Requires a contractor who desires to restrict the Government's 
rights in computer software or computer software documentation to place 
restrictive markings on the software or documentation, provides 
instructions for the placement of the restrictive markings, and 
authorizes the use of certain restrictive markings. When it is 
anticipated that the software will or may be used in combat or 
situations which simulate combat conditions, do not permit contractors 
to insert instructions into computer programs that interfere with or 
delay operation of the software to display a restrictive rights legend 
or other license notice; and
    (2) Requires a contractor to deliver, furnish, or otherwise provide 
to the Government any computer software or computer software 
documentation in which the Government has previously obtained rights 
with the Government's pre-existing rights in that software or 
documentation unless the parties have agreed otherwise or restrictions 
on the Government's rights to use, modify, produce, release, or disclose 
the software or documentation have expired. When restrictions are still 
applicable, the contractor is permitted to mark the software or 
documentation with the appropriate restrictive legend.
    (c) Unmarked computer software or computer software documentation. 
(1) Computer software or computer software documentation delivered or 
otherwise provided under a contract without restrictive markings shall 
be presumed to have been delivered with unlimited rights and may be 
released or disclosed without restriction. To the extent practicable, if 
a contractor has requested permission (see paragraph (c)(2) of this 
subsection) to correct an inadvertent omission of markings, do not 
release or disclose the software or documentation pending evaluation of 
the request.
    (2) A contractor may request permission to have appropriate legends 
placed on unmarked computer software or computer software documentation 
at its expense. The request must be received by the contracting officer 
within six months following the furnishing or delivery of such software 
or documentation, or any extension of that time approved by the 
contracting officer. The person making the request must--
    (i) Identify the software or documentation that should have been 
marked;
    (ii) Demonstrate that the omission of the marking was inadvertent, 
the proposed marking is justified and conforms with the requirements for 
the marking of computer software or computer software documentation 
contained in the clause at 252.227-7014; and
    (iii) Acknowledge, in writing, that the Government has no liability 
with respect to any disclosure, reproduction, or use of the software or 
documentation made prior to the addition of the marking or resulting 
from the omission of the marking.

[[Page 207]]

    (3) Contracting officers should grant permission to mark only if the 
software or documentation were not distributed outside the Government or 
were distributed outside the Government with restrictions on further use 
or disclosure.

[60 FR 33482, June 28, 1995, as amended at 63 FR 55052, Oct. 14, 1998]


<R05>
227.7203-11  Contractor procedures and records.

    (a) The clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer 
Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation, requires a 
contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver 
computer software or computer software documentation with other than 
unlimited rights, to establish and follow written procedures to assure 
that restrictive markings are used only when authorized and to maintain 
records to justify the validity of restrictive markings.
    (b) The clause at 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted 
Restrictions--Computer Software, requires contractors and their 
subcontractors or suppliers at any tier to maintain records sufficient 
to justify the validity of markings that assert restrictions on the use, 
modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure 
of computer software.


<R05>
227.7203-12  Government right to establish conformity of markings.

    (a) Nonconforming markings. (1) Authorized markings are identified 
in the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software 
and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation. All other markings 
are nonconforming markings. An authorized marking that is not in the 
form, or differs in substance, from the marking requirements in the 
clause at 252.227-7014 is also a nonconforming marking.
    (2) The correction of nonconforming markings on computer software is 
not subject to 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions--
Computer Software, and the correction of nonconforming markings on 
computer software documentation (technical data) is not subject to 
252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data. To 
the extent practicable, the contracting officer should return computer 
software or computer software documentation bearing nonconforming 
markings to the person who has placed the nonconforming markings on the 
software or documentation to provide that person an opportunity to 
correct or strike the nonconforming markings at that person's expense. 
If that person fails to correct the nonconformity and return the 
corrected software or documentation within 60 days following the 
person's receipt of the software or documentation, the contracting 
officer may correct or strike the nonconformity at the person's expense. 
When it is impracticable to return computer software or computer 
software documentation for correction, contracting officers may 
unilaterally correct any nonconforming markings at Government expense. 
Prior to correction, the software or documentation may be used in 
accordance with the proper restrictive marking.
    (b) Unjustified markings. (1) An unjustified marking is an 
authorized marking that does not depict accurately restrictions 
applicable to the Government's use, modification, reproduction, release, 
or disclosure of the marked computer software or computer software 
documentation. For example, a restricted rights legend placed on 
computer software developed under a Government contract either 
exclusively at Government expense or with mixed funding (situations 
under which the Government obtains unlimited or government purpose 
rights) is an unjustified marking.
    (2) Contracting officers have the right to review and challenge the 
validity of unjustified markings. However, at any time during 
performance of a contract and notwithstanding existence of a challenge, 
the contracting officer and the person who has asserted a restrictive 
marking may agree that the restrictive marking is not justified. Upon 
such agreement, the contracting officer may, at his or her election, 
either--
    (i) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at that person's 
expense; or
    (ii) Return the computer software or computer software documentation 
to the person asserting the restriction for

[[Page 208]]

correction at that person's expense. If the software or documentation 
are returned and that person fails to correct or strike the unjustified 
restriction and return the corrected software or documentation to the 
contracting officer within 60 days following receipt of the software or 
documentation, the unjustified marking shall be corrected or stricken at 
that person's expense.


<R05>
227.7203-13  Government right to review, verify, challenge and validate asserted restrictions.

    (a) General. An offeror's or contractor's assertion(s) of 
restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, 
release, or disclose computer software or computer software 
documentation do not, by themselves, determine the extent of the 
Government's rights in such software or documentation. The Government 
may require an offeror or contractor to submit sufficient information to 
permit an evaluation of a particular asserted restriction and may 
challenge asserted restrictions when there are reasonable grounds to 
believe that an assertion is not valid.
    (b) Requests for information. Contracting officers should have a 
reason to suspect that an asserted restriction might not be correct 
prior to requesting information. When requesting information, provide 
the offeror or contractor the reason(s) for suspecting that an asserted 
restriction might not be correct. A need for additional license rights 
is not, by itself, a sufficient basis for requesting information 
concerning an asserted restriction. Follow the procedures at 227.7203-
5(d) when additional license rights are needed but there is no basis to 
suspect that an asserted restriction might not be valid.
    (c) Transacting matters directly with subcontractors. The clause at 
252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions--Computer Software, 
obtains the contractor's agreement that the Government may transact 
matters under the clause directly with a subcontractor or supplier, at 
any tier, without creating or implying privity of contract. Contracting 
officers should permit a subcontractor or supplier to transact challenge 
and validation matters directly with the Government when--
    (1) A subcontractor's or supplier's business interests in its 
technical data would be compromised if the data were disclosed to a 
higher tier contractor.
    (2) There is reason to believe that the contractor will not respond 
in a timely manner to a challenge and an untimely response would 
jeopardize a subcontractor's or supplier's right to assert restrictions; 
or
    (3) Requested to do so by a subcontractor or supplier.
    (d) Challenging asserted restrictions--(1) Pre-award considerations. 
The challenge procedures in the clause at 252.227-7019 could 
significantly delay competitive procurements. Therefore, avoid 
challenging asserted restrictions prior to a competitive contract award 
unless resolution of the assertion is essential for successful 
completion of the procurement.
    (2) Computer software documentation. Computer software documentation 
is technical data. Challenges to asserted restrictions on the 
Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, 
display, or disclose computer software documentation must be made in 
accordance with the clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive 
Markings on Technical Data, and the guidance at 227.7103-13. The 
procedures in the clause at 252.227-7037 implement requirements 
contained in 10 U.S.C. 2321. Resolution of questions regarding the 
validity of asserted restrictions using the process described at 
227.7103-12(b)(2) is strongly encouraged.
    (3) Computer software. (i) Asserted restrictions should be reviewed 
before acceptance of the computer software deliverable under a contract. 
The Government's right to challenge an assertion expires three years 
after final payment under the contract or three years after delivery of 
the software, whichever is later. Those limitations on the Government's 
challenge rights do not apply to software that is publicly available, 
has been furnished to the Government without restrictions, or has been 
otherwise made available without restrictions.
    (ii) Contracting officers must have reasonable grounds to challenge 
the

[[Page 209]]

current validity of an asserted restriction. Before challenging an 
asserted restriction, carefully consider all available information 
pertaining to the asserted restrictions. Resolution of questions 
regarding the validity of asserted restrictions using the process 
described at 227.7203-12(b)(2) is strongly encouraged. After 
consideration of the situations described in paragraph (c) of this 
subsection, contracting officers may request the person asserting a 
restriction to furnish a written explanation of the facts and supporting 
documentation for the assertion in sufficient detail to enable the 
contracting officer to determine the validity of the assertion. 
Additional supporting documentation may be requested when the 
explanation provided by that person does not, in the contracting 
officer's opinion, establish the validity of the assertion.
    (iii) Assertions may be challenged whether or not supporting 
documentation was requested. Challenges must be in writing and issued to 
the person asserting the restriction.
    (4) Extension of response time. The contracting officer, at his or 
her discretion, may extend the time for response contained in a 
challenge, as appropriate, if the contractor submits a timely written 
request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.
    (e) Validating or denying asserted restrictions. (1) Contracting 
officers must promptly issue a final decision denying or sustaining the 
validity of each challenged assertion unless the parties have agreed on 
the disposition of the assertion. When a final decision denying the 
validity of an asserted restriction is made following a timely response 
to a challenge, the Government is obligated to continue to respect the 
asserted restrictions through final disposition of any appeal unless the 
agency head notifies the person asserting the restriction that urgent or 
compelling circumstances do not permit the Government to continue to 
respect the asserted restriction. See 252.227-7019(g) for restrictions 
applicable following a determination of urgent and compelling 
circumstances.
    (2) Only a contracting officer's final decision, or actions of an 
agency Board of Contract Appeals or a court of competent jurisdiction, 
that sustain the validity of an asserted restriction constitute 
validation of the restriction.
    (f) Multiple challenges to an asserted restriction. When more than 
one contracting officer challenges an asserted restriction, the 
contracting officer who made the earliest challenge is responsible for 
coordinating the Government challenges. That contracting officer shall 
consult with all other contracting officers making challenges, verify 
that all challenges apply to the same asserted restriction and, after 
consulting with the contractor, subcontractor, or supplier asserting the 
restriction, issue a schedule that provides that person a reasonable 
opportunity to respond to each challenge.


<R05>
227.7203-14  Conformity, acceptance, and warranty of computer software and computer software documentation.

    (a) Computer software documentation. Computer software documentation 
is technical data. See 227.7103-14 for appropriate guidance and 
statutory requirements.
    (b) Computer software--(1) Conformity and acceptance. Solicitations 
and contracts requiring the delivery of computer software shall specify 
the requirements the software must satisfy to be acceptable. Contracting 
officers, or their authorized representatives, are responsible for 
determining whether computer software tendered for acceptance conforms 
to the contractual requirements. Except for nonconforming restrictive 
markings (follow the procedures at 227.7203-12(a) if nonconforming 
markings are the sole reason computer software tendered for acceptance 
fails to conform to contractual requirements), do not accept software 
that does not conform in all respects to applicable contractual 
requirements. Correction or replacement of nonconforming software, or an 
equitable reduction in contract price when correction or replacement of 
the nonconforming data is not practicable or is not in the Government's 
interests, shall be accomplished in accordance with--

[[Page 210]]

    (i) The provisions of a contract clause providing for inspection and 
acceptance of deliverables and remedies for nonconforming deliverables; 
or
    (ii) The procedures at FAR 46.407(c) through (g), if the contract 
does not contain an inspection clause providing remedies for 
nonconforming deliverables.
    (2) Warranties--(i) Weapon systems. Computer software that is a 
component of a weapon system or major subsystem should be warranted as 
part of the weapon system warranty. Follow the procedures at 246.770.
    (ii) Non-weapon systems. Approval of the chief of the contracting 
office must be obtained to use a computer software warranty other than a 
weapon system warranty. Consider the factors at FAR 46.703 in deciding 
whether to obtain a computer software warranty. When approval for a 
warranty has been obtained, the clause at 252.246-7001, Warranty of 
Data, and its alternates, may be appropriately modified for use with 
computer software or a procurement specific clause may be developed.


<R05>
227.7203-15  Subcontractor rights in computer software or computer software documentation.

    (a) Subcontractors and suppliers at all tiers should be provided the 
same protection for their rights in computer software or computer 
software documentation as are provided to prime contractors.
    (b) The clauses at 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted 
Restrictions--Computer Software, and 252.227-7037, Validation of 
Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, obtain a contractor's agreement 
that the Government's transaction of validation or challenge matters 
directly with subcontractors at any tier does not establish or imply 
privity of contract. When a subcontractor or supplier exercises its 
right to transact validation matters directly with the Government, 
contracting officers shall deal directly with such persons, as provided 
at 227.7203-13(c) for computer software and 227.7103-13(c)(3) for 
computer software documentation (technical data).
    (c) Require prime contractors whose contracts include the following 
clauses to include those clauses, without modification except for 
appropriate identification of the parties, in contracts with 
subcontractors or suppliers who will be furnishing computer software in 
response to a Government requirement (see 227.7103-15(c) for clauses 
required when subcontractors or suppliers will be furnishing computer 
software documentation (technical data)):
    (1) 252.227.7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and 
Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation;
    (2) 252.227.7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions--Computer 
Software;
    (3) 252.227.7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government 
Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends; and
    (4) 252.227.7028, Technical Data or Computer Software Previously 
Delivered to the Government.
    (d) Do not require contractors to have their subcontractors or 
suppliers at any tier relinquish rights in technical data to the 
contractor, a higher tier subcontractor, or to the Government, as a 
condition for award of any contract, subcontract, purchase order, or 
similar instrument except for the rights obtained by the Government 
under the provisions of the Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software 
and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation clause contained in 
the contractor's contract with the Government.


<R05>
227.7203-16  Providing computer software or computer software documentation to foreign governments, foreign contractors, or international organizations.

    Computer software or computer software documentation may be released 
or disclosed to foreign governments, foreign contractors, or 
international organizations only if release or disclosure is otherwise 
permitted both by Federal export controls and other national security 
laws or regulations. Subject to such laws and regulations, the 
Department of Defense--
    (a) May release or disclose computer software or computer software 
documentation in which it has obtained unlimited rights to such foreign 
entities or authorize the use of such data by those entities; and

[[Page 211]]

    (b) Shall not release or disclose computer software or computer 
software documentation for which restrictions on use, release, or 
disclosure have been asserted to such foreign entities or authorize the 
use of such data by those entities, unless the intended recipient is 
subject to the same provisions as included in the use and non-disclosure 
agreement at 227.7103-7 and the requirements of the clause at 252.227-
7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial 
Computer Software Documentation, governing use, modification, 
reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of such data 
have been satisfied.


<R05>
227.7203-17  Overseas contracts with foreign sources.

    (a) The clause at 252.227-7032, Rights in Technical Data and 
Computer Software (Foreign), may be used in contracts with foreign 
contractors to be performed overseas, except Canadian purchases (see 
paragraph (c) of this subsection) in lieu of the clause at 252.227-7014, 
Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer 
Software Documentation, when the Government requires the unrestricted 
right to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose 
all computer software or computer software documentation to be delivered 
under the contract. Do not use the clause in contracts for special 
works.
    (b) When the Government does not require unlimited rights, the 
clause at 252.227-7032 may be modified to accommodate the needs of a 
specific overseas procurement situation. The Government should obtain 
rights to the computer software or computer software documentation that 
are not less than the rights the Government would have obtained under 
the software rights clause(s) prescribed in this part for a comparable 
procurement performed within the United States or its outlying areas.
    (c) Contracts for Canadian purchases shall include the appropriate 
software rights clause prescribed in this part for a comparable 
procurement performed within the United States or its outlying areas.

227.7204  Contracts under the Small Business Innovative Research Program.

    When contracting under the Small Business Innovative Research 
Program, follow the procedures at 227-7104.


<R05>
227.7205  Contracts for special works.

    (a) Use the clause at 252.227-7020, Rights in Special Works, in 
solicitations and contracts where the Government has a specific need to 
control the distribution of computer software or computer software 
documentation first produced, created, or generated in the performance 
of a contract and required to be delivered under that contract, 
including controlling distribution by obtaining an assignment of 
copyright, or a specific need to obtain indemnity for liabilities that 
may arise out of the creation, delivery, use, modification, 
reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of such 
software or documentation. Use the clause--
    (1) In lieu of the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial 
Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation, 
when the Government must own or control copyright in all computer 
software or computer software documentation first produced, created, or 
generated and required to be delivered under a contract; or
    (2) In addition to the clause at 252.227-7014 when the Government 
must own or control copyright in some of the computer software or 
computer software documentation first produced, created, or generated 
and required to be delivered under a contract. The specific software or 
documentation in which the Government must own or control copyright must 
be identified in a special contract requirement.
    (b) Although the Government obtains an assignment of copyright and 
unlimited rights in the computer software or computer software 
documentation delivered as a special work under the clause at 252.227-
7020, the contractor retains use and disclosure rights in that software 
or documentation. If the

[[Page 212]]

Government needs to restrict a contractor's rights to use or disclose a 
special work, it must also negotiate a special license which 
specifically restricts the contractor's use or disclosure rights.
    (c) The clause at 252.227-7020 does not permit a contractor to 
incorporate into a special work any work copyrighted by others unless 
the contractor obtains the contracting officer's permission to do so and 
obtains for the Government a non-exclusive, paid up, world-wide license 
to make and distribute copies of that work, to prepare derivative works, 
to perform or display any portion of that work, and to permit others to 
do so for government purposes. Grant permission only when the 
Government's requirements cannot be satisfied unless the third party 
work is included in the deliverable work.
    (d) Examples of other works which may be procured under the clause 
at 252.227-7020 include, but are not limited to, audiovisual works, 
scripts, soundtracks, musical compositions, and adaptations; histories 
of departments, agencies, services or units thereof; surveys of 
Government establishments; instructional works or guidance to Government 
officers and employees on the discharge of their official duties; 
reports, books, studies, surveys or similar documents; collections of 
data containing information pertaining to individuals that, if 
disclosed, would violate the right of privacy or publicity of the 
individuals to whom the information relates; or investigative reports.

<R05>
228.102-1  General.

    The requirement for performance and payment bonds is waived for 
cost-reimbursement contracts. However, for cost-type contracts with 
fixed-price construction subcontracts over $30,000, require the prime 
contractor to obtain from each of its construction subcontractors 
performance and payment protections in favor of the prime contractor as 
follows:
    (1) For fixed-price construction subcontracts over $30,000, but not 
exceeding $100,000, payment protection sufficient to pay labor and 
material costs, using any of the alternatives listed at FAR 28.102-
1(b)(1).
    (2) For fixed-price construction subcontracts over $100,000--
    (i) A payment bond sufficient to pay labor and material costs; and

[[Page 213]]

    (ii) A performance bond in an equal amount if available at no 
additional cost.

accrue to, and be for the exclusive use of, the obligee named in the 
bond;
    (b) In the event of default, the surety's liability on the 
performance bond is limited to the cost of completion of the contract 
work, less the balance of unexpended funds. Under no circumstances shall 
the liability exceed the penal sum of the bond;
    (c) The surety shall not be liable for indemnification or 
compensation of the obligee for loss or liability arising from personal 
injury or property damage, even if the injury or damage was caused by a 
breach of the bonded contract; and
    (d) Once it has taken action to meet its obligations under the bond, 
the surety is entitled to any indemnification and identical standard of 
liability to which the contractor was entitled under the contract or 
applicable laws and regulations.

231.205-18  Independent research and development and bid and proposal costs.

    (a) Definitions. As used in this subsection--
    (i) Covered contract means a DoD prime contract for an amount 
exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, except for a fixed-price 
contract without cost incentives. The term also includes a subcontract 
for an amount exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, except for 
a fixed-price subcontract without cost incentives under such a prime 
contract.
    (ii) Covered segment means a product division of the contractor that 
allocated more than $1,100,000 in independent research and development 
and bid and proposal (IR&D/B&P) costs to covered contracts during the 
preceding fiscal year. In the case of a contractor that has no product 
divisions, the term means that contractor as a whole. A product division 
of the contractor that allocated less than $1,100,000 in IR&D/B&P costs 
to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year is not subject to 
the limitations in paragraph (c) of this subsection.
    (iii) Major contractor means any contractor whose covered segments 
allocated a total of more than $11,000,000 in IR&D/B&P costs to covered 
contracts during the preceding fiscal year. For purposes of calculating 
the dollar threshold amounts to determine whether a contractor meets the 
definition of ``major contractor,'' do not include contractor segments 
allocating less than $1,100,000 of IR&D/B&P costs to covered contracts 
during the preceding fiscal year.
    (c) Allowability.
    (i) Departments/agencies shall not supplement this regulation in any 
way that limits IR&D/B&P cost allowability.
    (ii) See 225.7303-2(c) for allowability provisions affecting foreign 
military sale contracts.
    (iii) For major contractors, the following limitations apply:
    (A) The amount of IR&D/B&P costs allowable under DoD contracts shall 
not exceed the lesser of--
    (1) Such contracts' allocable share of total incurred IR&D/B&O 
costs; or
    (2) The amount of incurred IR&D/B&P costs for projects having 
potential interest to DoD.
    (B) Allowable IR&D/B&P costs are limited to those for projects that 
are of potential interest to DoD, including activities intended to 
accomplish any of the following:
    (1) Enable superior performance of future U.S. weapon systems and 
components.

231.205-22  Legislative lobbying costs.

    (a) Costs associated with preparing any material, report, list, or 
analysis on the actual or projected economic or employment impact in a 
particular State or congressional district of an acquisition program for 
which all research, development, testing, and evaluation has not been 
completed also are unallowable (10 U.S.C. 2249).

[69 FR 63332, Nov. 1, 2004]


<R05>
231.205-70  External restructuring costs.

    (a) Scope. This subsection--
    (1) Prescribes policies and procedures for allowing contractor 
external restructuring costs when savings would result for DoD; and
    (2) Implements 10 U.S.C. 2325.
    (b) Definitions. As used in this subsection:
    (1) Business combination means a transaction whereby assets or 
operations of two or more companies not previously under common 
ownership or control are combined, whether by merger, acquisition, or 
sale/purchase of assets.
    (2) External restructuring activities means restructuring activities 
occurring after a business combination that affect the operations of 
companies not previously under common ownership or control. They do not 
include restructuring activities occurring after a business combination 
that affect the operations of only one of the companies not previously 
under common ownership or control, or, when there has been no business 
combination, restructuring activities undertaken within one company. 
External restructuring activities are a direct outgrowth of a business 
combination. They normally will be initiated within 3 years of the 
business combination.
    (3) Restructuring activities means nonroutine, nonrecurring, or 
extraordinary activities to combine facilities, operations, or 
workforce, in order to eliminate redundant capabilities, improve future 
operations, and reduce overall costs. Restructuring activities do not 
include routine or ongoing repositionings and redeployments of a 
contractor's productive facilities or workforce (e.g., normal plant 
rearrangement or employee relocation), nor do they include other routine 
or ordinary activities charged as indirect costs that would otherwise 
have been incurred (e.g., planning and analysis, contract administration 
and oversight, or recurring financial and administrative support).
    (4) Restructuring costs means the costs, including both direct and 
indirect, of restructuring activities. Restructuring costs that may be 
allowed include, but are not limited to, severance pay for employees, 
early retirement incentive payments for employees, employee retraining 
costs, relocation expense for retained employees, and relocation and 
rearrangement of plant and equipment. For purposes of this definition, 
if restructuring costs associated with external restructuring activities 
allocated to DoD contracts are less than $2.5 million, the costs shall 
not be subject to the audit, review, and determination requirements of 
paragraph (c)(4) of this subsection; instead, the normal rules for 
determining cost allowability in accordance with FAR part 31 shall 
apply.
    (5) Restructuring savings means cost reductions, including both 
direct and indirect cost reductions, that result from restructuring 
activities. Reassignments of cost to future periods are not 
restructuring savings.
    (c) Limitations on cost allowability. Restructuring costs associated 
with external restructuring activities shall not be allowed unless--
    (1) Such costs are allowable in accordance with FAR part 31 and 
DFARS part 231;
    (2) An audit of projected restructuring costs and restructuring 
savings is performed;

[[Page 220]]

    (3) The cognizant administrative contracting officer (ACO) reviews 
the audit report and the projected costs and projected savings, and 
negotiates an advance agreement in accordance with paragraph (d) of this 
subsection; and
    (4)(i) The official designated in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this 
subsection determines in writing that the audited projected savings, on 
a present value basis, for DoD resulting from the restructuring will 
exceed either--
    (A) The costs allowed by a factor of at least two to one; or
    (B) The costs allowed, and the business combination will result in 
the preservation of a critical capability that might otherwise be lost 
to DoD.
    (ii)(A) If the amount of restructuring costs is expected to exceed 
$25 million over a 5-year period, the designated official is the Under 
Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) or the 
Principal Deputy. This authority may not be delegated below the level of 
an Assistant Secretary of Defense.
    (B) For all other cases, the designated official is the Director of 
the Defense Contract Management Agency. The Director may not delegate 
this authority.
    (d) Procedures and ACO responsibilities. As soon as it is known that 
the contractor will incur restructuring costs for external restructuring 
activities, the cognizant ACO shall follow the procedures at PGI 
231.205-70(d).
    (e) Information needed to obtain a determination. (1) The novation 
agreement (if one is required).
    (2) The contractor's restructuring proposal.
    (3) The proposed advance agreement.
    (4) The audit report.
    (5) Any other pertinent information.
    (6) The cognizant ACO's recommendation for a determination. This 
recommendation must clearly indicate one of the following, consistent 
with paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this subsection:
    (i) The audited projected savings for DoD will exceed the costs 
allowed by a factor of at least two to one on a present value basis.
    (ii) The business combination will result in the preservation of a 
critical capability that might otherwise be lost to DoD, and the audited 
projected savings for DoD will exceed the costs allowed on a present 
value basis.
    (f) Contracting officer responsibilities. (1) The contracting 
officer, in consultation with the cognizant ACO, should consider 
including a repricing clause in noncompetitive fixed-price contracts 
that are negotiated during the period between--
    (i) The time a business combination is announced; and
    (ii) The time the contractor's forward pricing rates are adjusted to 
reflect the impact of restructuring.
    (2) The decision to use a repricing clause will depend upon the 
particular circumstances involved, including--
    (i) When the restructuring will take place;
    (ii) When restructuring savings will begin to be realized;
    (iii) The contract performance period;
    (iv) Whether the contracting parties are able to make a reasonable 
estimate of the impact of restructuring on the contract; and
    (v) The size of the potential dollar impact of restructuring on the 
contract.
    (3) If the contracting officer decides to use a repricing clause, 
the clause must provide for a downward-only price adjustment to ensure 
that DoD receives its appropriate share of restructuring net savings.

          Subpart 231.3_Contracts With Educational Institutions


<R05>
231.303  Requirements.

    (1) Pursuant to section 841 of the National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Pub. L. 103-160), no limitation may be placed 
on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred by 
an institution of higher education under a DoD contract awarded on or 
after November 30, 1993, unless that same limitation is applied 
uniformly to all other organizations performing similar work under DoD 
contracts. The 26 percent limitation

[[Page 221]]

imposed on administrative indirect costs by OMB Circular No. A-21 shall 
not be applied to DoD contracts awarded on or after November 30, 1993, 
to institutions of higher education because the same limitation is not 
applied to other organizations performing similar work.
    (2) The cognizant administrative contracting officer may waive the 
prohibition in 231.303(1) if the governing body of the institution of 
higher education requests the waiver to simplify the institution's 
overall management of DoD cost reimbursements under DoD contracts.
    (3) Under 10 U.S.C. 2249, the costs cited in 231.205-22(a) are 
unallowable.

232.007  Contract financing payments.

    (a) DoD policy is to make contract financing payments as quickly as 
possible. Generally, the contracting officer shall insert the standard 
due dates of 7 days for progress payments, and 14 days for performance-
based payments and interim payments on cost-type contracts, in the 
appropriate paragraphs of the respective payment clauses. For interim 
payments on cost-reimbursement contracts for services, see 
232.906(a)(i).
    (b) The contracting officer should coordinate contract financing 
payment terms with offices that will be involved in the payment process 
to ensure that specified terms can be met. Where justified, the 
contracting officer may insert a due date greater than, but not less 
than, the standard. In determining payment terms, consider--
    (i) Geographical separation;
    (ii) Workload;
    (iii) Contractor ability to submit a proper request; and
    (iv) Other factors that could affect timing of payment.

administration of DoD contract financing, including DoD

[[Page 223]]

contract financing policies and important related procedures. Agency 
discretion under FAR part 32 is at the DoD level and is not delegated to 
the departments and agencies. Proposals by the departments and agencies, 
to exercise agency discretion, shall be submitted to OUSD(AT&L)DPAP.
    (b) Departments and agencies are responsible for their day-to-day 
contract financing operations. Refer specific cases involving financing 
policy or important procedural issues to OUSD(AT&L)DPAP for 
consideration through the department/agency Contract Finance Committee 
members (also see Subpart 201.4 for deviation request and approval 
procedures).

<R05>
232.072-1  Required financial reviews.

    The contracting officer shall perform a financial review when the 
contracting officer does not otherwise have sufficient information to 
make a positive determination of financial responsibility. In addition, 
the contracting officer shall consider performing a financial review--
    (a) Prior to award of a contract, when--
    (1) The contractor is on a list requiring preaward clearance or 
other special clearance before award;
    (2) The contractor is listed on the Consolidated List of Contractors 
Indebted to the Government (Hold-Up List), or is otherwise known to be 
indebted to the Government;
    (3) The contractor may receive Government assets such as contract 
financing payments or Government property;
    (4) The contractor is experiencing performance difficulties on other 
work; or
    (5) The contractor is a new company or a new supplier of the item.
    (b) At periodic intervals after award of a contract, when--
    (1) Any of the conditions in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(5) of 
this subsection are applicable; or
    (2) There is any other reason to question the contractor's ability 
to finance performance and completion of the contract.

[63 FR 11535, Mar. 9, 1998]


<R05>
232.072-2  Appropriate information.

    (a) The contracting officer shall obtain the type and depth of 
financial and other information that is required to establish a 
contractor's financial capability or disclose a contractor's financial 
condition. While the contracting officer should not request information 
that is not necessary for protection for the Government's interests, the 
contracting officer must insist upon obtaining the information that is 
necessary. The unwillingness or inability of a contractor to present 
reasonably requested information in a timely manner, especially 
information that a prudent business person would be expected to have and 
to use in the professional management of a business, may be a material 
fact in the determination of the contractor's responsibility and 
prospects for contract completion.
    (b) The contracting officer shall obtain the following information 
to the extent required to protect the Government's interest. In 
addition, if the contracting officer concludes that information not 
listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(10) of this subsection is 
required to comply with 232.072-1, that information should be requested. 
The information must be for the person(s) who are legally liable for 
contract performance. If the contractor is not a corporation, the 
contracting officer shall obtain the required information for each 
individual/joint venturer/partner:
    (1) Balance sheet and income statement--
    (i) For the current fiscal year (interim);

[[Page 224]]

    (ii) For the most recent fiscal year and, preferably, for the 2 
preceding fiscal years. These should be certified by an independent 
public accountant or by an appropriate officer of the firm; and
    (iii) Forecasted for each fiscal year for the remainder of the 
period of contract performance.
    (2) Summary history of the contractor and its principal managers, 
disclosing any previous insolvencies--corporate or personal, and 
describing its products or services.
    (3) Statement of all affiliations disclosing--
    (i) Material financial interests of the contractor;
    (ii) Material financial interests in the contractor;
    (iii) Material affiliations of owners, officers, directors, major 
stockholders; and
    (iv) The major stockholders if the contractor is not a widely-
traded, publicly-held corporation.
    (4) Statement of all forms of compensation to each officer, manager, 
partner, joint venturer, or proprietor, as appropriate--
    (i) Planned for the current year;
    (ii) Paid during the past 2 years; and
    (iii) Deferred to future periods.
    (5) Business base and forecast that--
    (i) Shows, by significant markets, existing contracts and 
outstanding offers, including those under negotiation; and
    (ii) Is reconcilable to indirect cost rate projections.
    (6) Cash forecast for the duration of the contract (see 232.072-3).
    (7) Financing arrangement information that discloses--
    (i) Availability of cash to finance contract performance;
    (ii) Contractor's exposure to financial crisis from creditor's 
demands;
    (iii) Degree to which credit security provisions could conflict with 
Government title terms under contract financing;
    (iv) Clearly stated confirmations of credit with no unacceptable 
qualifications;
    (v) Unambiguous written agreement by a creditor if credit 
arrangements include deferred trade payments or creditor subordinations/
repayment suspensions.
    (8) Statement of all state, local, and Federal tax accounts, 
including special mandatory contributions, e.g., environmental 
superfund.
    (9) Description and explanation of the financial effect of issues 
such as--
    (i) Leases, deferred purchase arrangements, or patent or royalty 
arrangements;
    (ii) Insurance, when relevant to the contract;
    (iii) Contemplated capital expenditures, changes in equity, or 
contractor debt load;
    (iv) Pending claims either by or against the contractor;
    (v) Contingent liabilities such as guarantees, litigation, 
environmental, or product liabilities;
    (vi) Validity of accounts receivable and actual value of inventory, 
as assets; and
    (vii) Status and aging of accounts payable.
    (10) Significant ratios such as--
    (i) Inventory to annual sales;
    (ii) Inventory to current assets;
    (iii) Liquid assets to current assets;
    (iv) Liquid assets to current liabilities;
    (v) Current assets to current liabilities; and
    (vi) Net worth to net debt.

[63 FR 11535, Mar. 9, 1998]


<R05>
232.072-3  Cash flow forecasts.

    (a) A contractor must be able to sustain a sufficient cash flow to 
perform the contract. When there is doubt regarding the sufficiency of a 
contractor's cash flow, the contracting officer should require the 
contractor to submit a cash flow forecast covering the duration of the 
contract.
    (b) A contractor's inability of refusal to prepare and provide cash 
flow forecasts or to reconcile actual cash flow with previous forecasts 
is a strong indicator of serious managerial deficiencies or potential 
contract cost or performance problems.
    (c) Single or one-time cash flow forecasts are of limited 
forecasting power. As such, they should be limited to preaward survey 
situations. Reliability of cash flow forecasts can be established only 
by comparing a series of previous actual cash flows with the

[[Page 225]]

corresponding forecasts and examining the causes of any differences.
    (d) Cash flow forecasts must--
    (1) Show the origin and use of all material amounts of cash within 
the entire business unit responsible for contract performance, period by 
period, for the length of the contract (or until the risk of a cash 
crisis ends); and
    (2) Provide an audit trail to the data and assumptions used to 
prepare it.
    (e) Cash flow forecasts can be no more reliable than the assumptions 
on which they are based. Most important of these assumptions are--
    (1) Estimated amounts and timing of purchases and payments for 
materials, parts, components, subassemblies, and services;
    (2) Estimated amounts and timing of payments of purchase or 
production of capital assets, test facilities, and tooling;
    (3) Amounts and timing of fixed cash charges such as debt 
installments, interest, rentals, taxes, and indirect costs;
    (4) Estimated amounts and timing of payments for projected labor, 
both direct and indirect;
    (5) Reasonableness of projected manufacturing and production 
schedules;
    (6) Estimated amounts and timing of billings to customers (including 
progress payments), and customer payments;
    (7) Estimated amounts and timing of cash receipts from lenders or 
other credit sources, and liquidation of loans; and
    (8) Estimated amount and timing of cash receipt from other sources.
    (f) The contracting officer should review the assumptions underlying 
the cash flow forecasts. In determining whether the assumptions are 
reasonable and realistic, the contracting officer should consult with--
    (1) The contractor;
    (2) Government personnel in the areas of finance, engineering, 
production, cost, and price analysis; or
    (3) Prospective supply, subcontract, and loan or credit sources.

<R05>
232.202-4  Security for Government financing.

    (a)(2) When determining whether an offeror's financial condition is 
adequate security, see 232.072-2 and 232.072-3 for guidance. It should 
be noted that an offeror's financial condition may be sufficient to make 
the contractor responsible for award purposes, but may not be adequate 
security for commercial contract financing.


<R05>
232.206  Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.

    (f) Prompt payment for commercial purchase payments. The contracting 
officer shall incorporate the following standard prompt payment terms 
for commercial item contract financing:
    (i) Commercial advance payments: The contractor entitlement date 
specified in the contract, or 30 days after receipt by the designated 
billing office of a proper request for payment, whichever is later.
    (ii) Commercial interim payments: The contractor entitlement date 
specified in the contract, or 14 days after receipt by the designated 
billing office of a proper request for payment, whichever is later. The 
prompt payment standards for commercial delivery payments shall be the 
same as specified in FAR Subpart 32.9 for invoice payments for the item 
delivered.
    (g) Installment payment financing for commercial items. Installment 
payment financing shall not be used for DoD contracts, unless market 
research has established that this form of contract financing is both 
appropriate and customary in the commercial marketplace. When 
installment payment financing is used, the contracting officer shall use 
the ceiling percentage of contract price that is customary in the 
particular marketplace (not to exceed the maximum rate established in 
FAR 52.232-30).

    (a) An advance payment pool agreement--
    (1) Is a means of financing the performance of more than one 
contract held by a single contractor;
    (2) Is especially convenient for the financing of cost-type 
contracts with nonprofit educational or research institutions for 
experimental or research and development work when several contracts 
require financing by advance payments. When appropriate, pooled advance 
payments may also be used to finance other types of contracts held by a 
single contractor; and
    (3) May be established--
    (i) Without regard to the number of appropriations involved;
    (ii) To finance contracts for one or more department(s) or 
contracting activity(ies); or
    (iii) In addition to any other advance payment pool agreement at a

set off any money due or to become due under the contract when the 
proceeds under the contract have been assigned in accordance with the 
Assignment of Claims provision of the contract. This determination was 
published in the Federal Register on June 11, 1996, as required by law. 
Nevertheless, if departments/agencies decide it is in the Government's

                      Subpart 232.9_Prompt Payment


<R05>
232.903  Responsibilities.

    DoD policy is to assist small disadvantaged business concerns by 
paying them as quickly as possible after invoices are received and 
before normal payment due dates established in the contract (see 
232.906(a)).

[70 FR 75413, Dec. 20, 2005]


<R05>
232.904  Determining payment due dates.

    (d) In most cases, Government acceptance or approval can occur 
within the 7-day constructive acceptance period specified in the FAR 
Prompt Payment clauses. Government payment of construction progress 
payments can, in most cases, be made within the 14-day period allowed by 
the Prompt Payment for Construction Contracts clause. While the 
contracting officer may specify a longer period because the period 
specified in the contract is not reasonable or practical, such change 
should be coordinated with the Government offices responsible for 
acceptance or approval and for payment. Reasons for specifying a longer 
period include but are not limited to: the nature of the work or 
supplies or services, inspection or testing requirements, shipping and 
acceptance terms, and resources available at the acceptance activity. A 
constructive acceptance period of less than the cited 7 or 14 days is 
not authorized.

for services in the clause at FAR 52.232-25, Prompt Payment, when using 
the clause with its Alternate I.
    (ii) The restrictions of FAR 32.906 prohibiting early payment do not 
apply to invoice payments made to small disadvantaged business concerns. 
However, contractors shall not be entitled to interest penalties if the 
Government fails to make early payment.

235.015-70  Special use allowances for research facilities acquired by educational institutions.

    (a) Definitions. As used in this subsection--
    (1) Research facility means--
    (i) Real property, other than land; and
    (ii) Includes structures, alterations, and improvements, acquired 
for the purpose of conducting scientific research under contracts with 
departments and agencies of the DoD.
    (2) Special use allowance means a negotiated direct or indirect 
allowance--
    (i) For construction or acquisition of buildings, structures, and 
real property, other than land; and
    (ii) Where the allowance is computed at an annual rate exceeding the 
rate which normally would be allowed under FAR subpart 31.3.
    (b) Policy. (1) Educational institutions are to furnish the 
facilities necessary to perform Defense contracts. FAR 31.3 governs how 
much the Government will reimburse the institution for the research 
programs. However, in extraordinary situations, the Government may give 
special use allowances to an educational institution when the 
institution is unable to provide the capital for new laboratories or 
expanded facilities needed for Defense contracts.
    (2) Decisions to provide a special use allowance must be made on a 
case-by-case basis, using the criteria in paragraph (c) of this 
subsection.
    (c) Authorization for special use allowance. The head of a 
contracting activity may approve special use allowances only when all of 
the following conditions are met--
    (1) The research facility is essential to the performance of DoD 
contracts;
    (2) Existing facilities, either Government or nongovernment, cannot 
meet program requirements practically or effectively;
    (3) The proposed agreement for special use allowances is a sound 
business arrangement;
    (4) The Government's furnishing of Government-owned facilities is 
undesirable or impractical; and
    (5) The proposed use of the research facility is to conduct 
essential Government research which requires the new or expanded 
facilities.
    (d) Application of the special use allowance. (1) In negotiating a 
special use allowance--
    (i) Compare the needs of DoD and of the institution for the research 
facility to determine the amount of the special use allowance;
    (ii) Consider rental costs for similar space in the area where the 
research facility is or will be located to establish the annual special 
use allowance;
    (iii) Do not include or allow--
    (A) The costs of land; or
    (B) Interest charges on capital;
    (iv) Do not include maintenance, utilities, or other operational 
costs;
    (v) The period of allowance generally will be--
    (A) At least ten years; or
    (B) A shorter period if the total amount to be allowed is less than 
the construction or acquisition cost for the research facility;
    (vi) Generally, provide for allocation of the special use allowance 
equitably among the Government contracts using the research facility;
    (vii) Special use allowances apply only in the years in which the 
Government has contracts in effect with the institution. However, if in 
any given year there is a reduced level of Government research effort 
which results in the special use allowance being excessive compared to 
the Government research funding, a separate special use

[[Page 239]]

allowance may be negotiated for that year;
    (viii) Special use allowances may be adjusted for the period before 
construction is complete if the facility is partially occupied and used 
for Government research during that period.
    (2) A special use allowance may be based on either total or partial 
cost of construction or acquisition of the research facility.
    (i) When based on total cost neither the normal use allowance nor 
depreciation will apply--
    (A) During the special use allowance period; and
    (B) After the educational institution has recovered the total 
construction or acquisition cost from the Government or other users.
    (ii) When based on partial cost, normal use allowance and 
depreciation--
    (A) Apply to the balance of costs during the special use allowance 
period to the extent negotiated in the special use allowance agreement; 
and
    (B) Do not apply after the special use allowance period, except for 
normal use allowance applied to the balance.
    (3) During the special use allowance period, the research facility--
    (i) Shall be available for Government research use on a priority 
basis over nongovernment use; and
    (ii) Cannot be put to any significant use other than that which 
justified the special use allowance, unless the head of the contracting 
activity, who approved the special use allowance, consents.
    (4) The Government will pay only an allocable share of the special 
use allowance when the institution makes any substantial use of the 
research facility for parties other than the Government during the 
period when the special use allowance is in effect.
    (5) In no event shall the institution be paid more than the 
acquisition costs.

regulations.
    (A) Generally, the D&F should authorize one contract at a time; 
however, an authorizing official may issue a blanket D&F for classes of 
contracts.
    (B) Prepare each D&F in accordance with FAR 1.7 and include a 
determination that--
    (1) The duties are of a temporary or intermittent nature;
    (2) Acquisition of the services is advantageous to the national 
defense;
    (3) DoD personnel with necessary skills are not available;

[[Page 248]]

    (4) Excepted appointment cannot be obtained;
    (5) A nonpersonal services contract is not practicable;
    (6) Statutory authority, 5 U.S.C. 3109 and other legislation, apply; 
and
    (7) Any other determination required by statues has been made.
    (ii) Personal services contracts for health care are authorized by 
10 U.S.C. 1091.
    (A) This authority may be used to acquire--
    (1) Direct health care services provided in medical treatment 
facilities;
    (2) Health care services at locations outside of medical treatment 
facilities (such as the provision of medical screening examinations at 
military entrance processing stations); and
    (3) Services of clinical counselors, family advocacy program staff, 
and victim's services representatives to members of the Armed Forces and 
covered beneficiaries who require such services, provided in medical

social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, and other comparable 
professionals who have advanced degrees in counseling or related 
academic disciplines and who meet all requirements for State licensure 
and board certification requirements, if any, within their fields of 
specialization.
    (B) Sources for personal services contracts with individuals under 
the authority of 10 U.S.C. 1091 shall be selected through the procedures

which individuals responding will be evaluated. The contracting officer 
shall solicit applicants through at least one local publication which 
serves the area of the facility. Acquisitions under this section for 
personal service contracts are exempt from the posting and synopsis 
requirements of FAR part 5.
    (F) The contracting officer shall provide the qualifications of 
individuals responding to the notice to the commander of the facility 
for evaluation and ranking in accordance with agency procedures. 
Individuals must be considered solely on the basis of the professional

qualifications of the requirement and the contracting officer must be 
able to make a determination that the price is fair and reasonable.
    (I) If a fair and reasonable price cannot be obtained from a 
qualified individual, the requirement should be canceled and acquired 
using procedures other than those set forth in this section.

Contractor shall promptly deliver to the Contracting Officer one copy of 
each catalog applicable to this agreement, and one copy of any 
subsequent revision.
    (b) The Government will request educational services under this 
agreement by a (insert type of request, such as, delivery order, 
official Government order, or other written communication). The (insert 
type of request, such as, delivery order, official Government order, or 
other written communication) will contain the number of this agreement 
and will designate as students at the Contractor's institution one or 
more Government-selected persons who have already been accepted for 
admission under the Contractor's usual admission standards.
    (c) All students under this agreement shall register in the same 
manner, be subject to the same academic regulations, and have the same 
privileges, including the use of all facilities and equipment as any 
other students enrolled in the institution.
    (d) Upon enrolling each student under this agreement, the Contractor 
shall, where the resident or nonresident status involves a difference in 
tuition or fees--
    (i) Determine the resident or nonresident status of the student;
    (ii) Notify the student and the Contracting Officer of the 
determination. If there is an appeal of the determination;
    (iii) If there is an appeal of the determination, process the appeal 
under the Contractor's standard procedures;
    (iv) Notify the student and Contracting Officer of the result; and
    (v) Make the determination a part of the student's permanent record.
    (e) The Contractor shall not furnish any instruction or other 
services to any student under this agreement before the effective date 
of a request for services in the form specified in paragraph (b) of this

publicly announces the revisions;
    (2) Applies the revisions uniformly to all students studying the 
same or similar curricula;
    (3) Provides the Contracting Officer notice of changes before their

[[Page 254]]

    (b) The Contractor shall not establish any tuition or fees which 
apply solely to students under this agreement.
    (c) If the Contractor regularly charges higher tuition and fees for 
nonresident students, the Contractor may charge the Government the

who are nonresidents. The Government shall not claim resident tuition 
and fees for any student solely on the basis of the student residing in 
the State as a consequence of enrollment under this agreement.
    (d) The Contractor shall charge the Government only the tuition and 
fees which relate directly to enrollment as a student. Tuition and fees 
may include--
    (i) Penalty fees for late registration or change of course caused by 
the Government;
    (ii) Mandatory health fees and health insurance charges; and
    (iii) Any flat rate charge applicable to all students registered for 
research that appears in the Contractor's publicly announced fee 
schedule.

    (i) Permit charges, such as vehicle registration or parking fees, 
unless specifically authorized in the request for service; and
    (ii) Any equipment, refundable deposits, or any items or services 
(such as computer time) related to student research.
    (f) Normally, the Contractor shall not directly charge individual 
students for application fees or any other fee chargeable to this 
agreement. However, if the Contractor's standard procedures require 
payment of any fee before the student is enrolled under this agreement, 
the Contractor may charge the student. When the Contractor receives 
payment from the Government, the Contractor shall fully reimburse the 
student.

applicable to the Contractor's school); and
    (v) A breakdown of charges for each student, including credit hours, 
tuition, application fee, and other fees. Provide a total for each 
student and a grand total for all students listed on the invoice.
    (h) If unforeseen events require additional charges that are 
otherwise payable under the Contractor's normal tuition and fee 
schedule, the Contractor may submit a supplemental invoice or make the 
adjustment on the next regular invoice under this agreement. The 
Contractor shall clearly identify and explain the supplemental invoice 
or the adjustment.
    (i) The Contractor shall apply any credits resulting from withdrawal 
of students, or from any other cause under its standard procedures, to 
subsequent invoices submitted under this agreement. Credits should 
appear on the first invoice submitted after the action resulting in the 
credits. If no subsequent invoice is submitted, the Contractor shall 
deliver to the Contracting Officer a check drawn to the order of the 
office designated for contract administration. The Contractor shall 
identify the reason for the credit and the applicable term dates in all 
cases.
    4. Withdrawal of students. (a) The Government may, at its option and 
at any time, withdraw financial support for any student by issuing 
official orders. The Government will furnish -------- copies of the 
orders to the Contractor within a reasonable time after publication.
    (b) The Contractor may request withdrawal by the Government of any 
student for academic or disciplinary reasons.
    (c) If withdrawal occurs before the end of a term, the Government 
will pay any tuition and fees due for the current term. The Contractor 
shall credit the Government with any charges eligible for refund under 
the Contractor's standard procedures for any students in effect on the 
date of withdrawal.
    (d) Withdrawal of students by the Government will not be the basis 
for any special charge or claim by the Contractor other than charges 
under the Contractor's standard procedures.
    5. Transcripts. Within a reasonable time after withdrawal of a 
student for any reason, or after graduation, the Contractor shall send 
to the Contracting Officer (or to an address supplied by the Contracting 
Officer) one copy of an official transcript showing all work by the 
student at the institution until such withdrawal or graduation.
    6. Student teaching. The Government does not anticipate the 
Contractor awarding fellowships and assistantships to students attending 
school under this agreement. However, for graduate students, should both 
the student and the Contractor decide it to be in the student's best 
interests to assist in the institution's teaching program, the 
Contractor may provide nominal compensation for part-time service. Base 
the compensation on the Contractor's practices and procedures for other 
students of similar accomplishment in that department or field. The 
Contractor shall apply the compensation as a credit against any invoices 
presented for payment for any period in which the student performed the 
part-time teaching service.

[[Page 255]]

    7. Termination of agreement. (a) Either party may terminate this 
agreement by giving 30 days advance written notice of the effective date 
of termination. In the event of termination, the Government shall have 
the right, at its option, to continue to receive educational services 
for those students already enrolled in the contractor's institution 
under this agreement until such time that the students complete their 
courses or curricula or the Government withdraws them from the 
Contractor's institution. The terms and conditions of this agreement in 
effect on the effective date of the termination shall continue to apply 
to such students remaining in the Contractor's institution.
    (b) Withdrawal of students under Schedule provision 4 shall not be 
considered a termination within the meaning of this provision 7.
    (c) Termination by either party shall not be the basis for any 
special charge or claim by the Contractor, other than as provided by the 
Contractor's standard procedures.

<R05>
239.7401  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart--
    (a) Common carrier means any entity engaged in the business of 
providing telecommunications services which are regulated by the Federal 
Communications Commission or other governmental body.
    (b) Foreign carrier means any person, partnership, association, 
joint-stock company, trust, governmental body, or corporation not 
subject to regulation by a U.S. governmental regulatory body and not 
doing business as a citizen of the United States, providing 
telecommunications services outside the territorial limits of the United 
States.
    (c) Governmental regulatory body means the Federal Communications 
Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than 
statewide jurisdiction when operating under the State authority. The 
following are not ``governmental regulatory bodies''--
    (1) Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial 
appeal; and
    (2) Regulatory bodies which regulate a company owned by the same 
entity which creates the regulatory body.
    (d) Noncommon carrier means any entity other than a common carrier 
offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for 
lease.
    (e) Securing, sensitive information, and telecommunications systems 
have the meaning given in the clause at 252.239-7016, Telecommunications 
Security Equipment, Devices, Techniques, and Services.
    (f) Telecommunications means the transmission, emission, or 
reception of signals, signs, writing, images, sounds, or intelligence of

<R05>
239.7402  Policy.

    (a) Acquisition. DoD policy is to acquire telecommunications 
services from common and noncommon telecommunications carriers--
    (1) On a competitive basis, except when acquisition using other than 
full and open competition is justified;
    (2) Recognizing the regulations, practices, and decisions of the 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and other governmental 
regulatory bodies on rates, cost principles, and accounting practices; 
and

[[Page 260]]

    (3) Making provision in telecommunications services contracts for 
adoption of--
    (i) FCC approved practices; or
    (ii) The generally accepted practices of the industry on those 
issues concerning common carrier services where--
    (A) The governmental regulatory body has not expressed itself;
    (B) The governmental regulatory body has declined jurisdiction; or
    (C) There is no governmental regulatory body to decide.
    (b) Security. (1) The contracting officer shall ensure, in 
accordance with agency procedures, that purchase requests identify--
    (i) The nature and extent of information requiring security during 
telecommunications;
    (ii) The requirement for the contractor to secure telecommunications 
systems;
    (iii) The telecommunications security equipment, devices, 
techniques, or services with which the contractor's telecommunications 
security equipment, devices, techniques, or services must be 
interoperable; and
    (iv) The approved telecommunications security equipment, devices, 
techniques, or services, such as found in the National Security Agency's 
Information Systems Security Products and Services Catalogue.
    (2) Contractors and subcontractors shall provide all 
telecommunications security techniques or services required for 
performance of Government contracts.
    (3) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this subsection, 
contractors and subcontractors shall normally provide all required 
telecommunications security equipment or devices as plant equipment in 
accordance with FAR part 45. In some cases, such as for communications 
security (COMSEC) equipment designated as controlled cryptographic item 
(CCI), contractors or subcontractors must also meet ownership 
eligibility conditions.
    (4) When the contractor or subcontractor does not meet ownership 
eligibility conditions, the head of the agency may authorize provision 
of the necessary facilities as Government-furnished property or 
acquisition as contractor-acquired property, as long as conditions of 
FAR 45.303 are met.
    (c) Foreign carriers. For information on contracting with foreign 
carriers, see PGI 239.7402(c).

[56 FR 36429, July 31, 1991, as amended at 56 FR 67220, Dec. 30, 1991;

239.7405  Delegated authority for telecommunications resources.

    The contracting officer may enter into a telecommunications service 
contract on a month-to-month basis or for any longer period or series of 
periods, not to exceed a total of 10 years. See PGI 239.7405 for 
documents relating to this contracting authority, which the General 
Services Administration has delegated to DoD.

[70 FR 67918, Nov. 9, 2005]


<R05>
239.7406  Cost or pricing data and information other than cost or pricing data.

    (a) Common carriers are not required to submit cost or pricing data 
before award of contracts for tariffed services. Rates or preliminary 
estimates quoted by a common carrier for tariffed telecommunications 
services are considered to be prices set by regulation within the 
provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2306a. This is true even if the tariff is set 
after execution of the contract.
    (b) Rates or preliminary estimates quoted by a common carrier for 
nontariffed telecommunications services or by a noncommon carrier for 
any telecommunications service are not considered prices set by law or 
regulation.
    (c) Contracting officers shall obtain sufficient information to 
determine that the prices are reasonable in accordance with FAR 15.403-3 
or 15.403-4. See PGI 239.7406 for examples of instances where additional 
information may be necessary to determine price reasonableness.

<R05>
239.7407  Type of contract.

    When acquiring telecommunications services, the contracting officer 
may

use a basic agreement (see FAR 16.702) in conjunction with communication 
service authorizations. When using this method, follow the procedures at 
PGI 239.7407.

[71 FR 27646, May 12, 2006]


<R05>
239.7408  Special construction.


<R05>
239.7408-1  General.

    (a) Special construction normally involves a common carrier giving a 
special service or facility related to the performance of the basic 
telecommunications service requirements.
    This may include--
    (1) Moving or relocating equipment;
    (2) Providing temporary facilities;
    (3) Expediting provision of facilities; or
    (4) Providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet 
Government requirements.
    (b) Use this subpart instead of FAR part 36 for acquisition of 
``special construction.''
    (c) Special construction costs may be--
    (1) A contingent liability for using telecommunications services for 
a shorter time than the minimum to reimburse the contractor for 
unamortized nonrecoverable costs. These costs are usually expressed in 
terms of a termination liability, as provided in the contract or by 
tariff;
    (2) A onetime special construction charge;
    (3) Recurring charges for constructed facilities;
    (4) A minimum service charge;
    (5) An expediting charge; or
    (6) A move or relocation charge.
    (d) When a common carrier submits a proposal or quotation which has 
special construction requirements, the contracting officer shall require 
a detailed special construction proposal. Analyze all special 
construction proposals to--
    (1) Determine the adequacy of the proposed construction;
    (2) Disclose excessive or duplicative construction; and
    (3) When different forms of charge are possible, provide for the 
form of charge most advantageous to the Government.
    (e) When possible, analyze and approve special construction charges 
before receiving the service. Impose a ceiling on the special 
construction costs before authorizing the contractor to proceed, if 
prior approval is not possible. The contracting officer must approve 
special construction charges before final payment.

[56 FR 36429, July 31, 1991, as amended at 71 FR 39011, July 11, 2006]


<R05>
239.7408-2  Applicability of construction labor standards for special construction.

    (a) The construction labor standards in FAR Subpart 22.4 ordinarily 
do not apply to special construction. However, if the special 
construction includes construction, alteration, or repair (as defined in 
FAR 22.401) of a public building or public work, the construction labor 
standards may apply. Determine applicability under FAR 22.402.
    (b) Each CSA or other type contract which is subject to construction 
labor standards under FAR 22.402 shall cite that fact.

[56 FR 36429, July 31, 1991, as amended at 71 FR 39011, July 11, 2006]


<R05>
239.7409  Special assembly.

    (a) Special assembly is the designing, manufacturing, arranging, 
assembling, or wiring of equipment to provide telecommunications 
services that cannot be provided with general use equipment.
    (b) Special assembly rates and charges shall be based on estimated 
costs. The contracting officer should negotiate special assembly rates 
and charges before starting service. When it is not possible to 
negotiate in advance, use provisional rates and charges subject to 
adjustment, until final rates and charges are negotiated. The CSAs 
authorizing the special assembly shall be modified to reflect negotiated 
final rates and charges.

[56 FR 36429, July 31, 1991, as amended at 71 FR 39011, July 11, 2006]


<R05>
239.7410  Cancellation and termination.

    (a)(1) Cancellation is stopping a requirement after placing of an 
order but before service starts.
    (2) Termination is stopping a requirement after placing an order and 
after service starts.

[[Page 262]]

    (b) Determine cancellation or termination charges under the 
provisions of the applicable tariff or agreement/contract.


<R05>
239.7411  Contract clauses.

    (a) In addition to other appropriate FAR and DFARS clauses, use the 
following clauses in solicitations, contracts, and basic agreements for 
telecommunications services. Modify the clauses only if necessary to 
meet the requirements of a governmental regulatory agency--
    (1) 252.239-7002, Access;
    (2) 252.239-7004, Orders for Facilities and Services;
    (3) 252.239-7005, Rates, Charges, and Services;
    (4) 252.239-7006, Tariff Information;
    (5) 252.239-7007, Cancellation or Termination of Orders;
    (6) 252.239-7008, Reuse Arrangements.
    (b) Use the following clauses in solicitations, contracts, and basic 
agreements for telecommunications services when the acquisition includes 
or may include special construction. Modify the clauses only if 
necessary to meet the requirements of a governmental regulatory agency--
    (1) 252.239-7011, Special Construction and Equipment Charges; and
    (2) 252.239-7012, Title to Telecommunication Facilities and 
Equipment.
    (c) Use the following clauses in basic agreements for 
telecommunications services--
    (1) 252.239-7013, Obligation of the Government;
    (2) 252.239-7014, Term of Agreement, and insert the effective date 
of the agreement in paragraph (a) of the clause; and
    (3) 252.239-7015, Continuation of Communication Service 
Authorizations, as appropriate, and insert in paragraph (a) of the 
clause, the name of the contracting office and the basic agreement or 
contract number which is being superseded.
    (d) Use the clause at 252.239-7016, Telecommunications Security 
Equipment, Devices, Techniques, and Services, in solicitations and 
contracts when performance of a contract requires secure 
telecommunications.

    (a) This part applies to purchase of utility services from 
nonregulated and regulated utility suppliers. It includes the 
acquisition of liquefied petroleum gas as a utility service when 
purchased from regulated utility suppliers.
    (b)(7) This part does not apply to third party financed projects. 
However, it may be used for any purchased utility services directly 
resulting from such projects, including those authorized by--
    (A) 10 U.S.C. 2394 for energy, fuels, and energy production 
facilities for periods not to exceed 30 years;
    (B) 10 U.S.C. 2394a for renewable energy for periods not to exceed

                Subpart 241.2_Acquiring Utility Services


<R05>
241.201  Policy.

    (1) DoD, as a matter of comity, generally complies with the current 
regulations, practices, and decisions of independent regulatory bodies. 
This policy does not extend to nonindependent regulatory bodies.
    (2) Purchases of utility services outside the United States may 
use--
    (i) Formats and technical provisions consistent with local practice; 
and
    (ii) Dual language forms and contracts.
    (3) Rates established by an independent regulatory body--
    (i) Are considered ``prices set by law or regulation'';
    (ii) Are sufficient to set prices without obtaining cost or pricing 
data (see FAR Subpart 15.4); and
    (iii) Are a valid basis on which prices can be determined fair and 
reasonable.
    (4) Compliance with the regulations, practices, and decisions of 
independent regulatory bodies as a matter of comity is not a substitute 
for the procedures at FAR 41.202(a).

[71 FR 3418, Jan. 23, 2006]


<R05>
241.202  Procedures.

    (1) Connection and service charges. The Government may pay a 
connection charge when required to cover the cost of the necessary 
connecting facilities. A connection charge based on the estimated labor 
cost of installing and removing the facility shall not include salvage 
cost. A lump-sum connection charge shall be no more than the agreed cost 
of the connecting facilities less net salvage. The order of precedence 
for contractual treatment of connection and service charges is--
    (i) No connection charge.
    (ii) Termination liability. Use when an obligation is necessary to 
secure the required services. The obligation must be not more than the 
agreed connection charge, less any net salvage material costs. Use of a 
termination liability instead of a connection charge requires the 
approval of the service power procurement officer or designee.
    (iii) Connection charge, refundable. Use a refundable connection 
charge when the supplier refuses to provide the facilities based on lack 
of capital or published rules which prohibit providing up-front funding. 
The contract should provide for refund of the connection charge within 
five years unless a longer period or omission of the refund requirement 
is authorized by the service power procurement officer or designee.
    (iv) Connection and service charges, nonrefundable. The Government 
may

[[Page 264]]

pay certain nonrefundable, nonrecurring charges including service 
initiation charges, a contribution in aid of construction, membership 
fees, and charges required by the supplier's rules and regulations to be 
paid by the customer. If possible, consider sharing with other than 
Government users the use of (and costs for) facilities when large 
nonrefundable charges are required.
    (2) Construction and labor requirements. Follow the procedures at 
PGI 241.202(2) for construction and labor requirements associated with 
connection and service charges.

[71 FR 3417, Jan. 23, 2006]


<R05>
241.205  Separate contracts.

    Follow the procedures at PGI 241.205 when acquiring utility services 
by separate contract.

<R04>
        Subpart 241.5_Solicitation Provision and Contract Clauses


<R05>
241.501  Solicitation provision and contract clauses.

    (d)(1) Use a clause substantially the same as the clause at FAR 
52.241-7, Change in Rates or Terms and Conditions of Service for 
Regulated Services, when the utility services to be provided are subject 
to an independent regulatory body.
    (2) Use a clause substantially the same as the clause at FAR 52.241-
8, Change in Rates or Terms and Conditions of Service for Unregulated 
Services, when the utility services to be provided are not subject to a 
regulatory body or are subject to a nonindependent regulatory body.

[71 FR 3418, Jan. 23, 2006]


<R05>
241.501-70  Additional clauses.

    (a) If the Government must execute a superseding contract and 
capital credits, connection charge credits, or termination liability 
exist, use the clause at 252.241-7000, Superseding Contract.
    (b) Use the clause at 252.241-70001, Government Access, when the 
clause at FAR 52.241-5, Contractor's Facilities, is used.

contracting officer's representative (see 201.602).


<R05>
242.202  Assignment of contract administration.

    (a)(i) DoD activities shall not retain any contract for 
administration that requires performance of any contract administration 
function at or near contractor facilities, except contracts for--
    (A) The National Security Agency;
    (B) Research and development with universities;
    (C) Flight training;
    (D) Management and professional support services;
    (E) Mapping, charting, and geodesy services;

Sealift Command may perform contract administration services at 
contractor locations involved solely in performance of airlift or 
sealift contracts);

military department, and subject to prior agreement, perform contract 
administration services on a military installation.
    (iii) DCMA shall provide preaward survey assistance for post, camp,

their personnel at contractor facilities, except--
    (A) In support of contracts retained for administration in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(i) of this section; or
    (B) As permitted under subpart 242.74.
    (e)(1)(A) In special circumstances, a contract administration office 
may request support from a component not listed in the Federal Directory 
of Contract Administration Services Components (available via the 
Internet at http://home.dcma.mil/casbook/casbook.htm). An example is a 
situation where the contractor's work site is on a military base and a 
base organization is asked to provide support. Before formally sending 
the request, coordinate with the office concerned to ensure that 
resources are available for, and capable of, providing the support.
    (B) When requesting support on a subcontract that includes foreign 
contract military sale (FMS) requirements, the contract administration 
office shall--
    (1) Mark ``FMS Requirement'' on the face of the documents; and
    (2) For each FMS case involved, provide the FMS case identifier, 
associated item quantities, DoD prime contract number, and prime 
contract line/subline item number.

    (i) When a novation agreement is required and the transferee intends 
to incur restructuring costs as defined at 213.205-70, the cognizant 
contracting officer shall include the following provision as paragraph 
(b)(7) of the novation agreement instead of the paragraph (b)(7) 
provided in the sample format at FAR 42.1204(i):

    ``(7)(i) Except as set forth in subparagraph (7)(ii) below, the 
Transferor and the Transferee agree that the Government is not obligated 
to pay or reimburse either of them for, or otherwise give effect to, any 
costs, taxes, or other expenses, or any related increases, directly or 
indirectly arising out of or resulting from the transfer or this 
Agreement, other than those that the Government in the absence of this 
transfer or Agreement would have been obligated to pay or reimburse 
under the terms of the contracts.
    (ii) The Government recognizes that restructuring by the Transferee 
incidental to the acquisition/merger may be in the best interests of the 
Government. Restructuring costs that are allowable under Part 31 of the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) or Part 231 of the Defense Federal 
Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) may be reimbursed under 
flexibily-priced novated contracts, provided the Transferee demonstrates 
that the restructuring will reduce overall costs to the Department of 
Defense (DoD) (and to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
(NASA), where there is a mix of DoD and NASA contracts), and the 
requirements included in DFARS 231.205-70 are met. Restructuring costs 
shall not be allowed on novated contracts unless there is

[[Page 271]]

an audit of the restructuring proposal; a determination by the 
contracting officer of overall reduced costs to DoD/NASA; and an Advance 
Agreement setting forth a cumulative cost ceiling for restructuring 
projects and the period to which such costs shall be assigned.''

    Source: 65 FR 77833, Dec. 13, 2000, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
242.7200  Scope of subpart.

    (a) This subpart provides policies, procedures, and standards for 
use in the evaluation of a contractor's material management and 
accounting system (MMAS).
    (b) The policies, procedures, and standards in this subpart--
    (1) Apply only when the contractor has contracts exceeding the 
simplified acquisition threshold that are not for the acquisition of 
commercial items and are either--
    (i) Cost-reimbursement contracts; or
    (ii) Fixed-price contracts with progress payments made on the basis 
of costs incurred by the contractor as work progresses under the 
contract; and
    (2) Do not apply to small businesses, educational institutions, or 
nonprofit organizations.


<R05>
242.7201  Definitions.

    Material management and accounting system and valid time-phased 
requirements are defined in the clause at 252.242-7004, Material 
Management and Accounting System.


<R05>
242.7202  Policy.

    DoD policy is for its contractors to have an MMAS that conforms to 
the standards in paragraph (e) of the clause at 252.242-7004, so that 
the system--
    (a) Reasonably forecasts material requirements;
    (b) Ensures the costs of purchased and fabricated material charged 
or allocated to a contract are based on valid time-phased requirements; 
and
    (c) Maintains a consistent, equitable, and unbiased logic for 
costing of material transactions.


<R05>
242.7203  Review procedures.

    (a) Criteria for conducting reviews. Conduct an MMAS review when--
    (1) A contractor has $40 million of qualifying sales to the 
Government during the contractor's preceding fiscal year; and
    (2) The administrative contracting officer (ACO), with advice from 
the auditor, determines an MMAS review is needed based on a risk 
assessment of the contractor's past experience and current 
vulnerability.
    (b) Qualifying sales. Qualifying sales are sales for which cost or 
pricing data were required under 10 U.S.C. 2306a, as implemented in FAR 
15.403, or that are contracts priced on other than a firm-fixed-price or 
fixed-price with economic price adjustment basis. Sales include prime 
contracts, subcontracts, and modifications to such contracts and 
subcontracts.
    (c) System evaluation. Cognizant contract administration and audit 
activities must jointly establish and manage programs for evaluating the 
MMAS systems of contractors and must annually establish a schedule of 
contractors to be reviewed. In addition, they must--
    (1) Conduct reviews as a team effort.
    (i) the ACO--
    (A) Appoints a team leader; and
    (B) Ensures that the team includes appropriate functional 
specialists (e.g., industrial specialist, engineer, property 
administrator, auditor).
    (ii) The team leader--
    (A) Advises the ACO and the contractor of findings during the review 
and at the exit conference; and

[[Page 273]]

    (B) Makes every effort to resolve differences regarding questions of 
fact during the review.
    (iii) The contract auditor--
    (A) Participates as a member of the MMAS team or serves as the team 
leader (see paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section); and
    (B) Issues an audit report for incorporation into the MMAS report 
based on an analysis of the contractor's books, accounting records, and 
other related data.
    (2) Tailor reviews to take full advantage of the day-to-day work 
done by both organizations.
    (3) Prepare the MMAS report.
    (d) Disposition of evaluation team findings. The team leader must 
document the evaluation team findings and recommendations in the MMAS 
report to the ACO. If there are any significant MMAS deficiencies, the 
report must provide an estimate of the adverse impact on the Government 
resulting from those deficiencies.
    (1) Initial notification to the contractor. The ACO must provide a 
copy of the report to the contractor immediately upon receipt from the 
team leader.
    (i) The ACO must notify the contractor in a timely manner if there 
are no deficiencies.
    (ii) If there are any deficiencies, the ACO must request the 
contractor to provide a written response within 30 days (or such other 
date as may be mutually agreed to by the ACO and the contractor) from 
the date of initial notification.
    (iii) If the contractor agrees with the report, the contractor has 
60 days (or such other date as may be mutually agreed to by the ACO and 
the contractor) to correct any identified deficiencies or submit a 
corrective action plan showing milestones and actions to eliminate the 
deficiencies.
    (iv) If the contractor disagrees with the report, the contractor 
must provide rationale in the written response.
    (2) Evaluation of the contractor's response. The ACO, in 
consultation with the auditor, evaluates the contractor's response and 
determines whether--
    (i) The MMAS contains any deficiencies and, if so, any corrective 
action is needed;
    (ii) The deficiencies are significant enough to result in the 
reduction of progress payments or disallowance of costs on vouchers; and
    (iii) Proposed corrective actions (if the contractor submitted them) 
are adequate to correct the deficiencies.
    (3) Notification of ACO determination. (i) The ACO must notify the 
contractor in writing (copy to auditor and functional specialists) of--
    (A) Any deficiencies and the necessary corrective action;
    (B) Acceptability of the contractor's corrective action plan (if one 
was submitted) or the need for a corrective action plan; and
    (C) Any decision to reduce progress payments or disallow costs on 
vouchers.
    (ii) The Government does not approve or disapprove the contractor's 
MMAS. ACO notifications should avoid any such implications.
    (iii) From the time the ACO determines that there are any 
significant MMAS deficiencies until the time the deficiencies are 
corrected, all field pricing reports for that contractor must contain a 
recommendation relating to proposed adjustments necessary to protect the 
Government's interests.
    (iv) The ACO should consider the effect of any significant MMAS 
deficiencies in reviews of the contractor's estimating system (see 
215.407-5).
    (4) Reductions or disallowances. (i) When the ACO determines the 
MMAS deficiencies have a material impact on Government contract costs, 
the ACO must reduce progress payments by an appropriate percentage based 
on affected costs (in accordance with FAR 32.503-6) and/or disallow 
costs on vouchers (in accordance with FAR 42.803). The reductions or 
disallowances must remain in effect until the ACO determines that--
    (A) The deficiencies are corrected; or
    (B) The amount of the impact is immaterial.
    (ii) The maximum payment adjustment is the adverse material impact 
to the Government as specified in the MMAS report. The ACO should use 
the maximum adjustment when the contractor did not submit a corrective 
action plan with its response, or when the plan is unacceptable. In 
other cases,

[[Page 274]]

the ACO should consider the quality of the contractor's corrective 
action plan in determining the appropriate percentage.
    (iii) As the contractor implements its accepted corrective action 
plan, the ACO should reinstate a portion of withheld amounts 
commensurate with the contractor's progress in making corrections. 
However, the ACO must not fully reinstate withheld amounts until the 
contractor corrects the deficiencies, or until the impact of the 
deficiencies become immaterial.
    (5) Monitoring contractor's corrective action. The ACO and the 
auditor must monitor the contractor's progress in correcting 
deficiencies. When the ACO determines the deficiencies have been 
corrected, the ACO must notify the contractor in writing. If the 
contractor fails to make adequate progress, the ACO must take further 
action. The ACO may--
    (i) Elevate the issue to higher level management;
    (ii) Further reduce progress payments and/or disallow costs on 
vouchers;
    (iii) Notify the contractor of the inadequacy of the contractor's 
cost estimating system and/or cost accounting system; and
    (iv) Issue cautions to contracting activities regarding the award of 
future contracts.

           Subpart 242.73_Contractor Insurance/Pension Review


<R05>
242.7301  General.

    (a) The administrative contracting officer (ACO) is responsible for 
determining the allowability of insurance/pension costs in Government 
contracts and for determining the need for a Contractor/Insurance 
Pension Review (CIPR). Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) 
insurance/pension specialists and Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) 
auditors assist ACOs in making these determinations, conduct CIPRs when 
needed, and perform other routine audits as authorized under FAR 42.705 
and 52.215-2. A CIPR is a DCMA/DCAA joint review that--
    (1) Provides an in-depth evaluation of a contractor's--
    (i) Insurance programs;
    (ii) Pension plans;
    (iii) Other deferred compensation plans; and
    (iv) Related policies, procedures, practices, and costs; or
    (2) Concentrates on specific areas of the contractor's insurance 
programs, pension plans, or other deferred compensation plans.
    (b) DCMA is the DoD Executive Agency for the performance of all 
CIPRs.
    (c) DCAA is the DoD agency designated for the performance of 
contract audit responsibilities related to Cost Accounting Standards 
administration as described in FAR Subparts 30.2 and 30.6 as they relate 
to a contractor's insurance programs, pension plans, and other deferred 
compensation plans.

    Subpart 242.74_Technical Representation at Contractor Facilities


<R05>
242.7400  General.

    (a) Program managers may conclude that they need technical 
representation in contractor facilities to perform non-contract 
administration service (CAS) technical duties and to provide liaison, 
guidance, and assistance on systems and programs. In these cases, the 
program manager may assign technical representatives under the 
procedures in 242.7401.
    (b) A technical representative is a representative of a DoD program, 
project, or system office performing non-CAS technical duties at or near 
a contractor facility. A technical representative is not--
    (1) A representative of a contract administration or contract audit 
component; or
    (2) A contracting officer's representative (see 201.602).

<R05>
242.7501  Policy.

    Contractors receiving cost-reimbursement or incentive type 
contracts, or contracts which provide for progress payments based on 
costs or on a percentage or stage of completion, shall maintain an 
accounting system and related internal controls throughout contract 
performance which provide reasonable assurance that--
    (a) Applicable laws and regulations are complied with;
    (b) The accounting system and cost data are reliable;
    (c) Risk of misallocations and mischarges are minimized; and
    (d) Contract allocations and charges are consistent with invoice

    (a) Upon receipt of an audit report identifying significant 
accounting system or related internal control deficiencies, the ACO 
will--
    (1) Provide a copy of the report to the contractor and allow 30 
days, or a reasonable extension, for the contractor to respond;
    (2) If the contractor agrees with the report, the contractor has 60 
days from the date of initial notification to correct any identified 
deficiencies or submit a corrective action plan showing milestones and 
actions to eliminate the deficiencies.
    (3) If the contractor disagrees, the contractor should provide 
rationale in its written response.
    (4) The ACO will consider whether it is appropriate to suspend a 
percentage of progress payments or reimbursement of costs proportionate 
to the estimated cost risk to the Government, considering audit reports 
or other relevant input, until the contractor submits a corrective 
action plan acceptable to the ACO and corrects the deficiencies. (See 
FAR 32.503-6 (a) and (b) and FAR 42.302(a)(7)).

or withdrawing purchasing system approval. The ACO shall notify the 
contractor of the decision within ten days after receipt of the report 
with a copy of the decision to the PSA and the contracting office, when 
requested.
    (d) When a contractor advises that it has corrected deficiencies 
that led the ACO to withhold or withdraw the purchasing system approval, 
the ACO--
    (1) Shall request the PSA to verify that the contractor has--
    (i) Corrected the deficiencies; and
    (ii) Implemented any other ACO recommendations.
    (2) Should ask for a review of purchasing policies and procedures 
issued since the last review.

<R05>
246.470  Government contract quality assurance actions.


<R05>
246.470-1  Assessment of additional costs.

    (a) Under the clause at FAR 52.246-2, Inspection of Supplies--Fixed-
Price, after considering the factors in paragraph (c) of this 
subsection, the quality assurance representative (QAR) may believe that 
the assessment of additional costs is warranted. If so, the

246.471  Authorizing shipment of supplies.

    (a) General. (1) Ordinarily, a representative of the contract 
administration office signs or stamps the shipping papers that accompany 
Government source-inspected supplies to release them for shipment. This 
is done for both prime and subcontracts.
    (2) An alternative procedure (see paragraph (b) of this section) 
permits the contractor to assume the responsibility for releasing the 
supplies for shipment.
    (3) The alternative procedure may include prime contractor release 
of supplies inspected at a subcontractor's facility.
    (4) The use of the alternative procedure releases DoD manpower to 
perform technical functions by eliminating routine signing or stamping 
of the papers accompanying each shipment.
    (b) Alternative Procedures--Contract Release for Shipment. (1) The 
contract administration office may authorize, in writing, the contractor 
to release supplies for shipment when--
    (i) The stamping or signing of the shipping papers by a 
representative of the contract administration office interferes with the 
operation of the Government contract quality assurance program or takes 
too much of the Government representative's time;
    (ii) There is sufficient continuity of production to permit the 
Government to establish a systematic and continuing evaluation of the 
contractor's control of quality; and
    (iii) The contractor has a record of satisfactory quality, including 
that pertaining to preparation for shipment.
    (2) The contract administration office shall withdraw, in writing, 
the authorization when there is an indication that the conditions in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this subsection no longer exist.
    (3) When the alternative procedure is used, require the contractor 
to--
    (i) Type or stamp, and sign, the following statement on the required 
copy or copies of the shipping paper(s), or on an attachment--

    The supplies in this shipment--
    1. Have been subjected to and have passed all examinations and tests 
required by the contract;
    2. Were shipped in accordance with authorized shipping instructions;
    3. Conform to the quality, identity, and condition called for by the 
contract; and
    4. Are of the quantity shown on this document.
    This shipment was--
    1. Released in accordance with section 246.471 of the Defense FAR 
Supplement; and
    2. Authorized by (name and title of the authorized representative of 
the contract administration office) in a letter dated (date of 
authorizing letter). (Signature and title of contractor's designated 
official.)

    (ii) Release and process, in accordance with established 
instructions, the DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, 
or other authorized receiving report.


<R05>
246.472  Inspection stamping.

    (a) DoD quality inspection approval marking designs (stamps) may be 
used for both prime contracts and subcontracts. Follow the procedures at 
PGI 246.472(a) for use of DoD inspection stamps.
    (b) Policies and procedures regarding the use of National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) quality status stamps are 
contained in NASA publications. When requested by NASA centers, the DoD 
inspector shall use NASA quality status stamps in accordance with 
current NASA requirements.

246.701  Definitions.

    Acceptance, as defined in FAR 46.701 and as used in this subpart and 
in the warranty clauses at FAR 52.246-17, Warranty of Supplies of a 
Noncomplex Nature; FAR 52.246-18, Warranty of Supplies of a Complex 
Nature; FAR 52.246-19, Warranty of Systems and Equipment Under 
Performance Specifications or Design Criteria; and FAR 52.246-20, 
Warranty of Services, includes the execution of an official document 
(e.g., DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report) by an 
authorized representative of the Government.
    Defect, as used in this subpart, means any condition or 
characteristic in any supply or service furnished by the contractor 
under the contract that is not in compliance with the requirements of 
the contract.


<R05>
246.704  Authority for use of warranties.

    (1) The chief of the contracting office must approve use of a 
warranty, except in acquisitions for--
    (i) Commercial items (see FAR 46.709);
    (ii) Technical data, unless the warranty provides for extended 
liability (see 246.708);
    (iii) Supplies and services in fixed-price type contracts containing 
quality assurance provisions that reference higher-level contract 
quality requirements (see 246.202-4); or
    (iv) Supplies and services in construction contracts when using the 
warranties that are contained in Federal, military, or construction 
guide specifications.
    (2) The chief of the contracting office shall approve the use of a 
warranty only when the benefits are expected to outweigh the cost.

[71 FR 27647, May 12, 2006]


<R05>
246.705  Limitations.

    (a) In addition to the exceptions provided in FAR 46.705(a),

<R05>
246.708  Warranties of data.

    Obtain warranties on technical data when practicable and cost 
effective. Consider the factors in FAR 46.703 in deciding whether to 
obtain warranties of technical data. Consider the following in deciding 
whether to use extended liability provisions--
    (1) The likelihood that correction or replacement of the 
nonconforming data, or a price adjustment, will not give adequate 
protection to the Government; and
    (2) The effectiveness of the additional remedy as a deterrent 
against furnishing nonconforming data.


<R05>
246.710  Contract clauses.

    (1) Use a clause substantially the same as the clause at 252.246-
7001, Warranty of Data, in solicitations and contracts that include the 
clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software, 
when there is a need for greater protection or period of liability than 
provided by the inspection and warranty clauses prescribed in FAR Part 
46.
    (2) Use the clause at 252.246-7001, Warranty of Data, with its 
Alternate I when extended liability is desired and a

[[Page 306]]

fixed price incentive contract is contemplated.
    (3) Use the clause at 252.246-7001, Warranty of Data, with its 
Alternate II when extended liability is desired and a firm fixed price 
contract is contemplated.
    (4) Use the clause at 252.246-7002, Warranty of Construction 
(Germany), instead of the clause at FAR 52.246-21, Warranty of 
Construction, in solicitations and contracts for construction when a 
fixed-price contract will be awarded and contract performance will be in 
Germany.

perform any additional services, other than attempted pick up or 
delivery, regardless of the contracting method.
    (vii) To the maximum extent possible, identify additional services 
required that are incidental to an order before placing the order; or,

both services in a single schedule. However, items must follow the same 
sequential order as in the basic format.
    (6) Process any modification of schedule format, other than those 
authorized in paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this subsection, as a 
request for deviation to the Commander, MTMC.

awarded.
    (f) In addition to designating each ordering activity, as required 
by the clause at FAR 52.216-18, Ordering, identify by name or position

         Subpart 247.5_Ocean Transportation by U.S.-Flag Vessels


<R05>
247.570  Scope.

    This subpart--
    (a) Implements--(1) The Cargo Preference Act of 1904 (``the 1904 
Act''), 10 U.S.C. 2631, which applies to the ocean transportation of 
cargo owned by, or destined for use by, DoD; and
    (2) Section 1017 of the National Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2007 (Pub. L. 109-364), which requires consideration of the 
extent to which offerers have had overhaul, repair, and maintenance work 
performed in shipyards located in the United States or Guam;
    (b) Does not specifically implement the Cargo Preference Act of 1954 
(``the 1954 Act''), 46 U.S.C. 1241(b). The 1954 Act is applicable to 
DoD, but DFARS coverage is not required because compliance with the 1904 
Act historically has resulted in DoD exceeding the 1954 Act's 
requirements; and
    (c) Does not apply to ocean transportation of the following 
products, in which case FAR subpart 47.5 applies:
    (1) Products obtained for contributions to foreign assistance 
programs.
    (2) Products owned by agencies other than DoD, unless the products 
are clearly identifiable for eventual use by DoD.

247.573  Procedures.

[72 FR 49206, Aug. 28, 2007]


<R05>
247.573-1  Ocean transportation incidental to a contract for supplies, services, or construction.

    (a) This subsection applies when ocean transportation is not the 
principal purpose of the contract, and the cargo to be transported is 
owned by DoD or is clearly identifiable for eventual use by DoD.
    (b) The contracting officer must obtain assistance from the 
congnizant transportation activity (see 247.105) in developing--
    (1) The Government estimate for transportation costs, irrespective 
of whether freight will be paid directly by the Government; and
    (2) Shipping instructions and delivery terms for inclusion in 
solicitations and contracts that may involve transportation of supplies 
by sea.
    (c) If the contractor notifies the contracting officer that the 
contractor or a subcontractor considers that--
    (1) No U.S.-flag vessels are available, the contracting officer must 
request confirmation of the nonavailability from--
    (i) The Commander, Military Sealift Command (MSC), through the 
Contracts and Business Management Directorate, MSC; or
    (ii) The Commander, Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC), 
through the Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting, MTMC.

[[Page 314]]

    (2) The proposed freight charges to the Government, the contractor, 
or any subcontractor are higher than charges for transportation of like 
goods to private persons, the contracting officer may approve a request 
for an exception to the requirement to ship on U.S.-flag vessels for a 
particular shipment.
    (i) Prior to granting an exception, the contracting officer must 
request advice, oral or written, from the Commander, MSC, or the 
Commander, MTMC.
    (ii) In advising the contracting officer whether to grant the 
exception, the Commander, MSC, or the Commander, MTMC, must consider, as 
appropriate, evidence from--
    (A) Published tariffs;
    (B) Industry publications;
    (C) The Maritime Administration; and
    (D) Any other available sources.
    (3) The freight charges proposed by U.S.-flag carriers are excessive 
or otherwise unreasonable--
    (i) The contracting officer must prepare a report in determination 
and finding format, and must--
    (A) Take into consideration that the 1904 Act is, in part, a subsidy 
of the U.S.-flag commercial shipping industry that recognizes that lower 
prices may be available from foreign-flag carriers. Therefore, a lower 
price for use of a foreign-flag vessel is not a sufficient basis, on its 
own, to determine that the freight rate proposed by the U.S.-flag 
carrier is excessive or otherwise unreasonable. However, such a price 
differential may indicate a need for further review;
    (B) Consider, accordingly, not only excessive profits to the carrier 
(to include vessel owner or operator), if ascertainable, but also 
excessive costs to the Government (i.e., costs beyond the economic 
penalty normally incurred by excluding foreign competition) resulting 
from the use of U.S.-flag vessels in extraordinarily inefficient 
circumstances; and
    (C) Include an analysis of whether the cost is excessive, taking 
into account factors such as--
    (1) The differential between the freight charges proposed by the 
U.S.-flag carrier and an estimate of what foreign-flag carriers would 
charge based upon a price analysis;
    (2) A comparison of U.S.-flag rates charged on comparable routes;
    (3) Efficiency of operation regardless of rate differential (e.g., 
suitability of the vessel for the required transportation in terms of 
cargo requirements or vessel capacity, and the commercial reasonableness 
of vessel positioning required); and
    (4) Any other relevant economic and financial considerations.
    (ii) The contracting officer must forward the report to--
    (A) The Commander, MSC, through the Contracts and Business 
Management Directorate, MSC; or
    (B) The Commander, MTMC, through the Principal Assistant Responsible 
for Contracting, MTMC.
    (iii) If in agreement with the contracting officer, the Commander, 
MSC, or the Commander, MTMC, will forward the report to the Secretary of 
the Navy or the Secretary of the Army, respectively, for a determination 
as to whether the proposed freight charges are excessive or otherwise 
unreasonable.

Redesignated at 72 FR 49206, Aug. 28, 2007]


<R05>
247.573-2  Direct purchase of ocean transportation services.

    (a) This subsection applies when ocean transportation is the 
principal purpose of the contract, including--
    (1) Time charters;
    (2) Voyage charters;
    (3) Contracts for charter vessel services;
    (4) Dedicated contractor contracts for charter vessel services;
    (5) Ocean bills of lading; and
    (6) Subcontracts under Government contracts or agreements for ocean 
transportation services.
    (b) Coordinate these acquisitions, as appropriate, with the U.S. 
Transportation Command, the DoD single manager for commercial 
transportation and related services, other than Service-unique or 
theater-assigned transportation assets, in accordance with DoD 5158.4, 
United States Transportation Command.

[[Page 315]]

    (c) All solicitations within the scope of this subsection must 
provide--(1) A preference for U.S.-flag vessels in accordance with the 
1904 Act;
    (2) An evaluation factor or subfactor for offeror participation in 
the Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement; and
    (3) An evaluation factor or subfactor considering the extent to 
which offerors have had overhaul, repair, and maintenance work for 
covered vessels performed in shipyards located in the United States or 
Guam.
    (d) Do not award a contract of the type described in paragraph (a) 
of this subsection for a foreign-flag vessel unless--
    (1) The Commander, MSC, or the Commander, MTMC, determines that no 
U.S.-flag vessels are available.
    (i) The Commander, MSC, and the Commander, MTMC, are authorized to 
make any determinations as to the availability of U.S.-flag vessels to 
ensure the proper use of Government and private U.S. vessels.
    (ii) The contracting officer must request such determinations--
    (A) For voyage and time charters, through the Contracts and Business 
Management Directorate, MSC; and
    (B) For ocean and intermodal transportation of DoD and DoD-sponsored 
cargoes, as applicable under contracts awarded by MTMC, including 
contracts for shipment of military household goods, through the Chiefs 
of the MTMC Ocean Cargo Clearance Authority.
    (iii) In the absence of regularly scheduled U.S.-flag service to 
fulfill stated DoD requirements under MTMC solicitations or rate 
requests, the Commander, MTMC, may grant, on a case-by-case basis, an 
on-going nonavailability determination for foreign-flag service approval 
with pre-determined review date(s);
    (2) The contracting officer determines that the U.S.-flag carrier 
has proposed to the Government freight charges that are higher than 
charges to private persons for transportation of like goods, and obtains 
the approval of the Commander, MSC, or the Commander, MTMC; or
    (3) The Secretary of the Navy or the Secretary of the Army 
determines that the proposed freight charges for U.S.-flag vessels are 
excessive or otherwise unreasonable.
    (i) After considering the factors in 247.573-1(d)(3)(i)(A) and (B), 
if the contracting officer concludes that the freight charges proposed 
by U.S.-flag carriers may be excessive or otherwise unreasonable, the 
contracting officer must prepare a report in determination and finding 
format that includes, as appropriate--
    (A) An analysis of the carrier's costs in accordance with FAR 
Subpart 15.4, or profit in accordance with 215.404-4. The costs or 
profit should not be so high as to make it unreasonable to apply the 
preference for U.S.-flag vessels;
    (B) A description of efforts taken pursuant to FAR 15.405, to 
negotiate a reasonable price. For the purpose of FAR 15.405(d), this 
report is the referral to a level above the contracting officer; and
    (C) An analysis of whether the costs are excessive (i.e., costs 
beyond the economic penalty normally incurred by excluding foreign 
competition), taking into consideration factors such as those listed at 
247.573-1(d)(3)(i)(C).
    (ii) The contracting officer must forward the report to--
    (A) The commander, MSC, through the Contracts and Business 
Management Directorate, MSC; or
    (B) The Commander, MTMC, through the Principal Assistant Responsible 
for Contracting, MTMC.
    (iii) If an agreement with the contracting officer, the Commander, 
MSC, or the Commander, MTMC, will forward the report to the Secretary of 
the Navy or the Secretary of the Army, respectively, for a determination 
as to whether the proposed freight charges are excessive or otherwise 
unreasonable.

249.501-70  Special termination costs.

    (a) The clause at 252.249-7000, Special Termination Costs, may be 
used in an incrementally funded contract when its use is approved by the 
agency head.
    (b) The clause is authorized when--
    (1) The contract term is 2 years or more;
    (2) The contract is estimated to require--
    (i) Total RDT&E financing in excess of $25 million; or
    (ii) Total production investment in excess of $100 million; and
    (3) Adequate funds are available to cover the contingent reserve 
liability for special termination costs.
    (c) The contractor and the contracting officer must agree upon an 
amount that represents their best estimate of the total special 
termination costs to which the contractor would be entitled in the event 
of termination of the contract. Insert this amount in paragraph (c) of

    (ii) The contractor's cost risk associated with contingent special 
termination costs is expected to fluctuate extensively over the period 
of the contract.

contract;
    (ii) The time when certain performance milestones are accomplished 
by the contractor; or

Corporation submits termination settlement proposals in the format 
prescribed in FAR 49.602 and that they

[[Page 318]]

contain the amount of settlements with subcontractors. The termination 
contracting officer (TCO) shall prepare an appropriate settlement 
agreement. (See FAR 49.603.) The letter transmitting a settlement 
proposal must certify--
    (1) That disposition of inventory has been completed; and
    (2) That the Contract Claims Resolution Board of the Public Works 
and Government Services Canada has approved settlements with Canadian 
subcontractors when the Procedures Manual on Termination of Contracts 
requires such approval.
    (c)(1) The Canadian Commercial Corporation will--

contract, the TCO shall obtain from the U.S. contracting officer prior 
to final settlement--
    (i) Ratification of the proposed settlement; and
    (ii) A contract modification increasing the contract price and 
obligating the additional funds.
    (d) The Canadian Commercial Corporation should send all termination 
settlement proposals submitted by U.S. subcontractors and suppliers to 
the TCO of the cognizant contract administration office of the Defense 
Contract Management Agency for settlement. The TCO will inform the 
Canadian Commercial Corporation of the amount of the net settlement of 
U.S. subcontractors and suppliers so that this amount can be included in 
the Canadian Commercial Corporation termination proposal. The Canadian 
Commercial Corporation is responsible for execution of the settlement 
agreement with these subcontractors.
    (e) The Canadian Commercial Corporation will continue administering 
contracts that the U.S. contracting officer terminates.
    (f) The Canadian Commercial Corporation will settle all Canadian 
subcontracts in accordance with the policies, practices, and procedures 
of the Canadian Government.
    (g) The U.S. agency administering the contract with the Canadian 
Commercial Corporation shall provide any services required by the 
Canadian Commercial Corporation, including disposal of inventory, for 
settlement of any subcontracts placed in the United States. Settlement 
of such U.S. subcontracts will be in accordance with this regulation.

    (d) Procedures for marking. (1) When an event occurs that requires 
the physical marking of the item with the 2D data matrix symbol, the 
Contractor shall use the previously assigned virtual UII as the 
permanent UII.
    (2) The Contractor shall use MIL-STD-130M (or later version) when 
physically marking existing PIPC with the compliant 2D data matrix 
symbol. The Contractor that has possession of the PIPC shall use due 
diligence to maintain the integrity of the UII and shall replace a 
damaged, destroyed, or lost mark with a replacement mark that contains 
the same UII data elements, as necessary. The Contractor shall apply the 
required 2D data matrix symbol to an identification plate, band, tag, or 
label securely fastened to the item, or directly to the surface of the 
item to be compliant.
    (3) When an item cannot be physically marked or tagged due to a lack 
of available space to mark identifying information or because marking or 
tagging would have a deleterious effect, the Contractor shall--
    (i) Attach to the item a tag that has the identifying information 
marked on the tag;
    (ii) Place the item in a supplemental bag or other package that 
encloses the item and has a tag attached to the bag or package that has 
the identifying information marked on the tag; or
    (iii) Apply the identifying information to the unit pack in addition 
to, or in combination with, the identification marking information 
specified in MIL-STD-129. When combining marking requirements for a unit 
pack, the Contractor shall follow the manner, method, form, and format 
of MIL-STD-129 and shall fulfill the informational requirements of that 
standard.
    (4) When the item has the tag removed or the item is removed from 
the bag to be installed as an embedded item in a parent item, the 
Contractor shall--
    (i) Assign a UII or a virtual UII to the parent item if a UII does 
not already exist;
    (ii) Mark the parent item with the DoD compliant 2D data matrix 
symbol, if feasible; and
    (iii) Update the IUID Registry to indicate that the tagged or bagged 
UII item has become an embedded item within the parent item.
    (5) In the event a previously tagged or bagged embedded item is 
subsequently removed from use, the Contractor shall tag or bag and mark 
the item again with the original UII.

252.215-7004  Excessive pass-through charges.

    As prescribed in 215.408(4), use the following clause:

                Excessive Pass-Through Charges (MAY 2008)

quality assurance functions).
    Excessive pass-through charge, with respect to a Contractor or 
subcontractor that adds no or negligible value to a contract or 
subcontract, means a charge to the Government by the Contractor or 
subcontractor that is for indirect costs or profit on work performed by 
a subcontractor (other than charges for the costs of managing 
subcontracts and applicable indirect costs and profit based on such 
costs).
    No or negligible value means the Contractor or subcontractor cannot 
demonstrate to the Contracting Officer that its effort added value to 
the contract or subcontract in accomplishing the work performed under 
the contract (including task or delivery orders).
    Subcontract means any contract, as defined in section 2.101 of the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation, entered into by a subcontractor to

writing if--
    (1) The Contractor changes the amount of subcontract effort after 
award such that it exceeds 70 percent of the total cost of work to be 
performed under the contract, task order, or delivery order. The 
notification shall identify the revised cost of the subcontract effort 
and shall include verification that the Contractor will provide added 
value; or
    (2) Any subcontractor changes the amount of lower-tier subcontractor 
effort after award such that it exceeds 70 percent of the total cost of 
the work to be performed under its subcontract. The notification shall 
identify the revised cost of the subcontract effort and shall include 
verification that the subcontractor will provide added value as related 
to the work to be performed by the lower-tier subcontractor(s).
    (d) Recovery of excessive pass-through charges. If the Contracting 
Officer determines that excessive pass-through charges exist--
    (1) For fixed-price contracts, the Government shall be entitled to a

252.216-7000  Economic price adjustment--basic steel, aluminum, brass, bronze, or copper mill products.

    As prescribed in 216.203-4-70(a), use the following clause:

  Economic Price Adjustment--Basic Steel, Aluminum, Brass, Bronze, or 
                     Copper Mill Products (JUL 1997)

    (a) Definitions. As used in this clause--
    Established price means a price which is an established catalog or 
market price for a commercial item sold in substantial quantities to the 
general public.
    Unit price excludes any part of the price which reflects 
requirements for preservation, packaging, and packing beyond standard 
commercial practice.
    (b) The Contractor warrants that the unit price stated for (Identify 
the item) is not in excess of the Contractor's established price in 
effect on the date set for opening of bids (or the contract date if this 
is a negotiated contract) for like quantities of the same item. This 
price is the net price after applying any applicable standard trade 
discounts offered by the Contractor from its catalog, list, or schedule 
price.
    (c) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of 
the amount and effective date of each decrease in any established price.
    (1) Each corresponding contract unit price shall be decreased by the 
same percentage that the established price is decreased.
    (2) This decrease shall apply to items delivered on or after the 
effective date of the decrease in the Contractor's established price.
    (3) This contract shall be modified accordingly.

[[Page 348]]

    (d) If the Contractor's established price is increased after the 
date set for opening of bids (or the contract date if this is a 
negotiated contract), upon the Contractor's written request to the 
Contracting Officer, the corresponding contract unit price shall be 
increased by the same percentage that the established price is 
increased, and this contract shall be modified accordingly, provided--
    (1) The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price under 
this contract shall not exceed 10 percent of the original contract unit 
price;
    (2) The increased contract unit price shall be effective on the 
effective date of the increase in the applicable established price if 
the Contractor's written request is received by the Contracting Officer 
within ten days of the change. If it is not, the effective date of the 
increased unit price shall be the date of receipt of the request by the 
Contracting Officer; and
    (3) The increased contract unit price shall not apply to quantities 
scheduled for delivery before the effective date of the increased 
contract unit price unless the Contractor's failure to deliver before 
that date results from causes beyond the control and without the fault 
or negligence of the Contractor, within the meaning of the Default 
clause of this contract.
    (4) The Contracting Officer shall not execute a modification 
incorporating an increase in a contract unit price under this clause 
until the increase is verified.
    (e) Within 30 days after receipt of the Contractor's written 
request, the Contracting Officer may cancel, without liability to either 
party, any portion of the contract affected by the requested increase 
and not delivered at the time of such cancellation, except as follows--
    (1) The Contractor may, after that time, deliver any items that were 
completed or in the process of manufacture at the time of receipt of the 
cancellation notice, provided the Contractor notifies the Contracting 
Officer of such items within 10 days after the Contractor receives the 
cancellation notice.
    (2) The Government shall pay for those items at the contract unit 
price increased to the extent provided by paragraph (d) of this clause.
    (3) Any standard steel supply item shall be deemed to be in the 
process of manufacture when the steel for that item is in the state of 
processing after the beginning of the furnace melt.
    (f) Pending any cancellation of this contract under paragraph (e) of 
this clause, or if there is no cancellation, the Contractor shall 
continue deliveries according to the delivery schedule of the contract. 
The Contractor shall be paid for those deliveries at the contract unit 
price increased to the extent provided by paragraph (d) of this clause.

252.216-7001  Economic price adjustment--nonstandard steel items.

    As prescribed in 216.203-4-70(b), use the following clause:

      Economic Price Adjustment--Nonstandard Steel Items (JUL 1997)

    (a) Definitions. As used in this clause--
    Base labor index means the average of the labor indices for the 
three months which consist of the month of bid opening (or offer 
submission) and the months immediately preceding and following that 
month.
    Base steel index means the Contractor's established price (see note 
6) including all applicable extras of $-------- per ---------- (see note 
1) for ---------- (see note 2) on the date set for bid opening (or the 
date of submission of the offer).
    Current labor index means the average of the labor indices for the 
month in which delivery of supplies is required to be made and the month 
preceding.
    Current steel index means the Contractor's established price (see 
note 6) for that item, including all applicable extras in effect ------
-- days (see note 3) prior to the first day of the month in which 
delivery is required.
    Established price is--
    (1) A price which is an established catalog or market price of a 
commercial item sold in substantial quantities to the general public; 
and
    (2) The net price after applying any applicable standard trade 
discounts offered by the Contractor from its catalog, list, or schedule 
price. (But see Note 6.)
    Labor index means the average straight time hourly earnings of the 
Contractor's employees in the -------- shop of the Contractor's --------
-- plant (see note 4) for any particular month.
    Month means calendar month. However, if the Contractor's accounting 
period does not coincide with the calendar month, then that accounting 
period shall be used in lieu of month.
    (b) Each contract unit price shall be subject to revision, under the 
terms of this clause, to reflect changes in the cost of labor and steel. 
For purpose of this price revision, the proportion of the contract unit 
price attributable to costs of labor not otherwise included in the price 
of the steel item identified under the base steel index definition in 
paragraph (a) shall be ------ percent, and the proportion of the 
contract unit price attributable to the cost of steel shall be ------ 
percent. (See note 5.)

[[Page 349]]

    (c)(1) Unless otherwise specified in this contract, the labor index 
shall be computed by dividing the total straight time earnings of the 
Contractor's employees in the shop identified in paragraph (a) for any 
given month by the total number of straight time hours worked by those 
employees in that month.
    (2) Any revision in a contract unit price to reflect changes in the 
cost of labor shall be computed solely by reference to the ``base labor 
index'' and the ``current labor index.''
    (d) Any revision in a contract unit price to reflect changes in the 
cost of steel shall be computed solely by reference to the ``base steel 
index'' and the ``current steel index.''
    (e)(1) Each contract unit price shall be revised for each month in 
which delivery of supplies is required to be made.
    (2) The revised contract unit price shall apply to the deliveries of 
those quantities required to be made in that month regardless of when 
actual delivery is made.
    (3) Each revised contract unit price shall be computed by adding--
    (i) The adjusted cost of labor (obtained by multiplying ------ 
percent of the contract unit price by a fraction, of which the numerator 
shall be the current labor index and the denominator shall be the base 
labor index);
    (ii) The adjusted cost of steel (obtained by multiplying ------ 
percent of the contract unit price by a fraction, of which the numerator 
shall be the current steel index and the denominator shall be the base 
steel index); and
    (iii) The amount equal to ------ percent of the original contract 
unit price (representing that portion of the unit price which relates 
neither to the cost of labor nor the cost of steel, and which is 
therefore not subject to revision (see note 5)).
    (4) The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price under 
this contract shall not exceed ten percent of the original contract unit 
price.
    (5) Computations shall be made to the nearest one-hundredth of one 
cent.
    (f)(1) Pending any revisions of the contract unit prices, the 
Contractor shall be paid the contract unit price for deliveries made.
    (2) Within 30 days after final delivery (or such other period as may 
be authorized by the Contracting Officer), the Contractor shall furnish 
a statement identifying the correctness of--
    (i) The average straight time hourly earnings of the Contractor's 
employees in the shop identified in paragraph (a) that are relevant to 
the computations of the base labor index and the current labor index; 
and
    (ii) The Contractor's established prices (see note 6), including all 
applicable extras for like quantities of the item that are relevant to 
the computation of the base steel index and the current steel index.
    (3) Upon request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall 
make available all records used in the computation of the labor indices.
    (4) Upon receipt of the statement, the Contracting Officer will 
compute the revised contract unit prices and modify the contract 
accordingly. No modification to this contract will be made pursuant to 
this clause until the Contracting Officer has verified the revised 
established price (see note 6).
    (g)(1) In the event any item of this contract is subject to a total 
or partial termination for convenience, the month in which the 
Contractor receives notice of the termination, if prior to the month in 
which delivery is required, shall be considered the month in which 
delivery of the terminated item is required for the purposes of 
determining the current labor and steel indices under paragraphs (c) and 
(d).
    (2) For any item which is not terminated for convenience, the month 
in which delivery is required under the contract shall continue to apply 
for determining those indices with respect to the quantity of the non-
terminated item.
    (3) If this contract is terminated for default, any price revision 
shall be limited to the quantity of the item which has been delivered by 
the Contractor and accepted by the Government prior to receipt by the 
Contractor of the notice of termination.
    (h) If the Contractor's failure to make delivery of any required 
quantity arises out of causes beyond the control and without the fault 
or negligence of the Contractor, within the meaning of the clause of 
this contract entitled ``Default,'' the quantity not delivered shall be 
delivered as promptly as possible after the cessation of the cause of 
the failure, and the delivery schedule set forth in this contract shall 
be amended accordingly.
    Notes:
    1 Offeror insert the unit price and unit measure of the standard 
steel mill item to be used in the manufacture of the contract item.
    2 Offeror identify the standard steel mill item to be used in the 
manufacture of the contract item.
    3 Offeror insert best estimate of the number of days required for 
processing the standard steel mill item in the shop identified under the 
labor index definition.
    4 Offeror identify the shop and plant in which the standard steel 
mill item identified under the base steel index definition will be 
finally fabricated or processed into the contract item.
    5 Offeror insert the same percentage figures for the corresponding 
blanks in paragraphs (b), (e)(3)(i), and (e)(3)(ii). In paragraph 
(e)(3)(iii), insert the percentage representing the difference between 
the sum of the percentages inserted in paragraph (b) and 100 percent.

is no established price or when it is not desirable to use this price, 
this paragraph may refer to another appropriate price basis, e.g., an 
established interplant price.

contract to the extent that the Contractor's actual costs of performing 
this contract are increased or decreased, as a direct result of the

that the government named in paragraph (a) of this clause increased the 
applicable wage rate(s) or material price(s), but only if the 
Contracting Officer receives the Contractor's written request for 
contract adjustment within 10 days of the change. If the Contractor's 
request is received later, the effective date shall be the date that the 
Contracting Officer received the Contractor's request.
    (2) For decreases in established wage rates or material prices, the 
decrease in contract unit price(s) shall be effective on the same date 
that the government named in paragraph (a) of this clause decreased the 
applicable wage rate(s) or material price(s). The decrease in contract 
unit price(s) shall apply to all items delivered on and after the

    (c) No modification changing the contract unit price(s) shall be 
executed until the Contracting Officer has verified the applicable 
change in the rates or prices set by the government named in paragraph

records that support a requested change in contract price.
    (d) Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a dispute under the 
Disputes clause of this contract.

    (b) Upon submission by the Contractor of invoices in the form and

the Contracting Officer, the Government will make progress payments as 
work progresses under the job order.
    (1) Generally, the Contractor may submit invoices on a semi-monthly 
basis, unless expenditures justify a more frequent submission.
    (2) The Government need not make progress payments for invoices 
aggregating less than $5,000.
    (3) The Contracting Officer shall approve progress payments based on 
the value, computed on the price of the job order, of labor and

site of the work, and preparatory work completed, less the aggregate of 
any previous payments.
    (4) Upon request, the Contractor will furnish the Contracting 
Officer any reports concerning expenditures on the work to date that the 
Contracting Officer may require.
    (c) The Government will retain until final completion and acceptance

retained will be in accordance with the rate authorized by Congress for 
Naval vessel repair contracts at the time of job order award.
    (d) The Contracting Officer may direct that progress payments be 
based on the price of the job order as adjusted as a result of change 
orders under the Changes clause of the Master Agreement. If the 
Contracting Officer does not so direct--
    (1) Payments of any increases shall be made from time to time after 
the amount of the increase is determined under the Changes clause of the

less the amount of any previous payments.
    (f) All materials, equipment, or any other property or work in 
process covered by the progress payments made by the Government, upon 
the making of those progress payments, shall become the sole property of 
the Government, and are subject to the provisions of the Title clause of 
the Master Agreement.

the Offeror may furnish, instead, an annual bid bond (or evidence 
thereof) or an annual performance and payment bond (or evidence 
thereof).
    (b) If the solicitation does not require a bid bond, the Offeror 
shall not include in the price any contingency to cover the premium of 
such a bond.
    (c) Even if the solicitation does not require bonds, the Contracting 
Officer may nevertheless require a performance and payment bond, in 
form, amount, and with a surety acceptable to the Contracting Officer. 
Where performance and payment bond is required, the offer price shall be 
increased upon the award of the job order in an amount not to exceed the 
premium of a corporate surety bond.
    (d) If any surety upon any bond furnished in connection with a job 
order under this agreement fails to submit requested reports as to its 
financial condition or otherwise becomes unacceptable to the Government, 
the

[[Page 355]]

Contracting Officer may require the Contractor to furnish whatever 
additional security the Contracting Officer determines necessary to 
protect the interests of the Government and of persons supplying labor 
or materials in the performance of the work contemplated under the

<R05>
252.217-7009  Default.

    As prescribed in 217.7104(a), use the following clause:

                           Default (DEC 1991)

    (a) The Government may, subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) 
of this clause, by written notice of default to the Contractor, 
terminate the whole or any part of a job order if the Contractor fails 
to--
    (1) Make delivery of the supplies or to perform the services within 
the time specified in a job order or any extension;
    (2) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of the job order; 
or
    (3) Perform any of the other provisions of this agreement or a job 
order.
    (b) Except for defaults of subcontractors, the Contractor shall not 
be liable for any excess costs if failure to perform the job order 
arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or 
negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes include acts of 
God or of the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its 
sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine 
restrictions, strikes, freight embargoes, and unusually severe weather.
    (c) If the Contractor's failure to perform is caused by the default 
of a subcontractor, and if such default arises out of causes beyond the 
control of both the Contractor and subcontractor, and without the fault 
or negligence of either, the Contractor shall not be liable for any 
excess costs for failure to perform, unless the supplies or services to 
be furnished by the subcontractor were obtainable from other sources in 
sufficient time to permit the Contractor to perform the job order within 
the time specified.
    (d) If the Government terminates the job order in whole or in part 
as provided in paragraph (a) of this clause--
    (1) The Government may, upon such terms and in such manner as the 
Contracting Officer may deem appropriate, arrange for the completion of 
the work so terminated, at such plant or plants, including that of the 
Contractor, as may be designated by the Contracting Officer.
    (i) The Contractor shall continue the performance of the job order 
to the extent not terminated under the provisions of this clause.
    (ii) If the work is to be completed at the plant, the Government may 
use all tools, machinery, facilities, and equipment of the Contractor 
determined by the Contracting Office to be necessary for that purpose.
    (iii) If the cost to the Government of the work procured or 
completed (after adjusting such cost to exclude the effect of changes in 
the plans and specifications made subsequent to the date of termination) 
exceeds the price fixed for work under the job order (after adjusting 
such price on account of changes in the plans and specifications made 
before the date of termination), the Contractor, or the Contractor's 
surety, if any, shall be liable for such excess.
    (2) The Government, in addition to any other rights provided in this 
clause, may require the Contractor to transfer title and delivery to the 
Government, in the manner and to the extent directed by the Contracting 
Officer, any completed supplies and such partially completed supplies 
and materials, parts, tools, dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, 
information and contract rights (hereinafter called ``manufacturing 
materials'') as the Contractor has specifically produced or specifically 
acquired for the performance of the terminated part of the job order.
    (i) The Contractor shall, upon direction of the Contracting Officer, 
protect and preserve property in possession of the Contractor in which 
the Government has an interest.
    (ii) The Government shall pay to the Contractor the job order price 
for completed items of work delivered to and accepted by the Government, 
and the amount agreed upon by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer 
for manufacturing materials delivered to and accepted by the Government, 
and for the protection and preservation of property. Failure to agree 
shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of 
the Disputes clause.
    (e) If, after notice of termination of the job order, it is 
determined that the Contractor was not in default, or that the default 
was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the 
same as if the notice of termination had been issued for the convenience 
of the Government.
    (f) If the Contractor fails to complete the performance of a job 
order within the time specified, or any extension, the actual damage to 
the Government for the delay will be difficult or impossible to 
determine.
    (1) In lieu of actual damage, the Contractor shall pay to the 
Government as fixed, agreed, and liquidated damages for each calendar 
day of delay the amount, if any, set forth in the job order (prorated to 
the nearest hour for fractional days).

[[Page 356]]

    (2) If the Government terminates the job order, the Contractor shall 
be liable, in addition to the excess costs provided in paragraph (d) of 
this clause, for liquidated damages accruing until such time as the 
Government may reasonably obtain completion of the work.
    (3) The Contractor shall not be charged with liquidated damages when 
the delay arises out of causes beyond the control and without the fault 
or negligence of the Contractor. Subject to the provisions of the 
Disputes clause of the Master Agreement, the Contracting Officer shall 
ascertain the facts and the extent of the delay and shall extend the 
time for performance when in the judgment of the Contracting Officer, 
the findings of fact justify an extension.
    (g) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this 
clause shall not be exclusive and are in addition to any other rights 
and remedies provided by law under this agreement.

specified elsewhere in the contract.
    (2) The Contractor has 30 days from the date of notification by the

within the time period specified by the Contracting Officer, the 
Government has the right to direct the Contractor to cease performance 
on all or part of this contract. The Contractor shall not resume

corrective action was effective and the Contracting Officer so informs 
the Contractor.
    (4) The Contracting Officer may remove Government personnel at any 
time the Contractor is in noncompliance with any safety requirement of 
this clause.
    (5) If the direction to cease work or the removal of Government 
personnel results in increased costs to the Contractor, the Contractor 
shall not be entitled to an adjustment in the contract price or a change 
in the delivery or performance schedule unless the Contracting Officer 
later determines that the Contractor had in fact complied with the 
manual or schedule provisions. If the Contractor is entitled to an 
equitable adjustment, it shall be made in accordance with the Changes

Contractor of its responsibility for contract performance.

enforcement of the safety requirements of this contract, this does not 
impose or add to any liability of the Government.
    (g) Subcontractors. (1) The Contractor shall insert this clause, 
including this paragraph (g), in every subcontract that involves 
ammunition or explosives.

programs, implementation, and facilities as the Government determines 
necessary.

representative shall notify the prime Contractor of all findings 
concerning subcontractor safety and compliance with the manual. The 
Contracting Officer or authorized representative may furnish copies to 
the subcontractor. The Contractor in turn shall communicate directly 
with the subcontractor, substituting its name for references to ``the 
Government''. The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors shall also 
include provisions to allow direction to cease performance of the 
subcontract if a serious uncorrected or recurring safety deficiency 
potentially causes an imminent hazard to DoD personnel, property, or 
contract performance.

with all contract safety requirements. The Contractor will determine the 
best method for verifying the adequacy of the subcontractor's 
compliance.
    (3) The Contractor shall ensure that the subcontractor understands 
and agrees to the Government's right to access to the subcontractor's 
facilities, personnel, and safety program documentation to perform 
safety surveys. The Government performs these safety surveys of 
subcontractor facilities solely to prevent the occurrence of any mishap 
which would endanger the safety of DoD personnel or otherwise adversely 
impact upon the Government's contractual interests.
    (4) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer or 
authorized representative before issuing any subcontract when it 
involves ammunition or explosives. If the proposed subcontract 
represents a change in the place of performance, the Contractor shall 
request approval for such change in accordance with the clause of this

                     Drug-Free Work Force (SEP 1988)

    (a) Definitions. (1) Employee in a sensitive position, as used in 
this clause, means an employee who has been granted access to classified 
information; or employees in other positions that the Contractor 
determines involve national security, health or safety, or functions 
other than the foregoing requiring a high degree of trust and 
confidence.
    (2) Illegal drugs, as used in this clause, means controlled 
substances included in Schedules I and II, as defined by section 802(6) 
of title 21 of the United States Code, the possession of which is 
unlawful under chapter 13 of that title. The term ``illegal drugs'' does 
not mean the use of a controlled substance pursuant to a valid 
prescription or other uses authorized by law.
    (b) The Contractor agrees to institute and maintain a program for 
achieving the objective of a drug-free work force. While this clause 
defines criteria for such a program, contractors are encouraged to 
implement alternative approaches comparable to the criteria in paragraph 
(c) that are designed to achieve the objectives of this clause.
    (c) Contractor programs shall include the following, or appropriate 
alternatives:
    (1) Employee assistance programs emphasizing high level direction, 
education, counseling, rehabilitation, and coordination with available 
community resources;
    (2) Supervisory training to assist in identifying and addressing 
illegal drug use by Contractor employees;

[[Page 367]]

    (3) Provision for self-referrals as well as supervisory referrals to 
treatment with maximum respect for individual confidentiality consistent 
with safety and security issues;
    (4) Provision for identifying illegal drug users, including testing 
on a controlled and carefully monitored basis. Employee drug testing 
programs shall be established taking account of the following:
    (i) The Contractor shall establish a program that provides for 
testing for the use of illegal drugs by employees in sensitive 
positions. The extent of and criteria for such testing shall be 
determined by the Contractor based on considerations that include the 
nature of the work being performed under the contract, the employee's 
duties, the efficient use of Contractor resources, and the risks to 
health, safety, or national security that could result from the failure 
of an employee adequately to discharge his or her position.
    (ii) In addition, the Contractor may establish a program for 
employee drug testing--
    (A) When there is a reasonable suspicion that an employee uses 
illegal drugs; or
    (B) When an employee has been involved in an accident or unsafe 
practice;
    (C) As part of or as a follow-up to counseling or rehabilitation for 
illegal drug use;
    (D) As part of a voluntary employee drug testing program.
    (iii) The Contractor may establish a program to test applicants for 
employment for illegal drug use.
    (iv) For the purpose of administering this clause, testing for 
illegal drugs may be limited to those substances for which testing is 
prescribed by section 2.1 of subpart B of the ``Mandatory Guidelines for 
Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs'' (53 FR 11980 (April 11 1988)), 
issued by the Department of Health and Human Services.
    (d) Contractors shall adopt appropriate personnel procedures to deal 
with employees who are found to be using drugs illegally. Contractors 
shall not allow any employee to remain on duty or perform in a sensitive 
position who is found to use illegal drugs until such times as the 
Contractor, in accordance with procedures established by the Contractor, 
determines that the employee may perform in such a position.
    (e) The provisions of this clause pertaining to drug testing program 
shall not apply to the extent they are inconsistent with state or local 
law, or with an existing collective bargaining agreement; provided that 
with respect to the latter, the Contractor agrees that those issues that 
are in conflict will be a subject of negotiation at the next collective 
bargaining session.

for the conduct of research, development, test, or evaluation in 
connection with the Ballistic Missile Defense Program. However, foreign 
governments and firms are encouraged to submit offers, since this 
provision is not intended to restrict access to unique foreign expertise 
if the contract will require a level of competency unavailable in the

party, its share of the costs should be correspondingly higher; or
    (4) The U.S. Government determines that a U.S. firm cannot 
competently perform the contract at a price equal to or less than the 
price at which a foreign government or firm can perform the contract.
    (d) The offeror (----) is (----) is not a U.S. firm.

restrictions of the Buy American Act.

value of those incidental services does not exceed the value of the 
product itself.

    (i) Is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of Morocco; or
    (ii) In the case of an article that consists in whole or in part of 
materials from another country, has been substantially transformed in

225.872-1 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement.
    (10) Qualifying country component means a component mined, produced,

and outlying areas.
    (b) Unless otherwise specified, this clause applies to all items in 
the Schedule.
    (c) The Contractor shall deliver under this contract only domestic 
end products unless, in its offer, it specified delivery of qualifying 
country end products, Free Trade Agreement country end products other 
than Bahrainian end products or Moroccan end products, or other foreign 
end products in the Buy American Act--Free Trade Agreements--Balance of 
Payments Program Certificate provision of the solicitation. If the 
Contractor certified in its offer that it will deliver a qualifying 
country end product or a Free Trade Agreement country end product other

materials from another country, has been substantially transformed in 
Canada into a new and different article of commerce with a name, 
character, or use distinct from that of the article or articles from 
which it was transformed. The term refers to a product offered for 
purchase under a supply contract, but for purposes of calculating the 
value of the end product includes services (except transportation 
services) incidental to its supply, provided that the value of those 
incidental services does not exceed the value of the product itself.
    (c) The Contractor shall deliver under this contract only domestic 
end products unless, in its offer, it specified delivery of qualifying 
country, Canadian, or other foreign end products in the Buy American 
Act--Free Trade Agreements--Balance of Payments Program Certificate 
provision of the solicitation. If the Contractor certified in its offer 
that it will deliver a qualifying country end product or a Canadian end

252.227-7013  Rights in technical data--Noncommercial items.

    As prescribed in 227.7103-6(a), use the following clause:

        Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items (NOV 1995)

    (a) Definitions. As used in this clause:
    (1) Computer data base means a collection of data recorded in a form 
capable of being processed by a computer. The term does not include 
computer software.
    (2) Computer program means a set of instructions, rules, or routines 
recorded in a form that is capable of causing a computer to perform a 
specific operation or series of operations.

[[Page 397]]

    (3) Computer software means computer programs, source code, source 
code listings, object code listings, design details, algorithms, 
processes, flow charts, formulae and related material that would enable 
the software to be reproduced, recreated, or recompiled. Computer 
software does not include computer data bases or computer software 
documentation.
    (4) Computer software documentation means owner's manuals, user's 
manuals, installation instructions, operating instructions, and other 
similar items, regardless of storage medium, that explain the 
capabilities of the computer software or provide instructions for using 
the software.
    (5) Detailed manufacturing or process data means technical data that 
describe the steps, sequences, and conditions of manufacturing, 
processing or assembly used by the manufacturer to produce an item or 
component or to perform a process.
    (6) Developed means that an item, component, or process exists and 
is workable. Thus, the item or component must have been constructed or 
the process practiced. Workability is generally established when the 
item, component, or process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to 
demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that 
there is a high probability that it will operate as intended. Whether, 
how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish 
workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, 
and the state of the art. To be considered ``developed,'' the item, 
component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered 
for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component, 
or process be actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title 
35 of the United States Code.
    (7) Developed exclusively at private expense means development was 
accomplished entirely with costs charged to indirect cost pools, costs 
not allocated to a government contract, or any combination thereof.
    (i) Private expense determinations should be made at the lowest 
practicable level.
    (ii) Under fixed-price contracts, when total costs are greater than 
the firm-fixed-price or ceiling price of the contract, the additional 
development costs necessary to complete development shall not be 
considered when determining whether development was at government, 
private, or mixed expense.
    (8) Developed exclusively with government funds means development 
was not accomplished exclusively or partially at private expense.
    (9) Developed with mixed funding means development was accomplished 
partially with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not 
allocated to a government contract, and partially with costs charged 
directly to a government contract.
    (10) Form, fit, and function data means technical data that 
describes the required overall physical, functional, and performance 
characteristics (along with the qualification requirements, if 
applicable) of an item, component, or process to the extent necessary to 
permit identification of physically and functionally interchangeable 
items.
    (11) Government purpose means any activity in which the United 
States Government is a party, including cooperative agreements with 
international or multi-national defense organizations, or sales or 
transfers by the United States Government to foreign governments or 
international organizations. Government purposes include competitive 
procurement, but do not include the rights to use, modify, reproduce, 
release, perform, display, or disclose technical data for commercial 
purposes or authorize others to do so.
    (12) Government purpose rights means the rights to--
    (i) Use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose 
technical data within the Government without restriction; and
    (ii) Release or disclose technical data outside the Government and 
authorize persons to whom release or disclosure has been made to use, 
modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose that data for

part, in any manner, and for any purpose whatsoever, and to have or 
authorize others to do so.
    (b) Rights in technical data. The Contractor grants or shall obtain 
for the Government the following royalty free, world-wide, nonexclusive, 
irrevocable license rights in technical data other than computer

[[Page 399]]

and to notify the Contractor that the data have been destroyed.
    (iii) The Contractor, its subcontractors, and suppliers are not 
required to provide the Government additional rights to use, modify, 
reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data 
furnished to the Government with limited rights. However, if the 
Government desires to obtain additional rights in technical data in 
which it has limited rights, the Contractor agrees to promptly enter 
into negotiations with the Contracting Officer to determine whether 
there are acceptable terms for transferring such rights. All technical 
data in which the Contractor has granted the Government additional 
rights shall be listed or described in a license agreement made part of 
the contract. The license shall enumerate the additional rights granted 
the Government in such data.
    (4) Specifically negotiated license rights. The standard license 
rights granted to the Government under paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) 
of this clause, including the period during which the Government shall 
have government purpose rights in technical data, may be modified by 
mutual agreement to provide such rights as the parties consider

enumerated in paragraph (a)(13) of this clause. Any rights so negotiated 
shall be identified in a license agreement made part of this contract.
    (5) Prior government rights. Technical data that will be delivered, 
furnished, or otherwise provided to the Government under this contract, 
in which the Government has previously obtained rights shall be 
delivered, furnished, or provided with the pre-existing rights, unless--
    (i) The parties have agreed otherwise; or

data made in accordance with paragraph (a)(13) or (b)(2)(iii) of this 
clause, in accordance with the terms of a license negotiated under 
paragraph (b)(4) of this clause, or by others to whom the recipient has 
released or disclosed the data and to seek relief solely from the party 
who has improperly used, modified, reproduced, released, performed, 
displayed, or disclosed Contractor data marked with restrictive legends.
    (c) Contractor rights in technical data. All rights not granted to 
the Government are retained by the Contractor.
    (d) Third party copyrighted data. The Contractor shall not, without 
the written approval of the Contracting Officer, incorporate any 
copyrighted data in the technical data to be delivered under this 
contract unless the Contractor is the copyright owner or has obtained 
for the Government the license rights necessary to perfect a license or 
licenses in the deliverable data of the appropriate scope set forth in 
paragraph (b) of this clause, and has affixed a statement of the license 
or licenses obtained on behalf of the Government and other persons to 
the data transmittal document.
    (e) Identification and delivery of data to be furnished with 
restrictions on use, release, or disclosure. (1) This paragraph does not 
apply to restrictions based solely on copyright.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this clause, technical 
data that the Contractor asserts should be furnished to the Government 
with restrictions on use, release, or disclosure are identified in an 
attachment to this contract (the Attachment). The Contractor shall not 
deliver any data with restrictive markings unless the data are listed on 
the Attachment.
    (3) In addition to the assertions made in the Attachment, other 
assertions may be identified after award when based on new information 
or inadvertent omissions unless the inadvertent omissions would have 
materially affected the source selection decision. Such identification 
and assertion shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer as soon as 
practicable prior to the scheduled date for delivery of the data, in the 
following format, and signed by an official authorized to contractually 
obligate the Contractor: Identification and Assertion of Restrictions on 
the Government's Use, Release, or Disclosure of Technical Data.
    The Contractor asserts for itself, or the persons identified below, 
that the Government's rights to use, release, or disclose the following 
technical data should be restricted--

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               Name of

\2\ Generally, the development of an item, component, or process at
  private expense, either exclusively or partially, is the only basis
  for asserting restrictions on the Government's rights to use, release,
  or disclose technical data pertaining to such items, components, or
  processes. Indicate whether development was exclusively or partially
  at private expense. If development was not at private expense, enter
  the specific reason for asserting that the Government's rights should
  be restricted.

                  (End of identification and assertion)

    (4) When requested by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall 
provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to 
evaluate the Contractor's assertions. The Contracting Officer reserves 
the right to add the Contractor's assertions to the Attachment and 
validate any listed assertion, at a later date, in accordance with the 
procedures of the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data 
clause of this contract.
    (f) Marking requirements. The Contractor, and its subcontractors or 
suppliers, may only assert restrictions on the Government's rights to 
use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical 
data to be delivered under this contract by marking the deliverable data 
subject to restriction. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(5) of this 
clause, only the following legends are authorized under this contract: 
the government purpose rights legend at paragraph (f)(2) of this clause; 
the limited rights legend at paragraph (f)(3) of this clause; or the 
special license rights legend at paragraph (f)(4) of this clause; and/or 
a notice of copyright as prescribed under 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402.
    (1) General marking instructions. The Contractor, or its 
subcontractors or suppliers, shall conspicuously and legibly mark the 
appropriate legend on all technical data that qualify for such markings. 
The authorized legends shall be placed on the transmittal document or 
storage container and, for printed material, each page of the printed 
material containing technical data for which restrictions are asserted. 
When only portions of a page of printed material are subject to the 
asserted restrictions, such portions shall be identified by circling, 
underscoring, with a note, or other appropriate identifier. Technical 
data transmitted directly from one computer or computer terminal to 
another shall contain a notice of asserted restrictions. Reproductions 
of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted 
restrictions shall also reproduce the asserted restrictions.
    (2) Government purpose rights markings. Data delivered or otherwise 
furnished to the Government purpose rights shall be marked as follows:

                        Government Purpose Rights

Contract No.____________________________________________________________

Contractor Name_________________________________________________________

Contractor Address______________________________________________________

________________________________________________________________________

Expiration Date_________________________________________________________
    The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, 
display, or disclose these technical data are restricted by paragraph 
(b)(2) of the Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items clause 
contained in the above identified contract. No restrictions apply after 
the expiration date shown above. Any reproduction of technical data or 
portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the 
markings.

                             (End of legend)

    (3) Limited rights markings. Data delivered or otherwise furnished 
to the Government with limited rights shall be marked with the following 
legend:

                             Limited Rights

Contract No.____________________________________________________________

Contractor Name_________________________________________________________

Contractor Address______________________________________________________

________________________________________________________________________
    The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, 
display, or disclose these technical data are restricted by paragraph 
(b)(3) of the Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items clause 
contained in the above identified contract. Any reproduction of 
technical data or portions thereof marked with this legend must also 
reproduce the markings. Any person, other than the Government, who has 
been provided access to such data must promptly notify the above named 
Contractor.

                             (End of legend)

    (4) Special license rights markings. (i) Data in which the 
Government's rights stem from a specifically negotiated license shall be 
marked with the following legend:

                         Special License Rights

    The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, 
display, or disclose these data are restricted by Contract No. --------
-------- (Insert contract number) ----------------, License No. --------
-------- (Insert license identifier) ----------------. Any reproduction 
of technical data or portions thereof marked with this legend must also 
reproduce the markings.

                             (End of legend)

    (ii) For purposes of this clause, special licenses do not include 
government purpose license rights acquired under a prior contract (see 
paragraph (b)(5) of this clause).
    (5) Pre-existing data markings. If the terms of a prior contract or 
license permitted the Contractor to restrict the Government's rights to 
use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical 
data deliverable under this contract, and those restrictions are still 
applicable, the Contractor may mark such data with the appropriate 
restrictive legend for which the data qualified

[[Page 401]]

under the prior contract or license. The marking procedures in paragraph 
(f)(1) of this clause shall be followed.
    (g) Contractor procedures and records. Throughout performance of 
this contract, the Contractor and its subcontractors or suppliers that 
will deliver technical data with other than unlimited rights, shall--
    (1) Have, maintain, and follow written procedures sufficient to 
assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized by the 
terms of this clause; and
    (2) Maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any 
restrictive markings on technical data delivered under this contract.
    (h) Removal of unjustified and nonconforming markings--(1) 
Unjustified technical data markings. The rights and obligations of the 
parties regarding the validation of restrictive markings on technical 
data furnished or to be furnished under this contract are contained in 
the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clause of this 
contract. Notwithstanding any provision of this contract concerning 
inspection and acceptance, the Government may ignore or, at the 
Contractor's expense, correct or strike a marking if, in accordance with 
the procedures in the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical 
Data clause of this contract, a restrictive marking is determined to be 
unjustified.
    (2) Nonconforming technical data markings. A nonconforming marking 
is a marking placed on technical data delivered or otherwise furnished 
to the Government under this contract that is not in the format 
authorized by this contract. Correction of nonconforming markings is not 
subject to the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data 
clause of this contract. If the Contracting Officer notifies the 
Contractor of a nonconforming marking and the Contractor fails to remove 
or correct such marking within sixty (60) days, the Government may 
ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, remove or correct any 
nonconforming marking.
    (i) Relation to patents. Nothing contained in this clause shall 
imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as 
affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to 
the Government under any patent.
    (j) Limitation on charges for rights in technical data. (1) The 
Contractor shall not charge to this contract any cost, including, but 
not limited to, license fees, royalties, or similar charges, for rights 
in technical data to be delivered under this contract when--
    (i) The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater 
rights in the data; or
    (ii) The data are available to the public without restrictions.
    (2) The limitation in paragraph (j)(1) of this clause--
    (i) Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any 
tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in 
subcontractor or supplier technical data, if the subcontractor or 
supplier has been paid for such rights under any other Government 
contract or under a license conveying the rights to the Government; and
    (ii) Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, 
or mailing the documents or other media in which the technical data will 
be delivered.
    (k) Applicability to subcontractors or suppliers. (1) The Contractor 
shall ensure that the rights afforded its subcontractors and suppliers 
under 10 U.S.C. 2320, 10 U.S.C. 2321, and the identification, assertion, 
and delivery processes of paragraph (e) of this clause are recognized 
and protected.
    (2) Whenever any technical data for noncommercial items is to be 
obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the Government 
under this contract, the Contractor shall use this same clause in the 
subcontract or other contractual instrument, and require its 
subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to 
identify the parties. No other clause shall be used to enlarge or 
diminish the Government's, the Contractor's, or a higher-tier 
subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's 
technical data.
    (3) Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or 
supplier shall normally be delivered to the next higher-tier contractor, 
subcontractor, or supplier. However, when there is a requirement in the 
prime contract for data which may be submitted with other than unlimited 
rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor or 
supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such data directly to 
the Government, rather than through a higher-tier contractor, 
subcontractor, or supplier.
    (4) The Contractor and higher-tier subcontractors or suppliers shall 
not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain 
rights in technical data from their subcontractors or suppliers.
    (5) In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize 
and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data as an 
excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligations to the 
Government.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (JUN 1995). As prescribed in 227.7103-6(b), add the 
following paragraph (l) to the basic clause:

    (l) Publication for sale. (1) This paragraph only applies to 
technical data in which the Government has obtained unlimited rights or 
a license to make an unrestricted release of technical data.

[[Page 402]]

    (2) The Government shall not publish a deliverable technical data 
item or items identified in this contract as being subject to paragraph 
(l) of this clause or authorize others to publish such data on its 
behalf if, prior to publication for sale by the Government and within 
twenty-four (24) months following the date specified in this contract 
for delivery of such data or the removal of any national security or 
export control restrictions, whichever is later, the Contractor 
publishes that item or items for sale and promptly notifies the 
Contracting Officer of such publication(s). Any such publication shall 
include a notice identifying the number of this contract and the 
Government's rights in the published data.
    (3) This limitation on the Government's right to publish for sale 
shall continue as long as the data are reasonably available to the 
public for purchase.

another shall contain a notice of asserted restrictions. However, 
instructions that interfere with or delay the operation of computer 
software in order to display a restrictive rights legend or other 
license statement at any time prior to or during use of the computer 
software, or otherwise cause such interference or delay, shall not be 
inserted in software that will or might be used in combat or situations 
that simulate combat conditions, unless the Contracting Officer's 
written permission to deliver such software has been obtained prior to 
delivery. Reproductions of computer software or any portions thereof 
subject to asserted restrictions, shall also reproduce the asserted 
restrictions.
    (2) Government purpose rights markings. Computer software delivered 
or otherwise furnished to the Government with government purpose rights 
shall be marked as follows:

    (ii) For purposes of this clause, special licenses do not include 
government purpose license rights acquired under a prior contract (see 
paragraph (b)(5) of this clause).
    (5) Pre-existing markings. If the terms of a prior contract or 
license permitted the Contractor to restrict the Government's rights to 
use, modify, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software or 
computer software documentation and those restrictions are still 
applicable, the Contractor may mark such software or documentation with 
the appropriate restrictive legend for which the software qualified 
under the prior contract or license. The marking procedures in paragraph 
(f)(1) of this clause shall be followed.
    (g) Contractor procedures and records. Throughout performance of 
this contract, the Contractor and its subcontractors or suppliers that 
will deliver computer software or computer software documentation with 
other than unlimited rights, shall--
    (1) Have, maintain, and follow written procedures sufficient to 
assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized by the 
terms of this clause; and

a marking if, in accordance with the procedures of those clauses, a 
restrictive marking is determined to be unjustified.
    (2) Nonconforming computer software or computer software 
documentation markings. A nonconforming marking is a marking placed on 
computer software or computer software documentation delivered or 
otherwise furnished to the Government under this contract that is not in 
the format authorized by this contract. Correction of nonconforming 
markings is not subject to the Validation of Asserted Restrictions--
Computer Software or the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical 
Data clause of this contract. If the Contracting Officer notifies the 
Contractor of a nonconforming marking or markings and the Contractor 
fails to remove or correct such markings within sixty (60) days, the 
Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, remove or correct 
any nonconforming markings.
    (i) Relation to patents. Nothing contained in this clause shall 
imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as 
affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to 
the Government under any patent.
    (j) Limitation on charges for rights in computer software or 
computer software documentation. (1) The Contractor shall not charge to 
this contract any cost, including but not limited to license fees, 
royalties, or similar charges, for rights in computer software or 
computer software documentation to be delivered under this contract 
when--
    (i) The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater 
rights in the software or documentation; or

without restrictions.
    (2) The limitation in paragraph (j)(1) of this clause--
    (i) Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any 
tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in 
subcontractor or supplier computer software or computer software 
documentation, if the subcontractor or supplier has been paid for such 
rights under any other Government contract or under a license conveying 
the rights to the Government; and
    (ii) Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, 
or mailing the documents or other media in which the software or 
documentation will be delivered.
    (k) Applicability to subcontractors or suppliers. (1) Whenever any 
noncommercial computer software or computer software documentation is to 
be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the 
Government under this contract, the Contractor shall use this same 
clause in its subcontracts or other contractual instruments, and require 
its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to 
identify the parties. No other clause shall be used to enlarge or 
diminish the Government's, the Contractor's, or a higher tier 
subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's 
computer software or computer software documentation.
    (2) The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors or suppliers shall 
not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain 
rights in computer software or computer software documentation from 
their subcontractors or suppliers.
    (3) The Contractor shall ensure that subcontractor or supplier 
rights are recognized and protected in the identification, assertion, 
and delivery processes required by paragraph (e) of this clause.
    (4) In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize 
and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in computer software or 
computer software documentation as an excuse for failing to satisfy its 
contractual obligation to the Government.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (JUN 1995). As prescribed in 227.7203-6(a)(2), add the

months following the date specified in this contract for delivery of 
such software or documentation, or the removal of any national security 
or export control restrictions, whichever is later, the Contractor 
publishes that item or items for sale and promptly notifies the 
Contracting Officer of such publication(s). Any such publication shall 
include a notice identifying the number of this contract and the 
Government's rights in the published software or documentation.
    (3) This limitation on the Government's rights to publish for sale 
shall continue as long as the software or documentation are reasonably

<R05>
252.227-7018  Rights in noncommercial technical data and computer software--Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program.

    As prescribed in 227.7104(a), use the following clause:

  Rights in Noncommercial Technical Data and Computer Software--Small 
         Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program (JUN 1995)

    (a) Definitions. As used in this clause:
    (1) Commercial computer software means software developed or 
regularly used for nongovernmental purposes which--
    (i) Has been sold, leased, or licensed to the public;
    (ii) Has been offered for sale, lease, or license to the public;
    (iii) Has not been offered, sold, leased, or licensed to the public 
but will be available for commercial sale, lease, or license in time to 
satisfy the delivery requirements of this contract; or
    (iv) Satisfies a criterion expressed in paragraph (a)(1)(i), (ii), 
or (iii) of this clause and would require only minor modification to 
meet the requirements of this contract.
    (2) Computer database means a collection of recorded data in a form 
capable of being processed by a computer. The term does not include 
computer software.
    (3) Computer program means a set of instructions, rules, or 
routines, recorded in a form that is capable of causing a computer to 
perform a specific operation or series of operations.
    (4) Computer software means computer programs, source code, source 
code listings, object code listings, design details, algorithms, 
processes, flow charts, formulae, and related material that would enable 
the software to be reproduced, re-created, or recompiled. Computer 
software does not include computer databases or computer software 
documentation.
    (5) Computer software documentation means owner's manuals, user's 
manuals, installation instructions, operating instructions, and other 
similar items, regardless of storage medium, that explain the 
capabilities of

[[Page 411]]

the computer software or provide instructions for using the software.
    (6) Detailed manufacturing or process data means technical data that 
describe the steps, sequences, and conditions of manufacturing, 
processing or assembly used by the manufacturer to produce an item or 
component or to perform a process.
    (7) Developed means--
    (i) (Applicable to technical data other than computer software 
documentation.) An item, component, or process, exists and is workable. 
Thus, the item or component must have been constructed or the process 
practiced. Workability is generally established when the item, 
component, or process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to 
demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that 
there is a high probability that it will operate as intended. Whether, 
how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish 
workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, 
and the state of the art. To be considered ``developed,'' the item, 
component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered 
for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component 
or process be actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title 
35 of the United States Code;
    (ii) A computer program has been successfully operated in a computer 
and tested to the extent sufficient to demonstrate to reasonable persons 
skilled in the art that the program can reasonably be expected to 
perform its intended purpose;
    (iii) Computer software, other than computer programs, has been 
tested or analyzed to the extent sufficient to demonstrate to reasonable 
persons skilled in the art that the software can reasonably be expected 
to perform its intended purpose; or
    (iv) Computer software documentation required to be delivered under 
a contract has been written, in any medium, in sufficient detail to 
comply with requirements under that contract.
    (8) Developed exclusively at private expense means development was 
accomplished entirely with costs charged to indirect cost pools, costs 
not allocated to a government contract, or any combination thereof.
    (i) Private expense determinations should be made at the lowest 
practicable level.
    (ii) Under fixed-price contracts, when total costs are greater than 
the firm-fixed-price or ceiling price of the contract, the additional 
development costs necessary to complete development shall not be 
considered when determining whether development was at government, 
private, or mixed expense.
    (9) Developed exclusively with government funds means development 
was not accomplished exclusively or partially at private expense.
    (10) Developed with mixed funding means development was accomplished 
partially with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not 
allocated to a government contract, and partially with costs charged 
directly to a government contract.
    (11) Form, fit, and function data means technical data that describe 
the required overall physical, functional, and performance 
characteristics (along with the qualification requirements, if 
applicable) of an item, component, or process to the extent necessary to 
permit identification of physically and functionally interchangeable 
items.
    (12) Generated means technical data or computer software first 
created in the performance of this contract.
    (13) Government purpose means any activity in which the United 
States Government is a party, including cooperative agreements with 
international or multi-national defense organizations or sales or 
transfers by the United States Government to foreign governments or 
international organizations. Government purposes include competitive 
procurement, but do not include the rights to use, modify, reproduce, 
release, perform, display, or disclose technical data or computer 
software for commercial purposes or authorize others to do so.
    (14) Limited rights means the rights to use, modify, reproduce, 
release, perform, display, or disclose technical data, in whole or in 
part, within the Government. The Government may not, without the written 
permission of the party asserting limited rights, release or disclose 
the technical data outside the Government, use the technical data for 
manufacture, or permit the technical data to be used by another party, 
except that the Government may reproduce, release or disclose such data 
or permit the use or reproduction of the data by persons outside the 
Government if reproduction, release, disclosure, or use is--
    (i) Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or
    (ii) A release or disclosure of technical data (other than detailed 
manufacturing or process data) to, or use of such data by, a foreign 
government that is in the interest of the Government and is required for 
evaluational or informational purposes;
    (iii) Subject to a prohibition on the further reproduction, release 
disclosure, or use of the technical data; and
    (iv) The Contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction is 
notified of such reproduction, release, disclosure, or use.
    (15) Minor modification means a modification that does not 
significantly alter the nongovernmental function or purpose of computer 
software or is of the type customarily provided in the commercial 
marketplace.
    (16) Noncommercial computer software means software that does not 
qualify as commercial

[[Page 412]]

computer software under paragraph (a)(1) of this clause.

(i) and (iii) of this clause; and
    (B) Not release or disclose the modified software except as provided 
in paragraphs (a)(17) (ii), (v) and (vi) of this clause;
    (v) Permit contractors or subcontractors performing service 
contracts (see 37.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation) in support 
of this or a related contract to use computer software to diagnose and 
correct deficiencies in a computer program, to modify computer software 
to enable a computer program to be combined with, adapted to, or merged 
with other computer programs or when necessary to respond to urgent 
tactical situations, provided that--
    (A) The Government notifies the party which has granted restricted

software for which restrictions are asserted. When only portions of a 
page of printed material are subject to the asserted restrictions, such 
portions shall be identified by circling, underscoring, with a note, or 
other appropriate identifier. Technical data or computer software 
transmitted directly from one computer or computer terminal to another 
shall contain a notice of asserted restrictions. However, instructions 
that interfere with or delay the operation of computer software in order 
to display a restrictive rights legend or other license statement at any 
time prior to or during use of the computer software, or otherwise cause 
such interference or delay, shall not be inserted in software that will 
or might be used in combat or situations that simulate combat 
conditions, unless the Contracting Officer's written permission to 
deliver such software has been obtained prior to delivery. Reproductions 
of technical data, computer software, or any portions thereof subject to 
asserted restrictions shall also reproduce the asserted restrictions.

Expiration of SBIR Data Rights Period___________________________________

The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, 
display, or disclose technical data or computer software marked with 
this legend are restricted during the period shown as provided in 
paragraph (b)(4) of the Rights in Noncommercial Technical Data and 
Computer Software--Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Program 
clause contained in the above identified contract. No restrictions apply 
after the expiration date shown above. Any reproduction of technical 
data, computer software, or portions thereof marked with this legend 
must also reproduce the markings.

                             (End of legend)

    (5) Special license rights markings. (i) Technical data or computer 
software in which the Government's rights stem from a specifically 
negotiated license shall be marked with the following legend:

                         Special License Rights

    The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, 
display, or disclose this technical data or computer software are 
restricted by Contract No. ---------------- (Insert contract number) --
--------------, License No. ---------------- (Insert license identifier) 
----------------. Any reproduction of technical data, computer software, 
or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the 
markings.

                             (End of legend)

    (ii) For purposes of this clause, special licenses do not include 
government purpose license rights acquired under a prior contract (see 
paragraph (b)(6) of this clause).
    (6) Pre-existing data markings. If the terms of a prior contract or 
license permitted the Contractor to restrict the Government's rights to 
use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical 
data or computer software, and those restrictions are still applicable, 
the Contractor may mark such data or software with the appropriate 
restrictive legend for which the data or software qualified under the 
prior contract or license. The marking procedures in paragraph (f)(1) of 
this clause shall be followed.

[[Page 416]]

    (g) Contractor procedures and records. Throughout performance of 
this contract, the Contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers that 
will deliver technical data or computer software with other than 
unlimited rights, shall--
    (1) Have, maintain, and follow written procedures sufficient to 
assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized by the 
terms of this clause; and
    (2) Maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any 
restrictive markings on technical data or computer software delivered 
under this contract.
    (h) Removal of unjustified and nonconforming markings--(1) 
Unjustified markings. The rights and obligations of the parties 
regarding the validation of restrictive markings on technical data or 
computer software furnished or to be furnished under this contract are 
contained in the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data 
and the Validation of Asserted Restrictions--Computer Software clauses 
of this contract, respectively. Notwithstanding any provision of this 
contract concerning inspection and acceptance, the Government may ignore 
or, at the Contractor's expense, correct or strike a marking if, in 
accordance with the applicable procedures of those clauses, a 
restrictive marking is determined to be unjustified.
    (2) Nonconforming markings. A nonconforming marking is a marking 
placed on technical data or computer software delivered or otherwise 
furnished to the Government under this contract that is not in the 
format authorized by this contract. Correction of nonconforming markings 
is not subject to the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical 
Data or the Validation of Asserted Restrictions--Computer Software 
clause of this contract. If the Contracting Officer notifies the 
Contractor of a nonconforming marking or markings and the Contractor 
fails to remove or correct such markings within sixty (6)) days, the 
Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, remove or correct 
any nonconforming markings.
    (i) Relation to patents. Nothing contained in this clause shall 
imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as 
affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to 
the Government under any patent.
    (j) Limitation on charges for rights in technical data or computer 
software. (1) The Contractor shall not charge to this contract any cost, 
including but not limited to, license fees, royalties, or similar 
charges, for rights in technical data or computer software to be 
delivered under this contract when--
    (i) The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater 
rights in the data or software; or
    (ii) The data are available to the public without restrictions.
    (2) The limitation in paragraph (j)(1) of this clause--
    (i) Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any 
tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in 
subcontractor of supplier technical data or computer software, if the 
subcontractor or supplier has been paid for such rights under any other 
Government contract or under a license conveying the rights to the 
Government; and
    (ii) Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, 
or mailing the documents or other media in which the technical data or 
computer software will be delivered.
    (k) Applicability to subcontractors or suppliers. (1) the Contractor 
shall assure that the rights afforded its subcontractors and suppliers 
under 10 U.S.C. 2320, 10 U.S.C. 2321, and the identification, assertion, 
and delivery processes required by paragraph (e) of this clause are 
recognized and protected.
    (2) Whenever any noncommercial technical data or computer software 
is to be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the 
Government under this contract, the Contractor shall use this same 
clause in the subcontract or other contractual instrument, and require 
its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to 
identify the parties. The Contractor shall use the Technical Data--
Commercial Items clause of this contract to obtain technical data 
pertaining to commercial items, components, or processes. No other 
clause shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government's, the 
Contractor's, or a higher tier subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a 
subcontractor's or supplier's technical data or computer software.
    (3) Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or 
supplier shall normally be delivered to the next higher tier contractor, 
subcontractor, or supplier. However, when there is a requirement in the 
prime contract for technical data which may be submitted with other than 
unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor 
or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such technical 
data directly to the Government, rather than through a higher tier 
contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.
    (4) The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors or suppliers shall 
not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain 
rights in technical data or computer software from their subcontractors 
or suppliers.
    (5) In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize 
and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data or 
computer software as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual 
obligation to the Government.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (JUN 1995). As prescribed in 227.7104(d), add the 
following paragraph (l) to the basic clause:

    (l) Publication for sale. (1) This paragraph applies only to 
technical data or computer software delivered to the Government with 
SBIR data rights.
    (2) Upon expiration of the SBIR data rights period, the Government 
will not exercise its right to publish or authorize others to publish an 
item of technical data or computer software identified in this contract 
as being subject to paragraph (l) of this clause if the Contractor, 
prior to the expiration of the SBIR data rights period, or within two 
years following delivery of the data or software item, or within twenty-
four months following the removal of any national security or export 
control restrictions, whichever is later, publishes such data or 
software item(s) and promptly notifies the Contracting Officer of such 
publication(s). Any such publication(s) shall include a notice 
identifying the number of this contract and the Government's rights in 
the published data.
    (3) This limitation on the Government's right to publish for sale 
shall continue as long as the technical data or computer software are 
reasonably available to the public for purchase.

[60 FR 33499, June 28, 1995, as amended at 60 FR 61602, Nov. 30, 1995]


<R05>
252.227-7019  Validation of asserted restrictions--Computer software.

    As prescribed in 227.7104(e)(3) or 227.7203-6(c), use the following 
clause:

    Validation of Asserted Restrictions--Computer Software (JUN 1995)

    (a) Definitions. (1) As used in this clause, unless otherwise 
specifically indicated, the term ``Contractor'' means the Contractor and 
its subcontractors or suppliers.
    (2) Other terms used in this clause are defined in the Rights in 
Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software 
Documentation clause of this contract.
    (b) Justification. The Contractor shall maintain records sufficient 
to justify the validity of any markings that assert restrictions on the 
Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, perform, display, 
release, or disclose computer software delivered or required to be 
delivered under this contract and shall be prepared to furnish to the 
Contracting Officer a written justification for such restrictive 
markings in response to a request for information under paragraph (d) or 
a challenge under paragraph (f) of this clause.
    (c) Direct contact with subcontractors or suppliers. The Contractor 
agrees that the Contracting Officer may transact matters under this 
clause directly with subcontractors or suppliers at any tier who assert 
restrictions on the Government's right to use, modify, reproduce, 
release, perform, display, or disclose computer software. Neither this 
clause, nor any action taken by the Government under this clause, 
creates or implies privity of contract between the Government and the 
Contractor's subcontractors or suppliers.
    (d) Requests for information. (1) The Contracting Officer may 
request the Contractor to provide sufficient information to enable the 
Contracting Officer to evaluate the Contractor's asserted restrictions. 
Such information shall be based upon the records required by this clause 
or other information reasonably available to the Contractor.
    (2) Based upon the information provided, if the--
    (i) Contractor agrees that an asserted restriction is not valid, the 
Contracting Officer may--
    (A) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at the Contractor's 
expense; or
    (B) Return the computer software to the Contractor for correction at 
the Contractor's expense. If the Contractor fails to correct or strike 
the unjustified restrictions and return the corrected software to the 
Contracting Officer within sixty (60) days following receipt of the 
software, the Contracting Officer may correct the strike the markings at 
the Contractor's expense.
    (ii) Contracting Officer concludes that the asserted restriction is 
appropriate for this contract, the Contracting Officer shall so notify 
the Contractor in writing.
    (3) The Contractor's failure to provide a timely response to a 
Contracting Officer's request for information or failure to provide 
sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate an 
asserted restriction shall constitute reasonable grounds for questioning 
the validity of an asserted restriction.
    (e) Government right to challenge and validate asserted 
restrictions. (1) The Government, when there are reasonable grounds to 
do so, has the right to review and challenge the validity of any 
restrictions asserted by the Contractor on the Government's rights to 
use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer 
software delivered, to be delivered under this contract, or otherwise 
provided to the Government in the performance of this contract. Except 
for software that is publicly available, has been furnished to the 
Government without restrictions, or has been otherwise made available 
without restrictions, the Government may exercise this right only within 
three

[[Page 418]]

years after the date(s) the software is delivered or otherwise furnished 
to the Government, or three years following final payment under this 
contract, whichever is later.
    (2) The absence of a challenge to an asserted restriction shall not 
constitute validation under this clause. Only a Contracting Officer's 
final decision or actions of an agency Board of Contract Appeals or a 
court of competent jurisdiction that sustain the validity of an asserted 
restriction constitute validation of the restriction.
    (f) Challenge procedures. (1) A challenge must be in writing and 
shall--
    (i) State the specific grounds for challenging the asserted 
restriction;
    (ii) Require the Contractor to respond within sixty (60) days;
    (iii) Require the Contractor to provide justification for the 
assertion based upon records kept in accordance with paragraph (b) of 
this clause and such other documentation that are reasonably available 
to the Contractor, in sufficient detail to enable the Contracting 
Officer to determine the validity of the asserted restrictions; and
    (iv) State that a Contracting Officer's final decision, during the 
three-year period preceding this challenge, or action of a court of 
competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals that sustained the 
validity of an identical assertion made by the Contractor (or a 
licensee) shall serve as justification for the asserted restriction.
    (2) The Contracting Officer shall extend the time for response if 
the Contractor submits a written request showing the need for additional 
time to prepare a response.
    (3) The Contracting Officer may request additional supporting 
documentation if, in the Contracting Officer's opinion, the Contractor's 
explanation does not provide sufficient evidence to justify the validity 
of the asserted restrictions. The Contractor agrees to promptly respond 
to the Contracting Officer's request for additional supporting 
documentation.
    (4) Notwithstanding challenge by the Contracting Officer, the 
parties may agree on the disposition of an asserted restriction at any 
time prior to a Contracting Officer's final decision or, if the 
Contractor has appealed that decision, filed suit, or provided notice of 
an intent to file suit, at any time prior to a decision by a court of 
competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals.
    (5) If the Contractor fails to respond to the Contracting Officer's 
request for information or additional information under paragraph (f)(1) 
of this clause, the Contracting Officer shall issue a final decision, in 
accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract, pertaining to the 
validity of the asserted restriction.
    (6) If the Contracting Officer, after reviewing the written 
explanation furnished pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this clause, or 
any other available information pertaining to the validity of an 
asserted restriction, determines that the asserted restriction has--
    (i) Not been justified, the Contracting Officer shall issue promptly 
a final decision, in accordance with the Disputes clause of this 
contract, denying the validity of the asserted restriction; or
    (ii) Been justified, the Contracting Officer shall issue promptly a 
final decision, in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract, 
validating the asserted restriction.
    (7) A Contractor receiving challenges to the same asserted 
restriction(s) from more than one Contracting Officer shall notify each 
Contracting Officer of the other challenges. The notice shall also state 
which Contracting Officer initiated the first in time unanswered 
challenge. The Contracting Officer who initiated the first in time 
unanswered challenge, after consultation with the other Contracting 
Officers who have challenged the restrictions and the Contractor, shall 
formulate and distribute a schedule that provides the contractor a 
reasonable opportunity for responding to each challenge.
    (g) Contractor appeal--Government obligation. (1) The Government 
agrees that, notwithstanding a Contracting Officer's final decision 
denying the validity of an asserted restriction and except as provided 
in paragraph (g)(3) of this clause, it will honor the asserted 
restriction--
    (i) For a period of ninety (90) days from the date of the 
Contracting Officer's final decision to allow the Contractor to appeal 
to the appropriate Board of Contract Appeals or to file suit in an 
appropriate court;
    (ii) For a period of one year from the date of the Contracting 
Officer's final decision if, within the first ninety (90) days following 
the Contracting Officer's final decision, the Contractor has provided 
notice of an intent to file suit in an appropriate court; or
    (iii) Until final disposition by the appropriate Board of Contract 
Appeals or court of competent jurisdiction, if the Contractor has: (A) 
appealed to the Board of Contract Appeals or filed suit an appropriate 
court within ninety (90) days; or (B) submitted, within ninety (90) 
days, a notice of intent to file suit in an appropriate court and filed 
suit within one year.
    (2) The Contractor agrees that the Government may strike, correct, 
or ignore the restrictive markings if the Contractor fails to--
    (i) Appeal to a Board of Contract Appeals within ninety (90) days 
from the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision;
    (ii) File suit in an appropriate court within ninety (90) days from 
such date; or
    (iii) File suit within one year after the date of the Contracting 
Officer's final decision if the Contractor had provided notice of

[[Page 419]]

intent to file suit within ninety (90) days following the date of the 
Contracting Officer's final decision.
    (3) The agency head, on a nondelegable basis, may determine that 
urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit awaiting the filing of 
suit in an appropriate court, or the rendering of a decision by a court 
of competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals. In that event, 
the agency head shall notify the Contractor of the urgent or compelling 
circumstances. Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(1) of this clause, the 
Contractor agrees that the agency may use, modify, reproduce, release, 
perform, display, or disclose computer software marked with (i) 
government purpose legends for any purpose, and authorize others to do 
so; or (ii) restricted or special license rights for government purposes 
only. The Government agrees not to release or disclose such software 
unless, prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is 
subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7 of the 
Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), or is a 
Government contractor receiving access to the software for performance 
of a Government contract that contains the clause at DFARS 252.227-7025, 
Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information 
Marked with Restrictive Legends. The agency head's determination may be 
made at any time after the date of the Contracting Officer's final 
decision and shall not affect the Contractor's right to damages against 
the United States, or other relief provided by law, if its asserted 
restrictions are ultimately upheld.
    (h) Final disposition of appeal or suit. If the Contractor appeals 
or files suit and if, upon final disposition of the appeal or suit, the 
Contracting Officer's decision is:
    (1) Sustained--
    (i) Any restrictive marking on such computer software shall be 
struck or corrected at the contractor's expense or ignored; and
    (ii) If the asserted restriction is found not to be substantially 
justified, the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for payment 
of the cost to the Government of reviewing the asserted restriction and 
the fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) 
incurred by the Government in challenging the restriction, unless 
special circumstances would make such payment unjust.
    (2) Not sustained--
    (i) The Government shall be bound by the asserted restriction; and
    (ii) If the challenge by the Government is found not to have been 
made in good faith, the Government shall be liable to the Contractor for 
payment of fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 
2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Contractor in defending the restriction.
    (i) Flowdown. The Contractor shall insert this clause in all 
contracts, purchase orders, and other similar instruments with its 
subcontractors or suppliers, at any tier, who will be furnishing 
computer software to the Government in the performance of this contract. 
The clause may not be altered other than to identify the appropriate 
parties.

extent practicable, make maximum use of structures, machines, products, 
materials, construction methods, and equipment that are readily 
available through Government or competitive commercial channels, or 
through standard or proven production techniques, methods, and

shall not produce a design or specification that requires in this 
construction work the use of structures, products, materials, 
construction equipment, or processes that are known by the Contractor to 
be available only from a sole source. The Contractor shall promptly 
report any such design or specification to the Contracting Officer and 
give the reason why it is considered necessary to so restrict the design

Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information 
               Marked With Restrictive Legends (JUN 1995)

    (a)(1) For contracts requiring the delivery of technical data, the 
terms ``limited rights'' and ``Government purpose rights'' are defined 
in the Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items clause of this 
contract.
    (2) For contracts that do not require the delivery of technical 
data, the terms ``government purpose rights'' and ``restricted rights'' 
are defined in the Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and 
Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation clause of this contract.
    (3) For Small Business Innovative Research program contracts, the 
terms ``limited rights'' and ``restricted rights'' are defined in the 
Rights in Noncommercial Technical Data and Computer Software--Small 
Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Program clause of this contract.
    (b) Technical data or computer software provided to the Contractor 
as Government furnished information (GFI) under this contract may be 
subject to restrictions on use, modification, reproduction, release, 
performance, display, or further disclosure.
    (1) GFI marked with limited or restricted rights legends. The 
Contractor shall use, modify, reproduce, perform, or display technical 
data received from the Government with limited rights legends or 
computer software received with restricted rights legends only in the 
performance of this contract. The Contractor shall not, without the 
express written permission of the party whose name appears in the 
legend, release or disclose such data or software to any person.
    (2) GFI marked with government purpose rights legends. The 
Contractor shall use technical data or computer software received from 
the Government with government purpose rights legends for government 
purposes only. The Contractor shall not, without the express written

use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, or display such data or 
software for any commercial purpose or disclose such data or software to 
a person other than its

the Contractor shall require the persons to whom disclosure will be made 
to complete and sign the non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7 of the 
Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS).
    (3) GFI marked with specially negotiated license rights legends. The 
Contractor shall use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, or display 
technical data or computer software received from the Government with 
specially negotiated license legends only as permitted in the license. 
Such data or software may not be released or disclosed to other persons 
unless permitted by the license and, prior to release or disclosure, the 
intended recipient has completed the non-disclosure agreement at DFARS 
227.7103-7. The Contractor shall modify paragraph (1)(c) of the non-
disclosure agreement to reflect the recipient's obligations regarding 
use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, and 
disclosure of the data or software.
    (c) Indemnification and creation of third party beneficiary rights. 
The Contractor agrees--
    (1) To indemnify and hold harmless the Government, its agents, and 
employees from every claim or liability, including attorneys fees, court 
costs, and expenses, arising out of, or in any way related to, the 
misuse or unauthorized modification, reproduction, release, performance, 
display, or disclosure of technical data or computer software received 
from the Government with restrictive legends by the Contractor or any 
person to whom the Contractor has released or disclosed such data or 
software; and
    (2) That the party whose name appears on the restrictive legend, in 
addition to any other rights it may have, is a third party beneficiary 
who has the right of direct action against the Contractor, or any person 
to whom the Contractor has released or disclosed such data or software, 
for the unauthorized duplication, release, or disclosure of technical 
data or computer software subject to restrictive legends.

Contractor of ten percent (10%) of the total contract price or amount 
unless a lesser withholding is specified in the contract. Payments shall 
not be withheld nor any other action taken pursuant to this paragraph

227.7203-6(f), use the following clause:

     Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data (SEP 1999)

    (a) Definitions. The terms used in this clause are defined in the 
Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items clause of this contract.
    (b) Contracts for commercial items--presumption of development at 
private expense. Under a contract for a commercial item, component, or 
process, the Department of Defense shall presume that a Contractor's 
asserted use or release restrictions are justified on the basis that the 
item, component, or process was developed exclusively at private 
expense. The Department shall not challenge such assertions unless 
information the Department provides demonstrates that the item, 
component, or process was not developed exclusively at private expense.
    (c) Justification. The Contractor or subcontractor at any tier is 
responsible for maintaining records sufficient to justify the validity 
of its markings that impose restrictions on the Government and others to 
use, duplicate, or disclose technical data delivered or required to be 
delivered under the contract or subcontract. Except under contracts for 
commercial items, the Contractor or subcontractor shall be prepared to 
furnish to the Contracting Officer a written justification for such 
restrictive markings in response to a challenge under paragraph (e) of 
this clause.
    (d) Prechallenge request for information. (1) The Contracting 
Officer may request the Contractor or subcontractor to furnish a written 
explanation for any restriction asserted by the Contractor or 
subcontractor on the right of the United States or others to use 
technical data. If, upon review of the explanation submitted, the 
Contracting Officer remains unable to ascertain the basis of the 
restrictive marking, the Contracting Officer may further request the 
Contractor or subcontractor to furnish additional information in the 
records of, or otherwise in the possession of or reasonably available 
to, the Contractor or subcontractor to justify the validity of any 
restrictive marking on technical data delivered or to be delivered under 
the contract or subcontract (e.g., a statement of facts accompanied with 
supporting documentation). The Contractor or subcontractor shall submit 
such written data as requested by the Contracting Officer within the 
time required or such longer period as may be mutually agreed.
    (2) If the Contracting Officer, after reviewing the written data 
furnished pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this clause, or any other 
available information pertaining to the validity of a restrictive 
marking, determines that reasonable grounds exist to question the 
current validity of the marking and that continued adherence to the 
marking would make impracticable the subsequent competitive acquisition 
of the item, component, or process to which the technical data relates, 
the Contracting Officer shall follow the procedures in paragraph (e) of 
this clause.
    (3) If the Contractor or subcontractor fails to respond to the 
Contracting Officer's request for information under paragraph (d)(1) of 
this clause, and the Contracting Officer determines that continued 
adherence to the marking would make impracticable the subsequent 
competitive acquisition of the item, component, or process to which the 
technical data relates, the Contracting Officer may challenge the 
validity of the marking as described in paragraph (e) of this clause.
    (e) Challenge. (1) Notwithstanding any provision of this contract 
concerning inspection and acceptance, if the Contracting Officer 
determines that a challenge to the restrictive marking is warranted, the 
Contracting Officer shall send a written challenge notice to the 
Contractor or subcontractor asserting the restrictive markings. Such 
challenge shall--
    (i) State the specific grounds for challenging the asserted 
restriction;
    (ii) Require a response within sixty (60) days justifying and 
providing sufficient evidence as to the current validity of the asserted 
restriction;
    (iii) State that a DoD Contracting Officer's final decision, issued 
pursuant to paragraph (g) of this clause, sustaining the validity of a 
restrictive marking identical to the asserted restriction, within the 
three-year period preceding the challenge, shall serve as justification 
for the asserted restriction if the validated restriction was asserted 
by the same Contractor or subcontractor (or any licensee of such 
Contractor or subcontractor) to which such notice is being provided; and
    (iv) State that failure to respond to the challenge notice may 
result in issuance of a final decision pursuant to paragraph (f) of this 
clause.
    (2) The Contracting Officer shall extend the time for response as 
appropriate if the Contractor or subcontractor submits a written request 
showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.
    (3) The Contractor's or subcontractor's written response shall be 
considered a claim within the meaning of the Contract Disputes Act of 
1978 (41 U.S.C. 601, et seq.), and shall be certified in the form 
prescribed at 33.207 of

[[Page 425]]

the Federal Acquisition Regulation, regardless of dollar amount.
    (4) A Contractor or subcontractor receiving challenges to the same 
restrictive markings from more than one Contracting Officer shall notify 
each Contracting Officer of the existence of more than one challenge. 
The notice shall also state which Contracting Officer initiated the 
first in time unanswered challenge. The Contracting Officer initiating 
the first in time unanswered challenge after consultation with the 
Contractor or subcontractor and the other Contracting Officers, shall 
formulate and distribute a schedule for responding to each of the 
challenge notices to all interested parties. The schedule shall afford 
the Contractor or subcontractor an opportunity to respond to each 
challenge notice. All parties will be bound by this schedule.
    (f) Final decision when Contractor or subcontractor fails to 
respond. Upon a failure of a Contractor or subcontractor to submit any 
response to the challenge notice, other than a failure to respond under 
a contract for commercial items, the Contracting Officer will issue a 
final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor in accordance with the 
Disputes clause of this contract pertaining to the validity of the 
asserted restriction. This final decision shall be issued as soon as 
possible after the expiration of the time period of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) 
or (e)(2) of this clause. Following issuance of the final decision, the 
Contracting Officer will comply with the procedures in paragraphs (g)(2) 
(ii) through (iv) of this clause.
    (g) Final decision when Contractor or subcontractor responds. (1) if 
the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor or subcontractor 
has justified the validity of the restrictive marking, the Contracting 
Officer shall issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor 
sustaining the validity of the restrictive marking, and stating that the 
Government will continue to be bound by the restrictive marking. This 
final decision shall be issued within sixty (60) days after receipt of 
the Contractor's or subcontractor's response to the challenge notice, or 
within such longer period that the Contracting Officer has notified the 
Contractor or subcontractor that the Government will require. The 
notification of a longer period for issuance of a final decision will be 
made within sixty (60) days after receipt of the response to the 
challenge notice.
    (2)(i) If the Contracting Officer determines that the validity of 
the restrictive marking is not justified, the Contracting Officer shall 
issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor in accordance 
with the Disputes clause of this contract. Notwithstanding paragraph (e) 
of the Disputes clause, the final decision shall be issued within sixty 
(60) days after receipt of the Contractor's or subcontractor's response 
to the challenge notice, or within such longer period that the 
Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor or subcontractor of the 
longer period that the Government will require. The notification of a 
longer period for issuance of a final decision will be made within sixty 
(60) days after receipt of the response to the challenge notice.
    (ii) The Government agrees that it will continue to be bound by the 
restrictive marking of a period of ninety (90) days from the issuance of 
the Contracting Officer's final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of 
this clause. The Contractor or subcontractor agrees that, if it intends 
to file suit in the United States Claims Court it will provide a notice 
of intent to file suit to the Contracting Officer within ninety (90) 
days from the issuance of the Contracting Officer's final decision under 
paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this clause. If the Contractor or subcontractor 
fails to appeal, file suit, or provide a notice of intent to file suit 
to the Contracting Officer within the ninety (90)-day period, the 
Government may cancel or ignore the restrictive markings, and the 
failure of the Contractor or subcontractor to take the required action 
constitutes agreement with such Government action.
    (iii) The Government agrees that it will continue to be bound by the 
restrictive marking where a notice of intent to file suit in the United 
States Claims Court is provided to the Contracting Officer within ninety 
(90) days from the issuance of the final decision under paragraph 
(g)(2)(i) of this clause. The Government will no longer be bound, and 
the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the Government may strike or 
ignore the restrictive markings, if the Contractor or subcontractor 
fails to file its suit within one (1) year after issuance of the final 
decision. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the head of an agency 
determines, on a nondelegable basis, that urgent or compelling 
circumstances will not permit waiting for the filing of a suit in the 
United States Claims Court, the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that 
the agency may, following notice to the Contractor or subcontractor, 
authorize release or disclosure of the technical data. Such agency 
determination may be made at any time after issuance of the final 
decision and will not affect the Contractor's or subcontractor's right 
to damages against the United States where its restrictive markings are 
ultimately upheld or to pursue other relief, if any, as may be provided 
by law.
    (iv) The Government agrees that it will be bound by the restrictive 
marking where an appeal or suit is filed pursuant to the Contract 
Disputes Act until final disposition by an agency Board of Contract 
Appeals or the United States Claims Court. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, where the head of an agency determines, on a nondelegable 
basis,

[[Page 426]]

following notice to the Contractor that urgent or compelling 
circumstances will not permit awaiting the decision by such Board of 
Contract Appeals or the United States Claims Court, the Contractor or 
subcontractor agrees that the agency may authorize release or disclosure 
of the technical data. Such agency determination may be made at any time 
after issuance of the final decision and will not affect the 
Contractor's or subcontractor's right to damages against the United 
States where its restrictive markings are ultimately upheld or to pursue 
other relief, if any, as may be provided by law.
    (h) Final disposition of appeal or suit. (1) If the Contractor or 
subcontractor appeals or files suit and if, upon final disposition of 
the appeal or suit, the Contracting Officer's decision is sustained--
    (i) The restrictive marking on the technical data shall be 
cancelled, corrected or ignored; and
    (ii) If the restrictive marking is found not to be substantially 
justified, the Contractor or subcontractor, as appropriate, shall be 
liable to the Government for payment of the cost to the Government of 
reviewing the restrictive marking and the fees and other expenses (as 
defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Government in 
challenging the marking, unless special circumstances would make such 
payment unjust.
    (2) If the Contractor or subcontractor appeals or files suit and if, 
upon final disposition of the appeal or suit, the Contracting Officer's 
decision is not sustained--
    (i) The Government shall continue to be bound by the restrictive 
marking; and
    (ii) The Government shall be liable to the Contractor or 
subcontractor for payment of fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 
U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Contractor or subcontractor in 
defending the marking, if the challenge by the Government is found not 
to have been made in good faith.
    (i) Duration of right to challenge. The Government may review the 
validity of any restriction on technical data, delivered or to be 
delivered under a contract, asserted by the Contractor or subcontractor. 
During the period within three (3) years of final payment on a contract 
or within three (3) years of delivery of the technical data to the 
Government, whichever is later, the Contracting Officer may review and 
make a written determination to challenge the restriction. The 
Government may, however, challenge a restriction on the release, 
disclosure or use of technical data at any time if such technical data--
    (1) Is publicly available;
    (2) Has been furnished to the United States without restriction; or
    (3) Has been otherwise made available without restriction. Only the 
Contracting Officer's final decision resolving a formal challenge by 
sustaining the validity of a restrictive marking constitutes 
``validation'' as addressed in 10 U.S.C. 2321.
    (j) Decision not to challenge. A decision by the Government, or a 
determination by the Contracting Officer, to not challenge the 
restrictive marking or asserted restriction shall not constitute 
``validation.''
    (k) Privity of contract. The Contractor or subcontractor agrees that 
the Contracting Officer may transact matters under this clause directly 
with subcontractors at any tier that assert restrictive markings. 
However, this clause neither creates nor implies privity of contract 
between the Government and subcontractors.
    (l) Flowdown. The Contractor or subcontractor agrees to insert this 
clause in contractual instruments with its subcontractors or suppliers 
at any tier requiring the delivery of technical data, except contractual 
instruments for commercial items or commercial components.

subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license 
submitted in accordance with 37 CFR Part 404 and agency licensing 
regulations;
    (B) Will not revoke the license in that field of use or the 
geographical areas in which the Contractor has achieved practical 
application and continues to make the benefits of the invention 
reasonably accessible to the public; and
    (C) May revoke or modify the license in any foreign country to the 
extent the Contractor, its licensees, or the domestic subsidiaries or 
affiliates have failed to achieve practical application in that foreign 
country.
    (iii) Before revoking or modifying the license, the agency--
    (A) Will furnish the Contractor a written notice of its intention to 
revoke or modify the license; and
    (B) Will allow the Contractor 30 days (or such other time as the 
funding agency may authorize for good cause shown by the Contractor) 
after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or 
modified.
    (iv) The Contractor has the right to appeal, in accordance with 37 
CFR part 404 and agency regulations, concerning the licensing of 
Government-owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or 
modification of the license.
    (c) Contractor's obligations. (1) The Contractor shall--
    (i) Disclose, in writing, each subject invention to the Contracting 
Officer within 2 months after the inventor discloses it in writing to 
Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters, or within 6 months 
after the Contractor first becomes aware that a subject invention has 
been made, whichever is earlier;
    (ii) Include in the disclosure--
    (A) The inventor(s) and the contract under which the invention was 
made;
    (B) Sufficient technical detail to convey a clear understanding of 
the invention; and
    (C) Any publication, on sale (i.e., sale or offer for sale), or 
public use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the 
invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has 
been accepted for publication; and
    (iii) After submission of the disclosure, promptly notify the 
Contracting Officer of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the 
invention for publication and of any on sale or public use.
    (2) The Contractor shall elect in writing whether or not to retain 
ownership of any subject invention by notifying the Contracting Officer 
at the time of disclosure or within 8 months of disclosure, as to those 
countries (including the United States) in which the Contractor will 
retain ownership. However, in any case where publication, on sale, or 
public use has initiated the 1-year statutory period during which valid 
patent protection can be obtained in the United States, the agency may 
shorten the period of election of title to a date that is no more than 
60 days prior to the end of the statutory period.
    (3) The Contractor shall--
    (i) File either a provisional or a nonprovisional patent application 
on an elected subject invention within 1 year after election, provided 
that in all cases the application is filed prior to the end of any 
statutory period wherein valid patent protection can be obtained in the 
United States after a publication, on sale, or public use;

[[Page 428]]

    (ii) File a nonprovisional application within 10 months of the 
filing of any provisional application; and
    (iii) File patent applications in additional countries or 
international patent offices within either 10 months of the first filed 
patent application (whether provisional or nonprovisional) or 6 months 
from the date the Commissioner of Patents grants permission to file 
foreign patent applications where such filing has been prohibited by a 
Secrecy Order.
    (4) The Contractor may request extensions of time for disclosure, 
election, or filing under paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this 
clause. The Contracting Officer will normally grant the extension unless 
there is reason to believe the extension would prejudice the 
Government's interests.
    (d) Government's rights-- (1) Ownership. The Contractor shall assign 
to the agency, upon written request, title to any subject invention--
    (i) If the Contractor elects not to retain title to a subject 
invention;
    (ii) If the Contractor fails to disclose or elect the subject 
invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause and 
the agency requests title within 60 days after learning of the 
Contractor's failure to report or elect within the specified times;
    (iii) In those countries in which the Contractor fails to file 
patent applications within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this 
clause, provided that, if the Contractor has filed a patent application 
in a country after the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, 
but prior to its receipt of the written request of the agency, the 
Contractor shall continue to retain ownership in that country; and
    (iv) In any country in which the Contractor decides not to continue 
the prosecution of any application for, to pay the maintenance fees on, 
or defend in reexamination or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a 
subject invention.
    (2) License. If the Contractor retains ownership of any subject 
invention, the Government shall have a nonexclusive, nontransferable, 
irrevocable, paid-up license to practice, or have practiced for or on 
behalf of the United States, the subject invention throughout the world.
    (e) Contractor action to protect the Government's interest. (1) The 
Contractor shall execute or have executed and promptly deliver to the 
agency all instruments necessary to--
    (i) Establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout 
the world in those subject inventions in which the Contractor elects to 
retain ownership; and
    (ii) Assign title to the agency when requested under paragraph 
(d)(1) of this clause and enable the Government to obtain patent 
protection for that subject invention in any country.
    (2) The Contractor shall--
    (i) Require, by written agreement, its employees, other than 
clerical and nontechnical employees, to--
    (A) Disclose each subject invention promptly in writing to personnel 
identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters, so 
that the Contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions in 
paragraph (c) of this clause; and
    (B) Provide the disclosure in the Contractor's format, which should 
require, as a minimum, the information required by paragraph (c)(1) of 
this clause;
    (ii) Instruct its employees, through employee agreements or other 
suitable educational programs, as to the importance of reporting 
inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent 
applications prior to U.S. or statutory foreign bars; and
    (iii) Execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on 
subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the 
subject inventions.
    (3) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any 
decisions not to file a nonprovisional patent application, continue the 
prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in 
a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in any country, 
not less than 30 days before the expiration of the response or filing 
period required by the relevant patent office.
    (4) The Contractor shall include, within the specification of any 
United States nonprovisional patent application and any patent issuing 
thereon covering a subject invention, the following statement: ``This 
invention was made with Government support under (identify the contract) 
awarded by (identify the agency). The Government has certain rights in 
this invention.''
    (5) The Contractor shall--
    (i) Establish and maintain active and effective procedures to ensure 
that subject inventions are promptly identified and disclosed to 
Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters;
    (ii) Include in these procedures the maintenance of--
    (A) Laboratory notebooks or equivalent records and other records as 
are reasonably necessary to document the conception and/or the first 
actual reduction to practice of subject inventions; and
    (B) Records that show that the procedures for identifying and 
disclosing the inventions are followed; and
    (iii) Upon request, furnish the Contracting Officer a description of 
these procedures for evaluation and for determination as to their 
effectiveness.
    (6) The Contractor shall, when licensing a subject invention, 
arrange to--
    (i) Avoid royalty charges on acquisitions involving Government 
funds, including funds derived through the Government's Military

[[Page 429]]

Assistance Program or otherwise derived through the Government;
    (ii) Refund any amounts received as royalty charges on the subject 
inventions in acquisitions for, or on behalf of, the Government; and
    (iii) Provide for the refund in any instrument transferring rights 
in the invention to any party.
    (7) The Contractor shall furnish to the Contracting Officer the 
following:
    (i) Interim reports every 12 months (or any longer period as may be 
specified by the Contracting Officer) from the date of the contract, 
listing subject inventions during that period and stating that all 
subject inventions have been disclosed or that there are no subject 
inventions.
    (ii) A final report, within 3 months after completion of the 
contracted work, listing all subject inventions or stating that there 
were no subject inventions, and listing all subcontracts at any tier 
containing a patent rights clause or stating that there were no 
subcontracts.
    (8)(i) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer 
in writing upon the award of any subcontract at any tier containing a 
patent rights clause by identifying--
    (A) The subcontractor;
    (B) The applicable patent rights clause;
    (C) The work to be performed under the subcontract; and
    (D) The dates of award and estimated completion.
    (ii) The Contractor shall furnish, upon request, a copy of the 
subcontract, and no more frequently than annually, a listing of the 
subcontracts that have been awarded.
    (9) In the event of a refusal by a prospective subcontractor to 
accept one of the clauses specified in paragraph (l)(1) of this clause, 
the Contractor--
    (i) Shall promptly submit a written notice to the Contracting 
Officer setting forth the subcontractor's reasons for the refusal and 
other pertinent information that may expedite disposition of the matter; 
and
    (ii) Shall not proceed with that subcontract without the written 
authorization of the Contracting Officer.
    (10) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer, upon 
request, the following information for any subject invention for which 
the Contractor has retained ownership:
    (i) Filing date.
    (ii) Serial number and title.
    (iii) A copy of any patent application (including an English-
language version if filed in a language other than English).
    (iv) Patent number and issue date.
    (11) The Contractor shall furnish to the Government, upon request, 
an irrevocable power to inspect and make copies of any patent 
application file.
    (f) Reporting on utilization of subject inventions. (1) The 
Contractor shall--

annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts in 
obtaining utilization of the subject invention that are being made by 
the Contractor or its licensees or assignees;
    (ii) Include in the reports information regarding the status of 
development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties 
received by the Contractor, and other information as the agency may 
reasonably specify; and
    (iii) Provide additional reports that the agency may request in 
connection with any march-in proceedings undertaken by the agency in 
accordance with paragraph (h) of this clause.
    (2) To the extent permitted by law, the agency shall not disclose 
the information provided under paragraph (f)(1) of this clause to 
persons outside the Government without the Contractor's permission, if 
the data or information is considered by the Contractor or its licensee 
or assignee to be ``privileged and confidential'' (see 5 U.S.C. 
552(b)(4)) and is so marked.
    (g) Preference for United States industry. Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this clause, the Contractor agrees that neither the 
Contractor nor any assignee shall grant to any person the exclusive 
right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless 
the person agrees that any products embodying the subject invention or 
produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured 
substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the 
agency may waive the requirement for an exclusive license agreement upon 
a showing by the Contractor or its assignee that--
    (1) Reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant 
licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to 
manufacture substantially in the United States; or
    (2) Under the circumstances, domestic manufacture is not 
commercially feasible.
    (h) March-in rights. The Contractor acknowledges that, with respect 
to any subject invention in which it has retained ownership, the agency 
has the right to require licensing pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 203 and 210(c), 
37 CFR 401.6, and any supplemental regulations of the agency in effect 
on the date of contract award.
    (i) Other inventions. Nothing contained in this clause shall be 
deemed to grant to the Government any rights with respect to any 
invention other than a subject invention.
    (j) Examination of records relating to inventions. (1) The 
Contracting Officer or any authorized representative shall, until 3 
years after final payment under this contract,

[[Page 430]]

have the right to examine any books (including laboratory notebooks), 
records, and documents of the Contractor relating to the conception or 
first reduction to practice of inventions in the same field of 
technology as the work under this contract to determine whether--
    (i) Any inventions are subject inventions;
    (ii) The Contractor has established procedures required by paragraph 
(e)(5) of this clause; and
    (iii) The Contractor and its inventors have complied with the 
procedures.
    (2) If the Contracting Officer learns of an unreported Contractor 
invention that the Contracting Officer believes may be a subject 
invention, the Contractor shall be required to disclose the invention to 
the agency for a determination of ownership rights.
    (3) Any examination of records under this paragraph (j) shall be 
subject to appropriate conditions to protect the confidentiality of the 
information involved.
    (k) Withholding of payment (this paragraph does not apply to 
subcontracts). (1) Any time before final payment under this contract, 
the Contracting Officer may, in the Government's interest, withhold 
payment until a reserve not exceeding $50,000 or 5 percent of the amount 
of the contract, whichever is less, is set aside if, in the Contracting 
Officer's opinion, the Contractor fails to--
    (i) Establish, maintain, and follow effective procedures for 
identifying and disclosing subject inventions pursuant to paragraph 
(e)(5) of this clause;
    (ii) Disclose any subject invention pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of 
this clause;
    (iii) Deliver acceptable interim reports pursuant to paragraph 
(e)(7)(i) of this clause; or
    (iv) Provide the information regarding subcontracts pursuant to 
paragraph (e)(8) of this clause.
    (2) The reserve or balance shall be withheld until the Contracting 
Officer has determined that the Contractor has rectified whatever 
deficiencies exist and has delivered all reports, disclosures, and other 
information required by this clause.
    (3) The Government will not make final payment under this contract 
before the Contractor delivers to the Contracting Officer--
    (i) All disclosures of subject inventions required by paragraph 
(c)(1) of this clause;
    (ii) An acceptable final report pursuant to paragraph (e)(7)(ii) of 
this clause; and
    (iii) All past due confirmatory instruments.
    (4) The Contracting Officer may decrease or increase the sums 
withheld up to the maximum authorized in paragraph (k)(1) of this 
clause. No amount shall be withheld under this paragraph while the 
amount specified by this paragraph is being withheld under other 
provisions of the contract. The withholding of any amount or the 
subsequent payment thereof shall not be construed as a waiver of any 
Government right.
    (l) Subcontracts. (1) The Contractor--
    (i) Shall include the substance of the Patent Rights-Ownership by 
the Contractor clause set forth at 52.227-11 of the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR), in all subcontracts for experimental, developmental, 
or research work to be performed by a small business concern or 
nonprofit organization; and
    (ii) Shall include the substance of this clause, including this 
paragraph (l), in all other subcontracts for experimental, 
developmental, or research work, unless a different patent rights clause 
is required by FAR 27.303.
    (2) For subcontracts at any tier--
    (i) The patents rights clause included in the subcontract shall 
retain all references to the Government and shall provide to the 
subcontractor all the rights and obligations provided to the Contractor 
in the clause. The Contractor shall not, as consideration for awarding 
the subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject 
inventions; and
    (ii) The Government, the Contractor, and the subcontractor agree 
that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause 
constitute a contract between the subcontractor and the Government with 
respect to those matters covered by this clause. However, nothing in 
this paragraph is intended to confer any jurisdiction under the Contract 
Disputes Act in connection with proceedings under paragraph (h) of this 
clause.

<R05>
252.228-7001  Ground and flight risk.

    As prescribed in 228.370(b), use the following clause:

                    Ground and Flight Risk (SEP 1996)

    (a) Definitions. As used in this clause--
    (1) Aircraft, unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, means--
    (i) Aircraft to be delivered to the Government under this contract 
(either before or after Government acceptance), including complete 
aircraft and aircraft in the process of being manufactured, 
disassembled, or reassembled; provided that an engine, portion of a wing 
or a wing is attached to a fuselage of the aircraft; and
    (ii) Aircraft, whether in a state of disassembly or reassembly, 
furnished by the Government to the Contractor under this contract, 
including all property installed, in the process of installation, or 
temporarily removed; provided that the aircraft and property are not 
covered by a separate bailment agreement.
    (2) Contractor's premises means those premises designated in the 
Schedule or in writing by the Contracting Officer, and any other place 
the aircraft is moved for safeguarding.
    (3) Flight means any flight demonstration, flight test, taxi test, 
or other flight made in the performance of this contract, or for the 
purpose of safeguarding the aircraft, or previously approved in writing 
by the Contracting Officer.

[[Page 432]]

    (i) For land based aircraft, flight begins with the taxi roll from a 
flight line on the Contractor's premises and continues until the 
aircraft has completed the taxi roll in returning to a flight line on 
the Contractor's premises;
    (ii) For seaplanes, flight begins with the launching from a ramp on 
the Contractor's premises and continues until the aircraft has completed 
its landing run and is beached at a ramp on the Contractor's premises;
    (iii) For helicopters, flight begins upon engagement of the rotors 
for the purpose of take-off from the Contractor's premises and continues 
until the aircraft has returned to the ground on the Contractor's 
premises and the rotors are disengaged; and
    (iv) For vertical take-off aircraft, flight begins upon 
disengagement from any launching platform or device on the Contractor's 
premises and continues until the aircraft has been engaged to any 
launching platform or device on the Contractor's premises;
    (v) All aircraft off the Contractor's premises shall be considered 
to be in flight when on the ground or water for reasonable periods of 
time following emergency landings, landings made in performance of this 
contract, or landings approved in writing by the Contracting Officer.
    (4) Flight crew member means the pilot, the co-pilot, and, unless 
otherwise provided in the Schedule, the flight engineer, navigator, and 
bombardier-navigator when assigned to their respective crew positions 
for the purpose of conducting any flight on behalf of the Contractor. If 
required, a defense systems operator may also be assigned as a flight 
crew member.
    (5) In the open means located wholly outside of buildings on the 
Contractor's premises or other places described in the Schedule as being 
in the open. Government furnished aircraft shall be considered to be 
located in the open at all times while in the Contractor's possession, 
care, custody, or control.
    (6) Operation means operations and tests of the aircraft and its 
installed equipment, accessories, and power plants, while the aircraft 
is in the open or in motion. The term does not apply to aircraft on any 
production line or in flight.
    (b) Except as may be specifically provided in the Schedule as an 
exception to this clause, the Government assumes the risk of damage to, 
or loss or destruction of aircraft in the open, during operation, and in 
flight. The Contractor shall not be liable to the Government for such 
damage, loss, or destruction.
    (c) The Government's assumption of risk for aircraft in the open 
shall continue unless the Contracting Officer finds that the aircraft is 
in the open under unreasonable conditions, and the Contractor fails to 
take prompt corrective action.
    (1) The Contracting Officer, when finding aircraft in the open under 
unreasonable conditions, shall notify the Contractor in writing of the 
unreasonable conditions and require the Contractor to make corrections 
within a reasonable time.
    (2) Upon receipt of the notice, the Contractor shall promptly 
correct the cited conditions, regardless of whether there is agreement 
that the conditions are unreasonable. If the Contracting Officer later 
determines that the cited conditions were not unreasonable, an equitable 
adjustment shall be made in the contract price for any additional costs 
incurred in correcting the conditions. Any dispute as to the 
unreasonableness of the conditions or the equitable adjustment shall be 
considered a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.
    (3) If the Contracting Officer finds that the Contractor failed to 
act promptly to correct the cited conditions or failed to correct the 
conditions within a reasonable time, the Contracting Officer may 
terminate the Government's assumption of risk for any aircraft in the 
open under the cited conditions. The termination will be effective at 
12:01 am on the fifteenth day following the day the written notice is 
received by the Contractor. If the Contracting Officer later determines 
that the Contractor acted promptly to correct the cited conditions or 
that the time taken by the Contractor was not unreasonable, an equitable 
adjustment shall be made in the contract price for any additional costs 
incurred as a result of termination of the Government's assumption of 
risk. Any dispute as to the timeliness of the Contractor's action or the 
equitable adjustment shall be considered a dispute under the Disputes 
clause of this contract.
    (4) If the Government terminates its assumption of risk, the risk of 
loss for Government-furnished property shall be determined in accordance 
with the Government Property clause of this contract.
    (5) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer 
when unreasonable conditions have been corrected. If the Government 
elects to again assume the risk of loss and relieve the Contractor of 
liabilities, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor. The 
Contractor shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment in the contract 
price for any insurance costs extending from the end of the third 
working day after the Contractor notice of correction until the 
Contractor is notified that the Government will assume the risk of loss. 
If the Government does not again assume the risk of loss and conditions 
have been corrected, the Contractor shall be entitled to an equitable 
adjustment for insurance costs, if any, extending after the third 
working day.
    (d) The Government's assumption of risk shall not extend to damage, 
loss, or destruction of aircraft which--

[[Page 433]]

    (1) Results from failure of the Contractor, due to willful 
misconduct or lack of good faith of any of the Contractor's managerial 
personnel, to maintain and administer a program for the protection and 
preservation of aircraft in the open and during operation in accordance 
with sound industrial practice. The term Contractor's managerial 
personnel means the Contractor's directors, officers, and any of the 
Contractor's managers, superintendents, or other equivalent 
representatives who supervise or direct all or substantially all of the 
Contractor's business; or all or substantially all of the Contractor's 
operations at any one plant or separate location at which this contract 
is performed; or a separate and complete major industrial operation in 
connection with the performance of this contract;
    (2) Is sustained during flight if the flight crew members have not 
been approved in writing by the Government Flight Representative, who 
has been authorized in accordance with the combined regulation entitled 
``Contractor's Flight and Ground Operations'' (Air Force Regulation 55-
22, Army Regulation 95-20, NAVAIR Instruction 3710.1C, and Defense 
Logistics Agency Manual 8210.1);
    (3) Occurs in the course of transportation by rail, or by conveyance 
on public streets, highways, or waterways, except for Government-
furnished property;
    (4) Is covered by insurance;
    (5) Consists of wear and tear; deterioration (including rust and 
corrosion); freezing; or mechanical, structural, or electrical breakdown 
or failure, unless these are the result of other loss, damage or 
destruction covered by this clause. (This exclusion does not apply to 
Government-furnished property if damage consists of reasonable wear and 
tear or deterioration, or results from inherent vice in the property.); 
or
    (6) Is sustained while the aircraft is being worked on and is a 
direct result of the work unless such damage, loss, or destruction would 
be covered by insurance which would have been maintained by the 
Contractor, but for the Government's assumption of risk.
    (e) With the exception of damage, loss, or destruction in flight, 
the Contractor assumes the risk and shall be responsible for the first 
$25,000 of loss or damage to aircraft in the open or during operation 
resulting from each separate event, except for reasonable wear and tear 
and to the extent the loss or damage is caused by negligence of 
Government personnel. If the Government elects to require that the 
aircraft be replaced or restored by the Contractor to its condition 
immediately prior to the damage, the equitable adjustment in the price 
authorized by paragraph (i) of this clause shall not include the dollar 
amount of the risk assumed by the Contractor. In the event the 
Government does not elect repair or replacement, the Contractor agrees 
to credit the contract price or pay the Government $25,000 (or the 
amount of the loss, if less) as directed by the Contracting Officer.
    (f) A subcontractor shall not be relieved from liability for damage, 
loss, or destruction of aircraft while in its possession or control, 
except to the extent that the subcontract, with the written approval of 
the Contracting Officer, provides for relief from each liability. In the 
absence of approval, the subcontract shall contain provisions requiring 
the return of aircraft in as good condition as when received, except for 
reasonable wear and tear or for the utilization of the property in 
accordance with the provisions of this contract. Where a subcontractor 
has not been relieved from liability, and damage, loss, or destruction 
occurs, the Contractor shall enforce liability against the subcontractor 
for the benefit of the Government.
    (g) The Contractor warrants that the contract price does not and 
will not include, except as may be authorized in this clause, any charge 
or contingency reserve for insurance covering damage, loss, or 
destruction of aircraft while in the open, during operation, or in 
flight when the risk has been assumed by the Government, even if the 
assumption may be terminated for aircraft in the open.
    (h) In the event of damage, loss, or destruction of aircraft in the 
open, during operation, or in flight, the Contractor shall take all 
reasonable steps to protect the aircraft from further damage, to 
separate damaged and undamaged aircraft, to put all aircraft in the best 
possible order and further, except in cases covered by paragraph (e) of 
this clause, the Contractor shall furnish to the Contracting Officer a 
statement of--
    (1) The damaged, lost, or destroyed aircraft;
    (2) The time and origin of the damage, loss, or destruction;
    (3) All known interests in commingled property of which aircraft are 
a part; and
    (4) The insurance, if any, covering the interest in commingled 
property.
    Except in cases covered by paragraph (e) of this clause, the 
Contracting Officer will make an equitable adjustment in the contract 
price for expenditures made by the Contractor in performing the 
obligations under this paragraph.
    (i) If prior to delivery and acceptance by the Government, aircraft 
is damaged, lost, or destroyed and the Government assumed the risk, the 
Government shall either--
    (1) Require that the aircraft be replaced or restored by the 
Contractor to the condition immediately prior to the damage, in which 
event the Contracting Officer will make an equitable adjustment in the 
contract price and the time for contract performance; or
    (2) Terminate this contract with respect to the aircraft, in which 
event the Contractor

[[Page 434]]

shall be paid the contract price for the aircraft (or, if applicable, 
any work to be performed on the aircraft) less any amount the 
Contracting Officer determines--
    (i) It would have cost the Contractor to complete the aircraft (or 
any work to be performed on the aircraft) together with anticipated 
profit on uncompleted work; and
    (ii) Would be the value of the damaged aircraft or any salvage 
retained by the Contractor.
    The Contracting Officer shall prescribe the manner of disposition of 
the damaged, lost, or destroyed aircraft, or any parts of the aircraft. 
If any additional costs of such disposition are incurred by the 
Contractor, a further equitable adjustment will be made in the amount 
due the Contractor. Failure of the parties to agree upon termination 
costs or an equitable adjustment with respect to any aircraft shall be 
considered a dispute under the Disputes clause.
    (j) In the event the Contractor is reimbursed or compensated by a 
third person for damage, loss, or destruction of aircraft and has also 
been compensated by the Government, the Contractor shall equitably 
reimburse the Government. The Contractor shall do nothing to prejudice 
the Government's right to recover against third parties for damage, 
loss, or destruction. Upon the request of the Contracting Officer or 
authorized representative, the Contractor shall at Government expense 
furnish to the Government all reasonable assistance and cooperation 
(including the prosecution of suit and the execution of instruments of 
assignment of subrogation) in obtaining recovery.
    (k) The Contractor agrees to be bound by the operating procedures 
contained in the combined regulation entitled ``Contractor's Flight and 
Ground Operations'' in effect on the date of contract award.

    As prescribed in 229.402-70(d), use the following clause:

    Status of Contractor as a Director Contractor (Spain) (June 1997)

    (a) ``Direct Contractor,'' as used in this clause, means an 
individual, company, or entity with whom an agency of the United States 
Department of Defense has executed a written agreement that allows duty-
free import of equipment, materials, and supplies into Spain for the 
construction, development, maintenance, and operation of Spanish-
American installations and facilities.
    (b) The Contractor is hereby designated as a Direct Contractor under 
the provisions of Complementary Agreement 5, articles 11, 14, 15, 17, 
and 18 of the Agreement on Friendship, Defense and Cooperation between 
the United States Government and the Kingdom of Spain, dated July 2, 
1982. The Agreement relates to contacts to be performed in whole or part 
in Spain, the provisions of which are hereby incorporated into and made 
a part of this contract by reference.
    (c) The Contractor shall apply to the appropriate Spanish 
authorities for approval of status as a Direct Contractor in order to 
complete duty-free import of non-Spanish equipment, materials, and 
supplies represented as necessary for contract performance by the 
Contracting Officer. Orders for equipment, materials, and supplies 
placed prior to official notification of such approval shall be at the 
Contractor's own risk. The Contractor must submit its documentation in 
sufficient time to permit processing by the appropriate United States 
and Spanish Government agencies prior to the arrival of the equipment, 
material, or supplies in Spain. Seasonal variations in processing times 
are common, and the Contractor should program its projects accordingly. 
Any delay or expense arising directly or indirectly from this process 
shall not excuse untimely performance (except as expressly allowed in 
other provisions of this contract), constitute a direct or constructive 
change, or otherwise provide a basis for additional compensation or 
adjustment of any kind.
    (d) To ensure that all duty-free imports are properly accounted for, 
exported, or disposed of, in accordance with Spanish law, the Contractor 
shall obtain a written bank letter of guaranty payable to the Treasurer 
of the United States, or such other authority as may be designated by 
the Contracting Officer, in the amount set forth in paragraph (g) of 
this clause, prior to effecting any duty-free imports for the 
performance of this contract.
    (e) If the Contractor fails to obtain the required guaranty, the 
Contractor agrees that the Contracting Officer may withhold a portion of 
the contract payments in order to establish a fund in the amount set 
forth in paragraph (g) of this clause. The fund shall be used for the 
payment of import taxes in the event that the Contractor fails to 
properly account for, export, or dispose of equipment, materials, or 
supplies imported on a duty-free basis.
    (f) The amount of the bank letter of guaranty or size of the fund 
required under paragraph (d) or (e) of this clause normally shall be 5 
percent of the contract value. However, if the Contractor demonstrates 
to the Contracting Officer's satisfaction that the amount retained by 
the United States Government or guaranteed by the bank is excessive, the 
amount shall be reduced to an amount commensurate with contingent import 
tax and duty-free liability. This bank guaranty or fund shall not be 
released to the Contractor until the Spanish General Directorate of 
Customs verifies the accounting, export, or disposition of the 
equipment, material, or supplies imported on a duty-free basis.

[[Page 439]]

    (g) The amount required under paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this 
clause is (Contracting Officer insert amount at time of contract award).
    (h) The Contractor agrees to insert the provisions of this clause,

    (a) Contract line item(s) ------* through ------* are incrementally 
funded. For these item(s), the sum of $------* of the total price is 
presently available for payment and allotted to this contract. An 
allotment schedule is set forth in paragraph (j) of this clause.
    (b) For item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the 
Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount 
payable by the Government, including reimbursement in the event of 
termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, 
approximates the total amount currently allotted to the contract. The 
Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond 
that point. The Government will not be obligated in any event to 
reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the 
contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the 
clause entitled ``Termination for Convenience of the Government.'' As 
used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the 
event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience 
includes costs, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for 
those items(s).
    (c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in 
paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting 
Officer in writing at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the 
Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the 
total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for 
termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total 
amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable 
item(s). The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that 
point will be reached and (2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, 
needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next 
scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (j) of 
this clause, or to a mutually agreed upon substitute date. The 
notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated 
amount of additional funds that will be required for the timely 
performance of the item(s) funded pursuant to this clause, for a 
subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in 
paragraph (j) of this clause, or otherwise agreed to by the parties. If 
after such notification additional funds are not allotted by the date 
identified in the Contractor's notification, or by an agreed substitute 
date, the Contracting Officer will terminate any item(s) for which 
additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the clause of this 
contract entitled ``Termination for Convenience of the Government.''
    (d) When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of 
the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, 
the parties will agree as to the period of contract performance which 
will be covered by the funds. The provisions of paragraph (b) through 
(d) of this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted 
funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified 
accordingly.
    (e) If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot 
additional funds, by the dates indicated below, in amounts sufficient 
for timely performance of the contract line item(s) identified in 
paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor incurs additional costs or 
is delayed in the performance of the work under this contract and if 
additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in 
the price or prices (including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling 
prices where applicable) of the item(s), or in the time of delivery, or 
both. Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will 
be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the 
clause entitled ``Disputes.''
    (f) The Government may at any time prior to termination allot 
additional funds for the performance of the contract line item(s) 
identified in paragraph (a) of this clause.
    (g) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the 
rights of the Government under the clause entitled ``Default.'' The 
provisions of this clause are limited to the work and allotment of funds 
for the contract line item(s) set forth in paragraph (a) of this clause. 
This clause no longer applies once the contract is fully funded except 
with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning 
equitable adjustments negotiated under paragraphs (d) or (e) of this 
clause.
    (h) Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to 
terminate this contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled 
``Termination for Convenience of the Government.''
    (i) Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of 
voluntary services whose acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 
U.S.C. 1342.
    (j) The parties contemplate that the Government will allot funds to 
this contract in accordance with the following schedule:
    On execution of contract $----
    (month) (day), (year) $----
    (month) (day), (year) $----

    As prescribed in 234.203(1), use the following provision:

           Notice of Earned Value Management System (APR 2008)

    (a) If the offeror submits a proposal in the amount of $50,000,000 
or more--
    (1) The offeror shall provide documentation that the Cognizant 
Federal Agency (CFA) has determined that the proposed Earned Value 
Management System (EVMS) complies with the EVMS guidelines in the 
American National Standards Institute/Electronic Industries Alliance 
Standard 748, Earned Value Management Systems (ANSI/EIA-748) (current 
version at time of solicitation). The Government reserves the right to 
perform reviews of the EVMS when deemed necessary to verify compliance.
    (2) If the offeror proposes to use a system that has not been 
determined to be in compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) 
of this provision, the offeror shall submit a comprehensive plan for 
compliance with the guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748.
    (i) The plan shall--
    (A) Describe the EVMS the offeror intends to use in performance of 
the contract, and how the proposed EVMS complies with the EVMS 
guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748;
    (B) Distinguish between the offeror's existing management system and 
modifications proposed to meet the EVMS guidelines;
    (C) Describe the management system and its application in terms of 
the EVMS guidelines;
    (D) Describe the proposed procedure for administration of the EVMS 
guidelines as applied to subcontractors; and
    (E) Describe the process the offeror will use to determine 
subcontractor compliance with ANSI/EIA-748.
    (ii) The offeror shall provide information and assistance as 
required by the Contracting Officer to support review of the plan.
    (iii) The offeror's EVMS plan must provide milestones that indicate 
when the offeror anticipates that the EVMS will be compliant with the 
guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748.
    (b) If the offeror submits a proposal in an amount less than 
$50,000,000--
    (1) The offeror shall submit a written description of the management 
procedures it will use and maintain in the performance of any resultant 
contract to comply with the requirements of the Earned Value Management 
System clause of the contract. The description shall include--
    (i) A matrix that correlates each guideline in ANSI/EIA-748 (current 
version at time of solicitation) to the corresponding process in the 
offeror's written management procedures; and
    (ii) The process the offeror will use to determine subcontractor 
compliance with ANSI/EIA-748.
    (2) If the offeror proposes to use an EVMS that has been determined 
by the CFA to be in compliance with the EVMS guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748, 
the offeror may submit a copy of the documentation of such determination 
instead of the written description required by paragraph (b)(1) of this 
provision.
    (c) The offeror shall identify the subcontractors (or the 
subcontracted effort if subcontractors have not been selected) to whom 
the EVMS requirements will apply. The offeror and the Government shall 
agree to the subcontractors or the subcontracted effort selected for 
application of the EVMS requirements. The offeror shall be responsible 
for ensuring that the selected subcontractors comply with the 
requirements of

252.234-7002  Earned Value Management System.

    As prescribed in 234.203(2), use the following clause:

                Earned Value Management System (APR 2008)

    (a) In the performance of this contract, the Contractor shall use--
    (1) An Earned Value Management System (EVMS) that complies with the 
EVMS guidelines in the American National Standards Institute/Electronic 
Industries Alliance Standard 748, Earned Value Management Systems (ANSI/
EIA-748); and
    (2) Management procedures that provide for generation of timely, 
reliable, and verifiable information for the Contract Performance Report 
(CPR) and the Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) required by the CPR and 
IMS data items of this contract.
    (b) If this contract has a value of $50,000,000 or more, the 
Contractor shall use an EVMS that has been determined by the Cognizant 
Federal Agency (CFA) to be in compliance with the EVMS guidelines as 
stated in paragraph (a)(1) of this clause. If, at the time of award, the 
Contractor's EVMS has not been determined by the CFA to be in compliance 
with the EVMS guidelines as stated in paragraph (a)(1) of this clause, 
the Contractor shall apply its current system to the contract and shall 
take necessary actions to meet the milestones in the Contractor's EVMS 
plan.
    (c) If this contract has a value of less than $50,000,000, the 
Government will not make a formal determination that the Contractor's 
EVMS complies with the EVMS guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748 with respect to 
the contract. The use of the Contractor's EVMS for this contract does 
not imply a Government determination of the Contractor's compliance with 
the EVMS guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748 for application to future contracts. 
The Government will allow the use of a Contractor's EVMS that has been 
formally reviewed and determined by the CFA to be in compliance with the 
EVMS guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748.
    (d) The Contractor shall submit notification of any proposed 
substantive changes to the EVMS procedures and the impact of those 
changes to the CFA. If this contract has a value of $50,000,000 or more, 
unless a waiver is granted by the CFA, any EVMS changes proposed by the 
Contractor require approval of the CFA prior to implementation. The CFA 
will advise the Contractor of the acceptability of such changes as soon 
as practicable (generally within 30 calendar days) after receipt of the 
Contractor's notice of proposed changes. If the CFA waives the advance 
approval requirements, the Contractor shall disclose EVMS changes to the 
CFA at least 14 calendar days prior to the effective date of 
implementation.
    (e) The Government will schedule integrated baseline reviews as 
early as practicable, and the review process will be conducted not later 
than 180 calendar days after (1) contract award, (2) the exercise of 
significant contract options, and (3) the incorporation of major 
modifications. During such reviews, the Government and the Contractor 
will jointly assess the Contractor's baseline to be used for performance 
measurement to ensure complete coverage of the statement of work, 
logical scheduling of the work activities, adequate resourcing, and 
identification of inherent risks.
    (f) The Contractor shall provide access to all pertinent records and 
data requested by the Contracting Officer or duly authorized 
representative as necessary to permit Government surveillance to ensure 
that the EVMS complies, and continues to comply, with the performance 
criteria referenced in paragraph (a) of this clause.
    (g) When indicated by contract performance, the Contractor shall 
submit a request for approval to initiate an over-target baseline or 
over-target schedule to the Contracting Officer. The request shall 
include a top-level projection of cost and/or schedule growth, a 
determination of whether or not performance variances will be retained, 
and a schedule of implementation for the rebaselining. The Government 
will acknowledge receipt of the request in a timely manner (generally 
within 30 calendar days).
    (h) The Contractor shall require its subcontractors to comply with 
EVMS requirements as follows:
    (1) For subcontracts valued at $50,000,000 or more, the following 
subcontractors shall comply with the requirements of this clause:

[Contracting Officer to insert names of subcontractors (or subcontracted 
effort if subcontractors have not been selected) designated for 
application of the EVMS requirements of this clause.]
________________________________________________________________________

excluding the requirements of paragraph (b) of this clause:

[Contracting Officer to insert names of subcontractors (or subcontracted 
effort if subcontractors have not been selected) designated for 
application of the EVMS requirements of this clause.]

252.236-7005  Airfield safety precautions.

    As prescribed in 236.570(b)(3), use the following clause. At some 
airfields, the width of the primary surface is 1,500 feet (750 feet on 
each side of the runway centerline). In such instances, substitute the 
proper width in the clause.

                 Airfield Safety Precautions (DEC 1991)

    (a) Definitions. As used in this clause--
    (1) Landing areas means--
    (i) The primary surfaces, comprising the surface of the runway, 
runway shoulders, and lateral safety zones. The length of each primary 
surface is the same as the runway length. The width of each primary 
surface is 2,000 feet (1,000 feet on each side of the runway 
centerline);
    (ii) The clear zone beyond the ends of each runway, i.e., the 
extension of the primary surface for a distance of 1,000 feet beyond 
each end of each runway;
    (iii) All taxiways, plus the lateral clearance zones along each side 
for the length of the taxiways (the outer edge of each lateral clearance 
zone is laterally 250 feet from the far or opposite edge of the taxiway, 
e.g., a 75-foot-wide taxiway would have a combined width of taxiway and 
lateral clearance zones of 425 feet); and
    (iv) All aircraft parking aprons, plus the area 125 feet in width 
extending beyond each edge all around the aprons.
    (2) Safety precaution areas means those portions of approach-
departure clearance zones and transitional zones where placement of 
objects incident to contract performance might result in vertical 
projections at or above the approach-departure clearance, or the 
transitional surface.
    (i) The approach-departure clearance surface is an extension of the 
primary surface and the clear zone at each end of each runway, for a 
distance of 50,000 feet, first along an inclined (glide angle) and then 
along a horizontal plane, both flaring symmetrically about the runway 
centerline extended.
    (A) The inclined plane (glide angle) begins in the clear zone 200 
feet past the end of the runway (and primary surface) at the same 
elevation as the end of the runway. It continues upward at a slope of 
50:1 (1 foot vertically for each 50 feet horizontally) to an elevation 
of 500 feet above the established airfield elevation. At that point the 
plane becomes horizontal, continuing at that same uniform elevation to a 
point 50,000 feet longitudinally from the beginning of the inclined 
plane (glide angle) and ending there.
    (B) The width of the surface at the beginning of the inclined plane 
(glide angle) is the same as the width of the clear zone. It then flares 
uniformly, reaching the maximum width of 16,000 feet at the end.
    (ii) The approach-departure clearance zone is the ground area under 
the approach-departure clearance surface.
    (iii) The transitional surface is a sideways extension of all 
primary surfaces, clear zones, and approach-departure clearance surfaces 
along inclined planes.
    (A) The inclined plane in each case begins at the edge of the 
surface.
    (B) The slope of the incline plane is 7:1 (1 foot vertically for 
each 7 feet horizontally). It continues to the point of intersection 
with the--

[[Page 453]]

    (1) Inner horizontal surface (which is the horizontal plane 150 feet 
above the established airfield elevation); or
    (2) Outer horizontal surface (which is the horizontal plane 500 feet 
above the established airfield elevation), whichever is applicable.
    (iv) The ``transitional zone'' is the ground area under the 
transitional surface. (It adjoins the primary surface, clear zone, and 
approach-departure clearance zone.)
    (b) General. (1) The Contractor shall comply with the requirements 
of this clause while--
    (i) Operating all ground equipment (mobile or stationary);
    (ii) Placing all materials; and
    (iii) Performing all work, upon and around all airfields.
    (2) The requirements of this clause are in addition to any other 
safety requirements of this contract.
    (c) The Contractor shall--
    (1) Report to the Contracting Officer before initiating any work;
    (2) Notify the Contracting Officer of proposed changes to locations 
and operations;
    (3) Not permit either its equipment or personnel to use any runway 
for purposes other than aircraft operation without permission of the 
Contracting Officer, unless the runway is--
    (i) Closed by order of the Contracting Officer; and
    (ii) Marked as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this clause;
    (4) Keep all paved surfaces, such as runways, taxiways, and 
hardstands, clean at all times and, specifically, free from small stones 
which might damage aircraft propellers or jet aircraft;
    (5) Operate mobile equipment according to the safety provisions of 
this clause, while actually performing work on the airfield. At all 
other times, the Contractor shall remove all mobile equipment to 
locations--
    (i) Approved by the Contracting Officer;
    (ii) At a distance of at least 750 feet from the runway centerline, 
plus any additional distance; and
    (iii) Necessary to ensure compliance with the other provisions of 
this clause; and
    (6) Not open a trench unless material is on hand and ready for 
placing in the trench. As soon as practicable after material has been 
placed and work approved, the Contractor shall backfill and compact 
trenches as required by the contract. Meanwhile, all hazardous 
conditions shall be marked and lighted in accordance with the other 
provisions of this clause.
    (d) Landing areas. The Contractor shall--
    (1) Place nothing upon the landing areas without the authorization 
of the Contracting Officer;
    (2) Outline those landing areas hazardous to aircraft, using (unless 
otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer) red flags by day, and 
electric, battery-operated low-intensity red flasher lights by night;
    (3) Obtain, at an airfield where flying is controlled, additional 
permission from the control tower operator every time before entering 
any landing area, unless the landing area is marked as hazardous in 
accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this clause;
    (4) Identify all vehicles it operates in landing areas by means of a 
flag on a staff attached to, and flying above, the vehicle. The flag 
shall be three feet square, and consist of a checkered pattern of 
international orange and white squares of 1 foot on each side (except 
that the flag may vary up to ten percent from each of these dimensions);
    (5) Mark all other equipment and materials in the landing areas, 
using the same marking devices as in paragraph (d)(2) of this clause; 
and
    (6) Perform work so as to leave that portion of the landing area 
which is available to aircraft free from hazards, holes, piles of 
material, and projecting shoulders that might damage an airplane tire.
    (e) Safety precaution areas. The Contractor shall--
    (1) Place nothing upon the safety precaution areas without 
authorization of the Contracting Officer;
    (2) Mark all equipment and materials in safety precaution areas, 
using (unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer) red flags 
by day, and electric, battery-operated, low-intensity red flasher lights 
by night; and
    (3) Provide all objects placed in safety precaution areas with a red 
light or red lantern at night, if the objects project above the 
approach-departure clearance surface or above the transitional surface.

    (a) The low offeror and the items to be awarded shall be determined 
as follows--
    (1) Prior to the opening of bids, the Government will determine the 
amount of funds available for the project.
    (2) The low offeror shall be the Offeror that--
    (i) Is otherwise eligible for award; and
    (ii) Offers the lowest aggregate amount for the first or base bid 
item, plus or minus (in the order stated in the list of priorities in 
the bid schedule) those additive or deductive items that provide the 
most features within the funds determined available.
    (3) The Contracting Officer shall evaluate all bids on the basis of 
the same additive or deductive items.
    (i) If adding another item from the bid schedule list of priorities 
would make the award exceed the available funds for all offerors, the 
Contracting Officer will skip that item and go to the next item from the 
bid schedule of priorities; and
    (ii) Add that next item if an award may be made that includes that 
item and is within the available funds.
    (b) The Contracting Officer will use the list of priorities in the 
bid schedule only to determine the low offeror. After determining the 
low offeror, an award may be made on any combination of items if--
    (1) It is in the best interest of the Government;
    (2) Funds are available at the time of award; and
    (3) The low offeror's price for the combination to be awarded is 
less than the price offered by any other responsive, responsible 
offeror.
    (c) Example. The amount available is $100,000. Offeror A's base bid 
and four additives (in the order stated in the list of priorities in the 
bid Schedule) are $85,000, $10,000, $8,000, $6,000, and $4,000. Offeror 
B's base bid and four additives are $80,000, $16,000, $9,000, $7,000, 
and $4,000. Offeror A is the low offeror. The aggregate amount of 
offeror A's bid for purposes of award would be $99,000, which includes a 
base bid plus the first and fourth additives. The second and third 
additives were skipped because each of them would cause the aggregate 
bid to exceed $100,000.

    As prescribed in 239.7411(a), use the following clause:

                 Rates, Charges, and Services (NOV 2005)

    (a) Definition--Governmental regulatory body means the Federal 
Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body 
with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state 
authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial 
appeal and regulatory bodies which regulate a company owned by the same 
entity which creates the regulatory body are not ``governmental 
regulatory bodies.''
    (b) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under 
this agreement/contract in accordance with--
    (1) All applicable tariffs, rates, charges, rules, regulations, or 
requirements;
    (i) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and
    (ii) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by 
the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;
    (2) Rates, terms, and conditions of service and facilities furnished 
or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's 
subscribers; or
    (3) Rates, terms, and conditions of service as may be agreed upon, 
subject, when appropriate, to jurisdiction of a governmental regulatory 
body.
    (c) The Government shall not prepay for services.
    (d) For nontariffed services, the Contractor shall charge the 
Government at the lowest rate and under the most favorable terms and 
conditions for similar service and facilities offered to any other 
customer.
    (e) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each 
case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of 
facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.
    (f) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause, of 
this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service 
or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The 
Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and 
facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.
    (g) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier 
than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When 
authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by 
the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay 
expediting charges only when--
    (1) They are provided for in the tariff established by a 
governmental regulatory body; or
    (2) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or 
other contractual document.

[[Page 463]]

    (h) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and 
the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is 
required, the Government may--
    (1) Provide the equipment; or
    (2) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If 
the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition 
shall be competitive, if practicable.
    (i) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for 
any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount 
paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified 
shall be equitably adjusted under applicable tariffs filed by the 
Contractor with the regulatory commission in effect at the time of 
deferral or change. If no tariffs are in effect, the Government and the 
Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure 
to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of 
fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.

    As prescribed in 239.7411(a), use the following clause:

            Cancellation or Termination of Orders (NOV 2005)

    (a) If the Government cancels any of the services ordered under this 
agreement/contract, before the services are made available to the 
Government, or terminates any of these services after they are made 
available to the Government, the Government shall reimburse the 
Contractor for the actual nonrecoverable costs the Contractor has 
reasonably incurred in providing facilities and equipment for which the 
Contractor has no foreseeable reuse.
    (b) The amount of the Government's liability upon cancellation or 
termination of any of the services ordered under this agreement/contract 
will be determined under applicable tariffs governing cancellation and 
termination charges which--
    (1) Are filed by the Contractor with a governmental regulatory body, 
as defined in the Rates, Charges, and Services clause of this agreement/
contract;
    (2) Are in effect on the date of termination; and
    (3) Provide specific cancellation or termination charges for the 
facilities and equipment involved or show how to determine the charges.
    (c) The amount of the Government's liability upon cancellation or 
termination of any of the services ordered under this agreement/
contract, which are not subject to a governmental regulatory body, will 
be determined under a mutually agreed schedule in the communication 
services authorization (CSA) or other contractual document.
    (d) If no applicable tariffs are in effect on the date of 
cancellation or termination or set forth in the applicable CSA or other 
contractual document, the Government's liability will be determined 
under the following settlement procedures--
    (1) The Contractor agrees to provide the Contracting Officer, in 
such reasonable detail as the Contracting Officer may require, inventory 
schedules covering all items of property or facilities in the 
Contractor's possession, the cost of which is included in the Basic 
Cancellation or Termination Liability for which the Contractor has no 
foreseeable reuse.
    (2) The Contractor shall use its best efforts to sell property or 
facilities when the Contractor has no foreseeable reuse or when the 
Government has not exercised its option to

[[Page 464]]

take title under the title to Telecommunications Facilities and 
Equipment clause of this agreement/contract. The Contractor shall apply 
any proceeds of the sale to reduce any payments by the Government to the 
Contractor under a cancellation or termination settlement.
    (3) The Contractor shall record actual nonrecoverable costs under 
established accounting procedures prescribed by the cognizant 
governmental regulatory authority or, if no such procedures have been 
prescribed, under generally accepted accounting procedures applicable to 
the provision of telecommunication services for public use.
    (4) The actual nonrecoverable costs are the installed costs of the 
facilities and equipment, less cost of reusable materials, and less net 
salvage value. Installed costs shall include the actual cost of 
equipment and materials specifically provided or used, plus the actual 
cost of installing (including engineering, labor, supervision, 
transportation, rights-of-way, and any other items which are chargeable 
to the capital accounts of the Contractor) less any costs the Government 
may have directly reimbursed the Contractor under the Special 
Construction and Equipment Charges clause of this agreement/contract. 
Deduct from the Contractor's installed cost, the net salvage value 
(salvage value less cost of removal). In determining net salvage value, 
give consideration to foreseeable reuse of the facilities and equipment 
by the Contractor. Make allowance for the cost of dismantling, removal, 
reconditioning, and disposal of the facilities and equipment when 
necessary either to the sale of facilities or their reuse by the 
Contractor in another location.
    (5) The Basic Cancellation Liability is defined as the actual 
nonrecoverable cost which the Government shall reimburse the Contractor 
at the time services are cancelled. The Basic Termination Liability is 
defined as the nonrecoverable cost amortized in equal monthly increments 
throughout the liability period. Upon termination of services, the 
Government shall reimburse the Contractor for the nonrecoverable cost 
less such costs amortized to the date services are terminated. Establish 
the liability period as mutually agreed to but not to exceed ten years.
    (6) When the Basic Cancellation or Termination Liability established 
by the CSA or other contractual document is based on estimated costs, 
the Contractor agrees to settle on the basis of actual cost at the time 
of termination or cancellation.
    (7) The Contractor agrees that, if after settlement but within the 
termination liability period of the services, should the Contractor make 
reuse of equipment or facilities which were treated as nonreusable or 
nonsalvagable in the settlement, the Contractor shall reimburse the 
Government for the value of the equipment or facilities.
    (8) The Contractor agrees to exclude--
    (i) Any costs which are not included in determining cancellation and 
termination charges under the Contractor's standard practices or 
procedures; and
    (ii) Charges not ordinarily made by the Contractor for similar 
facilities or equipment, furnished under similar circumstances.
    (e) The Government may, under such terms and conditions as it may 
prescribe, make partial payments and payments on account against costs 
incurred by the Contractor in connection with the canceled or terminated 
portion of this agreement/contract. The Government may make these 
payments if in the opinion of the Contracting Officer the total of the 
payments is within the amount the Contractor is entitled. If the total 
of the payments is in excess of the amount finally agreed or determined 
to be due under this clause, the Contractor shall pay the excess to the 
Government upon demand.
    (f) Failure to agree shall be a dispute concerning a question of 
fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause.

facilities or equipment to minimize the charges to the Government.
    (b) If at any time the Government requires that telecommunications 
facilities or equipment be relocated within the Contractor's service 
area, the Government shall have the option of paying the costs of 
relocating the facilities or equipment in lieu of paying any termination 
or cancellation charge under the Cancellation or Termination of Orders-
Common Carriers clause of this agreement/contract. The Basic Termination 
Liability applicable to the facilities or equipment in their former 
location shall continue to apply to the facilities and equipment in 
their new location. Monthly rental charges shall continue to be paid 
during the period.
    (c) When there is another requirement or foreseeable reuse in place 
of canceled or terminated facilities or equipment, no charge shall apply 
and the Basic Cancellation or Termination Liability shall be 
appropriately reduced. When feasible, the Contractor shall

[[Page 465]]

basis of the net salvage value, whichever is greater. The Contractor 
shall promptly pay the Government the amount of any credit.
    (c) The amount of the direct special construction charge shall not 
exceed--
    (1) The actual costs to the Contractor; and

    (1) Recurring charges for the services, facilities, and equipment do

costs or reimburse the Contractor for replacement costs at mutually 
acceptable rates under the following circumstances--

    (iii) Maintains a consistent, equitable, and unbiased logic for 
costing of material transactions; and
    (2) Assess its MMAS and take reasonable action to comply with the 
MMAS standards in paragraph (e) of this clause.
    (c) Disclosure and maintenance requirements. The Contractor shall--
    (1) Have policies, procedures, and operating instructions that 
adequately described its MMAS;
    (2) Provide to the Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO), upon 
request, the results of the internal reviews that it has conducted to 
ensure compliance with established MMAS policies, procedures, and 
operating instructions; and
    (3) Disclose significant changes in its MMAS to the ACO at least 30 
days prior to implementation.
    (d) Deficiencies. (1) If the Contractor receives a report from the 
ACO that identifies any deficiencies in its MMAS, the Contractor shall 
respond as follows:
    (i) If the Contractor agrees with the report findings and 
recommendations, the Contractor shall--
    (A) Within 30 days (or such other date as may be mutually agreed to 
by the ACO and the Contractor), state its agreement in writing; and
    (B) Within 60 days (or such other date as may be mutually agreed to 
by the ACO and the Contractor), correct the deficiencies or submit a 
corrective action plan showing milestones and actions to eliminate the 
deficiencies.
    (ii) If the Contractor disagrees with the report findings and 
recommendations, the Contractor shall, within 30 days (or such other 
date as may be mutually agreed to by the ACO and the Contractor), state 
its rationale for each area of disagreement.

[[Page 468]]

    (2) The ACO will evaluate the Contractor's response and will notify 
the Contractor in writing of the--
    (i) Determination concerning any remaining deficiencies;
    (ii) Adequacy of any proposed or completed corrective action plan; 
and
    (iii) Need for any new or revised corrective action plan.
    (3) When the ACO determines the MMAS deficiencies have a material 
impact on Government contract costs, the ACO must reduce progress 
payments by an appropriate percentage based on affected costs (in 
accordance with FAR 32.503-6) and/or disallow costs on vouchers (in 
accordance with FAR 42.803) until the ACO determines that--
    (i) The deficiencies are corrected; or
    (ii) The amount of the impact is immaterial.
    (4) If the contractor fails to make adequate progress, the ACO must 
take further action. The ACO may--
    (i) Elevate the issue to higher level management;
    (ii) Further reduce progress payments and/or disallow costs on 
vouchers;
    (iii) Notify the contractor of the inadequacy of the contractor's 
cost estimating system and/or cost accounting system; and
    (iv) Issue cautions to contracting activities regarding the award of 
future contracts.
    (e) MMAS standards. The MMAS shall have adequate internal controls 
to ensure system and data integrity, and shall--
    (1) Have an adequate system description including policies, 
procedures, and operating instructions that comply with the FAR and 
Defense FAR Supplement;
    (2) Ensure that costs of purchased and fabricated material charged 
or allocated to a contract are based on valid time-phased requirements 
as impacted by minimum/economic order quantity restrictions.
    (i) A 98 percent bill of material accuracy and a 95 percent master 
production schedule accuracy are desirable as a goal in order to ensure 
that requirements are both valid and appropriately time-phased.
    (ii) If systems have accuracy levels below these, the Contractor 
shall provide adequate evidence that--
    (A) There is no material harm to the Government due to lower 
accuracy levels; and
    (B) The cost to meet the accuracy goals is excessive in relation to 
the impact on the Government;
    (3) Provide a mechanism to identify, report, and resolve system 
control weaknesses and manual override. Systems should identify 
operational exceptions such as excess/residual inventory as soon as 
known;
    (4) Provide audit trails and maintain records (manual and those in 
machine readable form) necessary to evaluate system logic and to verify 
through transaction testing that the system is operating as desired;
    (5) Establish and maintain adequate levels of record accuracy, and 
include reconciliation of recorded inventory quantities to physical 
inventory by part number on a periodic basis. A 95 percent accuracy 
level is desirable. If systems have an accuracy level below 95 percent, 
the Contractor shall provide adequate evidence that--
    (i) There is no material harm to the Government due to lower 
accuracy levels; and
    (ii) The cost to meet the accuracy goal is excessive in relation to 
the impact on the Government;
    (6) Provide detailed descriptions of circumstances that will result 
in manual or system generated transfers of parts;
    (7) Maintain a consistent, equitable, and unbiased logic for costing 
of material transactions as follows:
    (i) The Contractor shall maintain and disclose written policies 
describing the transfer methodology and the loan/pay-back technique.
    (ii) The costing methodology may be standard or actual cost, or any 
of the inventory costing methods in 48 CFR 9904.411-50(b). The 
Contractor shall maintain consistency across all contract and customer 
types, and from accounting period to accounting period for initial 
charging and transfer charging.
    (iii) The system should transfer parts and associated costs within 
the same billing period. In the few instances where this may not be 
appropriate, the Contractor may accomplish the material transaction 
using a loan/pay-back technique. The ``loan/pay-back technique'' means 
that the physical part is moved temporarily from the contract, but the 
cost of the part remains on the contract. The procedures for the loan/
pay-back technique must be approved by the ACO. When the technique is 
used, the Contractor shall have controls to ensure--
    (A) Parts are paid back expeditiously;
    (B) Procedures and controls are in place to correct any overbilling 
that might occur;
    (C) Monthly, at a minimum, identification of the borrowing contract 
and the date the part was borrowed; and
    (D) The cost of the replacement part is charged to the borrowing 
contract;
    (8) Where allocations from common inventory accounts are used, have 
controls (in addition to those in paragraphs (e)(2) and (7) of this 
clause) to ensure that--
    (i) Reallocations and any credit due are processed no less 
frequently than the routine billing cycle;
    (ii) Inventories retained for requirements that are not under 
contract are not allocated to contracts; and
    (iii) Algorithms are maintained based on valid and current data;
    (9) Regardless of the provisions of FAR 45.505-3(f)(1)(ii), have 
adequate controls to

[[Page 469]]

ensure that physically commingled inventories that may include material 
for which costs are charged or allocated to fixed-price, cost-
reimbursement, and commercial contracts do not compromise requirements 
of any of the standards in paragraphs (e)(1) through (8) of this clause. 
Government-furnished material shall not be--
    (i) Physically commingled with other material; or
    (ii) Used on commercial work; and
    (10) Be subjected to periodic internal reviews to ensure compliance 
with established policies and procedures.

shall not be liable for the repair of any defects of material or design 
furnished by the Government or for the repair of any damage resulting 
from any defeat in Government-furnished material or design.

and the surrounding circumstances, supports a reasonable belief that an 
event has occurred or will occur.
    Critical safety item means a part, subassembly, assembly, subsystem, 
installation equipment, or support equipment for a system that contains 
a characteristic, any failure, malfunction, or absence of which could 
have a safety impact.

subcontractor under this contract.
    (b) The Contractor shall provide notification, in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of this clause, of--
    (1) All nonconformances for parts identified as critical safety 
items acquired by the Government under this contract; and
    (2) All nonconformances or deficiencies that may result in a safety 
impact for systems, or subsystems, assemblies, subassemblies, or parts 
integral to a system, acquired by or serviced for the Government under 
this contract.

occurring with regard to an item furnished by any subcontractor; and
    (2) Shall facilitate direct communication between the Government and 
the subcontractor as necessary.
    (e) Notification of safety issues under this clause shall be 
considered neither an admission of responsibility nor a release of 
liability for the defect or its consequences. This clause does not 
affect any right of the Government or the Contractor established 
elsewhere in this contract.
    (f)(1) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, 
including this paragraph (f), in subcontracts for--
    (i) Parts identified as critical safety items;
    (ii) Systems and subsystems, assemblies, and subassemblies integral 
to a system; or
    (iii) Repair, maintenance, logistics support, or overhaul services 
for systems and subsystems, assemblies, subassemblies, and parts 
integral to a system.

    (a) Definition. Wage adjustment, as used in this clause, means a 
change in the wages, salaries, or other terms or conditions of 
employment which--
    (1) Substantially affects the cost of performing this contract;
    (2) Is generally applicable to the port where work under this 
contract is performed; and
    (3) Applies to operations by the Contractor on non-Government work 
as well as to work under this contract.
    (b) General. The prices fixed in this contract are based on wages 
and working conditions established by collective bargaining agreements, 
and on other conditions in effect on the date of this contract. The 
Contracting Officer and the Contractor may agree to increase or decrease 
such prices in accordance with this clause.
    (c) Demand for negotiation. (1) At any time, subject to the 
limitations specified in this clause, either the Contracting Officer or 
the Contractor may deliver to the other a written demand that the 
parties negotiate to revise the prices under this contract.
    (2) No such demand shall be made before 90 days after the date of 
this contract, and thereafter neither party shall make a demand having 
an effective date within 90 days of the effective date of any prior 
demand. However, this limitation does not apply to a wage adjustment 
during the 90 day period.
    (3) Each demand shall specify a date (the same as or subsequent to 
the date of the delivery of the demand) as to when the revised prices 
shall be effective. This date is the effective date of the price 
revision.
    (i) If the Contractor makes a demand under this clause, the demand 
shall briefly state the basis of the demand and include the statements 
and data referred to in paragraph (d) of this clause.
    (ii) If the demand is made by the Contracting Officer, the 
Contractor shall furnish the statements and data within 30 days of the 
delivery of the demand.

(c)(3)(i) and (ii) of this clause, the Contractor shall submit--

prices for the services the Contractor will perform under this contract 
after the effective date of the price revision, itemized to be 
consistent with the original negotiations of the contract;
    (2) An explanation of the difference between the original (or last 
preceding) estimate and the new estimate;

[[Page 475]]

    (3) Such relevant operating data, cost records, overhead absorption 
reports, and accounting statements as may be of assistance in 
determining the accuracy and reliability of the new estimate;
    (4) A statement of the actual costs of performance under this 
contract to the extent that they are available at the time of the 
negotiation of the revision of prices under this clause; and
    (5) Any other relevant data usually furnished in the case of 
negotiations of prices under a new contract. The Government may examine 
and audit the Contractor's accounts, records, and books as the 
Contracting Officer considers necessary.
    (e) Negotiations. (1) Upon the filing of the statements and data 
required by paragraph (d) of this clause, the Contractor and the 
Contracting Officer shall negotiate promptly in good faith to agree upon 
prices for services the Contractor will perform on and after the 
effective date of the price revision.
    (2) If the prices in this contract were established by competitive 
negotiation, they shall not be revised upward unless justified by 
changes in conditions occurring after the contract was awarded.
    (3) The agreement reached after each negotiation will be 
incorporated into the contract by supplemental agreement.
    (f) Disagreements. If, within 30 days after the date on which 
statements and data are required pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
clause, the Contracting Officer and the Contractor fail to agree to 
revised prices, the failure to agree shall be resolved in accordance 
with the Disputes clause of this contract. The prices fixed by the 
Contracting Officer will remain in effect for the balance of the 
contract, and the Contractor shall continue performance.
    (g) Retroactive changes in wages or working conditions. (1) In the 
event of a retroactive wage adjustment, the Contractor or the 
Contracting Officer may request an equitable adjustment in the prices in 
this contract.
    (2) The Contractor shall request a price adjustment within 30 days 
of any retroactive wage adjustment. The Contractor shall support its 
request with--
    (i) An estimate of the changes in cost resulting from the 
retroactive wage adjustment;
    (ii) Complete information upon which the estimate is based; and
    (iii) A certified copy of the collective bargaining agreement, 
arbitration award, or other document evidencing the retroactive wage 
adjustment.
    (3) Subject to the limitation in paragraph (g)(2) of this clause as 
to the time of making a request, completion or termination of this 
contract shall not affect the Contractor's right under paragraph (g) of 
this clause.
    (4) In case of disagreement concerning any question of fact, 
including whether any adjustment should be made, or the amount of such 
adjustment, the disagreement will be resolved in accordance with the 
Disputes clause of this contract.
    (5) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing 
of any request by or on behalf of the employees of the Contractor which 
may result in a retroactive wage adjustment. The notice shall be given 
within 20 days after the request, or if the request occurs before 
contract execution, at the time of execution.

    (a) Definitions. Major defense program means a program that is 
carried out to produce or acquire a major system (as defined in 10 
U.S.C. 2302(5)) (see also DoD 5000.2-R, Mandatory Procedures for Major

terminations or substantial reductions under major defense programs.
    (c) Notice to employees and state and local officials. Within 2

work is directly related to the defense contract; or
    (2) If there is no such representative, each such employee;

eligible for training, adjustment assistance, and employment services 
under section 325 or 325A of the Job Training Partnership Act (29 U.S.C.

252.251-7000  Ordering from Government supply sources.

    As prescribed in 251.107, use the following clause:

           Ordering From Government Supply Sources (NOV 2004)

    (a) When placing orders under Federal Supply Schedules, Personal 
Property Rehabilitation Price Schedules, or Enterprise Software 
Agreements, the Contractor shall follow the terms of the applicable 
schedule or agreement and authorization. Include in each order:
    (1) A copy of the authorization (unless a copy was previously 
furnished to the Federal Supply Schedule, Personal Property 
Rehabilitation Price Schedule, or Enterprise Software Agreement 
contractor).
    (2) The following statement: Any price reductions negotiated as part 
of an Enterprise Software Agreement issued under a Federal Supply 
Schedule contract shall control. In the event of any other 
inconsistencies between an Enterprise Software Agreement, established as 
a Federal Supply Schedule blanket purchase agreement, and the Federal 
Supply Schedule contract, the latter shall govern.
    (3) The completed address(es) to which the Contractor's mail, 
freight, and billing documents are to be directed.
    (b) When placing orders under nonmandatory schedule contracts and 
requirements contracts, issued by the General Services Administration 
(GSA) Office of Information Resources Management, for automated data 
processing equipment, software and maintenance, communications equipment 
and supplies, and teleprocessing services, the Contractor shall follow 
the terms of the applicable contract and the procedures in paragraph (a) 
of this clause.
    (c) When placing orders for Government stock, the Contractor shall--
    (1) Comply with the requirements of the Contracting Officer's

    (2) Use only the GSA Form 1948-A, Retail Services Shopping Plate, 
when ordering from GSA Self-Service Stores;
    (3) Order only those items required in the performance of Government 
contracts; and
    (4) Pay invoices from Government supply sources promptly. For 
purchases made from DoD supply sources, this means within 30 days of the 
date of a proper invoice. The Contractor shall annotate each invoice 
with the date of receipt. For purposes of computing interest for late 
Contractor payments, the Government's invoice is deemed to be a demand 
for payment in accordance with the Interest clause of this contract. The 
Contractor's failure to pay may also result in the DoD supply source 
refusing to honor the requisition (see DFARS 251.102(f)) or in the 
Contracting Officer terminating the Contractor's authorization to use 
DoD supply sources. In the event the Contracting Officer decides to 
terminate the authorization due to the Contractor's failure to pay in a 
timely manner, the Contracting Officer shall provide the Contractor with 
prompt written notice of the intent to terminate the authorization and 
the basis for such action. The Contractor shall have 10 days after 
receipt of the Government's notice in which to provide additional 
information as to why the authorization should not be terminated. The 
termination shall not provide the Contractor with an excusable delay for 
failure to perform or complete the contract in accordance with the terms 
of the contract, and the Contractor shall be solely responsible for any 
increased costs.

[[Page 486]]

    (d) Only the Contractor may request authorization for subcontractor 
use of Government supply sources. The Contracting Officer will not grant 
authorizations for subcontractor use without approval of the Contractor.
    (e) Government invoices shall be submitted to the Contractor's 
billing address, and Contractor payments shall be sent to the Government 
remittance address specified below:

Contractor's Billing Address (include point of contact and telephone 
number):

Government Remittance Address (include point of contact and telephone 
number):

    (b) The Contractor should make requests for any unusual quantities 
of vehicles as far in advance as possible.
    (c) The Contractor shall establish and enforce suitable penalties 
for employees who use or authorize the use of Government vehicles for 
other than performance of Government contracts.
    (d) The Contractor shall assume, without the right of reimbursement 
from the Government, the cost or expense of any use of IFMS vehicles and 
services not related to the performance of the contract.
    (e) Only the Contractor may request authorization for subcontractor 
use of IFMS vehicles. The Contracting Officer will not grant

Approved 1 May 1962.
Revised 1 May 1969.
Revised 1 September 1973.
Revised 1 July 1979.

                             Part 1--Charter

    1. There is created the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals 
which is hereby designated as the authorized representative of the 
Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the 
Navy and the Secretary of the Air Force, in hearing, considering and 
determining appeals by contractors from decisions of contracting 
officers or their authorized representatives or other authorities on 
disputed questions. These appeals may be taken (a) pursuant to the 
Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. Sec. 601, et seq.), (b) 
pursuant to the provisions of contracts requiring the decision by the 
Secretary of Defense or by a Secretary of a Military Department or their 
duly authorized representative or board, or (c) pursuant to the 
provisions of any directive whereby the Secretary of Defense or the 
Secretary of a Military Department has granted a right of appeal not 
contained in the contract on any matter consistent with the contract 
appeals procedure. The Board may determine contract disputes for other 
departments and agencies by agreement. The Board shall operate under 
general policies established or approved by the Under Secretary of 
Defense (Research and Engineering).
    2. Membership of the Board shall consist of attorneys at law who 
have been qualified in the manner prescribed by the Contract Disputes 
Act of 1978. Members of the Board are hereby designated Administrative 
Judges. There shall be appointed from members of the Board a chairman 
and two or more vice-chairmen. Appointment of the chairman and vice-
chairmen and other members of the Board shall be made by the Under 
Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) and the Assistant 
Secretaries of the Military Departments responsible for procurement. The 
chairman and vice-chairmen shall serve in that capacity for a two-year 
term unless sooner removed or reappointed for an additional term or 
terms. The Under Secretary will also designate the order in which the 
vice-chairmen will act for the chairman in his absence. In the absence 
of a vice-chairman, the chairman or acting chairman may designate a 
member of the Board to serve as a temporary vice-chairman.
    3. It shall be the duty and obligation of the members of the Armed 
Services Board of Contract Appeals to decide appeals on the record of 
the appeal to the best of their knowledge and ability in accordance with 
applicable contract provisions and in accordance with law and regulation 
pertinent thereto.
    4. The chairman of the Board shall be responsible for establishing 
appropriate divisions of the Board to provide for the most effective and 
expeditous handling of appeals. He shall be reponsible for assigning 
appeals to the divisions for decision without regard to the military 
department or other procuring agency which entered into the contract. A 
division may consist of one or more members of the Board. The chairman 
shall designate one member of each division as the division head. The 
division heads and the chairman and vice-chairmen shall constitute the 
senior deciding group of the Board. A majority of the members of a 
division or of the senior deciding group shall constitute a quorum for 
the transaction of the business of each, respectively. Decisions of the 
Board shall be by majority vote of the members of a division 
participating and the chairman and a vice-chairman, unless the chairman 
refers the appeal for decision by the senior deciding group. The 
decision of the Board in cases so referred to the senior deciding group 
shall be by majority vote of the participating members of that group. 
The chairman may refer an appeal of unusual difficulty, significant 
precedential importance, or serious dispute within the normal decision 
process for decision by the senior deciding group. An appeal involving 
$50,000 or less may be decided by a single member or fewer members of 
the Board than hereinbefore provided for cases of unlimited dollar 
amount, under accelerated or expedited procedures as provided in the 
Rules of the Board and the Contract Disputes Act of 1978.
    5. The Board shall have all powers necessary and incident to the 
proper performance of its duties. Subject to the approval of the Under 
Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) and the Assistant 
Secretaries of the Military Departments responsible for procurement, the 
Board shall adopt its own methods of procedure, and rules and 
regulations for its conduct and for the preparation and presentation of 
appeals and issuance of opinions. The Military Departments and other 
procuring agencies shall

[[Page 490]]

provide legal personnel to prepare and present the contentions of the 
departments or agencies in relation to appeals filed with the Board. It 
shall not be necessary for the Board, unless it otherwise desires, to 
communicate with more than one trial attorney in each of the departments 
or agencies concerning the preparation and presentation of appeals and 
the obtaining of all records deemed by the Board to be pertinent 
thereto.
    6. Any member of the Board or any examiner, designated by the 
chairman, shall be authorized to hold hearings, examine witnesses, and 
receive evidence and argument for consideration and determination of the 
appeal by the designated division. A member of the Board shall have 
authority to administer oaths and issue subpoenas as specified in 
section 11 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978. The chairman may 
request orders of the court in cases of contumacy or refusal to obey a 
subpoena in the manner prescribed in that section.
    7. The chairman shall be responsible for the internal organization 
of the Board and for its administration. He shall provide within 
approved ceilings for the staffing of the Board with non-member 
personnel, including hearing examiners, as may be required for the 
performance of the functions of the Board. The chairman shall appoint a 
recorder of the Board. Such personnel shall be responsible to and shall 
function under the direction, supervision and control of the chairman.
    8. The Board will be serviced by the Department of the Army for 
administrative support for its operations as required. Administrative 
support will include budgeting, funding, fiscal control, manpower 
control and utilization, personnel administration, security 
administration, supplies, and other administrative services. The 
Departments of the Army, Navy, Air Force and the Office of the Secretary 
of Defense will participate in financing the Board's operations on an 
equal basis and to the extent determined by the Assistant Secretary of 
Defense (Comptroller). The cost of processing appeals for departments 
and agencies other than those in the Department of Defense will be 
reimbursed.
    9. The chairman of the Board will furnish the Secretary of Defense 
and to the Secretaries of the Military Departments by October 31 of each 
year a report containing an account of the Board's transactions and 
proceedings for the preceding fiscal year. Within 30 days following the 
close of a calendar quarter, the chairman shall forward a report of the 
Board's proceedings for the quarter to the Under Secretary of Defense 
(Research and Engineering), the Assistant Secretaries of the Military 
Departments responsible for procurement, and to the Director of the 
Defense Logistics Agency. Such reports shall disclose the number of 
appeals received, cases heard, opinions rendered, current reserve of 
pending matters, and such other information as may be required.
    10. The Board shall have a seal bearing the following inscription: 
``Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals.'' This seal shall be affixed 
to all authentications of copies of records and to such other 
instruments as the Board may determine.

                                 Preface

                 I. Jurisdiction for Considering Appeals

    The Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (referred to herein as 
the Board) shall consider and determine appeals from decisions of 
contracting officers pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 Pub. 
L. 95-563, 41 U.S.C. 601-613) relating to contracts made by (i) the 
Departments of Defense, Army, Navy and Air Force or (ii) any other 
executive agency when such agency or the Administrator for Federal 
Procurement Policy has designated the Board to decide the appeal.

               II. Location and Organization of the Board

    (a) The Board's address is Skyline Six, 5109 Leesburg Pike, 7th 
Floor, Falls Church, VA 22041-3217, telephone (703) 681-8500 
(receptionist), (703) 681-8502 (recorder).
    (b) The Board consists of a chairman, two or more vice chairmen, and 
other members, all of whom are attorneys at law duly licensed by a 
state, commonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia. Board 
members are designated Administrative Judges.
    (c) There are a number of divisions of the Armed Services Board of 
Contract Appeals, established by the Chairman of the Board in such 
manner as to provide for the most effective and expeditious handling of 
appeals. The Chairman and a Vice Chairman of the Board act as members of 
each division. Appeals are assigned to the divisions for decision 
without regard to the military department or other procuring agency 
which entered into the contract involved. Hearing may be held by a 
designated member (Administrative Judge), or by a duly authorized 
examiner. Except for

[[Page 491]]

appeals processed under the expedited or accelerated procedure, the 
decision of a majority of a division constitutes the decision of the 
Board, unless the chairman refers the appeal to the Board's Senior 
Deciding Group (consisting of the chairman, vice chairmen and all 
division heads), in which event a decision of a majority of that group 
constitutes the decision of the Board. Appeals referred to the Senior 
Deciding Group are those of unusual difficulty, significant precedential 
importance, or serious dispute within the normal division decision 
process. For decisions of appeals processed under the expedited or 
accelerated procedure, see rules 12.2(c) and 12.3(b).

                         Preliminary Procedures

    1. Appeals, How Taken. (a) Notice of an appeal shall be in writing 
and mailed or otherwise furnished to the Board within 90 days from the 
date of receipt of a contracting officer's decision. A copy thereof 
shall be furnished to the contracting officer from whose decision the 
appeal is taken.
    (b) Where the contractor has submitted a claim of $50,000 or less to 
the contracting officer and has requested a written decision within 60 
days from receipt of the request, and the contracting officer has not 
done so, the contractor may file a notice of appeal as provided in 
subparagraph (a) above, citing the failure of the contracting officer to 
issue a decision.
    (c) Where the contractor has submitted a properly certified claim 
over $50,000 to the contracting officer or has requested a decision by 
the contracting officer which presently involves no monetary amount 
pursuant to the Disputes clause, and the contracting officer has failed 
to issue a decision within a reasonable time, taking into account such 
factors as the size and complexity of the claim, the contractor may file 
a notice of appeal as provided in subparagraph (a) above, citing the 
failure of the contracting officer to issue a decision.
    (d) Upon docketing of appeals filed pursuant to (b) or (c) hereof, 
the Board may, at its option, stay further proceedings pending issuance 
of a final decision by the contracting officer within such period of 
time as is determined by the Board.
    (e) In lieu of filing a notice of appeal under (b) or (c) hereof, 
the contractor may request the Board to direct the contracting officer 
to issue a decision in a specified period of time, as determined by the 
Board, in the event of undue delay on the part of the contracting 
officer.
    2. Notice of Appeal, Contents of. A notice of appeal should indicate 
that an appeal is being taken and should identify the contract (by 
number), the department and/or agency involved in the dispute, the 
decision from which the appeal is taken, and the amount in dispute, if 
known. The notice of appeal should be signed personally by the appellant 
(the contractor taking the appeal), or by the appellant's duly 
authorized representative or attorney. The complaint referred to in rule 
6 may be filed with the notice of appeal, or the appellant may designate 
the notice of appeal as a complaint, if it otherwise fulfills the 
requirements of a complaint.
    3. Docketing of Appeals. When a notice of appeal in any form has 
been received by the Board, it shall be docketed promptly. Notice in 
writing shall be given to the appellant with a copy of these rules, and 
to the contracting officer.
    4. Preparation, Content, Organization, Forwarding, and Status of 
Appeal File--(a) Duties of Contracting Officer--Within 30 days of 
receipt of an appeal, or notice that an appeal has been filed, the 
contracting officer shall assemble and transmit to the Board an appeal 
file consisting of all documents pertinent to the appeal, including:
    (1) The decision from which the appeal is taken;
    (2) The contract, including pertinent specifications, amendments, 
plans and drawings;
    (3) All correspondence between the parties relevant to the appeal, 
including the letter or letters of claim in response to which the 
decision was issued;
    (4) Transcripts of any testimony taken during the course of 
proceedings, and affidavits or statements of any witnesses on the matter 
in dispute made prior to the filing of the notice of appeal with the 
Board; and
    (5) Any additional information considered relevant to the appeal.
    Within the same time above specified the contracting officer shall 
furnish the appellant a copy of each document he transmits to the Board, 
except those in subparagraph (a)(2) above. As to the latter, a list 
furnished appellant indicating specific contractual documents 
transmitted will suffice.
    (b) Duties of the Appellant--Within 30 days after receipt of a copy 
of the appeal file assembled by the contracting officer, the appellant 
shall transmit to the Board any documents not contained therein which he 
considers relevant to the appeal, and furnish two copies of such 
documents to the government trial attorney.
    (c) Organization of Appeal File--Documents in the appeal file may be 
originals or legible facsimiles or authenticated copies, and shall be 
arranged in chronological order where practicable, numbered 
sequentially, tabbed, and indexed to identify the contents of the file.
    (d) Lengthy Documents--Upon request by either party, the Board may 
waive the requirement to furnish to the other party copies of bulky, 
lengthy, or out-of-size documents in the appeal file when inclusion 
would be burdensome. At the time a party files with the Board a document 
as to which such a waiver has been granted he shall notify the other

[[Page 492]]

party that the document or a copy is available for inspection at the 
offices of the Board or of the party filing same.
    (e) Status of Documents in Appeal File--Documents contained in the 
appeal file are considered, without further action by the parties, as 
part of the record upon which the Board will render its decision. 
However, a party may object, for reasons stated, to consideration of a 
particular document or documents reasonably in advance of hearing or, if 
there is no hearing, of settling the record. If such objection is made, 
the Board shall remove the document or documents from the appeal file 
and permit the party offering the document to move its admission as 
evidence in accordance with rules 13 and 20.
    (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the filing of the rule 4 (a) and 
(b) documents may be dispensed with by the Board either upon request of 
the appellant in his notice of appeal or thereafter upon stipulation of 
the parties.
    5. Motions. (a) Any motion addressed to the jurisdiction of the 
Board shall be promptly filed. Hearing on the motion shall be afforded 
on application of either party. However, the Board may defer its 
decision on the motion pending hearing on both the merits and the 
motion. The Board shall have the right at any time and on its own 
initiative to raise the issue of its jurisdiction to proceed with a 
particular case, and shall do so by an appropriate order, affording the 
parties an opportunity to be heard thereon.
    (b) The Board may entertain and rule upon other appropriate motions.
    6. Pleadings--(a) Appellant--Within 30 days after receipt of notice 
of docketing of the appeal, the appellant shall file with the Board an 
original and two copies of a complaint setting forth simple, concise and 
direct statements of each of its claims. Appellant shall also set forth 
the basis, with appropriate reference to contract provisions, of each 
claim and the dollar amount claimed, to the extent known. This pleading 
shall fulfill the generally recognized requirements of a complaint, 
although no particular form is required. Upon receipt of the complaint, 
the Board shall serve a copy of it upon the Government. Should the 
complaint not be received within 30 days, appellant's claim and appeal 
may, if in the opinion of the Board the issues before the Board are 
sufficiently defined, be deemed to set forth its complaint and the 
Government shall be so notified.
    (b) Government--Within 30 days from receipt of the complaint, or the 
aforesaid notice from the Board, the Government shall prepare and file 
with the Board an original and two copies of an answer thereto. The 
answer shall set forth simple, concise and direct statements of 
Government's defenses to each claim asserted by appellant, including any 
affirmative defenses available. Upon receipt of the answer, the Board 
shall serve a copy upon appellant. Should the answer not be received 
within 30 days, the Board may, in its discretion, enter a general denial 
on behalf of the Government, and the appellant shall be so notified.
    (c) A party who intends to raise an issue concerning the law of a 
foreign country shall give notice in his pleadings or other reasonable 
written notice. The Board, in determining foreign law, may consider any 
relevant material or source, including testimony, whether or not 
submitted by a party or admissible under Rules 11, 13 or 20. The 
determination of foreign law shall be treated as a ruling on a question 
of law.
    7. Amendments of Pleadings or Record. The Board upon its own 
initiative or upon application by a party may order a party to make a 
more definite statement of the complaint or answer, or to reply to an 
answer. The Board may, in its discretion, and within the proper scope of 
the appeal, permit either party to amend its pleading upon conditions 
fair to both parties. When issues within the proper scope of the appeal, 
but not raised by the pleadings, are tried by express or implied consent 
of the parties, or by permission of the Board, they shall be treated in 
all respects as if they had been raised therein. In such instances, 
motions to amend the pleadings to conform to the proof may be entered, 
but are not required. If evidence is objected to at a hearing on the 
ground that it is not within the issues raised by the pleadings, it may 
be admitted within the proper scope of the appeal, provided, however, 
that the objecting party may be granted a continuance if necessary to 
enable it to meet such evidence.
    8. Hearing Election. After filing of the Government's answer or 
notice from the Board that it has entered a general denial on behalf of 
the Government, each party shall advise whether it desires a hearing as 
prescribed in Rules 17 through 25, or whether it elects to submit its 
case on the record without a hearing, as prescribed in Rule 11.
    9. Prehearing Briefs. Based on an examination of the pleadings, and 
its determination of whether the arguments and authorities addressed to 
the issues are adequately set forth therein, the Board may, in its 
discretion, require the parties to submit prehearing briefs in any case 
in which a hearing has been elected pursuant to Rule 8. If the Board 
does not require prehearing briefs either party may, in its discretion 
and upon appropriate and sufficient notice to the other party, furnish a 
prehearing brief to the Board. In any case where a prehearing brief is 
submitted, it shall be furnished so as to be received by the Board at 
least 15 days prior to the date set for hearing, and a copy shall 
simultaneously be furnished to the other party as previously arranged.

[[Page 493]]

    10. Prehearing or Presubmission Conference. (a) Whether the case is 
to be submitted pursuant to Rule 11, or heard pursuant to Rules 17 
through 25, the Board may upon its own initiative, or upon the 
application of either party, arrange a telephone conference or call upon 
the parties to appear before an administrative judge or examiner of the 
Board for a conference to consider:
    (1) Simplification, clarification, or severing of the issues;
    (2) The possibility of obtaining stipulations, admissions, 
agreements and rulings on admissibility of docments, understandings on 
matters already of record, or similar agreements that will avoid 
unnecessary proof;
    (3) Agreements and rulings to facilitate discovery;
    (4) Limitation of the number of expert witnesses, or avoidance of 
similar cumulative evidence;
    (5) The possibility of agreement disposing of any or all of the 
issues in dispute; and
    (6) Such other matters as may aid in the disposition of the appeal.
    (b) The administrative judge or examiner of the Board shall make 
such rulings and orders as may be appropriate to aid in the disposition 
of the appeal. The results of pretrial conferences, including any 
rulings and orders, shall be reduced to writing by the administrative 
judge or examiner and this writing shall thereater constitute a part of 
the record.
    11. Submission Without a Hearing. Either party may elect to waive a 
hearing and to submit its case upon the record before the Board, as 
settled pursuant to Rule 13. Submission of a case without hearing does 
not relieve the parties from the necessity of proving the facts 
supporting their allegations or defenses. Affidavits, depositions, 
admissions, answers to interrogatories, and stipulations may be employed 
to supplement other documentary evidence in the Board record. The Board 
may permit such submissions to be supplemented by oral argument 
(transcribed if requested), and by briefs arranged in accordance with 
Rule 23.
    12. Optional SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) and ACCELERATED Procedures. 
These procedures are available solely at the election of the appellant.
    12.1 Elections to Utilize SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) and ACCELERATED 
Procedures. (a) In appeals where the amount in dispute is $10,000 or 
less, the appellant may elect to have the appeal processed under a SMALL 
CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure requiring decision of the appeal, whenever 
possible, within 120 days after the Board receives written notice of the 
appellant's election to utilize this procedure. The details of this 
procedure appear in section 12.2 of this Rule. An appellant may elect 
the ACCELERATED procedure rather than the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) 
procedure for any appeal eligible for the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) 
procedure.
    (b) In appeals where the amount in dispute is $50,000 or less, the 
appellant may elect to have the appeal processed under an ACCELERATED 
procedure requiring decision of the appeal, whenever possible, within 
180 days after the Board receives written notice of the appellant's 
election to utilize this procedure. The details of this procedure appear 
in section 12.3 of this Rule.
    (c) The appellant's election of either the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) 
procedure or the ACCELERATED procedure may be made by written notice 
within 60 days after receipt of notice of docketing, unless such period 
is extended by the Board for good cause. The election may not be 
withdrawn except with permission of the Board and for good cause.
    12.2 The Small Claims (Expedited) Procedure. (a) In cases proceeding 
under the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure, the following time periods 
shall apply:
    (1) Within 10 days from the Government's first receipt from either 
the appellant or the Board of a copy of the appellant's notice of 
election of the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure, the Government shall 
send the Board a copy of the contract, the contracting officer's final 
decision, and the appellant's claim letter or letters, if any; remaining 
documents required under Rule 4 shall be submitted in accordance with 
times specified in that rule unless the Board otherwise directs.
    (2) Within 15 days after the Board has acknowledged receipt of 
appellant's notice of election, the assigned administrative judge shall 
take the following actions, if feasible, in an informal meeting or a 
telephone conference with both parties: (i) Identify and simplify the 
issues; (ii) establish a simplified procedure appropriate to the 
particular appeal involved; (iii) determine whether either party wants a 
hearing, and if so, fix a time and place therefor; (iv) require the 
Government to furnish all the additional documents relevant to the 
appeal; and (v) establish an expedited schedule for resolution of the 
appeal.
    (b) Pleadings, discovery, and other prehearing activity will be 
allowed only as consistent with the requirement to conduct the hearing 
on the date scheduled, or if no hearing is scheduled, to close the 
record on a date that will allow decisions within the 120-day limit. The 
Board, in its discretion, may impose shortened time periods for any 
actions prescribed or allowed under these rules, as necessary to enable 
the Board to decide the appeal within the 120-day limit, allowing 
whatever time, up to 30 days, that the Board considers necessary for the 
preparation of the decision after closing the record and the filing of 
briefs, if any.

[[Page 494]]

    (c) Written decision by the Board in cases processed under the SMALL 
CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure will be short and contain only summary 
findings of fact and conclusions. Decisions will be rendered for the 
Board by a single administrative judge. If there has been a hearing, the 
administrative judge presiding at the hearing may, in the judge's 
discretion, at the conclusion of the hearing and after entertaining such 
oral arguments as deemed appropriate, render on the record oral summary 
findings of fact, conclusions, and a decision of the appeal. Whenever 
such an oral decision is rendered, the Board will subsequently furnish 
the parties a typed copy of such oral decision for record and payment 
purposes and to establish the starting date for the period for filing a 
motion for reconsideration under rule 29.
    (d) A decision against the Government or the contractor shall have 
no value as precedent, and in the absence of fraud shall be final and 
conclusive and may not be appealed or set aside.
    12.3 The Accelerated Procedure. (a) In cases proceeding under the 
Accelerated procedure, the parties are encouraged, to the extent 
possible consistent with adequate presentation of their factual and 
legal positions, to waive pleadings, discovery, and briefs. The Board, 
in its discretion, may shorten time periods prescribed or allowed 
elsewhere in these rules, including rule 4, as necessary to enable the 
Board to decide the appeal within 180 days after the Board has received 
the appellant's notice of election of the ACCELERATED procedure, and may 
reserve 30 days for preparation of the decision.
    (b) Written decision by the Board in cases processed under the 
ACCELERATED procedure will normally be short and contain only summary 
findings of fact and conclusions. Decisions will be rendered for the 
Board by a single administrative judge with the concurrence of a vice 
chairman, or by a majority among these two and the chairman in case of 
disagreement. Alternatively, in cases where the amount in dispute is 
$10,000 or less as to which the ACCELERATED procedure has been elected 
and in which there has been a hearing, the single administrative judge 
presiding at the hearing may, with the concurrence of both parties, at 
the conclusion of the hearing and after entertaining such oral arguments 
as deemed appropriate, render on the record oral summary findings of 
fact, conclusions, and a decision of the appeal. Whenever such an oral 
decision is rendered, the Board will subsequently furnish the parties a 
typed copy of such oral decision for record and payment purposes, and to 
establish the starting date for the period of filing a motion for 
reconsideration under Rule 29.
    12.4 Motions for Reconsideration in Rule 12 Cases. Motions for 
Reconsideration of cases decided under either the SMALL CLAIMS 
(EXPEDITED) procedure or the ACCELERATED procedure need not be decided 
within the original 120-day or 180-day limit, but all such motions shall 
be processed and decided rapidly so as to fulfill the intent of this 
Rule.
    13. Settling the Record. (a) The record upon which the Board's 
decision will be rendered consists of the documents furnished under 
Rules 4 and 12, to the extent admitted in evidence, and the following 
items, if any: pleadings, prehearing conference memoranda or orders, 
prehearing briefs, depositions or interrogatories received in evidence, 
admissions, stipulations, transcripts of conferences and hearings, 
hearing exhibits, post-hearing briefs, and documents which the Board has 
specifically designated be made a part of the record. The record will, 
at all reasonable times, be available for inspection by the parties at 
the office of the Board.
    (b) Except as the Board may otherwise order in its discretion, no 
proof shall be received in evidence after completion of an oral hearing 
or, in cases submitted on the record, after notification by the Board 
that the case is ready for decision.
    (c) The weight to be attached to any evidence of record will rest 
within the sound discretion of the Board. The Board may in any case 
require either party, with appropriate notice to the other party, to 
submit additional evidence on any matter relevant to the appeal.
    14. Discovery--Depositions--(a) General Policy and Protective 
Orders--The parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary discovery 
procedures. In connection with any deposition or other discovery 
procedure, the Board may make any order required to protect a party or 
person from annoyance, embarrassment, or undue burden or expense. Those 
orders may include limitations on the scope, method, time and place for 
discovery, and provisions for protecting the secrecy of confidential 
information or documents.
    (b) When Depositions Permitted--After an appeal has been docketed 
and complaint filed, the parties may mutually agree to, or the Board 
may, upon application of either party, order the taking of testimony of 
any person by deposition upon oral examination or written 
interrogatories before any officer authorized to administer oaths at the 
place of examination, for use as evidence or for purpose of discovery. 
The application for order shall specify whether the purpose of the 
deposition is discovery or for use as evidence.
    (c) Orders on Depositions--The time, place, and manner of taking 
depositions shall be as mutually agreed by the parties, or failing such 
agreement, governed by order of the Board.
    (d) Use as Evidence--No testimony taken by depositions shall be 
considered as part of the evidence in the hearing of an appeal until

[[Page 495]]

such testimony is offered and received in evidence at such hearing. It 
will not ordinarily be received in evidence if the deponent is present 
and can testify at the hearing. In such instances, however, the 
deposition may be used to contradict or impeach the testimony of the 
deponent given at the hearing. In cases submitted on the record, the 
Board may, in its discretion, receive depositions to supplement the 
record.
    (e) Expenses--Each party shall bear its own expenses associated with 
the taking of any deposition.
    (f) Subpoenas--Where appropriate, a party may request the issuance 
of a subpoena under the provisions of Rule 21.
    15. Interrogatories to Parties, Admission of Facts, and Production 
and Inspection of Documents. After an appeal has been docketed and 
complaint filed with the Board, a party may serve on the other party: 
(a) Written interrogatories to be answered separately in writing, signed 
under oath and answered or objected to within 45 days after service; (b) 
a request for the admission of specified facts and/or the authenticity 
of any documents, to be answered or objected to within 45 days after 
service; the factual statements and the authenticity of the documents to 
be deemed admitted upon failure of a party to respond to the request; 
and (c) a request for the production, inspection and copying of any 
documents or objects not privileged, which reasonably may lead to the 
discovery of admissible evidence, to be answered or objected to within 
45 days after service. The Board may allow a shorter or longer time. Any 
discovery engaged in under this Rule shall be subject to the provisions 
of Rule 14(a) with respect to general policy and protective orders, and 
of Rule 35 with respect to sanctions.
    16. Service of Papers Other Than Subpoenas. Papers shall be served 
personally or by mail, addressed to the party upon whom service is to be 
made. Copies of complaints, answers and briefs shall be filed directly 
with the Board. The party filing any other paper with the Board shall 
send a copy thereof to the opposing party, noting on the paper filed 
with the Board that a copy has been so furnished. Subpoenas shall be 
served as provided in Rule 21.

                                Hearings

    17. Where and When Held. Hearings will be held at such places 
determined by the Board to best serve the interests of the parties and 
the Board. Hearings will be scheduled at the discretion of the Board 
with due consideration to the regular order of appeals, Rule 12 
requirements, and other pertinent factors. On request or motion by 
either party and for good cause, the Board may, in its discretion, 
adjust the date of a hearing.
    18. Notice of Hearings. The parties shall be given at least 15 days 
notice of the time and place set for hearings. In scheduling hearings, 
the Board will consider the desires of the parties and the requirement 
for just and inexpensive determination of appeals without unnecessary 
delay. Notices of hearings shall be promptly acknowledged by the 
parties.
    19. Unexcused Absence of a Party. The unexcused absence of a party 
at the time and place set for hearing will not be occasion for delay. In 
the event of such absence, the hearing will proceed and the case will be 
regarded as submitted by the absent party as provided in Rule 11.
    20. Hearings: Nature, Examination of Witnesses--(a) Nature of 
Hearings--Hearings shall be as informal as may be reasonable and 
appropriate under the circumstances. Appellant and the Government may 
offer such evidence as they deem appropriate and as would be admissible 
under the Federal Rules of Evidence or in the sound discretion of the 
presiding administrative judge or examiner. Stipulations of fact agreed 
upon by the parties may be regarded and used as evidence at the hearing. 
The parties may stipulate the testimony that would be given by a witness 
if the witness were present. The Board may require evidence in addition 
to that offered by the parties.
    (b) Examination of Witnesses--Witnesses before the Board will be 
examined orally under oath or affirmation, unless the presiding 
administrative judge or examiner shall otherwise order. If the testimony 
of a witness is not given under oath, the Board may advise the witness 
that his statements may be subject to the provisions of title 18, United 
States Code, sections 287 and 1001, and any other provision of law 
imposing penalties for knowingly making false representations in 
connection with claims against the United States or in any matter within 
the jurisdiction of any department or agency thereof.
    21. Subpoenas--(a) General--Upon written request of either party 
filed with the recorder, or on his own initiative, the administrative 
judge to whom a case is assigned or who is otherwise designated by the 
chairman may issue a subpoena requiring:
    (i) Testimony at a deposition--the deposing of a witness in the city 
or county where he resides or is employed or transacts his business in 
person, or at another location convenient for him that is specifically 
determined by the Board;
    (ii) Testimony at a hearing--the attendance of a witness for the 
purpose of taking testimony at a hearing; and
    (iii) Production of books and papers--in addition to (i) or (ii), 
the production by the witness at the deposition or hearing of books and 
papers designated in the subpoena.
    (b) Voluntary Cooperation--Each party is expected (i) to cooperate 
and make available witnesses and evidence under its control as requested 
by the other party, without

[[Page 496]]

issuance of a subpoena, and (ii) to secure voluntary attendance of 
desired third-party witnesses and production of desired third-party 
books, papers, documents, or tangible things whenever possible.
    (c) Requests for Subpoenas--(1) A request for subpoena shall 
normally be filed at least:
    (i) 15 days before a scheduled deposition where the attendance of a 
witness at a deposition is sought; or
    (ii) 30 days before a scheduled hearing where the attendance of a 
witness at a hearing is sought.
    In its discretion the Board may honor requests for subpoenas not 
made within these time limitations.
    (2) A request for a subpoena shall state the reasonable scope and 
general relevance to the case of the testimony and of any books and 
papers sought.
    (d) Requests to Quash or Modify--Upon written request by the person 
subpoenaed or by a party, made within 10 days after service but in any 
event not later than the time specified in the subpoena for compliance, 
the Board may (i) quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable and 
oppressive or for other good cause shown, or (ii) require the person in 
whose behalf the subpoena was issued to advance the reasonable cost of 
producing subpoenaed books and papers. Where circumstances require, the 
Board may act upon such a request at any time after a copy has been 
served upon the opposing party.
    (e) Form; Issuance--(1) Every subpoena shall state the name of the 
Board and the title of the appeal, and shall command each person to whom 
it is directed to attend and give testimony, and if appropriate, to 
produce specified books and papers at a time and place therein 
specified. In issuing a subpoena to a requesting party, the 
administrative judge shall sign the subpoena and may, in his discretion, 
enter the name of the witness and otherwise leave it blank. The party to 
whom the subpoena is issued shall complete the subpoena before service.
    (2) Where the witness is located in a foreign country, a letter 
rogatory or subpoena may be issued and served under the circumstances 
and in the manner provided in 28 U.S.C. 1781-1784.
    (f) Service--(1) The party requesting issuance of a subpoena shall 
arrange for service.
    (2) A subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a deposition 
or hearing may be served at any place. A subpoena may be served by a 
United States marshal or deputy marshal, or by any other person who is 
not a party and not less than 18 years of age. Service of a subpoena 
upon a person named therein shall be made by personally delivering a 
copy to that person and tendering the fees for one day's attendance and 
the mileage provided by 28 U.S.C. 1821 or other applicable law; however, 
where the subpoena is issued on behalf of the Government, money payments 
need not be tendered in advance of attendance.
    (3) The party at whose instance a subpoena is issued shall be 
responsible for the payment of fees and mileage of the witness and of 
the officer who serves the subpoena. The failure to make payment of such 
charges on demand may be deemed by the Board as a sufficient ground for 
striking the testimony of the witness and the books or papers the 
witness has produced.
    (g) Contumacy or Refusal to Obey a Subpoena--In case of contumacy or 
refusal to obey a subpoena by a person who resides, is found, or 
transacts business within the jurisdiction of a United States District 
Court, the Board will apply to the Court through the Attorney General of 
the United States for an order requiring the person to appear before the 
Board or a member thereof to give testimony or produce evidence or both. 
Any failure of any such person to obey the order of the Court may be 
punished by the Court as a contempt thereof.
    22. Copies of Papers. When books, records, papers, or documents have 
been received in evidence, a true copy thereof or of such part thereof 
as may be material or relevant may be substituted therefor, during the 
hearing or at the conclusion thereof.
    23. Post-Hearing Briefs. Post-hearing briefs may be submitted upon 
such terms as may be directed by the presiding administrative judge or 
examiner at the conclusion of the hearing.
    24. Transcript of Proceedings. Testimony and argument at hearings 
shall be reported verbatim, unless the Board otherwise orders. Waiver of 
transcript may be especially suitable for hearings under Rule 12.2. 
Transcripts of the proceedings shall be supplied to the parties at such 
rates as may be established by contract between the Board and the 
reporter, provided that ordinary copy of transcript shall be supplied to 
the appellant at an amount no greater than the cost of duplication.
    25. Withdrawal of Exhibits. After a decision has become final the 
Board may, upon request and after notice to the other party, in its 
discretion permit the withdrawal of original exhibits, or any part 
thereof, by the party entitled thereto. The substitition of true copies 
of exhibits or any part thereof may be required by the Board in its 
discretion as a condition of granting permission for such withdrawal.

                             Representation

    26. The Appellant. An individual appellant may appear before the 
Board in person, a corporation by one of its officers; and a partnership 
or joint venture by one of its members; or any of these by an attorney 
at law duly licensed in any state, commonwealth, territory, the District

foreign country. An attorney representing an appellant shall file a 
written notice of appearance with the Board.
    27. The Government. Government counsel may, in accordance with their 
authority, represent the interest of the Government before the Board. 
They shall file notices of appearance with the Board, and notice thereof 
will be given appellant or appellant's attorney in the form specified by 
the Board from time to time.

                                Decisions

    28. Decisions. (a) Decisions of the Board will be made in writing 
and authenticated copies of the decision will be forwarded 
simultaneously to both parties. The rules of the Board and all final 
orders and decisions (except those required for good cause to be held 
confidential and not cited as precedents) shall be open for public 
inspection at the offices of the Board. Decisions of the Board will be 
made solely upon the record, as described in Rule 13.
    (b) Any monetary award to a contractor by the Board shall be 
promptly paid in accordance with the procedures provided by section 1302 
of the Act of July 27, 1956 (70 Stat. 694, as amended; 31 U.S.C. 724a). 
To assure prompt payment the Recorder will forward a waiver form to each 
party with the decision. If the parties do not contemplate an appeal or 
motion for reconsideration, they will execute waivers which so state, 
and return them to the Recorder. The Recorder will forward the waivers 
and a certified copy of the award decision to the General Accounting 
Office for certification for payment.

                       Motion for Reconsideration

    29. Motion for Reconsideration. A motion for reconsideration may be 
filed by either party. It shall set forth specifically the grounds 
relied upon to sustain the motion. The motion shall be filed within 30 
days from the date of the receipt of a copy of the decision of the Board 
by the party filing the motion.

              Suspensions, Dismissals and Defaults: Remands

    30. Suspensions; Dismissal Without Prejudice. The Board may suspend 
the proceedings by agreement of counsel for settlement discussions, or 
for good cause shown. In certain cases, appeals docketed before the 
Board are required to be placed in a suspense status and the Board is 
unable to proceed with disposition thereof for reasons not within the 
control of the Board. Where the suspension has continued, or may 
continue, for an inordinate length of time, the Board may, in its 
discretion, dismiss such appeals from its docket without prejudice to 
their restoration when the cause of suspension has been removed. Unless 
either party or the Board acts within three years to reinstate any 
appeal dismissed without prejudice, the dismissal shall be deemed with 
prejudice.
    31. Dismissal or Default for Failure to Prosecute or Defend. 
Whenever a record discloses the failure of either party to file 
documents required by these rules, respond to notices or correspondence 
from the Board, comply with orders of the Board, or otherwise indicates 
an intention not to continue the prosecution or defense of an appeal, 
the Board may, in the case of a default by the appellant, issue an order 
to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed or, in the case of 
a default by the Government, issue an order to show cause why the Board 
should not act thereon pursuant to Rule 35. If good cause is not shown, 
the Board may take appropriate action.
    32. Remand from Court. Whenever any court remands a case to the 
Board for further proceedings, each of the parties shall, within 20 days 
of such remand, submit a report to the Board recommending procedures to 
be followed so as to comply with the court's order. The Board shall 
consider the reports and enter special orders governing the handling of 
the remanded case. To the extent the court's directive and time 
limitations permit, such orders shall conform to these rules.

                    Time, Computation and Extensions

    33. Time, Computation and Extensions. (a) Where possible, procedural 
actions should be taken in less time than the maximum time allowed. 
Where appropriate and justified, however, extensions of time will be 
granted. All requests for extensions of time shall be in writing.
    (b) In computing any period of time, the day of the event from which 
the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included, but 
the last day of the period shall be included unless it is a Saturday, 
Sunday, or a legal holiday, in which event the period shall run to the 
end of the next business day.

                         Ex Parte Communications

    34. Ex parte Communications. No member of the Board or the Board's 
staff shall entertain, nor shall any person directly or indirectly 
involved in an appeal, submit to the Board or the Board's staff, off the 
record, any evidence, explanation, analysis, or advice, whether written 
or oral, regarding any matter at issue in an appeal. This provision does 
not apply to consultation among Board members or to ex parte 
communications concerning the Board's administrative functions or 
procedures.

                                Sanctions

    35. Sanctions. If any party fails or refuses to obey an order issued 
by the Board, the Board may then make such order as it considers

[[Page 498]]

necessary to the just and expeditious conduct of the appeal.

                    Effective Date and Applicability

    36. Effective Date. These rules shall apply (i) mandatorily, to all 
appeals relating to contracts entered into on or after 1 March 1979, and 
(ii) at the contractor's election, to appeals relating to earlier 
contracts, with respect to claims pending before the contracting officer 
on 1 March 1979 or initiated thereafter.
    Pursuant to the Charter of the Armed Services Board of Contract 
Appeals, the attached rules are hereby approved for use and application 
to appeals to the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals under the 
Contract Disputes Act of 1978.

                           Part 1_Introduction

F-101 General.
    This appendix contains procedures and instructions for the use, 
preparation, and distribution of the material inspection and receiving 
report (MIRR) (DD Form 250 series) and commercial shipping/packing lists 
used to document Government contract quality assurance.
F-102 Applicability.
    (a) The provisions of this appendix apply to supplies or services 
acquired by DoD when the clause at 252.246-7000, Material Inspection and 
Receiving Report, is included in the contract. If the contract contains 
the clause at FAR 52.213-1, Fast Payment Procedure, the contractor may 
elect not to prepare a DD Form 250.
    (b) When DoD provides quality assurance or acceptance services for 
non-DoD activities, prepare a MIRR using the instructions in this 
appendix, unless otherwise specified in the contract.
F-103 Use.
    (a) The DD Form 250 is a multipurpose report used--(1) To provide 
evidence of Government contract quality assurance at origin or 
destination;
    (2) To provide evidence of acceptance at origin or destination;
    (3) For packing lists;
    (4) For receiving;
    (5) For shipping;
    (6) As a contractor invoice; and
    (7) As commercial invoice support.
    (b) Do not use the DD Form 250 for shipments--(1) By subcontractors, 
unless the subcontractor is shipping directly to the Government; or
    (2) Of contract inventory.
    (c) The contractor prepares the MIRR, except for entries that an 
authorized Government representative is required to complete. The 
contractor shall furnish sufficient copies of the completed form, as 
directed by the Government representative.
    (d) Use the DD Form 250-1--(1) For bulk movements of petroleum 
products by tanker or barge to cover--
    (i) Origin or destination acceptance of cargo; or
    (ii) Shipment or receipt of Government owned products.
    (2) To send quality data to the point of acceptance in the case of 
origin inspection on

[[Page 499]]

FOB destination deliveries or preinspection at product source. Annotate 
the forms with the words ``INSPECTED FOR QUALITY ONLY.''
F-104 Application.
    (a) DD Form 250. (1) Use the DD Form 250 for delivery of contract 
line, subline, exhibit line, or exhibit subline items. Do not use the DD 
Form 250 for those exhibit line or exhibit subline items on a DD Form 
1423, Contract Data Requirements List, that indicate no DD Form 250 is 
required.
    (2) If the shipped to, marked for, shipped from, mode of shipment, 
contract quality assurance and acceptance data are the same for more 
than one shipment made on the same day under the same contract, 
contractors may prepare one MIRR to cover all such shipments.
    (3) If the volume of the shipment precludes the use of a single car, 
truck, or other vehicle, prepare a separate MIRR for the contents of 
each vehicle.
    (4) When a shipment is consigned to an Air Force activity and the 
shipment includes items of more than one federal supply class (FSC) or 
material management code (MMC), prepare a separate DD Form 250 for items 
of each of the FSCs or MMCs in the shipment. However, the cognizant 
Government representative may authorize a single DD Form 250, listing 
each of the FSCs or MMCs included in the shipment on a separate 
continuation sheet. The MMC appears as a suffix to the national stock 
number applicable to the item.
    (5) Consolidation of Petroleum Shipments on a Single MIRR--(i) 
Contiguous United States. Contractors may consolidate multiple car or 
truck load shipments of petroleum made on the same day, to the same 
destination, against the same contract line item, on one MIRR. To permit 
verification of motor deliveries, assign each load a load number which 
can be identified to the shipment number in Block 2 of the DD Form 250. 
Include a shipping document (commercial or government) with each 
individual load showing as a minimum--
    (A) The shipper;
    (B) Shipping point;
    (C) Consignee;
    (D) Contract and line item number;
    (E) Product identification;
    (F) Gross gallons (bulk only);
    (G) Loading temperature (bulk only);
    (H) American Petroleum Institute gravity (bulk only);
    (I) Identification of carrier's equipment;
    (J) Serial number of all seals applied; and
    (K) Signature of supplier's representative.
    When acceptance is at destination, the receiving activity retains 
the shipping document(s) to verify the entries on the consignee copy of 
the DD Form 250 forwarded by the contractor (reference F-401, Table 1) 
before signing Block 21b.
    (ii) Overseas. The same criteria as for contiguous United States 
applies, except the consolidation period may be extended, if acceptable 
to the receiving activity, shipping activity, Government finance office, 
and the authorized Government representative having cognizance at the 
contractor's facility. In addition, the contractor may include more than 
one contract line item in each DD Form 250 if the shipped to, marked 
for, shipped from, mode of shipment, contract quality assurance, and 
acceptance data are the same for all line items.
    (6) Consolidation of Coal Shipments on a Single MIRR. Contractors 
may consolidate multiple railcar or truck shipments of coal made on the 
same day, to the same destination, against the same contract line items, 
on one MIRR. To permit verification of truck deliveries, assign each 
load a load number which can be identified to the shipment number in 
Block 2 of the DD Form 250 and the analytical test report. Include a 
commercial shipping document with each individual truck load showing as 
a minimum--
    (i) The shipper;
    (ii) The name or names;
    (iii) Location and shipping point of the mine or mines from which 
the coal originates;
    (iv) The contract number;
    (v) The exact size of the coal shipped; and
    (vi) A certified weighmaster's certification of weight for the 
truckload.
    Include a waybill with each rail shipment showing the identical 
information. To permit verification of rail deliveries, identify each 
railcar number comprising the shipment to the shipment number in Block 2 
of the DD Form 250 and the analytical test report. When acceptance is at 
destination, the receiving activity must retain the shipping document(s) 
to verify the entries on the consignee copy of the DD Form 250.
    (b) DD Form 250-1. (1) Use a separate form for each tanker or barge 
cargo loaded.
    (2) The contractor may report more than one barge in the same tow on 
a single form if on the same contract and consigned to the same 
destination.
    (3) When liftings involve more than one contract, prepare separate 
forms to cover the portion of cargo loaded on each contract.
    (4) Prepare a separate form for each product or grade of product 
loaded.
    (5) Use a separate document for each tanker or barge cargo and each 
grade of product discharged.
    (6) For discharge, the contractor may report more than one barge in 
the same tow on a single form if from the same loading source.

same or varying quantities, and the shipment requires origin acceptance. 
Prepare the MIRR using the procedures in this appendix with the 
following changes--
    (a) Blocks 2, 4, 13, and, if applicable, 14--Enter ``See Attached 
Distribution List.''

code.
    (e) The contractor may omit those distribution list pages of the DD 
Form 250c that are not applicable to the consignee. Provide a complete 
MIRR for all other distribution.
F-305 Correction instructions.
    Make a new revised MIRR or correct the original when, because of 
errors or omissions, it is necessary to correct the MIRR after 
distribution has been made. Use data identical to that of the original 
MIRR. Do not correct MIRRs for Blocks 19 and 20 entries. Make the 
corrections as follows--
    (a) Circle the error and place the corrected information in the same 
block; if space is limited, enter the corrected information in Block 16 
referencing the error page and block. Enter omissions in Block 16

submission of the material inspection and receiving information required 
by this appendix by using the Wide Area WorkFlow electronic form (see 
paragraph (b) of the clause at 252.232-7003) fulfills the requirement 
for an MIRR.
    (b) If the contracting officer authorizes the contractor to submit 
an invoice in paper form, the Government encourages, but does not 
require, the contractor to use the MIRR as an invoice, in lieu of a 
commercial form. If commercial forms are used, identify the related MIRR 
shipment number(s) on the form. If using the MIRR as an invoice, prepare 
the MIRR and forward the required number of copies to the payment office 
as follows:
    (1) Complete Blocks 5, 6, 19, and 20. Block 6 shall contain the 
invoice number and date. Column 20 shall be totaled.
    (2) Mark in letters approximately one inch high, first copy: 
``ORIGINAL INVOICE, for all invoice submissions; and three copies: 
``INVOICE COPY,'' when the payment office requires four copies. 
Questions regarding the appropriate number of copies (i.e., one or four) 
should be directed to the applicable payment office.
    (3) Forward the appropriate number of copies to the payment office 
(Block 12 address), except when acceptance is at destination and a Navy 
finance office will make payment, forward to destination.
    (4) Be sure to separate the copies of the MIRR used as an invoice 
from the copies of the MIRR used as a receiving report.
F-307 Packing list instructions.
    Contractors may use copies of the MIRR as a packing list. The 
packing list copies are in addition to the copies of the MIRR required 
for standard distribution (see F-401). Mark them ``PACKING LIST.''
F-308 Receiving instructions.
    When the MIRR is used for receiving purposes, local directives shall 
prescribe procedures. If CQA and acceptance or acceptance of supplies is 
required upon arrival at destination, see F-301(b)(21)(v) for 
instructions.

in accordance with FAR 9.406-3 or 9.407-3. A copy of the record which 
formed the basis for the decision by the debarring and suspending 
official will be made available to the contractor. If there is a reason 
to withhold from the contractor any portion of the record, the 
contractor will be informed of what is withheld and the reasons for such 
withholding.
H-102 Nature of proceeding.
    There are two distinct proceedings which may be involved in the 
suspension or debarment process. The first is the presentation of 
matters in opposition to the suspension or proposed debarment by the 
contractor.
    The second is fact-finding which occurs only in cases in which the 
contractor's presentation of matters in opposition raises a genuine 
dispute over one or more material facts. In a suspension action based 
upon an indictment or in a proposed debarment action based upon a 
conviction or civil judgment, there will be no fact-filling proceeding 
concerning the matters alleged in the indictment, or the facts 
underlying the convictions or civil judgment. However, to the extent 
that the proposed action stems from the contractor's affiliation with an 
individual or firm indicted or convicted, or the subject of a civil 
judgment, fact-finding is permitted if a genuine dispute of fact is 
raised as to the question of affiliation as defined in FAR 9.403.
H-103 Presentation of matters in opposition.
    (a) In accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) and 9.407-3(c), matters in 
opposition may be presented in person, in writing, or through a 
representative. Matters in opposition may be presented through any 
combination of the foregoing methods, but if a contractor desires to 
present matters in person or through a representative, any written 
material should be delivered at least 5 working days in advance of the 
presentation. Usually, all matters in opposition are presented in a 
single proceeding. A contractor who becomes aware of a pending 
indictment or allegations of wrongdoing that the contractor believes may 
lead to suspension or debarment action may contact the debarring and 
suspending official or designee to provide information as to the 
contractor's present responsibility.
    (b) An in-person presentation is an informal meeting, nonadversarial 
in nature. The debarring and suspending official and/or other agency 
representatives may ask questions of the contractor or its 
representative making the presentation. The contractor may select the 
individuals who will attend the meeting on the contractor's behalf; 
individual respondents or principals of a business firm respondent may 
attend and speak for themselves.
    (c) In accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) and 9.407-3(c), the contractor 
may submit matters in opposition within 30 days from receipt of the 
notice of suspension or proposed debarment.
    (d) The opportunity to present matters in opposition to debarment 
includes the opportunity to present matters concerning the duration of 
the debarment.
H-104 Fact-finding.
    (a) The debarring and suspending official will determine whether the 
contractor's presentation has raised a genuine dispute of material 
fact(s). If the debarring and suspending official has decided against 
debarment or continued suspension, or the provisions of FAR 9.4 preclude 
fact-finding, no fact-finding will be conducted. If the debarring and 
suspending official has determined a genuine dispute of material fact(s) 
exists, a designated fact-finder will conduct the fact-finding 
proceeding. The proceeding before the fact-finder will be limited to a 
finding of the facts in dispute as determined by the debarring and 
suspending official.
    (b) The designated fact-finder will establish the date for a fact-
finding proceeding, normally to be held within 45 working days of the 
contractor's presentation of matters in opposition. An official record 
will be made of the fact-finding proceeding.
    (c) The Government's representative and the contractor will have an 
opportunity to present evidence relevant to the facts at issues. The 
contractor may appear in person or through a representative in the fact-
finding proceeding.
    (d) Neither the Federal Rules of Evidence nor the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure govern fact-finding. Hearsay evidence may be presented 
and will be given appropriate weight by the fact-finder.

[[Page 512]]

    (e) Witnesses may testify in person. Witnesses will be reminded of 
the official nature of the proceeding and that any false testimony given 
is subject to criminal prosecution. Witnesses are subject to cross-
examination.
H-105 Timing requirements.
    All timing requirements set forth in these procedures may be 
extended by the debarring and suspending official for good cause.
H-106 Subsequent to fact-finding.
    (a) Written findings of fact will be prepared by the fact-finder as 
mandated by FAR 9.406-3(d)(2)(i) and 9.407-3(d)(2)(i).
    (b) The fact-finder will determine the disputed fact(s) by a 
preponderance of the evidence. A copy of the findings of fact will be 
provided to the debarring and suspending official, the Government's 
representative, and the contractor.
    (c) The debarring and suspending official will determine whether to 
continue the suspension or to debar the contractor based upon the entire 
administrative record, including the findings of fact.
    (d) Prompt written notice of the debarring and suspending official's 
decision will be sent to the contractor and any affiliates involved, in 
compliance with FAR 9.406-3(e) and 9.407-3(d)(4).

Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 (10 U.S.C. 2302 note). 
The purpose of the Program is to--
    (1) Provide incentives to major DoD contractors, performing under at 
least one active approved subcontracting plan negotiated with DoD or 
another Federal agency, to assist prot[eacute]g[eacute] firms in 
enhancing their capabilities to satisfy DoD and other contract and

    (b) Under the Program, eligible companies approved as mentor firms 
will enter into mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] agreements with eligible 
prot[eacute]g[eacute] firms to provide appropriate developmental 
assistance to enhance the capabilities of the prot[eacute]g[eacute] 
firms to perform as subcontractors and suppliers. DoD may provide the 
mentor firm with either cost reimbursement or credit against applicable 
subcontracting goals established under contracts with DoD or other 
Federal agencies.
    (c) DoD will measure the overall success of the Program by the 
extent to which the Program results in--
    (1) An increase in the dollar value of contract and subcontract 
awards to prot[eacute]g[eacute] firms (under DoD contracts, contracts 
awarded by other Federal agencies, and commercial contracts) from the 
date of their entry into the Program until 2 years after the conclusion 
of the agreement;
    (2) An increase in the number and dollar value of subcontracts 
awarded to a prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm (or former prot[eacute]g[eacute] 
firm) by its mentor firm (or former mentor firm);
    (3) An increase in the employment level of prot[eacute]g[eacute] 
firms from the date of entry into the Program until 2 years after the 
completion of the agreement.
    (d) This policy sets forth the procedures for participation in the 
Program applicable to companies that are interested in receiving--

I-106 Development of mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] agreements.
    (a) Prospective mentors and their prot[eacute]g[eacute]s may choose 
to execute letters of intent prior to negotiation of mentor-
prot[eacute]g[eacute] agreements.
    (b) The agreements should be structured after completion of a 
preliminary assessment of the developmental needs of the 
prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm and mutual agreement regarding the 
developmental assistance to be provided to address those needs and 
enhance the prot[eacute]g[eacute]'s ability to perform successfully 
under contracts or subcontracts.
    (c) A mentor firm may not require a prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm to 
enter into a mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] agreement as a condition for 
award of a contract by the mentor firm, including a subcontract under a 
DoD contract awarded to the mentor firm.
    (d) The mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] agreement may provide for the 
mentor firm to furnish any or all of the following types of 
developmental assistance:
    (1) Assistance by mentor firm personnel in--

[[Page 515]]

    (i) General business management, including organizational 
management, financial management, and personnel management, marketing, 
business development, and overall business planning;
    (ii) Engineering and technical matters such as production inventory 
control and quality assurance; and
    (iii) Any other assistance designed to develop the capabilities of 
the prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm under the developmental program.
    (2) Award of subcontracts under DoD contracts or other contracts on 
a noncompetitive basis.
    (3) Payment of progress payments for the performance of subcontracts 
by a prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm in amounts as provided for in the 
subcontract; but in no event may any such progress payment exceed 100 
percent of the costs incurred by the prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm for the 
performance of the subcontract. Provision of progress payments by a 
mentor firm to a prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm at a rate other than the 
customary rate for the firm must be implemented in accordance with FAR 
32.504(c).
    (4) Advance payments under such subcontracts. The mentor firm must 
administer advance payments in accordance with FAR Subpart 32.4.
    (5) Loans.
    (6) Investment(s) in the prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm in exchange for 
an ownership interest in the prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm, not to exceed 
10 percent of the total ownership interest. Investments may include, but 
are not limited to, cash, stock, and contributions in kind.
    (7) Assistance that the mentor firm obtains for the 
prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm from one or more of the following:
    (i) Small Business Development Centers established pursuant to 
Section 21 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 648).
    (ii) Entities providing procurement technical assistance pursuant to 
10 U.S.C. Chapter 142 (Procurement Technical Assistance Centers).
    (iii) Historically Black colleges and universities.

    (e) Pursuant to FAR 31.109, approved mentor firms seeking either 
reimbursement or credit are strongly encouraged to enter into an advance 
agreement with the contracting officer responsible for determining final 
indirect cost rates under FAR 42.705. The purpose of the advance 
agreement is to establish the accounting treatment of the costs of the 
developmental assistance pursuant to the mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] 
agreement prior to the incurring of any costs by the mentor firm. An 
advance agreement is an attempt by both the Government and the mentor 
firm to avoid possible subsequent dispute based on questions related to 
reasonableness, allocability, or allowability of the costs of 
developmental assistance under the Program. Absent an advance agreement, 
mentor firms are advised to establish the accounting treatment of such 
costs and to address the need for any changes to their cost accounting 
practices that may result from the implementation of a mentor-
prot[eacute]g[eacute] agreement, prior to incurring any costs, and 
irrespective of whether costs will be reimbursed or credited.
    (f) Developmental assistance provided under an approved mentor-
prot[eacute]g[eacute] agreement is distinct from, and must not 
duplicate, any effort that is the normal and expected product of the 
award and administration of the mentor firm's subcontracts. Costs 
associated with the latter must be accumulated and charged in accordance 
with the contractor's approved accounting practices; they are not 
considered developmental assistance costs eligible for either credit or 
reimbursement under the Program.
I-107 Elements of a mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] agreement.
    Each mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] agreement will contain the 
following elements:
    (a) The name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number of the 
mentor and prot[eacute]g[eacute] points of contact;
    (b) The NAICS code(s) that represent the contemplated supplies or 
services to be provided by the protege firm to the mentor firm and a

business, or a service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern, 
does not exceed the size standard for the appropriate NAICS code;

commitment to comply with the requirements for reporting and for review 
of the agreement during the duration of the agreement and for 2 years 
thereafter;
    (j) A program participation term for the agreement that does not 
exceed 3 years. Requests for an extension of the agreement for a period 
not to exceed an additional 2 years are subject to the approval of the 
cognizant Component Director, SBP. The justification must detail the 
unusual circumstances that warrant a term in excess of 3 years;
    (k) Procedures for the mentor firm to notify the 
prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm in writing at least 30 days in advance of the

participant in the Program as a mentor firm. Otherwise, a mentor firm 
must terminate a mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] agreement for cause;

prot[eacute]g[eacute] agreement for cause which provide that--

    The following program provisions apply to all reimbursable mentor-
prot[eacute]g[eacute] agreements:
    (a) Assistance provided in the form of progress payments to a 
prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm in excess of the customary progress payment 
rate for the firm will be reimbursed only if implemented in accordance 
with FAR 32.504(c).
    (b) Assistance provided in the form of advance payments will be 
reimbursed only if the payments have been provided to a 
prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm under subcontract terms and conditions 
similar to those in the clause at FAR 52.232-12, Advance Payments. 
Reimbursement of any advance payments will be made pursuant to the 
inclusion of the clause at DFARS 252.232-7005, Reimbursement of 
Subcontractor Advance Payments--DoD Pilot Mentor-Prot[eacute]g[eacute] 
Program, in appropriate contracts. In requesting reimbursement, the 
mentor firm agrees that the risk of any financial loss due to the 
failure or inability of a prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm to repay any 
unliquidated advance payments will be the sole responsibility of the 
mentor firm.
    (c) The primary forms of developmental assistance authorized for 
reimbursement under

[[Page 517]]

the Program are identified in I-106(d). On a case-by-case basis, 
Component Directors, SBP, at their discretion, may approve additional 
incidental expenses for reimbursement, provided these expenses do not 
exceed 10 percent of the total estimated cost of the agreement.
    (d) The total amount reimbursed to a mentor firm for costs of 
assistance furnished to a prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm in a fiscal year 
may not exceed $1,000,000 unless the cognizant Component Director, SBP, 
determines in writing that unusual circumstances justify reimbursement 
at a higher amount. Request for authority to reimburse in excess of 
$1,000,000 must detail the unusual circumstances and must be endorsed 
and submitted by the program manager to the cognizant Component 
Director, SBP.
    (e) Developmental assistance costs that are incurred pursuant to an 
approved reimbursable mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] agreement, and have 
been charged to, but not reimbursed through, a separate contract, or 
through a separately priced contract line item added to a DoD contract, 
will not be otherwise reimbursed, as either a direct or indirect cost, 
under any other DoD contract, irrespective of whether the costs have 
been recognized for credit against applicable subcontracting goals.
I-110 Credit agreements.
I-110.1 Program provisions applicable to credit agreements.
    (a) Developmental assistance costs incurred by a mentor firm for 
providing assistance to a prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm pursuant to an 
approved credit mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] agreement may be credited 
as if the costs were incurred under a subcontract award to that 
prot[eacute]g[eacute], for the purpose of determining the performance of 
the mentor firm in attaining an applicable subcontracting goal 
established under any contract containing a subcontracting plan pursuant 
to the clause at FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, or 
the provisions of the DoD Comprehensive Subcontracting Plan Test 
Program. Unreimbursed developmental assistance costs incurred for a 
prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm that is an eligible entity employing the 
severely disabled may be credited toward the mentor firm's small 
disadvantaged business subcontracting goal, even if the 
prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm is not a small disadvantaged business 
concern.
    (b) Costs that have been reimbursed through inclusion in indirect 
expense pools may also be credited as subcontract awards for determining 
the performance of the mentor firm in attaining an applicable 
subcontracting goal established under any contract containing a 
subcontracting plan. However, costs that have not been reimbursed 
because they are not reasonable, allocable, or allowable will not be 
recognized for crediting purposes.
    (c) Other costs that are not eligible for reimbursement pursuant to 
I-106(d) may be recognized for credit only if requested, identified, and 
incorporated in an approved mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] agreement.
    (d) The amount of credit a mentor firm may receive for any such 
unreimbursed developmental assistance costs must be equal to--
    (1) Four times the total amount of such costs attributable to 
assistance provided by small business development centers, historically 
Black colleges and universities, minority institutions, and procurement 
technical assistance centers.
    (2) Three times the total amount of such costs attributable to 
assistance furnished by the mentor's employees.
    (3) Two times the total amount of other such costs incurred by the 
mentor in carrying out the developmental assistance program.
I-110.2 Credit adjustments.
    (a) Adjustments may be made to the amount of credit claimed if the 
Director, SBP, OUSD(AT&L), determines that--
    (1) A mentor firm's performance in the attainment of its 
subcontracting goals through actual subcontract awards declined from the 
prior fiscal year without justifiable cause; and
    (2) Imposition of such a limitation on credit appears to be 
warranted to prevent abuse of this incentive for the mentor firm's 
participation in the Program.
    (b) The mentor firm must be afforded the opportunity to explain the 
decline in small business subcontract awards before imposition of any 
such limitation on credit. In making the final decision to impose a 
limitation on credit, the Director, SBP, OUSD(AT&L), must consider--
    (1) The mentor firm's overall small business participation rates (in 
terms of percentages of subcontract awards and dollars awarded) as 
compared to the participation rates existing during the 2 fiscal years 
prior to the firm's admission to the Program;
    (2) The mentor firm's aggregate prime contract awards during the 
prior 2 fiscal years and the total amount of subcontract awards under 
such contracts; and
    (3) Such other information the mentor firm may wish to submit.
    (c) The decision of the Director, SBP, OUSD(AT&L), regarding the 
imposition of a limitation on credit will be final.
I-111 Agreement terminations.
    (a) Mentors and/or prot[eacute]g[eacute]s must send a copy of any 
termination notices to the cognizant Component Director, SBP, that 
approved the agreement, and the DCMA administrative contracting officer 
responsible for conducting the annual review pursuant to I-113.

[[Page 518]]

    (b) For reimbursable agreements, mentors must also send copies of 
any termination to the program manager and to the contracting officer.
    (c) Termination of a mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] agreement will not 
impair the obligations of the mentor firm to perform pursuant to its 
contractual obligations under Government contracts and subcontracts.
    (d) Termination of all or part of the mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] 
agreement will not impair the obligations of the prot[eacute]g[eacute] 
firm to perform pursuant to its contractual obligations under any 
contract awarded to the prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm by the mentor firm.
    (e) Mentors and prot[eacute]g[eacute]s will follow provisions of the 
mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] agreement developed in compliance with I-
107(k) through (m).
I-112 Reporting requirements.
I-112.1 Reporting requirements applicable to SF294/SF295 reports.
    (a) Amounts credited toward applicable subcontracting goal(s) for 
unreimbursed costs under the Program must be separately identified on 
the appropriate SF294/SF295 reports from the amounts credited toward the 
goal(s) resulting from the award of actual subcontracts to 
prot[eacute]g[eacute] firms. The combination of the two must equal the 
mentor firm's overall accomplishment toward the applicable goal(s).
    (b) A mentor firm may receive credit toward the attainment of an SDB 
subcontracting goal for each subcontract awarded by the mentor firm to 
an entity that qualifies as a prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm pursuant to I-
101.3 or I-101.5.
    (c) For purposes of calculating any incentives to be paid to a 
mentor firm for exceeding an SDB subcontracting goal pursuant to the 
clause at FAR 52.219-26, Small Disadvantaged Business Participation 
Program--Incentive Subcontracting, incentives will be paid only if an 
SDB subcontracting goal has been exceeded as a result of actual 
subcontract awards to SDBs (i.e., excluding credit).
I-112.2 Program specific reporting requirements.
    (a) Mentors must report on the progress made under active mentor-
prot[eacute]g[eacute] agreements semiannually for the periods ending 
March 31st and September 30th throughout the Program participation term 
of the agreement. The September 30th report must address the entire 
fiscal year.
    (b) Reports are due 30 days after the close of each reporting 
period.
    (c) Each report must include the following data on performance under 
the mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] agreement:
    (1) Dollars obligated (for reimbursable agreements).
    (2) Expenditures.
    (3) Dollars credited, if any, toward applicable subcontracting goals 
as a result of developmental assistance provided to the 
prot[eacute]g[eacute] and a copy of the SF294 and/or SF295 for each 
contract where developmental assistance was credited.
    (4) The number and dollar value of subcontracts awarded to the 
prot[eacute]g[eacute] firm.
    (5) Description of developmental assistance provided, including 
milestones achieved.
    (6) Impact of the agreement in terms of capabilities enhanced, 
certifications received, and/or technology transferred.
    (d) A recommended reporting format and guidance for its submission 
are available at: http://www.acq.osd.mil/sadbu/mentor--protege.
    (e) The prot[eacute]g[eacute] must provide data, annually by October 
31st, on the progress made during the prior fiscal year by the 
prot[eacute]g[eacute] in employment, revenues, and participation in DoD 
contracts during--
    (1) Each fiscal year of the Program participation term; and
    (2) Each of the 2 fiscal years following the expiration of the 
Program participation term.
    (f) The prot[eacute]g[eacute] report required by paragraph (e) of 
this section may be provided as part of the mentor report for the period 
ending September 30th required by paragraph (a) of this section.
    (g) Progress reports must be submitted--
    (1) For credit agreements, to the cognizant Component Director, SBP, 
that approved the agreement, and the mentor's cognizant DCMA 
administrative contracting officer; and
    (2) For reimbursable agreements, to the cognizant Component 
Director, SBP, the contracting officer, the DCMA administrative 
contracting officer, and the program manager.
I-113 Performance reviews.
    (a) DCMA will conduct annual performance reviews of the progress and 
accomplishments realized under approved mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] 
agreements. These reviews must verify data provided on the semiannual 
reports and must provide information as to--
    (1) Whether all costs reimbursed to the mentor firm under the 
agreement were reasonably incurred to furnish assistance to the 
prot[eacute]g[eacute] in accordance with the mentor-
prot[eacute]g[eacute] agreement and applicable regulations and 
procedures; and
    (2) Whether the mentor and prot[eacute]g[eacute] accurately reported 
progress made by the prot[eacute]g[eacute] in employment, revenues, and 
participation in DoD contracts during the Program participation term and 
for 2 fiscal years following the expiration of the Program participation 
term.
