                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 1997), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

INQUIRIES

volume, contact the issuing agency. The issuing agency's name appears at

                               THIS TITLE

    Title 48--Federal Acquisition Regulations System is composed of 
eight volumes. The chapters in these volumes are arranged as follows: 
Chapter 1 (parts 1 to 51), chapter 1 (parts 52 to 99), chapter 2 (parts 
201 to 299), chapters 3 to 6, chapters 7 to 14, chapters 15 to 28 and 
chapter 29 to end. The contents of these volumes represent all current 
regulations codified under this title of the CFR as of October 1, 1997.

    The Federal acquisition regulations in chapter 1 are those 
government-wide acquisition regulations jointly issued by the General 
Services Administration, the Department of Defense, and the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration. Chapters 2 through 99 are 
acquisition regulations issued by individual government agencies. Parts 
1 to 69 in each of chapters 2 through 99 are reserved for agency 
regulations implementing the Federal acquisition regulations in chapter 
1 and are numerically keyed to them. Parts 70 to 99 in chapters 2 
through 99 contain agency regulations supplementing the Federal 
acquisition regulations.

    The OMB control numbers for the Federal Acquisition Regulations 
System appear in section 1.106 of chapter 1. For the convenience of the 
user section 1.106 is reprinted in the Finding Aids section of the 
second volume containing chapter 1 (parts 52 to 99).

    The first volume, containing chapter 1 (parts 1 to 51), includes an 
index to the Federal acquisition regulations.

    For this volume, Ann Elise Maso was Chief Editor. The Code of 
Federal Regulations publication program is under the direction of 
Frances D. McDonald, assisted by Alomha S. Morris.

201.201-1  The two councils.

    (c) The composition and operation of the DAR Council is prescribed 
in DoD Directive 5000.35, Defense Acquisition Regulatory System.
    (d)(i) Departments and agencies process proposed revisions of FAR or 
DFARS through channels to the Director of the DAR Council. Process the 
proposed revision as a memorandum in the following format, addressed to 
the Director, DAR Council, OUSD(A&T), 3062 Defense Pentagon, Washington, 
DC 20301-3062; datafax (703) 602-0350:

    I. Problem: Succinctly state the problem created by current FAR and/
or DFARS coverage and describe the factual and/or legal reasons 
necessitating regulatory change.
    II. Recommendation: Identify the FAR and/or DFARS citations to be 
revised. Attach as TAB A a copy of the text of the existing coverage, 
conformed to include the proposed additions and deletions. Indicate 
deleted coverage with dashed lines through the current words being 
deleted and insert proposed language in brackets at the appropriate 
locations within the existing coverage. If the proposed deleted portion 
is extensive, it may be outlined by lines forming a box with diagonal 
lines drawn connecting the corners.
    III. Discussion: Include a complete, convincing explanation of why 
the change is necessary and how the recommended revision will solve the 
problem. Address advantages and disadvantages of the proposed revision, 
as well as any cost or administrative impact on Government activities 
and contractors. Identify any potential impact of the change on 
automated systems, e.g., automated financial and procurement systems. 
Provide any other background information that would be helpful in 
explaining the issue.

[[Page 8]]

    IV. Collaterals: Address the need for public comment (FAR 1.301(b) 
and subpart 1.5), the Paperwork Reduction Act, and the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (FAR 1.301(c)).
    V. Deviations: If a recommended revision of DFARS is a FAR 
deviation, identify the deviation and include under separate TAB a 
justification for the deviation, which addresses the requirements of 
201.402(3). The justification should be in the form of a memorandum for 
the USD(A&T)DP.

    (ii) The public may offer proposed revisions of FAR or DFARS by 
submission of a memorandum, in the format (including all of the 
information) prescribed in paragraph (d)(i) of this subsection, to the 
Director of the DAR Council.
[56 FR 36284, July 31, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 61591, Nov. 30, 1995;

<R04>
              Subpart 201.3--Agency Acquisition Regulations


<R05>
201.301  Policy.

    (a) DoD implementation and supplementation of the FAR is issued in 
the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) under 
authorization and subject to the authority, direction, and control of 
the Secretary of Defense.
    (b) When Federal Register publication is required for any policy, 
procedure, clause, or form, the department or agency requesting USD(A&T) 
approval for use of the policy, procedure, clause, or form (see 
201.304(1)) must include an analysis of the public comments in the 
request for approval.
[56 FR 36284, July 31, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 61591, Nov. 30, 1995]


<R05>
201.303  Publication and codification.

    (a)(i) The DFARS is codified under chapter 2 in title 48, Code of 
Federal Regulations.
    (ii) To the extent possible, all DFARS text (whether implemental or 
supplemental) is numbered as if it were implemental. Supplemental 
numbering is used only when the text cannot be integrated intelligibly 
with its FAR counterpart.
    (A) Implemental numbering is the same as its FAR counterpart, except 
when the text exceeds one paragraph, the subdivisions are numbered by 
skipping a unit in the FAR 1.104-2(b)(2) prescribed numbering sequence. 
For example, three paragraphs implementing FAR 19.501 would be numbered 
219.501 (1), (2), and (3) rather than (a), (b), and (c). Three 
paragraphs implementing FAR 19.501(a) would be numbered 219.501(a) (i), 
(ii), and (iii) rather than (a) (1), (2), and (3). Further subdivision 
of the paragraphs follows the prescribed numbering sequence, e.g., 
219.501(1)(i)(A)(1)(i).
    (B) Supplemental numbering is the same as its FAR counterpart, with 
the addition of a number of 70 and up or (S-70) and up. Parts, subparts, 
sections, or subsections are supplemented by the addition of a number of 
70 and up. Lower divisions are supplemented by the addition of a number 
of (S-70) and up. When text exceeds one paragraph, the subdivisions are 
numbered using the FAR 1.104-2(b)(2) prescribed sequence, without 
skipping a unit. For example, DFARS text supplementing FAR 19.501 would 
be numbered 219.501-70. Its subdivisions would be numbered 219.501-70 
(a), (b), and (c).
    (C) Subdivision numbering below the 4th level does not repeat the 
numbering sequence. It uses italicized Arabic numbers and then 
italicized lower case Roman numerals.
    (D) An example of DFARS numbering is in Table 1-1, DFARS Numbering.
    (iii) Department/agency and component supplements must parallel the 
FAR and DFARS numbering, except department/agency supplemental numbering 
uses subsection numbering of 90 and up, instead of 70 and up.

    (a) A single report is one DD Form 350 report per contracting 
action.
    (b) A consolidated report is one DD Form 350 report which combines 
several contracting actions.
    (1) Prepare consolidated reports for--
    (i) Air Mobility Command awards for international airlift services. 
The Command reports these at the end of each operating month with one DD 
Form 350 for each airlift contract.
    (ii) Military Sealift Command awards of indefinite delivery 
contracts for ocean transportation. The Command reports at the beginning 
of each fiscal year the estimated value of the orders for that fiscal 
year on one DD Form 350.
    (iii) Defense Fuel Supply Center or Defense Supply Center, Richmond, 
indefinite delivery contracts for petroleum or petroleum supplies. The 
Centers, at the time of award, report the estimated value of the orders 
to be placed against the contract on one DD Form 350.
    (iv) Orders placed by the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) for 
resale

[[Page 22]]

items in excess of $25,000. DeCA consolidates the orders monthly and 
reports the cumulative dollar amounts and actions on one DD Form 350 in 
accordance with departmental/agency procedures. Defense Logistics Agency 
activities submit single rather than consolidated reports.
    (v) Vouchers processed by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Europe 
(USACCE), for the purchase of utilities from municipalities (e.g., gas, 
electricity, water, sewage, steam, snow removal, and garbage 
collection). USACCE consolidates these transactions monthly and reports 
the cumulative dollar amount on one DD Form 350 in accordance with 
departmental/agency procedures.
    (2) Consolidated reports may be prepared in accordance with 
departmental/agency procedures for orders under communications service 
agreements for local dial tone services.
    (c) A multiple report is more than one DD Form 350 per contracting 
action. Prepare multiple reports if--
    (1) The contracting action includes foreign military sales (FMS) 
requirements in addition to non-FMS requirements (Block B9 on the DD 
Form 350). Submit one DD Form 350 report for the FMS requirements and 
another DD Form 350 report for the non-FMS requirements, except if 
either of the portions in $25,000 or less, report the $25,000 or less 
portion on a DD Form 1057 in lieu of a DD Form 350.
    (2) The contracting action includes more than one type of contract 
(Block C5 on the DD Form 350) and the type with the least dollar value 
exceeds $500,000. Prepare a separate DD Form 350 for each contract type.

204.670-7  Report formats.

    Contracting offices submit the signed original DD Forms 350 and 
1057, unless the data collection point approves use of an automated 
facsimile or electronic equivalent containing the information.


<R05>
204.670-8  Security classification.

    Submit DD Forms 350 as unclassified documents. Classified contracts 
are not exempt from reporting solely because the contract is classified. 
Contact the appropriate departmental data collection points for special 
instructions if it is necessary for security reasons to modify coding of 
all or any individual blocks on the DD Form 350. If contact cannot be 
made for security reasons, obtain instructions from the Office of the 
Deputy to the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Support, ATTN: 
Director for Special Programs. Telephone number is (703) 614-0578/9 or 
DSN 224-0578/9.

204.670-9  Reporting of individual contracting actions of $25,000 or less.

    Under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (see 
FAR subpart 19.10), contracting actions of $25,000 or less in four 
designated industry groups must be reported in the same manner as if the 
actions were in excess of $25,000.
    (a) Report contracting actions of $25,000 or less in the designated 
industry groups on both the DD Form 350 and the DD Form 1057.
    (b) The following contracting actions are not subject to the 
additional DD Form 350 reporting, although they must still be reported 
on the DD Form 1057:
    (1) Contracting actions of $500 or less.
    (2) Foreign military sales.
    (3) Orders or modifications under a Federal schedule.
    (4) Actions with a government agency.
    (5) Actions with non-U.S. business firms.
    (6) Actions where the place of performance is other than the United 
States and its outlying areas.

                      Subpart 204.8--Contract Files


<R05>
204.802  Contract files.

    Official contract files shall consist of--
    (1) Only original, authenticated or conformed copies of contractual 
instruments--

[[Page 23]]

    (i) Authenticated copies means copies that are shown to be genuine 
in one of two ways--
    (A) Certification as true copy by signature of an authorized person; 
or
    (B) Official seal.
    (ii) Conformed copies means copies that are complete and accurate, 
including the date signed and the names and titles of the parties who 
signed them.
    (2) Signed or official record copies of correspondence, memoranda, 
and other documents.


<R05>
204.804  Closeout of contract files.

    Normally, the closeout date for contract files is the date in Block 
9d on the DD Form 1594, Contract Completion Statement, or in columns 59-
65 on the PK9. If the contracting office must do a major closeout action 
that will take longer than three months after the date shown in Block 9d 
of the DD Form 1594, or in columns 59-65 of the PK9--
    (1) The closeout date for file purposes will be the date in Block 
10e of the DD Form 1594 or the date of the closeout statement executed 
when the MILSCAP PK9 is received.
    (2) The contracting office shall notify the contract administration 
office of the revised closeout date by either sending a copy of the 
completed DD Form 1594 or by preparing a MILSCAP Format Identifier PKZ, 
Contract Closeout Extension.


<R05>
204.804-1  Closeout by the office administering the contract.

    (1) For contracting offices administering their own contracts, 
locally developed forms or statement of completion may be used instead 
of the DD Form 1594, Contract Completion Statement. Whichever method is 
used, the form shall be retained in the official contract file.
    (2) For contracts valued above the small purchase threshold, prepare 
a DD Form 1597, Contract Closeout Check List, (or agency equivalent) to 
ensure that all required contract actions have been satisfactorily 
accomplished.


<R05>
204.804-2  Closeout of the contracting office files if another office administers the contract.

    (1) When an office, other than the contracting office, administers 
the contract, it shall--
    (i) Provide the contracting office an interim contract completion 
statement when the contract is physically completed and accepted. This 
notice may be in the form of either a DD Form 1594, Contract Completion 
Statement, or a MILSCAP Format Identifier Interim PK9, Contract Physical 
Completion. When the DD Form 1594 is used, the contracting officer--
    (A) Annotates Block 8, Remarks, with--
    (1) ``Notice of Physical Completion;''
    (2) Final acceptance date;
    (3) Signature of a responsible official; and
    (4) Date signed.
    (B) Does not complete Blocks 9 (b), (c), and (d) at this time;
    (ii) Prepare a DD Form 1597, Contract Closeout Check List, if 
necessary, to determine that all the required actions have been done;
    (iii) Initiate DD Form 1593, Contract Administration Completion 
Record, if necessary to obtain statements from other organizational 
elements that they have completed the actions they are responsible for; 
and
    (iv) Upon final payment--
    (A) Process the DD Form 1594 with Blocks 1 through 9 completed or 
the MILSCAP Format Identifier PK9 verifying that all contract 
administration office actions have been done; and
    (B) Send the original of the DD Form 1594 or the MILSCAP Format 
Identifier PK9 to the contracting office, and file a copy in the 
official contract file.
    (2) If the administrative contracting officer (ACO) cannot closeout 
a contract within the specified time period (see FAR 4.804-1), the ACO 
must notify the procuring contracting officer (PCO) within 45 days after 
the expiration of the time period of--
    (i) The reasons for the delay; and
    (ii) New target date for closeout. If MILSCAP procedures apply, the 
ACO

[[Page 24]]

shall use the MILSCAP Format Identifier PKX, Unclosed Contract Status, 
to provide this notice to the PCO.
    (3) If the contract still is not closed out by the new target date, 
the ACO shall again notify the PCO with the reasons for delay and new 
target date. If MILSCAP procedures apply, continue to use the MILSCAP 
Format Identifier PKX, Unclosed Contract Status, to provide this notice.


<R05>
204.805  Disposal of contract files.

    (1) The sources of the period for which official contract files must 
be retained are General Records Schedule 3 (Procurement, Supply, and 
Grant Records) and General Records Schedule 6 (Accountable Officers' 
Accounts Records). Copies of the General Records Schedule may be 
obtained from the National Archives and Records Administration, 
Washington, DC 20408.
    (2) Deviations from the periods cannot be granted by the Defense 
Acquisition Regulatory Council. Forward requests for deviations to both 
the General Accounting Office and the National Archives and Records 
Administration.
    (3) Hold completed contract files in the office responsible for 
maintaining them for a period of 12 months after completion. After the 
initial 12 month period, send the records to the local records holding 
or staging area until they are eligible for destruction. If no space is 
available locally, transfer the files to the General Services 
Administration Federal Records Center that services the area.
    (4) Duplicate or working contract files should contain no originals 
of materials that properly belong in the official files. Destroy working 
files as soon as practicable once they are no longer needed.
    (5) Retain pricing review files, containing documents related to 
reviews of the contractor's price proposals, subject to cost or pricing 
data (see FAR 15.804-2), for six years. If it is impossible to determine 
the final payment date in order to measure the six year period, retain 
the files for nine years.

  Subpart 204.70--Uniform Procurement Instrument Identification Numbers


<R05>
204.7000  Scope.

    This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for assigning 
numbers to all solicitations, contracts, and related instruments. This 
subpart--
    (a) Does not apply to solicitations or contracts issued by the 
Defense Commercial Communications Office of the Defense Information 
Systems Agency; and
    (b) Is optional for solicitations and contracts that will be 
completely administered by the purchasing office or the consignee, 
except that--
    (1) The procurement instrument identification (PII) number, 
including supplemental modification numbers, shall not exceed 19 
characters (excluding hyphens); and
    (2) The number shall begin with the purchasing office identifier and 
the fiscal year in accordance with 204.7003(a) (1) and (2) and appendix 
G.
[56 FR 36289, July 31, 1991, as amended at 56 FR 67212, Dec. 30, 1991]


<R05>
204.7001  Policy.

    (a) Use the uniform PII numbering system prescribed by this subpart 
for the solicitation/contract instruments described in 204.7003 and 
204.7004.
    (b) Retain the basic PII number unchanged for the life of the 
instrument.


<R05>
204.7002  Procedures.

    (a) In assigning PII numbers--
    (1) Use only the alpha-numeric characters, as prescribed in this 
subpart; and
    (2) Do not use the letters ``I'' or ``O,'' except as noted in 
204.7003(a)(1)(i) (J) and (K).

[[Page 25]]

    (b) If department/agency procedures require other identification on 
the solicitation, contract, or other related instrument forms, enter it 
in such a location so as to separate it clearly from the PII number.
    (c) Enter the basic PII number, including Federal supply contract 
numbers and any supplementary numbers, in the spaces provided on the 
solicitation, contract, or related instrument forms. Separate the major 
elements by dashes, e.g., N00023-90-D-0009. If there is no space 
provided on the form, enter the number in the upper right corner of the 
form and identify what it is (e.g., Supplementary Number N00023-90-F-
0120).

<R05>
204.7004  Supplementary PII numbers.

    (a) Uses of the supplementary number. Use supplementary numbers with 
the basic PII number, to identify--
    (1) Amendments to solicitations;
    (2) Modifications to contracts and agreements, including provisioned 
item orders; and
    (3) Calls or orders under contracts, basic ordering agreements, or 
blanket purchase agreements, issued by the contracting office or by a 
DoD activity other than the contracting office, including DoD orders 
against Federal supply schedules.
    (b) Amendments to solicitations. Number amendments to solicitations 
sequentially using a four position numeric serial number added to the 
basic PII number and beginning with 0001, e.g., N00062-91-R-1234-0001.
    (c) Modifications to contracts and agreements. (1) Number 
modifications to contracts and agreements using a six position alpha-
numeric added to the basic PII number.
    (2) Position 1. Identify the office issuing the modification--
    (i) Contract administration office--A
    (ii) Contracting office--P
    (3) Positions 2 through 3. These are the first two digits in a 
serial number. They may be either alpha or numeric. Use the letters K, 
L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, or Z only in the second position and 
only in the following circumstances--
    (i) Use K, L, M, N, P, and Q in the second position only if the 
modification is issued by the Air Force and is a provisioned item order.
    (ii) Use S, and only S, in the second position to identify 
modifications issued to provide initial or amended shipping instructions 
when--
    (A) The contract has either FOB origin or destination delivery 
terms; and
    (B) The price changes.
    (iii) Use T, U, V, W, X, or Y, and only those characters, in the 
second position to identify modifications issued to provide initial or 
amended shipping instructions when--
    (A) The contract has FOB origin delivery terms; and
    (B) The price does not change.
    (iv) Only use Z in the second position to identify a modification 
which definitizes a letter contract.
    (4) Positions 4 through 6. These positions are always numeric. Use a 
separate series of serial numbers for each type of modification listed 
in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Examples of proper numbering for 
positions 2-6 (the first position will be either ``A'' or ``P'') are as 
follows:

    (5) If the contract administration office is changing the contract 
administration or disbursement office for the first time and is using 
computer generated modifications to notify many offices, it uses the six 
position supplementary number ARZ999. If either office has to be changed 
again during the life of the contract, the supplementary number will be 
ARZ998, and on down as needed.
    (6) Each office authorized to issue modifications shall assign the 
supplementary identification numbers in sequence. Do not assign the 
numbers until it has been determined that a modification is to be 
issued.
    (d) Delivery orders under indefinite delivery contracts, orders 
under basic ordering agreements, and calls under blanket purchase 
agreements. (1) Calls or orders issued by the office issuing the 
contract or agreement. Use a four position alpha-numeric call or order 
serial number added to the basic PII number. These shall be identified 
by using serial numbers beginning 0001 through 9999. When the numeric 
identifiers run out, use alpha characters in the third and fourth 
positions. Never use alpha characters in the first and second positions.
    (2) Orders placed against another activity's contract or agreement.
    (i) If the office placing the order or call is different from the 
office identified in the basic PII number, assign a serial number to the 
order or call. The first and second positions contain the call/order 
code assigned to the ordering office by appendix G. Do not use the 
letters A or P in the first position. The third and fourth positions are 
a two position serial number assigned by the ordering office. The series 
will begin with 01. When the numbers exceed 99, the office will assign a 
uniform series of identifiers containing alpha and/or numeric 
characters, e.g., Basic : N00383-91-D-0001 serial : TU01.
    (ii) If an office is placing calls or orders with NIB, NISH, or 
UNICOR, the office shall identify the instrument with a 13 position 
supplementary PII number using an F in the 9th position. Modifications 
to these calls or orders shall be numbered in accordance with paragraph 
(c) of this section, e.g., Order : DLA100-91-F-0001 modification : 
A00001.
    (e) Modifications to calls or orders. Use a two position alpha-
numeric suffix, known as a call or order modification indicator, to 
identify a modification to a call or order.
    (1) Modifications to a call or order issued by a purchasing office 
begin with 01, 02, and so on through 99, then B1 through B9, BA through 
BZ, C1 through C9, and so on through ZZ.
    (2) Modifications to a call or order issued by a contract 
administration office begin with 1A, 1B, and so on through 9Z, followed 
by A1, A2, and so on to A9, then AA, AB, and so on through AZ.

       Subpart 204.71--Uniform Contract Line Item Numbering System


<R05>
204.7100  Scope.

    This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for assigning 
contract line item numbers.


<R05>
204.7101  Definitions.

    Accounting classification reference number (ACRN) means a two 
position alpha or alpha/numeric control code used as a method of 
relating the accounting classification citation to detailed line item 
information contained in the schedule.
    Attachment means any documentation, appended to a contract or 
incorporated by reference, which does not establish a requirement for 
deliverables.
    Definitized item, as used in this subpart, means an item for which a 
firm

[[Page 29]]

price has been established in the basic contract or by modification.
    Exhibit means a document, referred to in a contract, which is 
attached and establishes requirements for deliverables. The term shall 
not be used to refer to any other kind of attachment to a contract. The 
DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List, is always an exhibit, 
rather than an attachment.
    Nonseverable deliverable, as used in this subpart, means a 
deliverable item that is a single end product or undertaking, entire in 
nature, that cannot be feasibly subdivided into discrete elements or 
phases without losing its identity.
    Undefinitized item, as used in this subpart, means an item for which 
a price has not been established in the basic contract or by 
modification.

<R05>
204.7102  Policy.

    (a) The numbering procedures of this subpart shall apply to all--
    (1) Solicitations;
    (2) Solicitation line and subline item numbers, if practicable;
    (3) Contracts as defined in FAR Subpart 2.1;
    (4) Contract line and subline item numbers;
    (5) Exhibits;
    (6) Exhibit line and subline items; and

    (1) There are no postaward contract administration functions that 
the contracting officer will assign to an office listed in the DoD 
Directory of Contract Administration Services Components;
    (2) The contract is an indefinite delivery type for petroleum 
products against which posts, camps, and stations issue delivery orders 
for products to be consumed by them; or

<R05>
204.7103  Contract line items.


<R05>
204.7103-1  Criteria for establishing.

    Contracts shall identify the items or services to be acquired as 
separate contract line items unless it is not feasible to do so.
    (a) Contract line items shall have all four of the following 
characteristics; however, there are exceptions within the 
characteristics, which may make establishing a separate contract line 
item appropriate even though one of the characteristics appears to be 
missing--
    (1) Single unit price. The item shall have a single unit price or a 
single total price, except--
    (i) If the item is not separately priced (NSP) but the price is 
included in the unit price of another contract line item, enter NSP 
instead of the unit price;
    (ii) When there are associated subline items, established for other 
than informational reasons, and those subline items are priced in 
accordance with 204.7104;
    (iii) When the items or services are being acquired on a cost-
reimbursement contract;
    (iv) When the contract is for maintenance and repair services (e.g., 
a labor hour contract) and firm prices have been established for 
elements of the total price of an item but the actual number and 
quantity of the elements are not known until performance. The 
contracting officer may structure these contracts to reflect a firm or 
estimated total amount for each line item;
    (v) When the contract line item is established to refer to an 
exhibit or an attachment (if management needs dictate that a unit price 
be entered, the price shall be set forth in the item description block 
and enclosed in parentheses); or
    (vi) When the contract is an indefinite delivery type contract and 
provides that the price of an item shall be determined at the time a 
delivery

[[Page 30]]

order is placed and the price is influenced by such factors as the 
quantity ordered (e.g., 10-99 @ $1.00, 100-249 @ $.98, 250+ @ $.95), the 
destination, the FOB point, or the type of packaging required.
    (2) Separately identifiable. A contract line item must be identified 
separately from any other items or services on the contract.
    (i) Supplies are separately identifiable if they have no more than 
one--
    (A) National stock number (NSN);
    (B) Item description; or
    (C) Manufacturer's part number.
    (ii) Services are separately identifiable if they have no more than 
one--
    (A) Scope of work; or
    (B) Description of services.
    (iii) This requirement does not apply if there are associated 
subline items, established for other than informational reasons, and 
those subline items include the actual detailed identification in 
accordance with 204.7104. Where this exception applies, use a general 
narrative description instead of the contract item description.
    (3) Separate delivery schedule. Each contract line item or service 
shall have its own delivery schedule, period of performance, or 
completion date expressly stated (``as required'' constitutes an 
expressly stated delivery term).
    (i) The fact that there is more than one delivery date, destination, 
performance date, or performance point may be a determining factor in 
the decision as to whether to establish more than one contract line 
item.
    (ii) If a contract line item has more than one destination or 
delivery date, the contracting officer may create individual contract 
line items for the different destinations or delivery dates, or may 
specify the different delivery dates for the units by destination in the 
delivery schedule.
    (4) Single accounting classification citation. (i) Each contract 
line item shall reference a single accounting classification citation 
except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this subsection.
    (ii) The use of multiple accounting classification citations for a 
contract line item is authorized in the following situations:
    (A) A single, nonseverable deliverable to be paid for with R&D or 
other funds properly incrementally obligated over several fiscal years 
in accordance with DoD policy;
    (B) A single, nonseverable deliverable to be paid for with different 
authorizations or appropriations, such as in the acquisition of a 
satellite or the modification of production tooling used to produce 
items being acquired by several activities; or
    (C) A modification to an existing contract line item for a 
nonseverable deliverable that results in the delivery of a modified 
item(s) where the item(s) and modification are to be paid for with 
different accounting classification citations.
    (iii) When the use of multiple accounting classification citations 
is authorized for a single contract line item, establish informational 
subline items for each accounting classification citation in accordance 
with 204.7104-1(a).
    (b) Exhibits may be used as an alternative to putting a long list of 
contract line items in the schedule. If exhibits are used, create a 
contract line item citing the exhibit's identifier. See 204.7105(a).
    (c) If the contract involves a test model or a first article which 
must be approved, establish a separate contract line item or subline 
item for each item of supply or service which must be approved. If the 
test model or first article consists of a lot composed of a mixture of 
items, a single line item or subline item may be used for the lot.
    (d) If a supply or service involves ancillary functions, like 
packaging and handling, transportation, payment of state or local taxes, 
or use of reusable containers, and these functions are normally 
performed by the contractor and the contractor is normally entitled to 
reimbursement for performing these functions, do not establish a 
separate contract line item solely to account for these functions. 
However, do identify the functions in the contract schedule. If the 
offeror separately prices these functions, contracting officers may 
establish separate contract line items for the functions; however, the 
separate

[[Page 31]]

line items must conform to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this 
subsection.
[56 FR 36289, July 31, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 34468, July 3, 1995; 60 
FR 43191, Aug. 18, 1995]


<R05>
204.7103-2  Numbering procedures.

    (a) Contract line items shall consist of four numeric digits 0001 
through 9999. Do not use numbers beyond 9999. Within a given contract, 
the item numbers shall be sequential but need not be consecutive.
    (b) The contract line item number shall be the same as the 
solicitation line item number unless there is a valid reason for using 
different numbers.
    (c) Once a contract line item number has been assigned, it shall not 
be assigned to another, different, contract line item in the same 
contract.


<R05>
204.7104  Contract subline items.


<R05>
204.7104-1  Criteria for establishing.

    Contract subline items provide flexibility to further identify 
elements within a contract line item for tracking performance or 
simplifying administration. There are only two kinds of subline items: 
those which are informational in nature and those which consist of more 
than one item that requires separate identification.
    (a) Informational subline items. (1) This type of subline item 
identifies information that relates directly to the contract line item 
and is an integral part of it (e.g., parts of an assembly or parts of a 
kit). These subline items shall not be scheduled separately for 
delivery, identified separately for shipment or performance, or priced 
separately for payment purposes.
    (2) The informational subline item may include quantities, prices, 
or amounts, if necessary to satisfy management requirements. However, 
these elements shall be included within the item description in the 
supplies/services column and enclosed in parentheses to prevent 
confusing them with quantities, prices, or amounts that have contractual 
significance. Do not enter these elements in the quantity and price 
columns.
    (3) Informational subline items shall be used to identify each 
accounting classification citation assigned to a single contract line 
item number when use of multiple citations is authorized (see 204.7103-
1(a)(4)(ii)).
    (b) Separately identified subline items. (1) Subline items will be 
used instead of contract line items to facilitate payment, delivery 
tracking, contract funds accounting, or other management purposes. Such 
subline items shall be used when items bought under one contract line 
item number--
    (i) Are to be paid for from more than one accounting classification. 
A subline item shall be established for the quantity associated with the 
single accounting classification citation. Establish a line item rather 
than a subline item if it is likely that a subline item may be assigned 
additional accounting classification citations at a later date. Identify 
the funding as described in 204.7104-1(a)(3);
    (ii) Are to be packaged in different sizes, each represented by its 
own NSN;
    (iii) Have collateral costs, such as packaging costs, but those 
costs are not a part of the unit price of the contract line item;
    (iv) Have different delivery dates or destinations or requisitions, 
or a combination of the three; or
    (v) Identify parts of an assembly or kit which--
    (A) Have to be separately identified at the time of shipment or 
performance; and
    (B) Are separately priced.
    (2) Each separately identified contract subline item shall have its 
own--
    (i) Delivery schedule, period of performance, or completion date;
    (ii) Unit price or single total price or amount (not separately 
priced (NSP) is acceptable as an entry for price or amount if the price 
is included in another subline item or a different contract line item). 
This requirement does not apply--
    (A) If the subline item was created to refer to an exhibit or an 
attachment. If management needs dictate that a unit price be entered, 
the price shall be set forth in the item description block of the 
schedule and enclosed in parentheses; or

[[Page 32]]

    (B) In the case of indefinite delivery contracts described at 
204.7103-1(a)(1)(vi).
    (iii) Identification (e.g., NSN, item description, manufacturer's 
part number, scope of work, description of services).
    (3) Unit prices and extended amounts.
    (i) The unit price and total amount for all subline items may be 
entered at the contract line item number level if the unit price for the 
subline items is identical. If there is any variation, the subline item 
unit prices shall be entered at the subline item level only.
    (ii) The unit price and extended amounts may be entered at the 
subline items level.
    (iii) The two methods in paragraphs (b)(3) (i) and (ii) of this 
subsection shall not be combined in a contract line item.
    (iv) When the price for items not separately priced is included in 
the price of another subline item or contract line item, it may be 
necessary to withhold payment on the priced subline item until all the 
related subline items that are not separately priced have been 
delivered. In those cases, use the clause at 252.204-7002, Payment for 
Subline Items Not Separately Priced.

<R05>
204.7104-2  Numbering procedures.

    (a) Number subline items by adding either two numeric characters or 
two alpha characters to the basic contract line item number.
    (1) Information subline item numbers. Use numeric characters only 
for information subline items, running 01 through 99. Do not use spaces 
or special characters to separate the subline item number from the 
contract line item number that is its root. For example, if the contract 
line item number is 0001, the first three subline items would be 000101, 
000102, and 000103. Do not use a designation more than once within a 
contract line item.
    (2) Separately identified subline items. Use alpha characters only 
for separately identified subline items, running AA through ZZ. Do not 
use spaces or special characters to separate the subline item number 
from the contract line item number that is its root. For example, if the 
contract line item number is 0001, the first three subline items would 
be 0001AA, 0001AB, and 0001AC.
    (i) Do not use the letters I or O as alpha characters.
    (ii) Use all 24 available alpha characters in the second position 
before selecting a different alpha character for the first position. For 
example, AA, AB, AC, through AZ before beginning BA, BB, and BC.
    (b) Within a given contract line item, the subline item numbers 
shall be sequential but need not be consecutive.
    (c) Exhibits may be used as an alternative to setting forth in the 
schedule a long list of contract subline items. If exhibits are used, 
create a contract subline item citing the exhibit's identifier. See 
204.7105.
    (d) If a contract line item involves ancillary functions, like 
packaging and handling, transportation, payment of state or local taxes, 
or use of reusable containers, and these functions are normally 
performed by the contractor and the contractor is normally entitled to 
reimbursement for performing these functions, do not establish a 
separate subline item solely to account for these functions. However, do 
identify the functions in the contract schedule. If offeror separately 
prices these functions, then contracting officers may establish separate 
subline items for the functions; however, the separate subline items 
must conform to the requirements of 204.7104-1.
    (e) The following examples illustrate subline items numbering--
    (1) Subline items structured to identify destinations for identical 
items, identically priced (delivery schedule shall be established for 
each subline item, not the contract line item).

204.7105  Contract exhibits and attachments.

    (a) Use of exhibits. (1) Exhibits may be used instead of putting a 
long list of contract line items or subline items in the contract 
schedule. Exhibits are particularly useful in buying spare parts.
    (2) When using exhibits, establish a contract line or subline item 
and refer to the exhibit.
    (3) Identify exhibits individually.
    (4) Each exhibit shall apply to only one contract line item or 
subline item, except--
    (i) One exhibit may apply to one or more option line item(s) when 
the data required under the exhibits is identical in all respects except 
the period during which the option is to be exercised; and
    (ii) An exhibit may apply to more than one contract line item if the 
exhibit is not separately priced and the exhibit deliverable is 
identical for all applicable contract line items.
    (5) More than one exhibit may apply to a single contract line item.
    (6) Data items on a DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List, 
may be either separately priced or not separately priced.
    (i) Separately priced. When data are separately priced, enter the 
price in only one place in the contract: in either Section B of the 
contract schedule or on the DD Form 1423. Whichever place, display the 
price there consistently.
    (A) Section B. If the prices are entered in section B of the 
schedule, detach Blocks 17 and 18 of the DD Form 1423 and file elsewhere 
in the contract file. If the prices are entered on the DD Form 1423, do 
not detach Blocks 17 and 18 of the DD Form 1423.
    (B) DD Form 1423. If the prices are entered on the DD Form 1423, the 
price of all separately priced deliverable data items attributable to a 
line item shall be totalled and included, for information purposes, in 
parentheses, below the supplies services for that line item, in section 
B of the schedule.
    (ii) NSP. Include prices in a priced contract line item or subline 
item. Detach Blocks 17 and 18 of the DD Form 1423 and retain them 
elsewhere as required.
    (7) The contracting officer may append attachments to exhibits, as 
long as the attachment does not identify a deliverable requirement which 
has not been established by a contract or exhibit line or subline item.
    (b) Numbering exhibits and attachments. (1) Use alpha characters to 
identify exhibits. The alpha characters shall be either single or double 
capital letters. Do not use the letters I or O.
    (2) Exhibit identifiers need not be either consecutive or 
sequential.
    (3) Once an identifier has been assigned to an exhibit, do not use 
it on another exhibit in the same contract.
    (4) The identifier shall always appear in the first or first and 
second positions of all applicable exhibit line item numbers.
    (5) If the exhibit has more than one page, cite the procurement 
instrument identification number, exhibit identifier, and applicable 
contract line or subline item number on each page.
    (6) Use numbers to identify attachments.
    (c) Numbering exhibit line items and subline items--(1) Criteria for 
establishing. The criteria for establishing exhibit line items and 
subline items is the same as those for establishing contract line items 
and subline items (see 204.7103 and 204.7104, respectively).
    (2) Procedures for numbering. (i) Number items in an exhibit in a 
manner similar to contract line items and subline items.
    (ii) Number line items using a four position number.
    (A) The first position or the first and second position contain the 
exhibit identifier.
    (B) The third and fourth positions contain the alpha or numeric 
character serial numbers assigned to the line item.
    (iii) Assign alpha or numeric characters to the line item on the 
basis of the same criteria outlined in contract subline items at 
204.7104.
    (iv) Exhibit line item numbers shall be sequential within the 
exhibit.
    (3) Examples--(i) Two position serial number for double letter 
exhibit identifier.

204.7106  Contract modifications.

    (a) If new items are added, assign new contract line or subline item 
numbers or exhibit line item numbers, in accordance with the procedures 
established at 204.7103, 204.7104, and 204.7105.
    (b) Modifications to existing contract line items or exhibit line 
items. (1) If the modification relates to existing contract line items 
or exhibit line items, the modification shall refer to those item 
numbers.
    (2) If the contracting officer decides to assign new identifications 
to existing contract or exhibit line items, the following rules apply--
    (i) Definitized and undefinitized items. (A) The original line item 
or subline item number may be used if the modification applies to the 
total quantity of the original line item or subline.
    (B) The original line item or subline item number may be used if the 
modification makes only minor changes in the specifications of some of 
the items ordered on the original line item or subline item and the 
resulting changes in unit price can be averaged to provide a new single 
unit price for the total quantity. If the changes in the specifications 
make the item significantly distinguishable from the original item or 
the resulting changes in unit price cannot be averaged, create a new 
line item.
    (C) If the modification affects only a partial quantity of an 
existing contract or exhibit line item or subline item and the change 
does not involve either the delivery date or the ship-to/mark-for data, 
the original contract or exhibit line item or subline item number shall 
remain with the unchanged quantity. Assign the changed quantity the next 
available number.
    (ii) Undefinitized items. In addition to the rules in paragraph 
(b)(2)(i), the following additional rules apply to undefinitized items--

[[Page 37]]

    (A) If the modification is undefinitized and increases the quantity 
of an existing definitized item, assign the undefinitized quantity the 
next available number.
    (B) If the modification increases the quantity of an existing 
undefinitized item, the original contract or exhibit line item or 
subline item may be used if the unit price for the new quantity is 
expected to be the same as the price for the original quantity. If the 
unit prices of the two quantities will be different, assign the new 
quantity the next available number.
    (C) If the modification both affects only a partial quantity of the 
existing contract or exhibit line or subline item and definitizes the 
price for the affected portion, the definitized portion shall retain the 
original item number. If there is any undefinitized portion of the item, 
assign it the next available number. However, if the modification 
definitizes the price for the whole quantity of the line item, and price 
impact of the changed work can be apportioned equally over the whole to 
arrive at a new unit price, the quantity with the changes can be added 
into the quantity of the existing item.
    (D) If the modification affects only a partial quantity of an 
existing contract or exhibit line or subline item but does not change 
the delivery schedule or definitize price, the unchanged portion shall 
retain the original contract or exhibit line or subline item number. 
Assign the changed portion the next available number.


<R05>
204.7107  Contract accounting classification reference number (ACRN).

    (a) When a contract contains more than one accounting classification 
citation, contracting offices shall use ACRNs. Assigning the ACRNs is 
the responsibility of the contracting office issuing the contract, basic 
ordering agreement, or blanket purchase agreement. This authority shall 
not be delegated. If more than one office will use the contract (e.g., 
ordering officers, other contracting officers), the contract must 
contain instructions for assigning ACRNs.
    (b) ACRNs are used to process certain contract data through the 
Military Standard Contract Administration Procedures (MILSCAP) system. 
The MILSCAP system uses the ACRN to relate certain contract 
administration records to the accounting classification citation used to 
obligate funds on the contract. Among these records are the accounting 
classification trailer record, the supplies schedules data record, and 
the services line item data record. ACRNs are also used to associate the 
various record formats of the contract payment notice as described in 
chapter 9 of the MILSCAP Manual, DoD 4000.25-5-M.
    (c) Procedures for establishing ACRNs. ACRNs consist of a two 
position alpha or alpha/numeric code assigned to each discrete 
accounting classification citation within each contract. ACRNs shall be 
established in accordance with the following guidelines:
    (1) Do not use the letters I and O.
    (2) In no case shall an ACRN apply to more than one accounting 
classification citation, nor shall more than one ACRN be assigned to one 
accounting classification citation.
    (d) Using the ACRN in the contract. (1) Show the ACRN as a detached 
prefix to the accounting classification citation in the accounting and 
appropriation data block or, if there are too many accounting 
classification citations to fit reasonably in that block, in section G 
(Contract Administration Data).
    (2) ACRNs need not prefix accounting classification citations if the 
accounting classification citations are present in the contract only for 
the transportation officer to cite to Government bills of lading.
    (3) If the contracting officer is making a modification to a 
contract and using the same accounting classification citations, which 
have had ACRNs assigned to them, the modification need cite only the 
ACRNs in the accounting and appropriations data block or on the 
continuation sheets.
    (e) Showing the ACRN in the contract. If there is more than one ACRN 
in a contract, all the ACRNs will appear in several places in the 
schedule (e.g., ACRN:AA).
    (1) Ship-to/mark-for block. Show the ACRN beside the identity code 
of each activity in the ship-to/mark-for block unless only one 
accounting classification citation applies to a line item or

[[Page 38]]

subline item. Only one ACRN may be assigned to the same ship-to/mark-for 
within the same contract line or subline item number unless multiple 
accounting classification citations apply to a single nonseverable 
deliverable unit such that the item cannot be related to an individual 
accounting classification citation.
    (2) Supplies/services column. (i) If only one accounting 
classification citation applies to a line item or a subline item, the 
ACRN may be shown in the supplies/services column near the item 
description.
    (ii) If more than one accounting classification citation applies to 
a single contract line item, identify each assigned ACRN and the amount 
of associated funds using informational subline items (see 204.7104-
1(a)).
    (3) Payment instructions. (i) When a contract line item is funded by 
multiple accounting classification citations, the contracting officer 
shall provide adequate instructions in section G (Contract 
Administration Data), under the heading ``Payment Instructions for 
Multiple Accounting Classification Citations,'' to permit the paying 
office to charge the accounting classification citations assigned to 
that contract line item (see 204.7104-1(a)) in a manner that reflects 
the performance of work on the contract. If additional accounting 
classification citations are subsequently added, the payment 
instructions must be modified to include the additional accounting 
classification citations.
    (ii) Payment instructions shall provide a methodology for the paying 
office to assign payments to the appropriate accounting classification 
citation(s), based on anticipated contract work performance. The method 
established should be consistent with the reasons for the establishment 
of the line items. The payment method may be based upon a unique 
distribution profile devised to reflect how the funds represented by 
each of the accounting classification citations support contract 
performance. Payment methods that direct that payments be made from the 
earliest available fiscal year funding sources, or that provide for 
proration across accounting classification citations assigned to the 
line item, or a combination thereof, may be used if that methodology 
reasonably reflects how each of the accounting classification citations 
supports contract performance.

                Subpart 204.72--Contractor Identification


<R05>
204.7200  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes uniform policies and procedures for 
identification of commercial and Government entities when it is 
necessary to:
    (a) Exchange data with another contracting activity, including 
contract administration activities and contract payment activities, or 
to comply with the reporting requirements of subpart 204.6; or
    (b) Identify contractors for the purposes of developing computerized 
acquisition systems or solicitation mailing lists.


<R05>
204.7201  Definitions.

    (a) Commercial and Government entity (CAGE) code means--
    (1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) 
to identify a commercial or Government entity; or
    (2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO) and maintained by the Defense Logistics Services 
Center.
    (b) Contractor identification code means any code required by the 
contracting office for the purpose of identifying the offeror. CAGE 
codes and Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) numbers are two 
examples of contractor identification codes.

<R05>
204.7202  General.

    Various coding systems are in use to identify commercial and 
government entities. Codes are requested by contracting and contract 
administration offices for various reasons. This guidance is designed to 
improve the accuracy of the initial code assignment and

[[Page 39]]

to help ensure that the data are maintained accurately and are up-to-
date.


<R05>
204.7202-1  CAGE codes.

    (a) CAGE codes are assigned or maintained by the Defense Logistics 
Services Center (DLSC) to identify commercial and Government activities. 
Their use is prescribed by 253.204-70(b)(5)(ii)(C) and DoD 4000.25-5-M, 
Military Standard Contract Administration Procedures (MILSCAP).
    (b) CAGE codes have also been known in the past as federal supply 
codes for manufacturers (FSCM) and federal supply codes for 
nonmanufacturers (FSCNM).
    (c) If the CAGE code is not already available in the contracting 
office, and the apparent awardee does not respond to the provision at 
252.204-7001, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code Reporting, 
use the following procedures in the order listed--
    (1) Use the bimonthly H-8 microfiche or CD ROM publication issued by 
DLSC. (Their address is: DLSC-RP, Federal Center, 74 N. Washington, 
Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084. Their telephone numbers are: DSN 932-4725, 
FTS 552-4725, or commercial (616) 961-4725.);
    (2) Use the on-line access to the CAGE file through the Defense 
Logistics Information System;
    (3) Use the on-line access to the Defense Logistics Agency CAGE file 
through the DLA Network or dial-up capability; or
    (4) Ask DLSC to assign a CAGE code. Submit a DD Form 2051, Request 
for Assignment of a CAGE Code, (or electronic equivalent) to the address 
in paragraph (c)(1) of this subsection, ATTN: DLSC-SBB. The contracting 
activity completes Section A of the DD Form 2051, Request for Assignment 
of a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code, and the contractor 
completes section B. The contracting activity must verify section B 
before the form is submitted.
    (d) Direct questions on obtaining computer tapes, electronic 
updates, or code assignments to DLSC (DLSC-SBB) at DSN 932-4358, FTS 
552-4358, or commercial (616) 961-4358.

    (a) The contracting officer shall assist the offeror in obtaining 
the required contractor code(s).
    (b) Prospective offerors may not be denied a solicitation or bid set 
because the offeror does not have a contractor code.
    (c) The contracting officer or designee shall not request a new code 
assignment until the appropriate microfiche, hardcopy or computer files 
have been screened in an effort to identify a current code for the 
entity. If the contracting officer does not have access to the files or 
listings, then initiate action to obtain the files or listings and any 
equipment necessary to use those files and/or listings (see 204.7202-1 
and 2).
    (d) If a CAGE code is being requested, it is the responsibility of 
the contracting activity to request the assignment of the CAGE code by 
completing section A of the DD Form 2051, Request for Assignment of a 
Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code (see 253.303-2051). The 
prospective contractor will complete section B of the form. The 
completed form or electronic equivalent will be submitted by the 
contracting activity to DLSC-SBB for processing and code assignment 
after the contracting activity has verified the data submitted by the 
contractor. CAGE codes may be requested at the time the offeror is sent 
a solicitation package or added to the mailing list to ensure that a 
code is assigned in sufficient time to process the DD Form 350, 
Individual Contracting Action Report, without delay.

    Contracting officers shall process and execute novation agreements 
in accordance with FAR Subpart 42.12, Novation and Change-of-Name 
Agreements. These actions are independent of code and name assignments 
made as a result of the occasion which created the need for the novation 
agreement. The maintenance activity will determine which entity(s) will 
retain the existing code(s) and which entities will be assigned new 
codes. The contracting officer responsible for processing the novation 
agreement shall provide the maintenance activity with the following 
information:
    (a) Name(s), address(es), and code(s) of the contractor(s) 
transferring the original contractual rights and obligations.

assigned CAGE codes for identification and processing purposes.
    (a) A single CAGE code will be assigned to the agent/broker 
establishment in addition to any codes assigned to the entities 
represented by the agent/broker, i.e., only one code will be assigned to 
a specific agent/broker entity regardless of the number of firms 
represented by that agent/broker.
    (b) Additional codes may be assigned to an agent/broker if they meet 
the criteria for assigning additional codes for entities, e.g., 
different location.
    (c) Codes will not be assigned to an agent/broker in care of the 
entity being represented or in any way infer that the agent/broker is a 
separate establishment bearing the name of the entity represented by the 
agent/broker.

sources; e.g., the technical complexity and criticality of the supplies 
or services; and
    (2) The current annual requirement and projected needs for the 
supplies or services;
    (C) Whether the existing source must be totally excluded from the 
contract action or whether a partial exclusion is sufficient;
    (D) The potential effect of exclusion on the excluded source in 
terms of loss of capability to furnish the supplies or services in the 
future;

<R05>
207.102  Policy.

    When a class justification for other than full and open competition 
has been approved, planning for competition shall be accomplished 
consistent with the terms of that approval.
[60 FR 61592, Nov. 30, 1995]


<R05>
207.103  Agency-head responsibilities.

    (c)(i) Military departments and agencies shall prepare written 
acquisition plans for--
    (A) Acquisitions for development, as defined in FAR 35.001, when the 
total cost of all contracts for the acquisition program is estimated at 
$5 million or more;
    (B) Acquisitions for production or services when the total cost of 
all contracts for the acquisition program is estimated at $30 million or 
more for all years or $15 million or more for any fiscal year; and
    (C) Any other acquisition considered appropriate by the department 
or agency.
    (ii) Written plans are not required in acquisitions for a final buy 
out or one-time buy. The terms ``final buy out'' and ``one-time buy'' 
refer to a single contract which covers all known present and future 
requirements. This exception does not apply to a multiyear contract or a 
contract with options or phases.
    (d) Prepare written acquisition plans for acquisition programs 
meeting the thresholds of paragraphs (c)(i) (A) and (B) of this section 
on a program basis. Other acquisition plans may be written

[[Page 47]]

on either a program or an individual contract basis.
    (f) The program manager, or other official responsible for the 
program, has overall responsibility for acquisition planning.
    (h)(i) Apply design-to-cost principles--
    (A) In all major defense acquisition programs (DoDD 5000.1, Defense 
Acquisition), unless exempted by the Secretary of Defense; and
    (B) To the acquisition of systems, subsystems, and components below 
the thresholds for major defense acquisition programs, to the extent 
prescribed by DoDD 5000.1.
    (ii) Consider life-cycle-cost in all acquisitions of systems and 
equipment.

<R05>
207.104  General procedures.

    (b) The planner should forward the requirements information to the 
contract administration organization when assistance in identification 
of potential sources of supply is necessary, when an existing contract 
is being modified or resolicited, or when contract administration 
resource requirements will be affected.
[61 FR 50451, Sept. 26, 1996]


<R05>
207.105  Contents of written acquisition plans.

    For acquisitions covered by 207.103(c)(i) (A) and (B), correlate the 
plan to the DoD Future Years Defense Program, applicable budget 
submissions, and the decision coordinating paper/program memorandum, as 
appropriate. It is incumbent upon the planner to coordinate the plan 
with all those who have a responsibility for the development, 
management, or administration of the acquisition. The acquisition plan 
should be provided to the contract administration organization to 
facilitate resource allocation and planning for the evaluation, 
identification, and management of contractor performance risk.
    (a) Acquisition background and objectives--(1) Statement of need. 
Include--
    (A) Applicability of a decision coordinating paper (DCP), 
acquisition decision memorandum, Defense Acquisition Board (DAB), and/or 
internal service reviews. Describe the options in the DCP/acquisition 
decision memorandum and delineate which option the acquisition plan 
supports.
    (B) The date approval for operational use has been or will be 
obtained. If waivers are requested, describe the need for the waivers.
    (C) A milestone chart depicting the acquisition objectives.
    (D) Milestones for updating the acquisition plan. Indicate when the 
plan will be updated. Program managers should schedule updates to 
coincide with DAB reviews and the transition from one phase to another 
(e.g., engineering and manufacturing development to production and 
deployment).
    (8) Acquisition streamlining. DoDD 5000.1, Defense Acquisition, and 
DoD 5000.2-R, Mandatory Procedures for Major Defense Acquisition 
Programs (MDAPs) and Major Automated Information System (MAIS) 
Acquisition Programs, contain policy direction on acquisition 
streamlining. See MIL-HDBK 248, Acquisition Streamlining, for guidance 
on streamlining performance requirements, the technical package, and the 
contract strategy.
    (b) Plan of action.--(5) Budgeting and funding. Include specific 
references to budget line items and program elements, where applicable, 
estimated production unit cost, and the total cost for remaining 
production.
    (6) Product descriptions. For development acquisitions, describe the 
market research undertaken to identify commercial items, commercial 
items with modifications, or nondevelopmental items (see FAR part 10) 
that could satisfy the acquisition objectives.
    (13) Logistics considerations. (i) Describe the extent of integrated 
logistics support planning to date, including references to approved 
plans.
    (ii) Discuss the mission profile, reliability, and maintainability 
(R&M) program plan, R&M predictions, redundancy, qualified parts lists, 
parts and material qualification, R&M requirements imposed on vendors, 
failure analysis, corrective action and feedback, and R&M design reviews 
and trade-off studies.

Procedures for Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs) and Major 
Automated Information System (MAIS) Acquisition Programs, for procedures 
on standardization and on the DoD Parts Control Program. See MIL-STD-
965, Parts Control Program, for procedures on the Standardized Military 
Drawing Program.
    (S-70) Describe the extent of Computer-Aided Acquisition and 
Logistics Support (CALS) implementation (see MIL-HDBK 59, Department of 
Defense Computer-Aided Logistics Support (CALS) Program Guide, and MIL-
STD-1840A, Automated Interchange of Technical Information.
    (16) Environmental and energy conservation objectives. Discuss 
actions taken to ensure either elimination of or authorization to use 
class I ozone-depleting chemicals and substances (see 211.271).
    (18) Other considerations. (A) National Technology and Industrial 
Base. For major defense acquisition programs, address the following 
(Pub. L. 102-484, section 4220)--
    (1) An analysis of the capabilities of the national technology and 
industrial base to develop, produce, maintain, and support such program, 
including consideration of the following factors related to foreign 
dependency (Pub. L. 102-484, section 4219(h))--
    (i) The availability of essential raw materials, special alloys, 
composite materials, components, tooling, and production test equipment 
for the sustained production of systems fully capable of meeting the 
performance objectives established for those systems; the uninterrupted 
maintenance and repair of such systems; and the sustained operation of 
such systems.
    (ii) The identification of items specified in paragraph 
(b)(18)(A)(1)(i) of this section that are available only from sources 
outside the national technology and industrial base.
    (iii) The availability of alternatives for obtaining such items from 
within the national technology and industrial base if such items become 
unavailable from sources outside the national technology industrial 
base; and an analysis of any military vulnerability that could result 
from the lack of reasonable alternatives.
    (iv) The effects on the national technology and industrial base that 
result from foreign acquisition of firms in the United States.
    (2) Consideration of requirements for efficient manufacture during 
the design and production of the systems to be procured under the 
program.
    (3) The use of advanced manufacturing technology, processes, and 
systems during the research and development phase and the production 
phase of the program.
    (4) To the maximum extent practicable, the use of contract 
solicitations that encourage competing offerors to acquire, for use in 
the performance of the contract, modern technology, production 
equipment, and production systems (including hardware and software) that 
increase the productivity of the offerors and reduce the life-cycle 
costs.
    (5) Methods to encourage investment by U.S. domestic sources in 
advanced manufacturing technology production equipment and processes 
through--
    (i) Recognition of the contractor's investment in advanced 
manufacturing technology production equipment, processes, and 
organization of work systems that build on workers' skill and 
experience, and work force skill development in the development of the 
contract objective; and
    (ii) Increased emphasis in source selection on the efficiency of 
production.
    (6) Expanded use of commercial manufacturing processes rather than 
processes specified by DoD.
    (7) Elimination of barriers to, and facilitation of, the integrated 
manufacture of commercial items and items being produced under DoD 
contracts.
    (8) Expanded use of commercial items, commercial items with 
modifications, or to the extent commercial items are not available, 
nondevelopmental items (see FAR part 10).
    (B) Industrial preparedness (IP).
    (1) Provide the program's IP strategy that assesses the capability 
of the U.S. industrial base to achieve identified surge and mobilization 
goals. If no IP strategy has been developed, provide supporting 
rationale for this position.
    (2) If in the IP strategy, the development of a detailed IP plan was 
determined to be applicable, include the

[[Page 49]]

plan by text or by reference. If the development of the IP plan was 
determined not to be applicable, summarize the details of the analysis 
forming the basis of this decision.
    (3) If the program involves peacetime and wartime hardware 
configurations which are supported by logistics support plans, identify 
their impact on the IP plan.
    (C) Ensure compliance with DoDD 4210.15, Hazardous Material 
Pollution Prevention.
    (D) Contract administration. Discuss the level of Government 
administration anticipated or currently performed and any change 
proposed by the contract administration office.

<R05>
207.106  Additional requirements for major systems.

    (b)(1)(A) The contracting officer is prohibited by 10 U.S.C. 
2305(d)(4)(A) from requiring offers for development or production of 
major systems that would enable the Government to use technical data to 
competitively reprocure identical items or components of the system if 
the item or component were developed exclusively at private expense, 
unless the contracting officer determines that--
    (1) The original supplier of the item or component will be unable to 
satisfy program schedule or delivery requirements;
    (2) Proposals by the original supplier of the item or component to 
meet mobilization requirements are insufficient to meet the agency's 
mobilization needs; or
    (3) The Government is otherwise entitled to unlimited rights in 
technical data.
    (B) If the contracting officer makes a determination, under 
paragraphs (b)(1)(A) (1) and (2) of this section, for a competitive 
solicitation, 10 U.S.C. 2305(d)(4)(B) requires that the evaluation of 
items developed at private expense be based on an analysis of the total 
value, in terms of innovative design, life-cycle costs, and other 
pertinent factors, of incorporating such items in the system.


<R04>
               Subpart 207.4--Equipment Lease or Purchase


<R05>

<R05>
207.470  Statutory requirements.

    (a) Limitation on contracts with terms of 18 months or more. As 
required by 10 U.S.C. 2401a, the contracting officer shall not enter 
into any contract for any vessel, aircraft, or vehicle, through a lease, 
charter, or similar agreement with a term of 18 months or more, or 
extend or renew any such contract for a term of 18 months or more, 
unless the head of the contracting activity has--
    (1) Considered all costs of such a contract (including estimated 
termination liability); and
    (2) Determined in writing that the contract is in the best interest 
of the Government.
    (b) Leasing of commercial vehicles and associated equipment. Except 
as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the contracting officer 
may use leasing in the acquisition of commercial vehicles and associated 
equipment whenever the contracting officer determines that leasing of 
such vehicles is practicable and efficient (10 US.C. 2401a).

    (2)(iii) Information on General Services Administration (GSA) 
schedules for maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation of personal 
property is in the GSA supply catalog. The types of personal property 
for which GSA, Federal Supply Service has schedule contracts for 
maintenance, repair, and/or rehabilitation are--
    (1) Furniture (office, household, quarters, institutional, and 
hospital type);
    (2) Typewriters (manual, electric, and electronic);
    (3) Repair and maintenance of Government owned vehicles; and
    (4) Tire retreading and repair (except aircraft).


<R05>
208.002  Use of other Government supply sources.

    (f) Detailed information on strategic and critical materials in

<R04>
          Subpart 208.4--Ordering From Federal Supply Schedules


<R05>
208.404  Using schedules.

    (a) When a schedule lists both foreign and domestic items that will 
meet the

[[Page 51]]

needs of the requiring activity, the ordering office must apply the 
procedures of part 225 and FAR part 25, Foreign Acquisition. When 
purchase of an item of foreign origin is specifically required, the 
requiring activity must furnish the ordering office sufficient 
information to permit the determinations required by part 225 and FAR 
part 25 to be made.


<R05>
208.404-1  Mandatory use.

    The DoD will not be a mandatory user of any schedule unless 
individual DoD activities elect to provide annual requirements estimates 
to GSA and become mandatory users. Examples of areas where this approach 
may be applied are:
    (1) Group 68--gases and chemicals;
    (2) Group 26--pneumatic tires and inner tubes;
    (3) Maintenance, repair, and/or rehabilitation of personal property; 
and
    (4) ``Just-in-time'' arrangements for delivery of material directly 
from vendors to users.


<R05>
208.404-2  Optional use.

    Make maximum use of the schedules. Other procedures may be used if 
further competition is judged to be in the best interest of the 
Government in terms of quality, responsiveness, or cost.


<R05>
208.405  Ordering office responsibilities.


<R05>
208.405-2  Order placement.

    (1) Ordering offices may use DD Form 1155, Order for Supplies or 
Services, to order items from schedules.
    (2) Orders may be placed orally if--
    (i) The order does not exceed the small purchase threshold at FAR 
13.000;
    (ii) The contractor agrees to furnish a delivery ticket for each 
shipment under the order (in the number of copies required by the 
ordering office). The ticket must include the--
    (A) Contract number;
    (B) Order number under the contract;
    (C) Date of order;
    (D) Name and title of person placing order;
    (E) Itemized listing of supplies or services furnished; and
    (F) Date of delivery or shipment.
    (iii) Invoicing procedures are agreed upon. Optional methods of 
submitting invoices for payment are permitted, such as--
    (A) An individual invoice with a receipted copy of the delivery 
ticket;
    (B) A summarized monthly invoice covering all oral orders made 
during the month, with receipted copies of the delivery tickets (this 
option is preferred if there are many oral orders); or
    (C) A contracting officer statement that the Government has received 
the supplies.
    (3) For purchases where cash payment is an advantage, the use of 
imprest funds (see FAR 13.4) is authorized when--
    (i) The order does not exceed the threshold at FAR 13.404(a); and
    (ii) The contractor agrees to the procedure.


<R04>
Subpart 208.7--Acquisition From the Blind and Other Severely Handicapped


<R05>
208.705  Procedures.

    Ordering offices may use DD Form 1155, Order for Supplies or

<R04>
                 Subpart 208.70--Coordinated Acquisition


<R05>
208.7000  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes policy and procedures for acquisition of 
items for which contracting responsibility is assigned to one or more of 
the departments/agencies or the General Services Administration. 
Contracting responsibility is assigned through--
    (a) The Coordinated Acquisition Program (commodity assignments are 
listed in appendix B); or
    (b) The Integrated Materiel Management Program (assignments are in 
DoD 4140.26-M, Integrated Materiel Management for Consumable Items).


<R05>
208.7001  Definitions.

    For purposes of this subpart--
    Acquiring department means the department, agency, or General 
Services Administration which has contracting

[[Page 52]]

responsibility under the Coordinated Acquisition Program.
    Integrated materiel management means assignment of acquisition 
management responsibility to one department, agency, or the General 
Services Administration for all of DoD's requirements for the assigned 
item. Acquisition management normally includes computing requirements, 
funding, budgeting, storing, issuing, cataloging, standardizing, and 
contracting functions.
    Requiring department means the department or agency which has the 
requirement for an item.


<R05>
208.7002  Assignment authority.

    (a) Under the DoD Coordinated Acquisition Program, contracting 
responsibility for certain commodities is assigned to a single 
department, agency, or the General Services Administration (GSA). 
Commodity assignments are made--
    (1) To the departments and agencies, by the Assistant Secretary of 
Defense (Production and Logistics);
    (2) To the GSA, through agreement with GSA, by the Assistant 
Secretary of Defense (Production and Logistics);
    (3) Outside the continental United States, by the Unified 
Commanders; and
    (4) For acquisitions to be made in the United States for commodities 
not assigned under paragraphs (a) (1), (2), or (3) of this section, by 
agreement of agency heads (10 U.S.C. 2308).
    (i) Agreement may be on either a one-time or a continuing basis. The 
submission of a military interdepartmental purchase request (MIPR) by a 
requiring activity and its acceptance by the contracting activity of 
another department, even though based on an oral communication, 
constitutes a one-time agreement.
    (ii) Consider repetitive delegated acquisition responsibilities for 
coordinated acquisition assignment. If not considered suitable for 
coordinated acquisition assignment, formalize continuing agreements and 
distribute them to all activities concerned.
    (b) Under the Integrated Materiel Management Program, assignments 
are made by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Production and 
Logistics)--
    (1) To the departments and agencies; and
    (2) To the GSA, through agreement with GSA.


<R05>
208.7002-1  Acquiring department responsibilities.

    The acquiring department generally is responsible under coordinated 
acquisition for--
    (a) Operational aspects of acquisition planning (Phasing the 
submission of requirements to contracting, consolidating or dividing 
requirements, analyzing the market, and determining patterns for the 
phased placement of orders to avoid unnecessary production fluctuations 
and meet the needs of requiring departments at the lowest price);
    (b) Purchasing;
    (c) Performing or assigning contract administration, including 
follow up and expediting of inspection and transportation; and
    (d) Obtaining licenses under patents and settling patent 
infringement claims arising out of the acquisition. (Acquiring 
departments must obtain approval from the department whose funds are to 
be charged for obtaining licenses or settling claims.)


<R05>
208.7002-2  Requiring department responsibilities.

    The requiring department is responsible for--
    (a) Ensuring compliance with the order of priority in FAR 8.001 for 
use of Government supply sources before submitting a requirement to the 
acquiring department for contracting action.
    (b) Providing the acquiring department--
    (1) The complete and certified documentation required by FAR 6.303-
2(b). A requiring department official, equivalent to the appropriate 
level in FAR 6.304, must approve the documentation before submission of 
the military interdepartmental purchase request (MIPR) to the acquiring 
department;
    (2) Any additional supporting data which the acquiring department 
contracting officer requests (e.g., the results of any market survey or 
why none was conducted, and actions the requiring department will take 
to overcome barriers to competition in the future);

[[Page 53]]

    (3) The executed determination and findings required by FAR 6.302-
7(c)(1);
    (4) When a requiring department requests an acquiring department to

208.7003  Applicability.


<R05>
208.7003-1  Assignments under integrated material management (IMM).

    (a) All items assigned for IMM must be acquired from the IMM manager 
except--
    (1) Items purchased under circumstances of unusual and compelling 
urgency as defined in FAR 6.302-2. After such a purchase is made, the 
requiring activity must send one copy of the contract and a statement of 
the emergency to the IMM manager;
    (2) Items for which the IMM manager assigns a supply system code for 
local purchase or otherwise grants authority to purchase locally; or
    (3) When purchase by the requiring activity is in the best interest 
of the Government in terms of the combination of quality, timeliness, 
and cost that best meets the requirement. This exception does not apply 
to items--
    (i) Critical to the safe operation of a weapon system;
    (ii) With special security characteristics; or
    (iii) Which are dangerous (e.g., explosives, munitions).
    (b) When an item assigned for IMM is to be acquired by the requiring 
activity under paragraph (a)(3) of this subsection, the contracting 
officer must--
    (1) Document the contract file with a statement of the specific 
advantage of local purchase for an acquisition exceeding the micro-
purchase threshold in FAR part 13; and
    (2) Ensure that a waiver is obtained from the IMM manager before 
initiating an acquisition exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold 
in FAR part 13, if the IMM assignment is to the General Services 
Administration (GSA), the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), or the Army 
Materiel Command (AMC). Submit requests for waiver to--

<R05>
208.7003-2  Assignments under coordinated acquisition.

    Requiring departments must submit to the acquiring department all 
contracting requirements for items assigned for coordinated acquisition, 
except--
    (a) Items obtained through the sources in FAR 8.001(a)(1) (i) 
through (vii);
    (b) Items obtained under 208.7003-1(a);
    (c) Requirements not in excess of the simplified acquisition 
threshold in FAR part 13, when contracting by the requiring department 
is in the best interest of the Government;
    (d) In an emergency. When an emergency purchase is made, the 
requiring department must send one copy of the contract and a statement 
of the emergency to the contracting activity of the acquiring 
department;
    (e) Requirements for which the acquiring department's contracting 
activity delegates contracting authority to the requiring department;
    (f) Items in a research and development stage (as described in FAR 
part 35). Under this exception, the military departments may contract 
for research and development requirements, including quantities for 
testing purposes and items undergoing in-service evaluation (not yet in 
actual production, but beyond prototype). Generally, this exception 
applies only when research and development funds are used.
    (g) Items peculiar to nuclear ordnance material where design 
characteristics or test-inspection requirements are controlled by the 
Department of Energy (DoE) or by DoD to ensure reliability of nuclear 
weapons.
    (1) This exception applies to all items designed for and peculiar to 
nuclear ordnance regardless of agency control, or to any item which 
requires test or inspection conducted or controlled by DoE or DoD.
    (2) This exception does not cover items used for both nuclear 
ordnance and other purposes if the items are not subject to the special 
testing procedures.
    (h) Items to be acquired under FAR 6.302-6 (national security 
requires limitation of sources);
    (i) Items to be acquired under FAR 6.302-1 (supplies available only 
from the original source for follow-on contract);
    (j) Items directly related to a major system and which are design 
controlled by and acquired from either the system manufacturer or a 
manufacturer of a major subsystem;
    (k) Items subject to rapid design changes, or to continuous redesign 
or modification during the production and/or operational use phases, 
which require continual contact between industry and the requiring 
department to ensure that the item meets the requirements:
    (1) This exception permits the requiring department to contract for 
items of highly unstable design. For use of this exception, it must be 
clearly impractical, both technically and contractually, to refer the 
acquisition to the acquiring department. Anticipation that contracting 
by negotiation will be appropriate, or that a number of design changes 
may occur during contract performance is not in itself sufficient reason 
for using this exception.
    (2) This exception also applies to items requiring compatibility 
testing, provided such testing requires continual contact between 
industry and the requiring department;
    (l) Containers acquired only with items for which they are designed;
    (m) One-time buy of a noncataloged item.
    (1) This exception permits the requiring departments to contract for 
a nonrecurring requirement for a noncataloged item. This exception could 
cover a part or component for a prototype which may be stock numbered at 
a later date.
    (2) This exception does not permit acquisitions of recurring 
requirements for an item, based solely on the fact that the item is not 
stock numbered, nor may it be used to acquire items which have only 
slightly different

[[Page 55]]

characteristics than previously cataloged items.
[56 FR 36306, July 31, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 61593, Nov. 30, 1995]


<R05>
208.7004  Procedures.


<R05>
208.7004-1  Purchase authorization from requiring department.

    (a) Requiring departments send their requirements to acquiring 
departments on either a DD Form 448, Military Interdepartmental Purchase 
Request (MIPR), or a DD Form 416, Requisition for Coal, Coke or 
Briquettes. A MIPR or a DD Form 416 is the acquiring department's 
authority to acquire the supplies or services on behalf of the requiring 
department.
    (b) The acquiring department is authorized to create obligations 
against the funds cited in a MIPR without further referral to the 
requiring department. The acquiring department has no responsibility to 
determine the validity of a stated requirement in an approved MIPR, but 
it should bring apparent errors in the requirement to the attention of 
the requiring department.
    (c) Changes that affect the contents of the MIPR must be processed 
as a MIPR amendment regardless of the status of the MIPR. The requiring 
department may initially transmit changes electronically or by some 
other expedited means, but must confirm changes by a MIPR amendment.
    (d) The requiring department must submit requirements for additional 
line items of supplies or services not provided for in the original MIPR 
as a new MIPR. The requiring department may use a MIPR amendment for 
increased quantities only if--
    (1) The original MIPR requirements have not been released for 
solicitation; and
    (2) The acquiring department agrees.


<R05>
208.7004-2  Acceptance by acquiring department.

    (a) Acquiring departments formally accept a MIPR by DD Form 448-2, 
Acceptance of MIPR, as soon as practicable, but no later than 30 days 
after receipt of the MIPR. If the 30 day time limit cannot be met, the 
acquiring department must inform the requiring department of the reason 
for the delay, and the anticipated date the MIPR will be accepted. The 
acquiring department must accept MIPRs in writing before expiration of 
the funds.
    (b) The acquiring department in accepting a MIPR will determine 
whether to use Category I (reimbursable funds citation) or Category II 
(direct funds citation) methods of funding.
    (1) Category I method of funding is used under the following 
circumstances and results in citing the funds of the acquiring 
department in the contract--
    (i) Delivery is from existing inventories of the acquiring 
department;
    (ii) Delivery is by diversion from existing contracts of the 
acquiring department;
    (iii) Production or assembly is through Government work orders in 
Government-owned plants;
    (iv) Production quantities are allocated among users from one or 
more contracts, and the identification of specific quantities of the end 
item to individual contracts is not feasible at the time of MIPR 
acceptance;
    (v) Acquisition of the end items involves separate acquisition of 
components to be assembled by the acquiring department;
    (vi) Payments will be made without reference to deliveries of end 
items (e.g., cost-reimbursement type contracts and fixed price contracts 
with progress payment clauses); or
    (vii) Category II method of funding is not feasible and economical.
    (2) Category II method of funding is used in circumstances other 
than those in paragraph (b)(1) of this subsection. Category II funding 
results in citation of the requiring department's funds and MIPR number 
in the resultant contract.
    (c) When the acquiring departments accepts a MIPR for Category I 
funding--
    (1) The DD Form 448-2, Acceptance of MIPR, is the authority for the 
requiring department to record the obligation of funds;
    (2) The acquiring department will annotate the DD Form 448-2 if 
contingencies, price revisions, or variations in quantities are 
anticipated. The acquiring department will periodically advise the 
requiring department, prior to submission of billings, of any

[[Page 56]]

changes in the acceptance figure so that the requiring department may 
issue an amendment to the MIPR, and the recorded obligation may be 
adjusted to reflect the current price;
    (3) If the acquiring department does not qualify the acceptance of a 
MIPR for anticipated contingencies, the price on the acceptance will be 
final and will be billed at time of delivery;
    (4) Upon receipt of the final billing (SF 1080, Voucher for 
Transferring Funds), the requiring department may adjust the fiscal 
records accordingly without authorization from or notice to the 
acquiring department.
    (d) When the MIPR is accepted for Category II funding, a conformed 
copy of the contract (see 204.802(1)(ii)) is the authority to record the 
obligation. When all awards have been placed to satisfy the total MIPR 
requirement, any unused funds remaining on the MIPR become excess to the 
acquiring department. The acquiring department will immediately notify 
the requiring department of the excess funds by submitting an Acceptance 
of MIPR (DD Form 448-2). This amendment is authorization for the 
requiring department to withdraw the funds. The acquiring department is 
prohibited from further use of such excess funds.
    (e) When the acquiring department requires additional funds to 
complete the contracting action for the requiring department, the 
request for additional funds must identify the exact items involved, and 
the reason why additional funds are required. The requiring department 
shall act quickly to--
    (1) Provide the funds by an amendment of the MIPR; or
    (2) Reduce the requirements.
    (f) The accepting activity of the acquiring department shall remain 
responsible for the MIPR even though that activity may split the MIPR 
into segments for action by other contracting activities.


<R05>
208.7004-3  Use of advance MIPRs.

    (a) An advance MIPR is an unfunded MIPR provided to the acquiring 
department in advance of the funded MIPR so that initial steps in 
planning the contract action can begin at an earlier date.
    (b) In order to use an advance MIPR, the acquiring department and 
the requiring department must agree that its use will be beneficial. The 
departments may execute a blanket agreement to use advance MIPRs.
    (c) The requiring department shall not release an advance MIPR to 
the acquiring department without obtaining proper internal approval of 
the requirement.
    (d) When advance MIPRs are used, mark ``ADVANCE MIPR'' prominently 
on the DD Form 448.
    (e) For urgent requirements, the advance MIPR may be transmitted 
electronically.
    (f) On the basis of an advance MIPR, the acquiring department may 
take the initial steps toward awarding a contract, such as obtaining 
internal coordination and preparing an acquisition plan. Acquiring 
departments may determine the extent of these initial actions but shall 
not award contracts on the basis of advance MIPRs.


<R05>
208.7004-4  Cutoff dates for submission of Category II MIPRs.

    (a) Unless otherwise agreed between the departments, May 31 is the 
cutoff date for the receipt of MIPRs citing expiring appropriations 
which must be obligated by September 30 of that fiscal year. If 
circumstances arise which require the submission of MIPRs citing 
expiring appropriations after the cutoff date, the requiring department 
will communicate with the acquiring department before submission to find 
out whether the acquiring department can execute a contract or otherwise 
obligate the funds by the end of the fiscal year. Acquiring departments 
will make every effort to obligate funds for all such MIPRs accepted 
after the cutoff date. However, acceptance of a late MIPR does not 
constitute assurance by the acquiring department that all such funds 
will be obligated.
    (b) Nothing in these instructions is intended to restrict the 
processing of MIPRs when the acquiring department is capable of 
executing contracts or otherwise obligating funds before the end of the 
fiscal year.
    (c) The May 31 cutoff date does not apply to MIPRs citing continuing 
appropriations.

[[Page 57]]


<R05>
208.7004-5  Notification of inability to obligate on Category II MIPRs.

    On August 1, the acquiring department will advise the requiring 
department of any Category II MIPRs on hand citing expiring 
appropriations they will be unable to obligate prior to the fund 
expiration date. If an unforeseen situation develops after August 1 
which will prevent execution of a contract, the acquiring department 
will notify the requiring department as quickly as possible and return 
the MIPR. The letter of transmittal returning the MIPR will authorize 
purchase by the requiring department and state the reason that the 
acquisition could not be accomplished.


<R05>
208.7004-6  Cancellation of requirements.

    (a) Category I MIPRs. The requiring department will notify the 
acquiring department by electronic or other immediate means when 
cancelling all or part of the supplies or services requested in the 
MIPR. Within 30 days, the acquiring department will notify the requiring 
department of the quantity of items available for termination and the 
amount of funds in excess of the estimated settlement costs. Upon 
receipt of this information, the requiring department will issue a MIPR 
amendment to reduce the quantities and funds accordingly.
    (b) Category II MIPRs. The requiring department will notify the 
acquiring department electronically or by other immediate means when 
cancelling all or any part of the supplies or services requested in the 
MIPR.
    (1) If the acquiring department has not entered into a contract for 
the supplies or services to be cancelled, the acquiring department will 
immediately notify the requiring department. Upon receipt of such 
notification, the requiring department shall initiate a MIPR amendment 
to revoke the estimated amount shown on the original MIPR for the 
cancelled items.
    (2) If the items to be cancelled have already been placed under 
contract--
    (i) As soon as practicable, but in no event more than 45 days after 
receipt of the cancellation notice from the requiring department, the 
contracting officer shall issue a termination data letter to the 
requiring department (original and four copies) containing, as a 
minimum, the information in Table 8-1, Termination Data Letter.
    (ii) The termination contracting officer (TCO) will review the 
proceedings at least every 60 days to reassess the Government's probable 
obligation. If any additional funds are excess to the probable 
settlement requirements, or if it appears that previous release of 
excess funds will result in a shortage of the amount which will be 
required for settlement, the TCO will promptly notify the contracting 
office which will amend the termination data letter. The requiring 
department will process a MIPR amendment to reflect the reinstatement of 
funds within 30 days after receiving the amended termination data 
letter.
    (iii) Upon receipt of a copy of the termination settlement 
agreement, the requiring department will prepare a MIPR amendment, if 
required, to remove any remaining excess funds.

                   Table 8-1, Termination Data Letter

  (a) As termination action is now in progress on the above contract,   
 the following information is submitted:                                
  (1) Brief Description of items terminated.                            
  (2) You are notified that the sum of $________ is available for       
 release under the subject contract. This sum represents the difference 
 between $________, the value of items terminated under the contract,   
 and $________, estimated to be required for settlement of the          
 terminated contract. The estimated amount available for release is     
 allocated by the appropriations cited on the contract as follows:      
  MIPR NO. ________ ACCOUNTING CLASSIFICATION ________ AMOUNT ________  
  Total available for release at this time $________                    
  (b) Request you forward an amendment to MIPR ________ on DD Form 448-2
 to reflect the reduced quantity and amount of funds available for      
 release.                                                               
  (c) Periodic reviews (not less than 60 days) will be made as          
 termination proceedings progress to redetermine the Government's       
 probable obligation.

<R05>
208.7004-7  Termination for default.

    (a) When the acquiring department terminates a contract for default, 
they will ask the requiring department if the supplies or services to be 
terminated are still required so that repurchase action can be started.
    (b) The requiring department will not deobligate funds on a contract 
terminated for default until receipt of a settlement modification or 
other written evidence from the acquiring department authorizing release 
of funds.
    (c) On the repurchase action, the acquiring department will not 
exceed the unliquidated funds on the defaulted contract without 
receiving additional funds from the requiring department.


<R05>
208.7004-8  Transportation funding.

    The requiring department will advise the acquiring department or the 
transportation officer in the contract administration office of the fund 
account to be charged for transportation costs. The requiring department 
may cite the fund account on each MIPR or provide the funding cite to 
the transportation officer at the beginning of each fiscal year for use 
on Government bills of lading. When issuing a Government bill of lading, 
show the requiring department as the department to be billed and cite 
the appropriate fund account.


<R05>
208.7004-9  Status reporting.

    (a) The acquiring department will maintain a system of MIPR follow 
up to inform the requiring department of the current status of its 
requests. In addition, the contract administration office will maintain 
a system of follow up in order to advise the acquiring department on 
contract performance.
    (b) If requested by the requiring department, the acquiring 
department will furnish the requiring department a copy of the 
solicitation when the MIPR is satisfied through Category II funding.
    (c) Any reimbursement billings, shipping document, contractual 
documents, project orders, or related documentation furnished to the 
requiring department will identify the requiring department's MIPR 
number, quantities of items, and funding information.


<R05>
208.7004-10  Administrative costs.

    The acquiring department bears the administrative costs of acquiring 
supplies for the requiring department. However, when an acquisition 
responsibility is transferred to another department, funds appropriated 
or to be appropriated for administrative costs will transfer to the 
successor acquiring department. The new acquiring department must assume 
budget cognizance as soon as possible.


<R05>
208.7005  MIPRs.

                          Administration (NASA)


<R05>
208.7100  Authorization.

    NASA is authorized by Public Law 85-568 to use the acquisition 
services, personnel, equipment, and facilities of DoD departments and 
agencies with their consent, with or without reimbursement, and on a 
similar basis to cooperate with the departments/agencies in the use of 
acquisition services, equipment, and facilities.


<R05>
208.7101  Policy.

    Departments and agencies will--
    (a) Cooperate fully with NASA in making acquisition services, 
equipment, personnel, and facilities available on the basis of mutual 
agreement.
    (b) Not claim reimbursement for administrative costs incident to 
acquisitions for NASA, unless agreed otherwise prior to the time 
services are performed.


<R05>
208.7102  Procedures.

    (a) When contracting or performing field service functions for NASA, 
the departments and agencies will use

[[Page 59]]

their own methods, except when otherwise required by the terms of the 
agreement.
    (b) Departments and agencies normally will use their own funds when 
contracting for or performing services for NASA and will not cite NASA 
funds on any defense obligation or payment document.


<R05>
208.7103  Purchase request and acceptance.

    (a) NASA will use NASA Form 523, NASA-Defense Purchase Request, to 
request acquisition of supplies or services.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, departments 
and agencies will respond within 30 days to a NASA purchase request by 
forwarding DD Form 448-2, Acceptance of MIPR. Forward each DD Form 448-2 
in quadruplicate and indicate action status as well as the name and 
address of the DoD acquisition activity for future use by the NASA 
initiator.
    (c) To the extent feasible, all documents related to the NASA action 
will reference the NASA-Defense Purchase Request number and the item 
number when appropriate.
    (d) Departments and agencies are not required to accept NASA-Defense 
Purchase Requests for common-use standard stock items which the 
supplying department has on hand or on order for prompt delivery at 
published prices.


<R05>
208.7104  Changes in estimated total prices.

    When a department or agency determines that the estimated total 
price (Block 6F, NASA Form 523) for NASA items is not sufficient to 
cover the required reimbursement, or is in excess of the amount 
required, the department/agency will forward a request for amendment to 
the NASA originating office. Indicate in the request a specific dollar 
amount, rather than a percentage, and include justification for any 
upward adjustment requested. Upon approval of a request, NASA will 
forward an amendment of its purchase request to the contracting 
activity.


<R05>
208.7105  Payments.

    Departments and agencies will submit SF 1080, Voucher for 
Transferring Funds, billings to the NASA office designated in Block 9 of 
the NASA-Defense Purchase Request, except where agreements provide that 
reimbursement is not required. Departments and agencies will support 
billings in the same manner as billings between departments and 
agencies.

Planning. Planning

[[Page 60]]

is conducted only with U.S. or Canadian sources.
    (c) The use of privately-owned facilities is preferred to minimize 
the need for Government investment. Departments and agencies will 
include Government-owned production facilities in the industrial base 
only when--
    (1) Private industry is unable to provide the facilities necessary 
to support DoD requirements; or
    (2) The facilities are necessary--
    (i) For reasons of national security; or
    (ii) To ensure a quick response capability to meet fluctuating 
demands.

         Subpart 208.73--Use of Government-Owned Precious Metals


<R05>
208.7301  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart--
    Defense Industrial Supply Center (DISC) means the Defense Logistics 
Agency field activity located at 700 Robbins Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 
19111-5096, which is the assigned commodity integrated material manager 
for refined precious metals and is responsible for the storage and issue 
of such material.
    Dual pricing evaluation procedure means a procedure where offerors 
submit two prices for precious metals bearing items--one based on 
Government-furnished precious metals and one based on contractor-
furnished precious metals. The contracting officer evaluates the prices 
to determine which is in the Government's best interest.
    Precious Metals Indicator Code (PMIC) means a single digit, alpha-
numeric code assigned to national stock numbered items in The Defense 
Integrated Data System Total Item Record used to indicate the presence 
or absence of precious metals in the item. PMICs and the content value 
of corresponding items are listed in DoDD 4100.39M, Defense Integrated 
Data System (DIDS) Procedures Manual, chapter 10, Table 160.
    Refined precious metal means recovered silver, gold, platinum, 
palladium, iridium, rhodium, or ruthenium, in bullion, granulation or 
sponge form, which has been purified to at least .999 percentage of 
fineness.


<R05>
208.7302  Policy.

    DoD policy is for maximum participation in the Precious Metals 
Recovery Program (PMRP). DoD components shall furnish recovered precious 
metals contained in the DISC inventory to production contractors rather 
than use contractor-furnished precious metals whenever the contracting 
officer determines it to be in the Government's best

[[Page 61]]

interest. (See DoDD 4160.22, Recovery and Utilization of Precious 
Metals.)


<R05>
208.7303  Procedures.

    (a) Item managers and contracting officers will use the PMIC and/or 
other relevant data furnished with a purchase request to determine the 
applicability of this subpart.
    (b) When an offeror advises of a precious metals requirement, the 
contracting officer shall use the procedures in chapter X of DoD 
4160.21-M, Defense Utilization and Disposal Manual, to determine 
availability of required precious metal assets and current government-
furnished materiel (GFM) unit prices. If the precious metals are 
available, the contracting officer shall evaluate offers and award the 
contract on the basis of the offer which is in the best interest of the 
Government.
    (c) When the clause prescribed by 208.7305 is included in a 
solicitation, the contracting officer will ensure that section B, 
Schedule of Supplies or Services and Prices, is structured to--
    (1) Permit insertion of alternate prices for each deliverable 
contract line item number that uses precious metals; and
    (2) Use dual pricing evaluation procedures.


<R05>
208.7304  Refined precious metals.

    The following refined precious metals are currently managed by DISC:

<R05>
208.7305  Contract clause.

    (a) Use the clause at 252.208-7000, Intent to Furnish Precious 
Metals as Government-Furnished Material, in all solicitations and 
contracts except--
    (1) When the contracting officer has determined that the required 
precious metals are not available from DISC;
    (2) When the contracting officer knows that the items being acquired 
do not require precious metals in their manufacture; or
    (3) For acquisitions below the small purchase threshold in FAR 
13.000.
    (b) To make the determination in paragraph (a)(1) of this section,

           Subpart 209.1--Responsible Prospective Contractors


<R05>
209.101  Definitions.

    ``Entity controlled by a foreign government,'' ``foreign 
government,'' and ``proscribed information,'' are defined in the 
provision at 252.209-7002, Disclosure of Ownership or Control by a 
Foreign Government.
[59 FR 51132, Oct. 7, 1994]


<R05>
209.103  Policy.

    (a)(i) Do not deny award to contractors subject to on-site 
inspection under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, or 
similar treaty, due to the actual or potential presence of Soviet 
inspectors at the contractor's facility unless--
    (A) Necessary for reasons of national security;
    (B) The decision is based on full information, including comment 
from the potential contractor or subcontractor on the security issues 
involved; and
    (C) The department or agency acquisition executive reviews the 
decision and the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition & Technology) 
approves the decision.
    (ii) Make any decision to deny consideration for award under 
paragraph (a)(i) of this section as early as possible in the acquisition 
process. Notify the firm in writing of any decision not to consider the 
firm for award of a contract or subcontract.
    (c) The additional cost of contract administration and audit due to 
a contractor's performance risk may be considered in evaluating the 
contractor's price.

    Use the clause at 252.209-7000, Acquisition from Subcontractors 
Subject to On-Site Inspection Under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear

[60 FR 61593, Nov. 30, 1995, as amended at 61 FR 50452, Sept. 26, 1996]


<R05>
209.104  Standards.


<R05>
209.104-1  General standards.

    (e) For cost-reimbursement or incentive type contracts, or contracts 
which provide for progress payments based on costs or on a percentage or 
stage of completion, the prospective contractor's accounting system and 
related internal controls must provide reasonable assurance that--
    (i) Applicable laws and regulations are complied with;
    (ii) The accounting system and cost data are reliable;
    (iii) Risk of misallocations and mischarges are minimized; and
    (iv) Contract allocations and charges are consistent with invoice 
procedures.
    (g)(i) Ownership or control by the government of a terrorist 
country. (A) Under 10 U.S.C. 2327(b), a contracting officer shall not 
award a contract to a firm or to a subsidiary of a firm when a foreign 
government--
    (1) Either directly or indirectly, has a significant interest--
    (i) In the firm; or
    (ii) In the subsidiary; and
    (2) Has been determined by the Secretary of State under 50 U.S.C. 
App. 2405(j)(1)(A) to be a government of a country that has repeatedly 
provided support for acts of international terrorism.
    (B) The Secretary of Defense may waive the prohibition in paragraph 
(g)(i)(A) of this subsection in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2327(c). This 
waiver authority may not be delegated.
    (ii) Ownership or control by a foreign government when access to 
proscribed information is required to perform the contract. (A) Under 10 
U.S.C. 2536(a), no DoD contract under a national security program may be 
awarded to an entity controlled by a foreign government if that entity 
requires access to proscribed information to perform the contract.
    (B) Whenever the contracting officer has a question about 
application of the provision at 252.209-7002, the contracting officer 
may seek advice from the Director, Defense Security Programs, Office of 
the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications 
and Intelligence.

[[Page 63]]

    (C) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2536(b)(1)(A), the Secretary of 
Defense may waive the prohibition in paragraph (g)(ii)(A) of this 
subsection upon determining that the waiver is essential to the national 
security interest of the United States. The Secretary has delegated 
authority to grant this waiver to the Assistant Secretary of Defense 
Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence. Waiver requests, 
prepared by the requiring activity in coordination with the contracting 
officer, shall be processed through the Director of Defense Procurement, 
Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition & Technology), and 
shall include a proposed national interest determination. The proposed 
national interest determination, prepared by the requiring activity in 
coordination with the contracting officer, shall include:
    (1) Identification of the proposed awardee, with a synopsis of its 
foreign ownership (include solicitation and other reference numbers to 
identify the action);
    (2) General description of the acquisition and performance 
requirements;
    (3) Identification of the national security interests involved and 
the ways award of the contract helps advance those interests;
    (4) The availability of another entity with the capacity, capability 
and technical expertise to satisfy defense acquisition, technology base, 
or industrial base requirements; and
    (5) A description of any alternate means available to satisfy the 
requirement, e.g., use of substitute products or technology or alternate 
approaches to accomplish the program objectives.
    (D) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2536(b)(1)(B), the Secretary of 
Defense may, in the case of a contract awarded for environmental 
restoration, remediation, or waste management at a DoD facility, waive 
the prohibition in paragraph (g)(ii)(A) of this subsection upon--
    (1) Determining that--
    (i) The waiver will advance the environmental restoration, 
remediation, or waste management objectives of DoD and will not harm the 
national security interests of the United States; and
    (ii) The entity to which the contract is awarded is controlled by a 
foreign government with which the Secretary is authorized to exchange 
Restricted Data under section 144c. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 
U.S.C. 2164(c)); and
    (2) Notifying Congress of the decision to grant the waiver. The 
contract may be awarded only after the end of the 45-day period 
beginning on the date the notification is received by the appropriate 
Congressional committees.

<R05>
209.104-4  Subcontractor responsibility.

    Generally, the Canadian Commercial Corporation's (CCC) proposal of a 
firm as its subcontractor is sufficient basis for an affirmative 
determination of responsibility. However, when the CCC determination of 
responsibility is not consistent with other information available to the 
contracting officer, the contracting officer shall request from CCC and 
any other sources whatever additional information is necessary to make 
the responsibility determination.


<R05>
209.104-70  Solicitation provisions.

    (a) Use the provision at 252.209-7001, Disclosure of Ownership or 
Control by the Government of a Terrorist Country, in all solicitations 
expected to result in contracts of $100,000 or more.
    (b) Use the provision at 252.209-7002, Disclosure of Ownership or 
Control by a Foreign Government, in all solicitations, including those 
subject to the procedures in FAR part 13, when access to proscribed 
information is necessary to perform a DoD contract under a national 
security program.

209.106  Preaward surveys.


<R05>
209.106-1  Conditions for preaward surveys.

    (a) If a preaward survey is requested, include the rationale in 
block 23 of the SF 1403, Preaward Survey of Prospective Contractor 
(General).
[60 FR 61593, Nov. 30, 1995]

[[Page 64]]


<R05>
209.106-2  Requests for preaward surveys.

    (1) The surveying activity is the cognizant contract administration 
office as listed in DLAH 4105.4, DoD Directory of Contract 
Administration Services Components. When information is required as part 
of the survey on the adequacy of the contractor's accounting system or 
its suitability for administration of the proposed type of contract, the 
surveying activity will obtain the information from the auditor.
    (2) Limited information may be requested by telephone.
    (3) The contracting officer may request a formal survey by telephone 
but must confirm immediately with SF 1403, Preaward Survey of 
Prospective Contractor (General). For a formal survey, send original and 
three copies of SF 1403, including necessary drawings and 
specifications.
    (a) List additional factors in item H, section III of the SF 1403 
and explain them in block 23. For example--
    (i) Information needed to determine a prospective contractor's 
eligibility under the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act. (Note that the 
Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act, block 12 of section I, only indicates 
what the contractor has represented its classification to be under 
Walsh-Healey.)
    (ii) Evaluation of a contractor as a planned producer when the 
offered item is or may appear on the Industrial Preparedness Planning 
List (IPPL). When the preaward survey results in a recommendation for 
award, ask the office responsible for industrial preparedness planning 
to consider designating the prospective contractor as a planned 
producer. If the item is already on the IPPL or the prospective 
contractor is already a planned producer, note the information in block 
23.
    (iii) Evaluation of the prospective contractor's performance against 
small business subcontracting plans.
    (c) On base level preaward surveys, technical personnel from the 
requiring installation should participate when there is concern about 
the ability of a prospective contractor to perform a base level service 
or construction contract.
    (d) Allow more time for--
    (i) Complex items;
    (ii) New or inexperienced DoD contractors; and
    (iii) Surveys with time-consuming requirements, e.g., secondary 
survey, accounting system review, financial capability analysis, or 
purchasing office participation.
    (e) Only request those factors essential to the determination of 
responsibility. See 253.209-1(a) for an explanation of the factors in 
section III, blocks 19 and 20 of the SF 1403.

               Subpart 209.2--Qualifications Requirements


<R05>
209.202  Policy.

    (a)(1) The inclusion of qualification requirements in specifications 
for products which are to be included on a Qualified Products List, or 
manufactured by business firms included on a Qualified Manufacturers 
List, requires approval by the departmental standardization office in 
accordance with DoD Manual 4120.3-M, Defense Standardization Program 
Policies and Procedures. The inclusion of other qualification 
requirements in an acquisition or group of acquisitions requires 
approval by the chief of the contracting office.

    (d) The contracting officer may require that first articles be 
manufactured using the same facilities, production processes, methods, 
and materials to be used for production units under the contract.


<R05>
209.305  Risk.

    The contracting officer may give this authorization to a contractor 
only after approval by a level higher than the contracting officer.


<R05>
209.306  Solicitation requirements.

    (a)(1) To be sure that the contractor and the Government clearly 
understand and interpret contract terms and conditions in the same 
manner, avoid

[[Page 65]]

describing first article requirements exclusively in general terms such 
as ``visual,'' ``dimensional,'' ``workmanship,'' or ``specification 
compliance.''

209.308  Contract clauses.

    Alternate I of the clauses at FAR 52.209-3, First Article Approval--
Contractor Testing, or 52.209-4, First Article Approval--Government 
Testing, as appropriate, may be used when--
    (1) The form, fit, or function of the product would be adversely 
affected by contractor changes in the production facilities, processes, 
methods, or materials subsequent to first article approval; and
    (2) The Government has relied upon first article testing in the 
absence of complete design specifications to supplement a performance 
specification; or
    (3) It is essential to have an approved first article to serve as a 
manufacturing standard.


<R04>
         Subpart 209.4--Debarment, Suspension, and Ineligibility


<R05>
209.402  Policy.

    (d) The uniform suspension and debarment procedures to be followed 
by all debarring and suspending officials are set out in appendix H to

<R05>
209.405  Effect of listing.

    Under 10 U.S.C. 2393b, when a department or agency determines that a 
compelling reason exists for it to conduct business with a contractor

    (a)(i) When the debarring official decides that debarment is not 
necessary, the official may require the contractor to enter into a 
written agreement which includes--
    (A) A requirement for the contractor to establish, if not already 
established, and to maintain the standards of conduct and internal

official must determine that the contractor has addressed adequately the 
circumstances that gave rise to the misconduct, and that appropriate 
standards of ethics and integrity are in place and are working.

209.470-1  Policy.

    (a)(1) Section 558 of the National Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 1995 (Public Law 103-337) provides that no funds available 
to DoD may be provided by grant or contract to any institution of higher 
education that has a policy of denying or that effectively prevents the 
Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military recruiting purposes--
    (i) Entry to campuses or access to students on campuses; or
    (ii) Access to directory information pertaining to students.
    (2) Section 541 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 1996 (10 U.S.C. 983) provides that no funds appropriated or 
otherwise available to DoD may be obligated by contract or by grant, 
including a grant of funds to be available for student aid, to any 
institution of higher education that, as determined by the Secretary of 
Defense, has an anti-ROTC policy and at which, as determined by the 
Secretary, the Secretary would otherwise maintain or seek to establish a 
unit of the Senior Reserve Officer Training Corps, or at which the 
Secretary would otherwise enroll or seek to enroll students for 
participation in a unit of the Senior Reserve Officer Training Corps at 
another nearby institution of higher education. This prohibition applies 
to new contracts and all contract modifications. (See 243.105.) This 
prohibition shall cease to apply to that institution upon a 
determination by the Secretary that the institution no longer has an 
anti-ROTC policy.
    (b) Institutions of higher education that are determined under 32

215.605  Evaluation factors and subfactors.

    (b)(2)(A) In acquisitions which require use of the clause at FAR 
52.219-9, Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business 
Subcontracting Plan, the extent of participation of small and small 
disadvantaged business in performance of the contact shall be addressed 
in source selection.
    (1) For acquisitions other than those based only on cost or price 
competition, the contracting officer shall evaluate the extent to which 
offerors identify and commit to small business and to small 
disadvantaged business,

[[Page 79]]

historically black college and university, or minority institution 
performance of the contract, whether as a joint venture, teaming 
arrangement, or subcontractor.
    (2) Criteria for evaluation may include--
    (i) The extent which such firms are specifically identified in 
proposals;
    (ii) The extent of commitment to use such firms (for example, 
enforceable commitments are to be weighted more heavily than non-
enforceable ones);
    (iii) The complexity and variety of the work small firms are to 
perform;
    (iv) The realism of the proposal;
    (v) When not otherwise required by 215.608(a)(2), past performance 
of the offerors in complying with requirements of the clauses at FAR 
52.219-8, Utilization of Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned 
Small Business Concerns, and 52.219-9, Small, Small Disadvantaged and 
Women-Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan; and
    (vi) The extent of participation of such firms in terms of the value 
of the total acquisition.
    (3) Proposals addressing the extent of small and small disadvantaged 
business performance may be separate from subcontracting plans submitted 
pursuant to the clause at FAR 52.219-9 and should be structured to allow 
for consideration of offers from small businesses.
    (4) When an evaluation includes the criterion in paragraph 
(b)(2)(A)(2)(i) of this section, the small, small disadvantaged, or 
women-owned small businesses considered in the evaluation shall be 
listed in any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to FAR 52.219-9 to 
facilitate compliance with 252.219-7003(g).
    (B) The costs or savings related to contract administration and 
audit may be considered when the offeror's past performance or 
performance risk is likely to result in significant costs or savings.
    (c) In competitive acquisitions of services--
    (i) Evaluation and award should be based, to the maximum extent 
practicable, on best overall value to the Government in terms of quality 
and other factors.
    (ii) The weighting of costs must be commensurate with the nature of 
the services being acquired.
    (A) It may be appropriate to award to an offeror, based on technical 
and quality considerations, at other than the lowest price when--
    (1) The effort being contracted for departs from clearly defined 
efforts; or
    (2) Highly skilled personnel are required.
    (B) It may be appropriate to award to the technically acceptable 
offeror with the lowest price when--
    (1) Services being acquired are of a routine or simple nature;
    (2) Highly skilled personnel are not required; or
    (3) The product to be delivered is clearly defined at the outset of 
the acquisition.

uncompensated overtime in contracts to acquire services on the basis of 
the number of hours provided (see 237.170) will not degrade the level of 
technical expertise required to fulfill the Government's requirements. 
When acquiring such services, contracting officers shall conduct a risk 
assessment, and evaluate for award on that basis, any proposals received 
that reflect factors such as--
    (i) Unrealistically low labor rates or other costs that may result 
in quality or service shortfalls; and
    (ii) Unbalanced distribution of uncompensated overtime among skill 
levels and its use in key technical positions.
    (2) When a past performance evaluation is required by FAR 15.605, 
and the solicitation includes the clause at FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of 
Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned

[[Page 80]]

Small Business Concerns, the evaluation shall include the past 
performance of offerors in complying with requirements of that clause. 
When a past performance evaluation is required by FAR 15.605, and the 
solicitation includes the clause at FAR 52.219-9, Small, Small 
Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan, the 
evaluation shall include the past performance of offerors in complying 
with requirements of that clause.
    (b) Except for determinations based on violations or possible 
violations of section 27 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy 
(OFPP) Act, and unless otherwise specified in department/agency 
regulations, the contracting officer shall make the written 
determination. Determinations based on violations or possible violations 
of Section 27 of the OFPP Act shall be made as specified in FAR 3.104.

<R05>
215.611  Best and final offers.

    (c)(i) Before requesting an additional (second or subsequent) best 
and final offer, the contracting officer shall obtain approval from--
    (A) The source selection authority and the senior procurement 
executive (SPE) for competitive negotiated acquisitions under formal 
source selection (see FAR 15.612). The SPE may delegate this authority 
to a level no lower than the head of the contracting activity.
    (B) The head of the contracting activity (HCA) for all other 
competitive negotiated acquisitions. The HCA may delegate this authority 
to the chief of the contracting office.
    (ii) Each HCA shall establish a system for reporting and documenting 
additional requests for best and final offers. Systems shall include as 
a minimum--
    (A) The total number of competitive negotiated acquisitions awarded;
    (B) The number of those acquisitions for which an additional request 
for best and final offers was approved and issued; and
    (C) The reasons for approving each additional request for best and 
final offers.
    (iii) To ensure that additional requests for best and final offers 
are used only when necessary and unavoidable, HCAs shall--
    (A) Periodically analyze data collected under paragraph (c)(ii) of 
this section;
    (B) Take appropriate corrective action, e.g., training, revising 
approval levels; and
    (C) Provide periodic summary reports to the SPE as specified in 
department/agency regulations.


<R05>
215.613  Alternate source selection procedures.


<R05>
215.613-70  Four-step source selection procedures.

    (a) General. The four-step source selection procedure is designed 
for those situations where the Government wishes to focus on technical 
excellence. Proposals are evaluated, a competitive range established, 
and an apparent successful offeror selected without discussions of 
proposal deficiencies (a deficiency is defined as that part of an 
offeror's proposal which would not satisfy the Government's 
requirements). Negotiations are conducted only in the final step and 
only with the apparent successful offeror.
    (b) Applicability. Four-step source selection procedures may be used 
for--
    (1) Competitively negotiated research and development acquisitions 
with an estimated value of $2 million or more; or
    (2) Other acquisitions as permitted by department/agency 
regulations, except those in paragraph (c) of this subsection.
    (c) Restrictions. Four-step source selection procedures shall not be 
used for acquisitions which--
    (1) Will require extensive discussion and negotiations;
    (2) Use the authority of FAR 6.302-2;
    (3) Are solely for personal or nonpersonal services;
    (4) Are for architect-engineer services; or
    (5) Have an estimated value of less than $2 million.
    (d) Presolicitation. Establish early and open dialogue with 
prospective offerors

[[Page 81]]

to ensure their understanding of the Government's needs, since the 
evaluation will be conducted with limited discussions and without 
disclosing deficiencies in offeror proposals. Ways of establishing this 
dialogue are--
    (1) Presolicitation notices;
    (2) Presolicitation conferences;
    (3) Preproposal conferences;
    (4) Solicitations for information or planning purposes; and
    (5) Tailoring of specifications.
    (e) Solicitations. Include the following special provisions in four-
step source selection solicitations--
    (1) Explanation of the four-step concept and procedures;
    (2) Statement regarding the relative importance of technical/system 
performance criteria;
    (3) Notification that the contracting officer may reject proposals 
with unrealistic technical, schedule, cost, or price commitments since 
unrealistic commitments reflect an inherent lack of technical competence 
or indicate a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the 
requirements;
    (4) Schedule of planned source selection events, including specific 
dates for the sequential submission of separate technical and cost 
proposal.
    (5) Requirement for the technical proposal to include--
    (i) Identification, when appropriate, of trade-offs (with 
illustrative cost estimate impacts) among performance, production costs, 
operating and support costs, schedule and logistics support factors; and
    (ii) Information showing that the goals for design to cost and 
operating and support costs (when used) will be achieved when the item 
enters production.
    (6) Requirement for the cost proposal to include detailed cost 
information supporting the technical proposal and the cost factors in 
the evaluation criteria;
    (7) Statement that both technical and cost discussions will be 
limited as described in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this subsection; and
    (8) Notification that the contracting officer will only negotiate 
with the selected offeror, and that offerors' initial technical and cost 
proposals should be their best offer.
    (f) Step one--evaluation of technical proposals. (1) The sequence of 
step one--
    (i) Evaluate all technical proposals;
    (ii) Conduct limited discussions with all offerors; and
    (iii) Ask for any necessary clarifications and additional supporting 
data when necessary (normally, ask that this be submitted with the cost 
proposal).
    (2) In conducting step one--
    (i) Limit discussions to only what is necessary to ensure that both 
parties understand each other;
    (ii) Do not tell offerors about deficiencies in their proposals; and
    (iii) Provide written clarification to all offerors when it appears 
the Government's requirements have been misinterpreted.
    (g) Step two--evaluation of cost proposals. (1) The sequence of step 
two--
    (i) Request cost proposals;
    (ii) Evaluate all cost proposals;
    (iii) Establish the competitive range;
    (iv) Eliminate those proposals outside the range and advise those 
offerors;
    (v) Conduct limited discussions with remaining offerors; and
    (vi) Eliminate proposals which cannot be made acceptable and advise 
the offerors.
    (2) In conducting step two--
    (i) Limit discussions to--
    (A) Clarifying inconsistencies or correcting mathematical errors;
    (B) Correlating cost elements with technical effort in order to 
assess cost realism; and
    (C) Ensuring a complete understanding of the Government's 
requirements, the offeror's offer, and other contract terms;
    (ii) Do not tell an offeror that any of its cost elements are either 
too high or too low; and
    (iii) Follow the guidelines in paragraph (f) of this subsection if 
further discussions of technical proposals or clarifications are 
required.
    (h) Step three--common cut-off and selection of an offeror for final 
contract negotiations. (1) The sequence of step three--
    (i) Notify offerors of the common cut-off date for receipt of best 
and final offers (technical and cost);
    (ii) Evaluate the offers;

[[Page 82]]

    (iii) Select the best offeror (see paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this 
subsection for multiple sources);
    (iv) Tell the selected source that the decision is conditional based 
on negotiation of a definitive contract within the time period 
prescribed by the source selection authority; and
    (v) Advise the other offerors of the source selected.
    (2) In conducting step three--
    (i) Remind offerors, when notifying them of the common cut-off date, 
that any changes incorporated in the final proposal must be fully 
documented;
    (ii) Do not accept lump sum reductions in final cost proposals 
without supporting data;
    (iii) Do not request additional best and final offers without the 
approval required by 215.611(c); and
    (iv) Do not select two or more offerors, rather than a single 
source, for final contract negotiations, unless the HCA makes a written 
determination that final selection of a single source should not be made 
until the prospective contracts have been tentatively negotiated.
    (i) Step four--final negotiations and contract award. (1) The 
sequence of step four (single selectee)--
    (i) Negotiate the final contract price, terms, and conditions; and
    (ii) Award the contract.
    (2) The sequence of step four (multiple selectees)--
    (i) Negotiate tentative final contract terms and conditions;
    (ii) Select the best source; and
    (iii) Award.
    (3) In conducting step four--
    (i) Complete negotiations and award the contract within the time 
prescribed by the source selection authority;
    (ii) Terminate negotiations and make a new source selection decision 
if the condition in paragraph (i)(3)(i) cannot be met;
    (iii) Do not permit changes in the Government's requirements or the 
offeror's proposal which would affect the source selection decision; and
    (iv) Follow the procedures in FAR 15.606 if changes in the 
Government's requirements are necessary.

<R05>
215.804-1  Prohibition on obtaining cost or pricing data.

    (b) Standards for exceptions from cost or pricing data 
requirements--(1) Adequate price competition. (A) An example of a price 
``based on'' adequate price competition is exercise of a priced option 
in a contract where adequate price competition existed, if the 
contracting officer has determined that the option price is reasonable 
in accordance with FAR 17.207(d);
    (B) Dual or multiple source programs.
    (1) In dual or multiple source programs, the determination of 
adequate price competition must be made on a case-by-case basis. 
Contracting officers must exercise deliberation and thorough review in 
making the determination. Even when adequate price competition exists, 
in certain cases it may be appropriate to obtain additional information 
to assist in price analysis.
    (2) Adequate price competition normally exists when--
    (i) Prices are solicited across a full range of step quantities, 
normally including a 0-100 percent split, from at least two offerors 
that are individually capable of producing the full quantity; and
    (ii) The reasonableness of all prices awarded is clearly established 
on the basis of price analysis (see FAR 15.805-2).
    (4) Exceptional cases.
    (A) The DoD has exempted the Canadian Commercial Corporation and its 
subcontractors from submission and certification of cost or pricing data 
on all acquisitions.

[[Page 83]]

    (B) The DoD has waived certain cost or pricing data requirements for 
nonprofit organizations (including educational institutions) on cost-
reimbursement-no-fee contracts. The contracting officer shall require--
    (1) Submission of information other than cost or pricing data to the 
extent necessary to determine price reasonableness and cost realism; and
    (2) Cost or pricing data from subcontractors that are not nonprofit 
organizations.

215.804-6  Procedural requirements.

    (b)(1)(A) When the solicitation requires contractor compliance with 
the Contractor Cost Data Reporting (CCDR) System (Army--AMCP 715-8, 
Navy--NAV PUB P-5241, and Air Force--AFMCP 800-15), require the 
contractor to submit DD Forms 1921 or 1921-1 with its SF 1411.
    (B) Contracting offices may develop contract pricing proposal 
supporting schedules for use by offerors in providing supporting data 
for the SF 1411. Schedules should only ask for data that are necessary 
and reasonable based on industry, company, or commodity practices.
[56 FR 36326, July 31, 1991, as amended at 59 FR 27669, May 27, 1994; 62 
FR 40472, July 29, 1997]


<R05>
215.804-7  Defective cost or pricing data.

    (b)(2) Unless there is clear evidence to the contrary, the 
contracting officer may presume the defective data were relied on and 
resulted in a contract price increase equal to the amount of the defect 
plus related overhead and profit or fee. The contracting officer is not 
expected to reconstruct the negotiation by speculating as to what would 
have been the mental attitudes of the negotiating parties if the 
nondefective data had been known.


<R05>
215.804-8  Contract clauses.

    If the solicitation or contract includes one of the clauses at FAR 
52.215-23, FAR 52.215-24, or FAR 52.215-25, also use the clause at 
252.215-7000, Pricing Adjustments.

<R05>
215.805-5  Field pricing support.

    (a)(1)(A) Contracting officers shall request field pricing reports 
for--
    (1) Fixed-price proposals exceeding the cost or pricing data 
threshold at FAR 15.804-2(a)(1);
    (2) Cost-type proposals exceeding the cost or pricing data threshold 
at FAR 15.804-2(a) (1) from offerors with significant estimating system 
deficiencies (see 215.811-70(a)(3) and (c)(2)(i); or
    (B) Contracting officers may, with adequate written justification, 
waive the requirement for these reports.
    (2)(A) The contract administration office price/cost analyst 
supports the administrative contracting officer in preparing a complete 
and accurate field pricing report for the contracting officer. The 
analyst--
    (1) In concert with the auditor and in consideration of the 
auditor's workload, establishes a deadline for the auditor's input, 
subject to adjustments when considered necessary;
    (2) Identifies areas for special consideration;
    (3) Arranges for exchanges of technical and audit information; and
    (4) Must be fully responsive to a request for technical information 
from the auditor.
    (B) The pricing report--
    (1) Details the price/cost analyst's comprehensive review and 
evaluation of the proposal;
    (2) Includes information specifically requested by the contracting 
officer; and
    (3) Summarizes what was analyzed, how it was analyzed, and the 
conclusions reached.
    (c)(i) In requesting field pricing support--
    (A) Mark all requests ``FIELD PRICING REQUEST'' in bold letters on 
the mailing envelope;
    (B) On urgent requests, provide facsimile numbers to facilitate 
return of the completed report; and
    (C) Send an advance copy to the audit activity.
    (ii) When the contracting officer knows in advance that field 
pricing support will be required, the contracting officer may request 
field pricing

[[Page 84]]

support before the offeror submits a proposal.
    (A) Give the administrative contracting officer (ACO) and auditor a 
copy of the solicitation;
    (B) Tell them when to expect the proposal; and
    (C) Tell the offeror to provide the ACO and auditor copies of the 
proposal.
    (iii) Where audit reports are received on contracting actions that 
are subsequently cancelled or unsuccessful, notify the cognizant auditor 
in writing.
    (iv) For spare parts or support equipment, identify all line items 
where the proposed price exceeds by 25 percent or more the lowest price 
the Government has paid within the most recent 12-month period. The 
field pricing report will include, as a minimum--
    (A) A detailed analysis of each line item identified by the 
contracting officer in the request;
    (B) A detailed analysis of those line items where a comparison of 
the item description and the proposed price indicates a potential for 
overpricing;
    (C) An analysis of the significant high-dollar-value items. If there 
are no obvious high-dollar-value items, include an analysis of a random 
sample of items; and
    (D) An analysis of a random sample of the remaining low-dollar value 
items. Sample size may be determined by subjective judgment, e.g., 
experience with the contractor and reliability of its estimating and 
accounting systems.
    (v) For spare parts proposals that have been identified as Spares 
Acquisition Integrated with Production (SAIP) items (see DoD Instruction 
4245.12, Spares Acquisition Integrated with Production (SAIP))--
    (A) Include a copy of the data entitled ``Contractor's Procurement 
Schedule for SAIP'' (Data Item DI-V-7200), or equivalent, in the request 
so that the benefits of combining new and in process quantities can be 
assured (these data are delivered by the contractor on contracts that 
include SAIP requirements); or
    (B) Require the contractor to include these data in its proposal.
    (e)(6) The contract administration office price/cost analyst is 
responsible for providing a complete and accurate field pricing report. 
This includes quantifying technical findings; however, if the auditor 
requests a technical analysis, the auditor normally will incorporate the 
financial effect of the analysis in the audit report.
    (7) The contracting officer shall, with the advice of the ACO and 
auditor, ensure that the contractor initiates necessary corrective 
action before contract award.
    (8) The administrative contracting officer and auditor shall confer 
with the contractor during the course of the field pricing review to 
fully understand the basis for each item in the proposal and to remove 
any doubts as to the validity and accuracy of their conclusions and 
findings.
    (g) The audit activity sends the original to the administrative 
contracting officer and a copy to the contracting officer.

<R05>
215.805-70  Cost realism analysis.

    (a) In competitive acquisitions, even when adequate price 
competition exists, to ensure that proposed costs are consistent with 
the technical proposal, the contracting officer--
    (1) Should perform a cost realism analysis when--
    (i) A cost-reimbursement contract is anticipated;
    (ii) The solicitation contains new requirements that may not be 
fully understood by competing contractors;
    (iii) There are quality concerns; or
    (iv) Past experience indicates that contractors proposed costs have 
resulted in quality or service shortfalls.
    (2) May perform a cost realism analysis on other acquisitions.
    (b) The contracting officer should determine what information other 
than cost or pricing data is necessary for the cost realism analysis 
during acquisition planning and development of the solicitation. Unless 
such information is already available from Government sources, the 
contracting officer will need to ask the offerors for it.
    (1) Request only necessary data; and
    (2) Do not request submission of cost or pricing data.

<R05>
215.806  Subcontract pricing considerations.


<R05>
215.806-1  General.

    Price redeterminable or fixed-price incentive contracts may include 
subcontracts placed on the same basis. When the contracting officer 
wants to reprice the prime contract even though the contractor has not 
yet established final prices for the subcontracts, the contracting 
officer may negotiate a firm contract price--
    (1) If cost or pricing data on the subcontracts show the amounts to 
be reasonable and realistic; or
    (2) If cost or pricing data on the subcontracts are too indefinite 
to determine whether the amounts are reasonable and realistic, but--
    (i) Circumstances require prompt negotiation; and
    (ii) A statement substantially as follows is included in the 
repricing modification of the prime contract:

    As soon as the Contractor establishes firm prices for each 
subcontract listed below, the Contractor shall submit (in the format and 
with the level of detail specified by the Contracting Officer) to the 
Contracting Officer the subcontractor's cost incurred in performing the 
subcontract and the final subcontract price. The Contractor and 
Contracting Officer shall negotiate an equitable adjustment in the total 
amount paid or to be paid under this contract to reflect the final 
subcontract price.

    (a)(1) Contractor and subcontractor proposals may reflect the 
selection of sources whose proposals offer the greatest value to the 
Government in terms of performance and other factors. If the selection 
is based on greatest value rather than lowest price, the analysis 
supporting subcontractor selection should include a discussion of the 
factors considered in the selection (see also FAR 15.605(c) and 
215.605(c)). If the contractor's analysis is not adequate, return it for 
correction of deficiencies.
    (d) The contracting officer shall make every effort to ensure that 
fees negotiated by contractors for cost-plus-fixed-fee subcontracts do 
not exceed the fee limitations in FAR 15.903(d).
[56 FR 36326, July 31, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 29497, June 5, 1995]


<R05>
215.806-3  Field pricing reports.

    (a)(i) If, in the opinion of the contracting officer or auditor, the 
review of a prime contractor's proposal requires further review of 
subcontractors' cost estimates at the subcontractors' plants (after due 
consideration of reviews performed by the prime contractor), these 
reviews should be fully coordinated with the administrative contracting 
officer (ACO) having cognizance of the prime contractor before being 
initiated. The ACO for the prime contractor will initiate the request to 
the ACO for the subcontractor, with an information copy to the auditor 
for the subcontractor. The ACO for the subcontractor sends the resulting 
field pricing report to the prime ACO with an information copy to the 
prime auditor. Requests for field pricing support on lower tier 
subcontractors are handled in a like manner.
    (ii) Notify the appropriate contract administration activities when 
extensive, special, or expedited field pricing assistance will be needed 
to review and evaluate subcontractors' proposals under a major weapon 
system acquisition.


<R05>
215.807  Prenegotiation objectives.

    (a)(i) Also consider data resulting from application of work 
measurement systems in developing prenegotiation objectives.
    (ii) Consider field pricing support personnel participation in 
planned prenegotiation and negotiation activities.
    (b) Prenegotiation objectives, including objectives related to 
disposition of findings and recommendations contained in preaward and 
postaward contract audit and other advisory reports, shall be documented 
and reviewed in accordance with Departmental procedures.

<R05>
215.808  Price negotiation memorandum.

    (a)(8) Include the principal factors related to the disposition of 
findings and recommendations contained in preaward and postaward 
contract audit and other advisory reports.

[[Page 86]]

    (10) The memorandum--
    (A) Must document significant deviations from the prenegotiation 
profit objective;
    (B) Should include the DD Form 1547, Record of Weighted Guidelines 
Application (see subpart 215.9), if used, with supporting rationale; and
    (C) Must document the rationale for not using the weighted 
guidelines method when its use is required by 215.9.


<R05>
215.809  Forward pricing rate agreements.

    (e)(i) Use forward pricing rate agreement (FPRA) rates when such 
rates are available, unless waived on a case-by-case basis by the head 
of the contracting activity.
    (ii) Advise the ACO of each case waived.
    (iii) Contact the ACO for questions on FPRAs or recommended rates.


<R05>
215.810  Should-cost review.


<R05>
215.810-2  Program should-cost review.

    (b) DoD contracting activities should consider performing a program 
should-cost review before award of a definitive major systems contract 
exceeding $100 million.
[61 FR 7742, Feb. 29, 1996]


<R05>
215.810-3  Overhead should-cost review.

    (a) Contact the DCMC/DLA Overhead Center, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-
6221, at (703) 767-3387, for questions on overhead should-cost analysis.
    (b)(i) The Defense Contract Management Command/Defense Logistics 
Agency (DCMC/DLA), or the military department responsible for performing 
contract administration functions (e.g., Navy SUPSHIP), should consider, 
based on risk assessment, performing an overhead should-cost review of a 
contractor business unit (as defined in FAR 31.001) when all of the 
following conditions exist:
    (A) Projected annual sales to DoD exceed $1 billion;
    (B) Projected DoD versus total business exceeds 30 percent;
    (C) Level of sole-source DoD contracts is high;
    (D) Significant volume of proposal activity is anticipated;
    (E) Production or development of a major weapon system or program is 
anticipated; and
    (F) Contractor cost control/reduction initiatives appear inadequate.
    (ii) The head of the contracting activity may request an overhead 
should-cost review for a business unit which does not meet the criteria 
in paragraph (b)(i) of this subsection.
    (iii) Overhead should-cost reviews are labor intensive. These 
reviews generally involve participation by the contracting, contract 
administration, and contract audit elements. The extent of availability 
of military department, contract administration, and contract audit 
resources to support DCMC/DLA-led teams should be considered when 
determining whether a review will be conducted. Overhead should-cost 
reviews generally shall not be conducted at a contractor business 
segment more frequently than every three years.

215.811  Estimating systems.


<R05>
215.811-70  Disclosure, maintenance, and review requirements.

    (a) Definitions. (1) Adequate estimating system means an estimating 
system that--
    (i) Is established, maintained, reliable, and consistently applied; 
and
    (ii) Produces verifiable, supportable, and documented cost 
estimates.
    (2) Contractor means a business unit as defined in FAR 31.001.
    (3) Estimating system is as defined in the clause at 252.215-7002 
Cost Estimating System Requirements.
    (4) Significant estimating system deficiency means a shortcoming in 
the estimating system which is likely to consistently result in proposal 
estimates for total cost or a major cost element(s) which do not provide 
an acceptable basis for negotiation of fair and reasonable prices.
    (b) Applicability. (1) DoD policy is that all contractors have 
estimating systems that--
    (i) Are adequate;
    (ii) Consistently produce well supported proposals that are 
acceptable as

[[Page 87]]

a basis for negotiation of fair and reasonable prices;
    (iii) Are consistent with and integrated with the contractor's 
related management systems; and
    (iv) Are subject to applicable financial control systems.
    (2) A large business contractor is subject to estimating system 
disclosure, maintenance, and review requirements if--
    (i) In its preceding fiscal year, the contractor received DoD prime 
contracts or subcontracts totaling $50 million or more for which cost or 
pricing data were required; or
    (ii) In its preceding fiscal year, the contractor received DoD prime 
contracts or subcontracts totaling $10 million or more (but less than 
$50 million) for which cost or pricing data were required and the 
contracting officer, with concurrence or at the request of the 
administrative contracting officer, determines it to be in the best 
interest of the Government (e.g., significant estimating problems are 
believed to exist or the contractor's sales are predominantly 
Government).
    (c) Responsibilities. (1) The contracting officer shall--
    (i) Through use of the clause at 252.215-7002 Cost Estimating System 
Requirements, apply the disclosure, maintenance and review requirements 
to large business contractors meeting the criteria in paragraph 
(b)(2)(i) of this subsection;
    (ii) Consider whether to apply the disclosure, maintenance, and 
review requirements to large business contractors under paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii) of this subsection; and
    (iii) Not apply the disclosure, maintenance, and review requirement 
to other than large business contractors.
    (2) The cognizant administrative contracting officer, for 
contractors subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this subsection, shall--
    (i) Determine the adequacy of the disclosure and system; and
    (ii) Pursue correction of any deficiencies.
    (3) The cognizant auditor, on behalf of the ACO, serves as team 
leader in conducting estimating system reviews.
    (4) A contractor subject to estimating system disclosure, 
maintenance, and review requirements shall--
    (i) Maintain an adequate system;
    (ii) Describe its system to the administrative contracting officer 
(ACO);
    (iii) Provide timely notice of changes in the system; and
    (iv) Correct system deficiencies identified by the ACO.
    (d) Characteristics of an adequate estimating system--(1) General. 
An adequate system should provide for the use of appropriate source 
data, utilize sound estimating techniques and good judgment, maintain a 
consistent approach, and adhere to established policies and procedures.
    (2) Evaluation. In evaluating the adequacy of a contractor's 
estimating system, the ACO should consider whether the contractor's 
estimating system, for example--
    (i) Establishes clear responsibility for preparation, review and 
approval of cost estimates;
    (ii) Provides a written description of the organization and duties 
of the personnel responsible for preparing, reviewing, and approving 
cost estimates;
    (iii) Assures that relevant personnel have sufficient training, 
experience and guidance to perform estimating tasks in accordance with 
the contractor's established procedures;
    (iv) Identifies the sources of data and the estimating methods and 
rationale used in developing cost estimates;
    (v) Provides for appropriate supervision throughout the estimating 
process;
    (vi) Provides for consistent application of estimating techniques;
    (vii) Provides for detection and timely correction of errors;
    (viii) Protects against cost duplication and omissions;
    (ix) Provides for the use of historical experience, including 
historical vendor pricing information, where appropriate;
    (x) Requires use of appropriate analytical methods;
    (xi) Integrates information available from other management systems, 
where appropriate;
    (xii) Requires management review including verification that the 
company's estimating policies, procedures

[[Page 88]]

and practices comply with this regulation;
    (xiii) Provides for internal review of and accountability for the 
adequacy of the estimating system, including the comparison of projected 
results to actual results and an analysis of any differences;
    (xiv) Provides procedures to update cost estimates in a timely 
manner throughout the negotiation process; and
    (xv) Addresses responsibility for review and analysis of the 
reasonableness of subcontract prices.
    (3) Indicators of potentially significant estimating deficiencies. 
The following examples indicate conditions that may produce or lead to 
significant estimating deficiencies--
    (i) Failure to ensure that historical experience is available to and 
utilized by cost estimators, where appropriate;
    (ii) Continuing failure to analyze material costs or failure to 
perform subcontractor cost reviews as required.
    (iii) Consistent absence of analytical support for significant 
proposed cost amounts;
    (iv) Excessive reliance on individual personal judgment where 
historical experience or commonly utilized standards are available;
    (v) Recurring significant defective pricing findings within the same 
cost element(s);
    (vi) Failure to integrate relevant parts of other management systems 
(e.g., production control or cost accounting) with the estimating system 
so that the ability to generate reliable cost estimates is impaired; and
    (vii) Failure to provide established policies, procedures, and 
practices to persons responsible for preparing and supporting estimates.
    (e) Review Procedures. Cognizant audit and contract administration 
activities shall--
    (1) Establish and manage regular programs for reviewing selected 
contractors' estimating systems.
    (2) Conduct reviews as a team effort.
    (i) The contract auditor will be the team leader.
    (ii) The team leader will--
    (A) Coordinate with the ACO to ensure that team membership includes 
qualified contract administration technical specialists.
    (B) Advise the ACO and contractor of significant findings during the 
conduct of the review and during the exit conference.
    (C) Prepare a team report.
    (1) The ACO or a representative should--
    (i) Coordinate the contract administration activity's review;
    (ii) Consolidate findings and recommendations; and
    (iii) When appropriate, prepare a comprehensive written report for 
submission to the auditor.
    (2) The contract auditor will attach the ACO's report to the team 
report.
    (3) Tailor reviews to take full advantage of the day-to-day work 
done by both organizations.
    (4) Conduct a review every three years of contractors subject to the 
disclosure requirements. The ACO and auditor may lengthen or shorten the 
three-year period based on their joint risk assessment of the 
contractor's past experience and current vulnerability.
    (f) Disposition of survey team findings--(1) Reporting of survey 
team findings. The auditor will document the findings and 
recommendations of the survey team in a report to the ACO. If there are 
significant estimating deficiencies, the auditor will recommend 
disapproval of all or portions of the estimating system.
    (2) Initial notification to the contractor. The ACO will provide a 
copy of the team report to the contractor and, unless there are no 
deficiencies mentioned in the report, ask the contractor to submit a 
written response in 30 days, or a reasonable extension.
    (i) If the contractor agrees with the report, the contractor has 60 
days from the date of initial notification to correct any identified 
deficiencies or submit a corrective action plan showing milestones and 
actions to eliminate the deficiencies.
    (ii) If the contractor disagrees, the contractor should provide 
rationale in its written response.
    (3) Evaluation of contractor's response. The ACO, in consultation 
with the auditor, will evaluate the contractor's response to determine 
whether--

[[Page 89]]

    (i) The estimating system contains deficiencies which need 
correction;
    (ii) The deficiencies are significant estimating deficiencies which 
would result in disapproval of all or a portion of the contractor's 
estimating system; or
    (iii) The contractor's proposed corrective actions are adequate to 
eliminate the deficiency.
    (4) Notification of ACO determination. The ACO will notify the 
contractor and the auditor of the determination and, if appropriate, of 
the Government's intent to disapprove all or selected portions of the 
system. The notice shall--
    (i) List the cost elements covered;
    (ii) Identify any deficiencies requiring correction; and
    (iii) Require the contractor to correct the deficiencies within 45 
days or submit an action plan showing milestones and actions to 
eliminate the deficiencies.
    (5) Notice of disapproval. If the contractor has neither submitted 
an acceptable corrective action plan nor corrected significant 
deficiencies within 45 days, the ACO shall disapprove all or selected 
portions of the contractor's estimating system. The notice of 
disapproval must--
    (i) Identify the cost elements covered;
    (ii) List the deficiencies which prompted the disapproval; and
    (iii) Be sent to the cognizant auditor, and each contracting and 
contract administration office having substantial business with the 
contractor.
    (6) Monitoring contractor's corrective action. The auditor and ACO 
will monitor the contractor's progress in correcting deficiencies. If 
the contractor fails to make adequate progress, the ACO shall take 
whatever action is necessary to ensure that the contractor corrects the 
deficiencies. Examples of actions the ACO can take are: Bringing the 
issue to the attention of higher level management, reducing or 
suspending progress payments (see FAR 32.503-6), and recommending 
nonaward of potential contracts.
    (7) Withdrawal of estimating system disapproval. The ACO will 
withdraw the disapproval when the ACO determines that the contractor has 
corrected the significant system deficiencies. The ACO will notify the 
contractor, the auditor, and affected contracting and contract 
administration activities of the withdrawal.
    (g) Impact of estimating system deficiencies on specific proposals. 
(1) Field pricing teams will discuss identified estimating system 
deficiencies and their impact in all reports on contractor proposals 
until the deficiencies are resolved.
    (2) The contracting officer responsible for negotiation of a 
proposal generated by an estimating system with an identified deficiency 
shall evaluate whether the deficiency impacts the negotiations. If it 
does not, the contracting officer should proceed with negotiations. If 
it does, the contracting officer should consider other alternatives, 
e.g.--
    (i) Allowing the contractor additional time to correct the 
estimating system deficiency and submit a corrected proposal;
    (ii) Considering another type of contract, e.g., an FPIF instead of 
an FFP;
    (iii) Using additional cost analysis techniques to determine the 
reasonableness of the cost elements affected by the system's deficiency;
    (iv) Segregating the questionable areas as a cost reimbursable line 
item;
    (v) Reducing the negotiation objective for profit or fee; or
    (vi) Including a contract (reopener) clause that provides for 
adjustment of the contract amount after award.
    (3) The contracting officer who incorporates a reopener clause into 
the contract is responsible for negotiating price adjustments required 
by the clause. Any reopener clause necessitated by an estimating 
deficiency should--
    (i) Clearly identify the amounts and items which are in question at 
the time of negotiation;
    (ii) Indicate a specific time or subsequent event by which the 
contractor will submit a supplemental proposal, including cost or 
pricing data, identifying the cost impact adjustment necessitated by the 
deficient estimating system;
    (iii) Provide for the contracting officer to unilaterally adjust the 
contract price if the contractor fails to submit the supplemental 
proposal; and

[[Page 90]]

    (iv) Provide that failure of the Government and the contractor to 
agree to the price adjustment shall be a dispute under the Disputes 
clause.
    (h) Contract clause. Use the clause at 252.215-7002, Cost Estimating 
System Requirements, in all solicitations and contracts to be awarded on 
the basis of cost or pricing data.

<R05>
215.873  Estimated data prices.

    (a) The Department of Defense requires estimates of the prices of 
data in order to evaluate the cost to the Government of data items in 
terms of their management, product, or engineering value.
    (b) When data are required to be delivered under a contract, the 
solicitation will include DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List. 
The form and the provision included in the solicitation request the 
offeror to state what portion of the total price is estimated to be 
attributable to the production or development of the listed data for the 
Government (not to the sale of rights in the data). However, offerors' 
estimated prices may not reflect all such costs; and different offerors 
may reflect these costs in a different manner, for the following 
reasons--
    (1) Differences in business practices in competitive situations;
    (2) Differences in accounting systems among offerors;
    (3) Use of factors or rates on some portions of the data;
    (4) Application of common effort to two or more data items; and
    (5) Differences in data preparation methods among offerors.
    (c) Data price estimates should not be used for contract pricing 
purposes without further analysis.
    (d) The contracting officer shall ensure that the contract does not 
include a requirement for data that the contractor has delivered or is 
obligated to deliver to the Government under another contract or 
subcontract, and that the successful offeror identifies any such data 
required by the solicitation. However, where duplicate data are desired, 
the contract price shall include the costs of duplication, but not of 
preparation, of such data.

                          Subpart 215.9--Profit


<R05>
215.902  Policy.

    Departments and agencies shall use a structured approach for 
developing a prenegotiation profit or fee objective (profit objective) 
on any negotiated contract action that requires cost analysis, except on 
cost-plus-award-fee contracts (but see 215.974). There are three 
approaches--
    (1) The weighted guidelines method;
    (2) The modified weighted guidelines method; and
    (3) An alternate structured approach.


<R05>
215.903  Contracting officer responsibilities.

    (a) Also, do not perform a profit analysis when assessing cost 
realism in competitive acquisitions.
    (b) The contracting officer--
    (1) Shall use the weighted guidelines method (see 215.971), unless--
    (A) The modified weighted guidelines method applies; or
    (B) An alternate approach is justified.
    (2) Shall use the modified weighted guidelines method (see 215.972) 
on contract actions with nonprofit organizations;
    (3) May use an alternate structured approach (see 215.973) when--
    (i) The contract action is--
    (A) Under $500,000;
    (B) For architect-engineer or construction work;
    (C) Primarily for delivery of material from subcontractors; or
    (D) A termination settlement; or
    (ii) The weighted guidelines method does not produce a reasonable 
overall profit objective and the head of the contracting activity 
approves use of the alternate approach in writing.
    (4) Shall use the weighted guidelines method to establish a basic 
profit rate under a formula type pricing agreement, and may then use the 
basic rate on all actions under the agreement, provided that conditions 
affecting profit do not change.

[[Page 91]]

    (5) Shall document the profit analysis in the price negotiation 
memorandum.
    (e) Although specific agreement on the applied weights or values for 
individual profit factors shall not be attempted, the contracting 
officer may encourage the contractor to--
    (1) Present the details of its proposed profit amounts in the 
weighted guidelines format or similar structured approach; and
    (2) Use the weighted guidelines method in developing profit 
objectives for negotiated subcontracts.
    (f) The contracting officer must also verify that relevant variables 
have not materially changed (e.g., performance risk, interest rates, 
progress payment rates, distribution of facilities capital).


<R05>
215.905  Profit-analysis factors.


<R05>
215.905-1  Common factors.

    The common factors are embodied in the DoD structured approaches and 
need not be further considered by the contracting officer.


<R05>
215.970  DD Form 1547, Record of Weighted Guidelines Method Application.

    (a) The DD Form 1547--
    (1) Provides a vehicle for performing the analysis necessary to 
develop a profit objective;
    (2) Provides a format for summarizing profit amounts subsequently 
negotiated as part of the contract price; and
    (3) Serves as the principal source document for reporting profit 
statistics to DoD's management information system.
    (b) The Military Departments are responsible for establishing 
policies and procedures for feeding the DoD-wide management information 
system on profit and fee statistics (see 215.975).
    (c) The contracting officer shall--
    (1) Use and prepare a DD Form 1547 whenever a structured approach to 
profit analysis is required by 215.902. (See 215.971, 215.972, and 
215.973 for guidance on using the structured approaches.) Administrative 
instructions for completing the form are in 253.215-70.
    (2) Ensure that the DD Form 1547 is accurately completed. The 
contracting officer is responsible for the correction of any errors 
detected by the management system auditing process.


<R05>
215.971  Weighted guidelines method.


<R05>
215.971-1  General.

    (a) The weighted guidelines method focuses on three profit factors--
    (1) Performance risk;
    (2) Contract type risk; and
    (3) Facilities capital employed.
    (b) The contracting officer assigns values to each profit factor; 
the value multiplied by the base results in the profit objective for 
that factor. Each profit factor has a normal value and a designated 
range of values. The normal value is representative of average 
conditions on the prospective contract when compared to all goods and 
services acquired by DoD. The designated range provides values based on 
above normal or below normal conditions. In the price negotiation 
memorandum, the contracting officer need not explain assignment of the 
normal value, but should address conditions that justify assignment of 
other than the normal value.


<R05>
215.971-2  Performance risk.

    (a) Description. This profit factor addresses the contractor's 
degree of risk in fulfilling the contract requirements. The factor 
consists of three parts--
    (1) Technical--the technical uncertainties of performance.
    (2) Management--the degree of management effort necessary to ensure 
that contract requirements are met.
    (3) Cost control--the contractor's efforts to reduce and control 
costs.
    (b) Determination. The following extract from the DD Form 1547 is 
annotated to describe the process.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) Standard. The standard designated range should apply to most 
contracts.
    (2) Alternate. Contracting officers may use the alternate designated 
range for research and development and service contractors when these 
contractors require relatively low capital investment in buildings and 
equipment when compared to the defense industry overall. If the 
alternate designated range is used, do not give any profit for 
facilities capital employed (see 215.971-4(c)(3)).
    (d) Evaluation criteria for technical. (1) Review the contract 
requirements and focus on the critical performance elements in the 
statement of work or specifications. Factors to consider include--
    (i) Technology being applied or developed by the contractor;
    (ii) Technical complexity;
    (iii) Program maturity;
    (iv) Performance specifications and tolerances;
    (v) Delivery schedule; and
    (vi) Extent of a warranty or guarantee.
    (2) Above normal conditions. (i) The contracting officer may assign 
a higher than normal value in those cases where there is a substantial 
technical risk. Indicators are--
    (A) The contractor is either developing or applying advanced 
technologies;
    (B) Items are being manufactured using specifications with stringent 
tolerance limits;
    (C) The efforts require highly skilled personnel or require the use 
of state of the art machinery;
    (D) The services and analytical efforts are extremely important to 
the Government and must be performed to exacting standards;
    (E) The contractor's independent development and investment has 
reduced the Government's risk or cost;
    (F) The contractor has accepted an accelerated delivery schedule to 
meet DoD requirements; or
    (G) The contractor has assumed additional risk through warranty 
provisions.
    (ii) Extremely complex, vital efforts to overcome difficult 
technical obstacles which require personnel with exceptional abilities, 
experience, and professional credentials may justify a value 
significantly above normal.
    (iii) The following may justify a maximum value--
    (A) Development or initial production of a new item, particularly if 
performance or quality specifications are tight; or
    (B) A high degree of development or production concurrency.
    (3) Below normal conditions.
    (i) The contracting officer may assign a lower than normal value in 
those cases where the technical risk is low. Indicators are--
    (A) Acquisition is for off-the-shelf items;
    (B) Requirements are relatively simple;
    (C) Technology is not complex;
    (D) Efforts do not require highly skilled personnel;
    (E) Efforts are routine;
    (F) Programs are mature; or

[[Page 93]]

    (G) Acquisition is a follow-on effort or a repetitive type 
acquisition.
    (ii) The contracting officer may assign a value significantly below 
normal for--
    (A) Routine services;
    (B) Production of simple items;
    (C) Rote entry or routine integration of Government furnished 
information; or
    (D) Simple operations with Government-furnished property.
    (e) Evaluation criteria for management. (1) The contracting officer 
should--
    (i) Assess the contractor's management and internal control systems 
using contracting office information and reviews made by field contract 
administration offices or other DoD field offices;
    (ii) Assess the management involvement expected on the prospective 
contract action;
    (iii) Consider the degree of cost mix as an indication of the types 
of resources applied and value-added by the contractor; and
    (iv) Consider the contractor's support of Federal socioeconomic 
programs.
    (2) Above normal conditions. (i) The contracting officer may assign 
a higher than normal value when the management effort is intense. 
Indicators of this are--
    (A) The contractor's value-added is both considerable and reasonably 
difficult;
    (B) The effort involves a high degree of integration or 
coordination; or
    (C) The contractor has a substantial record of active participation 
in Federal socioeconomic programs.
    (ii) The contracting officer may justify a maximum value when the 
effort--
    (A) Requires large scale integration of the most complex nature;
    (B) Involves major international activities with significant 
management coordination (e.g., offsets with foreign vendors); or
    (C) Has critically important milestones.
    (3) Below normal conditions. (i) The contracting officer may assign 
a lower than normal value when the management effort is minimal. 
Indicators of this are--
    (A) The program is mature and many end item deliveries have been 
made;

negotiation of the proposal.
    (ii) The following may justify a value significantly below normal--
    (A) Reviews performed by the field contract administration offices 
disclose unsatisfactory management and internal control systems (e.g., 
quality assurance, property control, safety, security); or
    (B) The effort requires an unusually low degree of management 
involvement.
    (f) Evaluation criteria for cost control. (1) The contracting 
officer should evaluate--
    (i) The expected reliability of the contractor's cost estimates 
(including the contractor's cost estimating system);
    (ii) The contractor's cost reduction initiatives (e.g., competition 
advocacy programs, dual sourcing, spare parts pricing reform, value 
engineering);
    (iii) The adequacy of the contractor's management approach to 
controlling cost and schedule; and
    (iv) Any other factors which affect the contractor's ability to meet 
the cost targets, e.g., foreign currency exchange rates and inflation 
rates.
    (2) Above normal conditions. The contracting officer may assign a 
higher than normal value if the contractor can demonstrate a highly 
effective cost control program. Indicators of this are--
    (i) The contractor provides fully documented and reliable cost 
estimates;
    (ii) The contractor has an aggressive cost reduction program that 
has demonstrable benefits;
    (iii) The contractor uses a high degree of subcontract competition 
(e.g., aggressive dual sourcing); or
    (iv) The contractor has a proven record of cost tracking and 
control.

[[Page 94]]

    (3) Below normal conditions. The contracting officer may assign a 
lower than normal value if the contractor demonstrates minimal concern 
for cost control. Indicators are--
    (i) The contractor's cost estimating system is marginal;
    (ii) The contractor has made minimal effort to initiate cost 
reduction programs;
    (iii) The contractor's cost proposal is inadequate;
    (iv) The contractor has a record of cost overruns or other 
indication of unreliable cost estimates and lack of cost control.

215.971-3  Contract type risk and working capital adjustment.

    (a) Description. The contract type risk factor focuses on the degree 
of cost risk accepted by the contractor under varying contract types. 
The working capital adjustment is an adjustment added to the profit 
objective for contract type risk. It only applies to fixed-price 
contracts that provide for progress payments. Though it uses a formula 
approach, it is not intended to be an exact calculation of the cost of 
working capital. Its purpose is to give general recognition to the 
contractor's cost of working capital under varying contract 
circumstances, financing policies, and the economic environment.

    (1) Select a value from the list of contract types in paragraph (c) 
of this subsection using the evaluation criteria in paragraph (d) of 
this subsection.
    (2) Insert the amount from Block 18, i.e., the total allowable costs 
excluding general and administrative expenses, independent research and 
development/bid proposal expenses, and facilities capital cost of money.
    (3) Multiply (1) by (2).
    (4) Only complete this Block when the prospective contract is a 
fixed-price contract containing provisions for progress payments.
    (5) Insert the amount computed per paragraph (e) of this subsection.
    (6) Insert the appropriate figure from paragraph (f) of this 
subsection.
    (7) Use the interest rate established by the Secretary of the 
Treasury (230.7101(a)). Do not use any other interest rate.
    (8) Multiply (5) by (6) by (7). This is the working capital 
adjustment. It shall not exceed 4 percent of the contract costs in Block 
20.
    (c) Values: Normal and designated ranges.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) No financing means that the contract either does not provide 
progress payments, or provides them only on a limited basis, such as 
financing of first articles. Do not compute a working capital 
adjustment.
    (2) With financing means progress payments. When progress payments 
are present, compute a working capital adjustment (Block 26).
    (3) For the purposes of assigning profit values, treat a fixed-price 
contract with redeterminable provisions as if it were a fixed-price-
incentive contract with below normal conditions.
    (4) Cost-plus contracts shall not receive the working capital 
adjustment.
    (5) These types of contracts are considered cost-plus-fixed-fee 
contracts for the purposes of assigning profit values. They shall not 
receive the working capital adjustment in Block 26. However, they may 
receive higher than normal values within the designated range to the 
extent that portions of cost are fixed.
    (d) Evaluation criteria--(1) General. The contracting officer should 
consider elements that affect contract type risk such as--
    (i) Length of contract;
    (ii) Adequacy of cost data for projections;
    (iii) Economic environment;
    (iv) Nature and extent of subcontracted activity;
    (v) Protection provided to the contractor under contract provisions 
(e.g., economic price adjustment clauses);
    (vi) The ceilings and share lines contained in incentive provisions; 
and
    (vii) Risks associated with contracts for foreign military sales 
(FMS) which are not funded by U.S. appropriations.
    (2) Mandatory--The contracting officer shall assess the extent to 
which costs have been incurred prior to definitization of the contract 
action (see also 217.7404-6(a)). The assessment shall include any 
reduced contractor risk on both the contract before definitization and 
the remaining portion of the contract. When costs have been incurred 
prior to definitization, generally regard the contract type risk to be 
in the low end of the designated range. If a substantial portion of the 
costs have been incurred prior to definitization, the contracting 
officer may assign a value as low as 0%, regardless of contract type.
    (3) Above normal conditions. The contracting officer may assign a 
higher than normal value when there is substantial contract type risk. 
Indicators of this are--
    (i) Efforts where there is minimal cost history;
    (ii) Long-term contracts without provisions protecting the 
contractor, particularly when there is considerable economic 
uncertainty;
    (iii) Incentive provisions (e.g., cost and performance incentives) 
which place a high degree of risk on the contractor; or
    (iv) FMS sales (other than those under DoD cooperative logistics 
support arrangements or those made from U.S. Government inventories or 
stocks) where the contractor can demonstrate that there are substantial 
risks above those normally present in DoD contracts for similar items.
    (4) Below normal conditions. The contracting officer may assign a 
lower than normal value when the contract type risk is low. Indicators 
of this are--
    (i) Very mature product line with extensive cost history;
    (ii) Relatively short-term contracts;
    (iii) Contractual provisions which substantially reduce the 
contractor's risk; or
    (iv) Incentive provisions which place a low degree of risk on the 
contractor.
    (e) Costs financed. (1) Costs financed equal total costs multiplied 
by the portion (percent) of costs financed by the contractor.
    (2) Total costs equal Block 20 (i.e., all allowable costs, including 
general and administrative and independent research and development/bid 
and proposal, but excluding facilities capital cost of money), reduced 
as appropriate when--
    (i) The contractor has little cash investment (e.g., subcontractor 
progress payments liquidated late in period of performance);
    (ii) Some costs are covered by special financing provisions, such as 
advance payments; or
    (iii) The contract is multiyear and there are special funding 
arrangements.

[[Page 96]]

    (3) The portion financed by the contractor is generally the portion 
not covered by progress payments, i.e., 100% minus the customary 
progress payment rate (FAR 32.501). For example, if a contractor 
receives progress payments at 75%, the portion financed by the 
contractor is 25%. On contracts that provide flexible progress payments 
(252.232-7003) or progress payments to small businesses, use the 
customary progress payment rate for large businesses.
    (f) Contract length factor. (1) This is the period of time that the 
contractor has a working capital investment in the contract. It--
    (i) Is based on the time necessary for the contractor to complete 
the substantive portion of the work;
    (ii) Is not necessarily the period of time between contract award 
and final delivery (or final payment), as periods of minimal effort 
should be excluded;
    (iii) Should not include periods of performance contained in option 
provisions; and
    (iv) Should not, for multiyear contracts, include periods of 
performance beyond that required to complete the initial program year's 
requirements.
    (2) The contracting officer--
    (i) Should use the following table to select the contract length 
factor;
    (ii) Should develop a weighted average contract length when the 
contract has multiple deliveries; and
    (iii) May use sampling techniques provided they produce a 
representative result.

    (3) Example: A prospective contract has a performance period of 40 
months with end items being delivered in the 34th, 36th, 38th, and 40th 
months of the contract. The average period is 37 months and the contract 
length factor is 1.15.

215.971-4  Facilities capital employed.

    (a) Description. This factor focuses on encouraging and rewarding 
aggressive capital investment in facilities that benefit DoD. It 
recognizes both the facilities capital that the contractor will employ 
in contract performance and the contractor's commitment to improving 
productivity.
    (b) Determination. The following extract from the DD Form 1547 has 
been annotated to explain the process.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) Select a value from the list in paragraph (c) of this subsection 
using the evaluation criteria in paragraph (d) of this subsection.
    (2) Use the allocated facilities capital attributable to land, 
buildings, and equipment, as derived in DD Form 1861, ``Contract 
Facilities Capital Cost of Money'' (see 215.871-5 and 230.7001).
    (i) In addition to the net book value of facilities capital 
employed, consider facilities capital that is part of a formal 
investment plan if the contractor submits reasonable evidence that--
    (A) Achievable benefits to DoD will result from the investment; and
    (B) The benefits of the investment are included in the forward 
pricing structure.
    (ii) If the value of intracompany transfers has been included in 
Block 18

[[Page 97]]

at cost (i.e., excluding general and administrative (G&A) expenses and 
profit), add to the contractor's allocated facilities capital, the 
allocated facilities capital attributable to the buildings and equipment 
of those corporate divisions supplying the intracompany transfers. Do 
not make this addition if the value of intracompany transfers has been 
included in Block 18 at price (i.e., including G&A expenses and profit).
    (3) Multiply (1) by (2).
    (c) Values: Normal and designated ranges.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) These are the normal values and ranges. They apply to all 
situations except those noted in (2) and (3).
    (2) These alternate values and ranges apply to situations where a 
highly facilitized manufacturing firm will be performing a research and 
development or services contract. They balance the method used to 
allocate facilities capital cost of money, which may produce 
disproportionate allocation of assets to these types of efforts.
    (3) When using a value from the alternate designated range for the 
performance risk factor (215.971-2(c)(2)), do not allow profit on 
facilities capital employed.
    (d) Evaluation criteria. (1) In evaluating facilities capital 
employed, the contracting officer--
    (i) Should relate the usefulness of the facilities capital to the 
goods or services being acquired under the prospective contract;
    (ii) Should analyze the productivity improvements and other 
anticipated industrial base enhancing benefits resulting from the 
facilities capital investment, including--
    (A) The economic value of the facilities capital, such as physical 
age, undepreciated value, idleness, and expected contribution to future 
defense needs; and
    (B) The contractor's level of investment in defense related 
facilities as compared with the portion of the contractor's total 
business which is derived from DoD;
    (iii) Should consider any contractual provisions that reduce the 
contractor's risk of investment recovery, such as termination protection 
clause, capital investment indemnification, and productivity saving 
rewards (215.870-3); and
    (iv) Shall ensure that increases in facilities capital investments 
are not merely asset revaluations attributable to mergers, stock 
transfers, take-overs, sales of corporate entities, or similar actions.
    (2) Above normal conditions. (i) The contracting officer may assign 
a higher than normal value if the facilities capital investment has 
direct, identifiable, and exceptional benefits. Indicators are--
    (A) New investments in state-of-the-art technology which reduce 
acquisition cost or yield other tangible benefits such as improved 
product quality or accelerated deliveries;
    (B) Investments in new equipment for research and development 
applications; or
    (C) Contractor demonstration that the investments are over and above 
the normal capital investments necessary to support anticipated 
requirements of DoD programs.
    (ii) The contracting officer may assign a value significantly above 
normal when there are direct and measurable benefits in efficiency and 
significantly reduced acquisition costs on the effort being priced. 
Maximum values apply only to those cases where the benefits of the 
facilities capital investment are substantially above normal.
    (3) Below normal conditions. (i) The contracting officer may assign 
a lower than normal value if the facilities capital investment has 
little benefit to DoD. Indicators are--
    (A) Allocations of capital apply predominantly to commercial item 
lines;
    (B) Investments are for such things as furniture and fixtures, home 
or

[[Page 98]]

group level administrative offices, corporate aircraft and hangars, 
gymnasiums; or
    (C) Facilities are old or extensively idle.
    (ii) The contracting officer may assign a value significantly below 
normal when a significant portion of defense manufacturing is done in an 
environment characterized by outdated, inefficient, and labor-intensive 
capital equipment.

215.972  Modified weighted guidelines method for nonprofit organizations.

    (a) Definition. As used in this subpart, a nonprofit organization is 
a business entity--
    (1) Which operates exclusively for charitable, scientific, or 
educational purposes;
    (2) Whose earnings do not benefit any private shareholder or 
individual;
    (3) Whose activities do not involve influencing legislation or 
political campaigning for any candidate for public office; and
    (4) Which is exempted from Federal income taxation under section 501 
of the Internal Revenue Code.
    (b) For nonprofit organizations which are Federally funded research 
and development centers (FFRDCs), the contracting officer--
    (1) Should consider whether any fee is appropriate. Considerations 
shall include the FFRDC's--
    (i) Proportion of retained earnings (as established under generally 
accepted accounting methods) that relates to DoD contracted effort;
    (ii) Facilities capital acquisition plans;
    (iii) Working capital funding as assessed on operating cycle cash 
needs;
    (iv) Contingency funding; and
    (v) Provision for funding unreimbursed costs deemed ordinary and 
necessary to the FFRDC.
    (2) Shall, when a fee is considered appropriate, compute the fee 
objective using the weighted guidelines method in 215.971, with the 
following modifications--
    (i) Modifications to performance risk (Blocks 21-24 of the DD Form 
1547). (A) If the contracting officer assigns a value from the standard 
designated range (215.971-2(c)), reduce the fee objective by an amount 
equal to 1% of the costs in Block 18 of the DD Form 1547. Show the net 
(reduced) amount on the DD Form 1547.
    (B) If the contracting officer assigns a value from the alternate 
designated range, reduce the fee objective by an amount equal to 2% of 
the costs in Block 18 of the DD Form 1547. Show the net (reduced) amount 
on the DD Form 1547.
    (ii) Modifications to contract type risk (Block 25 of the DD Form 
1547). Use a designated range of -1% to 0% in lieu of the values in 
215.971-3. There is no normal value.
    (c) For nonprofit organizations which are entities that have been 
identified by the Secretary of Defense or a Secretary of a Department as 
receiving sustaining support on a cost-plus-fixed-fee basis from a 
particular DoD department or agency, compute a fee objective for covered 
actions using the weighted guidelines method in 215.971, modified as 
described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (d) For all other nonprofit organizations, compute a fee objective 
for covered actions using the weighted guidelines method in 215.971, 
modified as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.


<R05>
215.973  Alternate structured approaches.

    (a) The contracting officer may use an alternate structured approach 
under 215.903.
    (b) The contracting officer may design the structure of the 
alternate, but it shall include--
    (1) Consideration of the three basic components of profit--
performance risk, contract type risk (including working capital), and 
facilities capital employed. However, the contracting officer is not 
required to complete Blocks 21 through 30 of the DD Form 1547.
    (2) Offset for facilities capital cost of money.
    (i) The contracting officer shall reduce the overall prenegotiation 
profit objective by the lesser of 1% of total cost or the amount of 
facilities capital cost of money. The profit amount in

[[Page 99]]

the negotiation summary of the DD Form 1547 must be net of the offset.
    (ii) This adjustment is needed for the following reason: The values 
of the profit factors used in the weighted guidelines method were 
adjusted to recognize the shift in facilities capital cost of money from 
an element of profit to an element of contract cost (FAR 31.205-10) and 
reductions were made directly to the profit factors for performance 
risk. In order to ensure that this policy is applied to all DoD 
contracts which allow facilities capital cost of money, similar 
adjustments shall be made to contracts which use alternate structured 
approaches.


<R05>
215.974  Fee requirements for cost-plus-award-fee contracts.

    In developing a fee objective for cost-plus-award-fee contracts, the 
contracting officer shall--
    (a) Follow the guidance in FAR 16.404-2 and 216.404-2;
    (b) Not use the weighted guidelines method or alternate structured 
approach;
    (c) Apply the offset policy in 215.973(b)(2) for facilities capital 
cost of money, i.e., reduce the base fee by the lesser of 1% of total 
costs or the amount of facilities capital cost of money; and
    (d) Not complete a DD Form 1547.


<R05>
215.975  Reporting profit and fee statistics.

    (a) Contracting officers in contracting offices which participate in 
the management information system for profit and fee statistics send 
completed DD Forms 1547 on actions of $500,000 or more, where the 
contracting officer used either the weighted guidelines method, an 
alternate structured approach, or the modified weighted guidelines 
method, to their designated office within 30 days after contract award.
    (b) Participating contracting offices and their designated offices 
are--

<R04>
                 Subpart 216.1--Selecting Contract Types


<R05>
216.104  Factors in selecting contract types.

    (d) Design stability should also be considered.


<R05>
216.104-70  Research and development.

    (a) General. There are several categories of research and 
development (R&D) contracts: research, exploratory development, advanced 
development, engineering development, and operational systems 
development (see 235.001 for definitions). Each category has a primary 
technical or functional objective. Different parts of a project may fit 
several categories. The contract type must fit the work required, not 
just the classification of the overall program.
    (b) Research and exploratory development. (1) Price is not 
necessarily the

[[Page 101]]

primary factor in determining the contract type.
    (2) The nature of the work to be performed will usually result in a 
cost-plus award fee, cost-plus fixed fee term, cost-no-fee, or cost-
sharing contract.
    (3) If the Government and the contractor can identify and agree upon 
the level of contractor effort required, the contracting officer may 
select a firm fixed-price level-of-effort contract, except see 235.006.
    (4) If the Government and the contractor agree that an incentive 
arrangement is desirable and capable of being evaluated after completion 
of the work, the contracting officer may use an incentive type contract.
    (c) Advanced development. (1) The nature of the work to be performed 
often results in a cost-plus fixed fee completion type contract.
    (2) Contracting officers may select incentive contracts if--
    (i) Realistic and measurable targets are identified; and
    (ii) Achievement of those targets is predictable with a reasonable 
degree of accuracy.
    (3) Contracting officers should not use contracts with only cost 
incentives where--
    (i) There will be a large number of major technical changes; or
    (ii) Actions beyond the control of the contractor may influence the 
contractor's achievement of cost targets.
    (d) Engineering development and operational systems development. (1) 
When selecting contract types, also consider--
    (i) The degree to which the project is clearly defined, which in 
turn affects the contractor's ability to provide accurate cost 
estimates;
    (ii) The need for effort that will overlap that of earlier stages;
    (iii) The need for firm technical direction by the Government; and
    (iv) The degree of configuration control the Government will 
exercise.
    (2) For development efforts, particularly for major defense systems, 
the preferred contract type is cost reimbursement.
    (3) Contracting officers should use fixed-price type contracts when 
risk has been reduced to the extent that realistic pricing can occur; 
e.g., when a program has reached the final stages of development and 
technical risks are minimal, except see 235.006.


<R04>
                  Subpart 216.2--Fixed-Price Contracts


<R05>
216.203  Fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment.


<R05>
216.203-4  Contract clauses.

    (a) Adjustment based on established prices-standard supplies. 
Generally, use the clause at FAR 52.216-2, Economic Price Adjustment-
Standard Supplies only when--
    (i) The total contract price is over the small purchase threshold in 
FAR 13.000; and
    (ii) Delivery will not be completed within 6 months after the 
contract date.
    (b) Adjustment based on established prices-semistandard supplies. 
Generally, use the clause at FAR 52.216-3, Economic Price Adjustment-
Semistandard Supplies, only when--
    (i) The total contract price is over the small purchase threshold in 
FAR 13.000; and
    (ii) Delivery will not be completed within 6 months after the 
contract date.
    (c) Adjustments based on actual cost of labor or material.
    (2) Limit use of the clause at FAR 52.216-4, Economic Price 
Adjustment-Labor and Material, to contracts in which the price exceeds 
$50,000 and the period of performance exceeds 6 months, unless otherwise 
approved by the chief of the contracting office. Use an appropriate 
modification of the clause in sealed bidding.
    (4) Apply the full amount of the decrease in the labor rates and 
fringe benefits or unit prices for materials.
    (d) Adjustments based on cost indexes of labor or material. Use the 
following guidelines--
    (i) Do not make the clause unnecessarily complex.
    (ii) Normally, the clause should not provide either a ceiling or a 
floor for adjustment unless adjustment is based on indices below the 
four digit level of the Bureau of Labor Statistics--
    (A) Producer Price Index;

[[Page 102]]

    (B) Employment Cost Index for wages and salaries, benefits, and 
compensation costs for aerospace industries; or
    (C) Wage and Income Series by Standard Industrial Classification 
(Labor).
    (iii) Normally, the clause should cover all potential economic 
fluctuations within the original contract period of performance.
    (iv) The clause must accurately identify the index(es) upon which 
adjustments will be based.
    (A) It must provide for a means to adjust for appropriate economic 
fluctuation in the event publication of the movement of the designated 
index is discontinued. This might include the substitution of another 
index if the time remaining would justify doing so and an appropriate 
index is reasonably available, or some other method for repricing the 
remaining portion of work to be performed.
    (B) Normally, there should be no need to make an adjustment if 
computation of the identified index is altered. However, it may be 
appropriate to provide for adjustment of the economic fluctuation 
computations in the event there is such a substantial alteration in the 
method of computing the index that the original intent of the parties is 
negated.
    (C) When an index to be used is subject to revision (e.g., the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics Producer Price Indexes), the economic price 
adjustment clause must specify that any economic price adjustment will 
be based on a revised index and must identify which revision to the 
index will be used.
    (v) Construct the index to encompass a large sample of relevant 
items while still bearing a logical relationship to the type of contract 
costs being measured. The basis of the index should not be so large and 
diverse that it is significantly affected by fluctuations not relevant 
to contract performance, but it must be broad enough to minimize the 
effect of any single company, including the anticipated contractor(s).
    (vi) Construction of an index is largely dependent upon three 
general series published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of 
Labor Statistics (BLS). These are the--
    (A) Industrial Commodities portion of the Producer Price Index;
    (B) Employment Cost Index for wages and salaries, benefits, and 
compensation costs for aerospace industries; and
    (C) Wage and Income Series by Standard Industrial Classification 
(Labor). Since there is no BLS published series currently available that 
relates directly to total prices of delivered DoD aircraft, ships, 
missiles, electronics, etc., it will be necessary to construct composite 
indices from major portions of the three series identified.
    (vii) Normally, do not use more than two indices, i.e., one for 
labor (direct and indirect) and one for material (direct and indirect).
    (viii) The clause must establish and properly identify a base period 
comparable to the contract periods for which adjustments are to be made 
as a reference point for application of an index.
    (ix) The clause should not provide for an adjustment beyond the 
original contract performance period, including options. The start date 
for the adjustment may be the beginning of the contract or a later time, 
as appropriate, based on the projected rate of expenditures.
    (x) The expenditure profile for both labor and material should be 
based on a predetermined rate of expenditure (expressed as the 
percentage of material or labor usage as it relates to the total 
contract price) in lieu of actual cost incurred.
    (A) If the clause is to be used in a competitive acquisition, 
determine the labor and material allocations, with regard to both mix of 
labor and material and rate of expenditure by percentage, in a manner 
which will, as nearly as possible, approximate the average expenditure 
profile of all companies to be solicited so that all companies may 
compete on an equal basis.
    (B) If the clause is to be used in a noncompetitive acquisition, the 
labor and material allocations may be subject to negotiation and 
agreement.
    (C) For multiyear contracts, establish predetermined expenditure 
profile tables for each of the annual increments in the multiyear buy. 
Each of the second and subsequent year tables

[[Page 103]]

must be cumulative to reflect the total expenditures for all increments 
funded through the latest multiyear funding.
    (xi) The clause should state the percentage of the contract price 
subject to price adjustment.
    (A) Normally, do not apply adjustments to the profit portion of the 
contract.
    (B) Examine the labor and material portions of the contract to 
exclude any areas that do not require adjustment. For example, it may be 
possible to exclude--
    (1) Subcontracting for short periods of time during the early life 
of the contract which could be covered by firm-fixed-priced 
subcontracting;
    (2) Certain areas of overhead, e.g., depreciation charges, prepaid 
insurance costs, rental costs, leases, certain taxes, and utility 
charges;
    (3) Labor costs for which a definitive union agreement exists; and
    (4) Those costs not likely to be affected by fluctuation in the 
economy.
    (C) Allocate that part of the contract price subject to adjustment 
to specific periods of time (e.g., quarterly, semiannually, etc.) based 
on the most probable expenditure or commitment basis (expenditure 
profile).
    (xii) The clause should provide for definite times or events that 
trigger price adjustments. Adjustments should be frequent enough to 
afford the contractor appropriate economic protection without creating a 
burdensome administrative effort. The adjustment period should normally 
range from quarterly to annually.
    (xiii) When the contract contains cost incentives, any sums paid to 
the contractor on account of economic price adjustment provisions must 
be subtracted from the total of the contractor's allowable costs for the 
purpose of establishing the total costs to which the cost incentive 
provisions apply. If the incentive arrangement is cited in percentage 
ranges, rather than dollar ranges, above and below target costs, 
structure the economic price adjustment clause to maintain the original 
contract incentive range in dollars.
    (xiv) The economic price adjustment clause should provide that once 
the labor and material allocations and the portion of the contract price 
subject to price adjustment have been established, they remain fixed 
through the life of the contract and shall not be modified except in the 
event of significant changes in the scope of the contract. The clause 
should state that pricing actions pursuant to the Changes clause or 
other provisions of the contract will be priced as though there were no 
provisions for economic price adjustment. However, subsequent 
modifications may include a change to the delivery schedule or 
significantly change the amount of, or mix of, labor or material for the 
contract. In such cases, it may be appropriate to prospectively apply 
economic price adjustment coverage. This may be accomplished by--
    (A) Using an economic price adjustment (EPA) clause that applies 
only to the effort covered by the modification;
    (B) Revising the baseline data or period in the EPA clause for the 
basic contract to include the new work; or
    (C) Using an entirely new EPA clause for the entire contract, 
including the new work.
    (xv) Consistent with the factors in paragraphs (d)(i) through (xiv) 
of this subsection, it may also be appropriate to provide in the prime 
contract for similar economic price adjustment arrangements between the 
prime contractor and affected subcontractors to allocate risks properly 
and ensure that those subcontractors are provided similar economic 
protection.
    (xvi) When economic price adjustment clauses are included in 
contracts that do not require submission of cost or pricing data as 
provided for in FAR 15.804-1, the contracting officer must obtain 
adequate information to establish the baseline from which adjustments 
will be made. The contracting officer may require verification of the 
data submitted to the extent necessary to permit reliance upon the data 
as a reasonable baseline.

216.203-4-70  Additional clauses.

    (a) Price adjustment for basic steel, aluminum, brass, bronze, or 
copper mill products.

[[Page 104]]

    (1) The price adjustment clause at 252.216-7000, Economic Price 
Adjustment--Basic Steel, Aluminum, Brass, Bronze, or Copper Mill 
Products, may be used in fixed-price supply contracts for basic steel, 
aluminum, brass, bronze, or copper mill products, such as sheets, 
plates, and bars, when an established catalog or market price exists for

    (2) The 10 percent figure in paragraph (d)(1) of the clause shall 
not be exceeded unless approval is obtained at a level above the 
contracting officer.
    (b) Price adjustment for nonstandard steel items. (1) The price 
adjustment clause at 252.216-7001, Economic Price Adjustment--
Nonstandard Steel Items, may be used in fixed-price supply contracts 
when--
    (i) The contractor is a steel producer and actually manufacture the 
standard steel mill item referred to in the ``base steel index'' 
definition of the clause; and
    (ii) The items being acquired are nonstandard steel items made

    (5) The ten percent figure in paragraph (e)(4) of the clause shall 
not be exceeded unless approval is obtained at a level above the 
contracting officer.
    (c) Price adjustment for wage rates or material prices controlled by 
a foreign government. (1) The price adjustment clause at 252.216-7003, 
Economic Price Adjustment--Wage Rates or Material Prices Controlled by a 
Foreign Government, may be used in fixed-price supply and service 
contracts when--
    (i) The contract is to be performed wholly or in part in a foreign 
country; and
    (ii) A foreign government controls wage rates or material prices and 
may, during contract performance, impose a mandatory change in wages or 
prices of material.

<R04>
                   Subpart 216.4--Incentive Contracts


<R05>
216.402  Application of predetermined, formula-type incentives.


<R05>
216.402-2  Technical performance incentives.

    Contractor performance incentives should relate to specific 
performance areas of milestones, such as delivery or test schedules, 
quality controls, maintenance requirements, and reliability standards.


<R05>
216.403  Fixed-price incentive contracts.

    (b) Application.
    (3) Individual line items may have separate incentive provisions; 
e.g., when dissimilar work calls for separate formulas.


<R05>
216.403-2  Fixed-price incentive (successive targets) contracts.

    (a) Description. (1)(iii) The formula does not apply for the life of 
the contract. It is used to fix the firm target profit for the contract. 
To provide an incentive consistent with the circumstances, the formula 
should reflect the relative risk involved in establishing an incentive 
arrangement where cost and pricing information were not sufficient to 
permit the negotiation of firm targets at the outset.


<R05>
216.403-70  Fixed-price contracts with award fees.

    Award fee provisions may be used in fixed price contracts as 
provided in 216.470.


<R05>
216.404  Cost-reimbursement incentive contracts.


<R05>
216.404-1  Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts.

    (b) Application.
    (3) Give appropriate weight to basic acquisition objectives in 
negotiating the range of fee and the fee adjustment formula. For 
example--
    (A) In an initial product development contract, it may be 
appropriate to provide for relatively small adjustments in fee tied to 
the cost incentive feature, but provide for significant adjustments if 
the contractor meets or surpasses performance targets.
    (B) In subsequent development and test contracts, it may be 
appropriate to negotiate an incentive formula tied primarily to the 
contractor's success in controlling costs.


<R05>
216.404-2  Cost-plus-award-fee contracts.

    (a) Description. (i) Normally, award fee is not earned when the fee-
determining official has determined that contractor performance has been 
submarginal or unsatisfactory.
    (ii) The basis for all award fee determinations shall be documented 
in the contract file.
    (b) Application. (1) The cost-plus-award-fee (CPAF) contract is also 
suitable for level of effort contracts where mission feasibility is 
established but measurement of achievement must be by subjective 
evaluation rather than objective measurement. See Table 16-1, 
Performance Evaluation Criteria, for sample performance evaluation 
criteria and Table 16-2, Contractor Performance Evaluation Report, for a 
sample evaluation report.
    (2) The contracting activity may--
    (A) Establish a board to--
    (1) Evaluate the contractor's performance; and
    (2) Determine the amount of the award or recommend an amount to the 
contracting officer.
    (B) Afford the contractor an opportunity to present information on 
its own behalf.
    (c) Limitations. The CPAF contract shall not be used--
    (i) To avoid--
    (A) Establishing CPFF contracts when the criteria for CPFF contracts 
apply, or
    (B) Developing objective targets so a CPIF contract can be used.
    (ii) For either engineering development or operational system 
development acquisitions which have specifications suitable for 
simultaneous research and development and production, except a CPAF 
contract may be used for individual engineering development or 
operational system development acquisitions ancillary to the development 
of a major weapon system or equipment, where--
    (A) It is more advantageous; and

[[Page 106]]

    (B) The purpose of the acquisition is clearly to determine or solve 
specific problems associated with the major weapon system or equipment.
    (2)(A) Do not apply the weighted guidelines method to CPAF contracts 
for either the base (fixed) fee or the award fee.
    (B) The base fee shall not exceed three percent of the estimated 
cost of the contract exclusive of the fee.


<R05>
216.470  Other applications of award fees.

    The ``award amount'' portion of the fee may be used in other types 
of contracts under the following conditions--
    (1) The Government wishes to motivate and reward a contractor for 
management performance in areas which cannot be measured objectively and 
where normal incentive provisions cannot be used. For example, logistics 
support, quality, timeliness, ingenuity, and cost effectiveness are 
areas under the control of management which may be susceptible only to 
subjective measurement and evaluation.
    (2) The ``base fee'' (fixed amount portion) is not used.
    (3) The chief of the contracting office approves the use of the 
``award amount.''
    (4) An award review board and procedures are established for conduct 
of the evaluation.
    (5) The administrative costs of evaluation do not exceed the 
expected benefits.

217.103  Procedures.


<R05>
217.103-1  General.

    (a) Criteria. 10 U.S.C. 2306(h) and annual DoD authorization and 
appropriations acts have established the following additional criteria:
    (i) The use of such a contract will promote the national security of 
the United States (10 U.S.C. 2306(h)(1)).
    (ii) The contract provides for a production rate at not less than 
minimum economic production rates given the existing tooling and 
facilities (10 U.S.C. 2306(h)(9));
    (iii) Any advance economic order quantity acquisition (see FAR 
17.101) is funded at least to the limits of the Government's liability. 
Recurring costs for such economic order quantities shall not be included 
in the unfunded cancellation ceiling. (Section 9021, Pub. L. 101-165 and 
similar sections in subsequent Defense appropriations acts).
    (b) Limitations.
    (i) Public Law 90-378 (10 U.S.C. 2306(g)).
    (A) DoD may enter into multiyear acquisitions for the following 
services (and items of supply relating to such services), even though 
funds are limited by statute to obligation during the fiscal year in 
which the contract is executed:
    (1) Operation, maintenance, and support of facilities and 
installations;
    (2) Maintenance or modification of aircraft, ships, vehicles, and 
other highly complex military equipment;
    (3) Specialized training requiring high quality instructor skills 
(e.g., training for pilots and other aircrew members or foreign language 
training); and
    (4) Base services (e.g., ground maintenance, in-plane refueling, bus 
transportation, and refuse collection and disposal).
    (B) This authority may be used as long as the contract--
    (1) Does not extend beyond five years;
    (2) Complies with FAR 17.101 through 17.105; and
    (3) Performance years do not extend beyond the end of any fiscal 
year.
    (ii) Public Law 97-214 (10 U.S.C. 2829).
    (A) DoD may enter into multiyear contracts for supplies and services 
required for management, maintenance, and operation of military family 
housing and may pay the costs of such contracts for each year out of 
annual appropriations for that year.
    (B) This authority may be used as long as the contract--
    (1) Does not extend beyond four years;
    (2) Complies with FAR 17.101 through 17.105; and
    (3) Performance years do not extend beyond the end of any fiscal 
year.
    (iii) Award of a multiyear contract for services requires a written 
determination by the head of the contracting activity (10 U.S.C. 
2306(g)(1)) that--
    (A) There will be a continuing need for the services and incidental 
supplies;
    (B) Furnishing the services and incidental supplies will require--
    (1) A substantial initial investment in plant or equipment;
    (2) The upfront commitment of substantial financial resources for 
the assembly, training or transportation of a specialized work force; or
    (3) Other substantial startup costs; and
    (C) Using a multiyear contract will be in the best interest of the 
United States by encouraging effective competition and promoting 
economical business operations.

[[Page 112]]

    (iv) The appropriate Secretary must provide a 30-day advance 
notification to the Committees on Appropriations and Armed Services of 
the House of Representatives and the Senate before the award of any--
    (A) Multiyear contract that contains a cancellation ceiling in 
excess of $100 million (10 U.S.C. 2306(h)(3));
    (B) Multiyear contract that provides for economic order quantity 
purchases in excess of $20 million in any year (Section 9021, Pub. L. 
101-165 and similar sections in subsequent appropriations acts);
    (C) Multiyear contract that includes an unfunded contingent 
liability in excess of $20 million (Section 9021, Pub. L. 101-165 and 
similar sections in subsequent appropriations acts); or
    (D) Contract for advance procurement leading to a multiyear contract 
with an economic order quantity procurement in excess of $20 million in 
any year (Section 9021, Pub. L. 101-165 and similar sections in 
subsequent appropriations acts).
    (v) Departments/agencies shall establish reporting procedures to 
meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(iv) of this subsection. Submit 
copies of the notifications to the Under Secretary of Defense 
(Acquisition & Technology), Director of Defense Procurement (USD(A&T)DP) 
and the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (Program/Budget) 
(USD(C)(P/B)).
    (vi) Do not initiate a multiyear contract--
    (A) In excess of $500 million for any system or component thereof 
unless--
    (1) Specifically provided for in a Defense appropriations act 
(section 9021, Pub. L. 101-165 and similar sections in subsequent 
appropriations acts); and
    (2) The Secretary of Defense certifies to Congress that the current 
Future Years Defense Program fully funds the support costs associated 
with the multiyear program. Forward documentation to support this 
certification to the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition & 
Technology), Director of Defense Procurement.
    (B) Without using present value analysis to determine the lowest 
cost to the Government of a multiyear contract compared to annual 
contracts (Section 9021, Pub. L. 101-165 and similar sections in 
subsequent appropriations acts).
    (vii) Do not terminate a multiyear contract under a program approved 
by Congress without providing a ten-day advance notification to the 
Committees on Appropriations and Armed Services of the House of 
Representatives and the Senate (Section 9021, Pub. L. 101-165 and 
similar sections in subsequent appropriations acts).
    (viii) The Secretary of Defense may ask Congress for relief from any 
conditions established by law for that particular procurement program 
(10 U.S.C. 2306(h)(11)).
    (A) A request for relief from the requirement to achieve specific 
cost savings may be made if it appears, after negotiations with the 
contractors, that such savings cannot be achieved, but that substantial 
savings could nevertheless be achieved by using a multiyear contract.
    (B) Include in such request details concerning the reasons for 
requesting use of a multiyear contract as well as details about the 
negotiated contract terms and conditions.
    (C) Forward supporting documentation to the Under Secretary of 
Defense (Acquisition & Technology), Director of Defense Procurement.
    (ix) Departments/agencies also must comply with any other 
restrictions or notification requirements contained in annual 
authorization or appropriation acts.
    (d) Cancellation. State cancellation ceilings in the schedule as a 
not-to-exceed amount.

    (1) Options may be used for foreign military sales requirements.
    (2) Consider use of surge options to support the Industrial 
Preparedness Production Planning program (see subpart 208.72). A surge 
option allows the Government, prior to final delivery, to--
    (i) Accelerate the contractor's production rate in accordance with a 
surge production plan or a delivery schedule

[[Page 113]]

provided by the contractor under the terms of the contract; and
    (ii) Purchase additional quantities of supplies or services.
    (3) See subpart 217.74 for limitations on the use of undefinitized 
options.

<R05>
217.208  Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.

    Sealed bid solicitations shall not include provisions for 
evaluations of options unless the contracting officer determines that 
there is a reasonable likelihood that the options will be exercised (10 
U.S.C. 2301(a)(7)). This limitation also applies to sealed bid 
solicitations for the contracts excluded by FAR 17.200.


<R05>
217.208-70  Additional clauses.

    (a) Use the clause at 252.217-7000, Exercise of Option to Fulfill 
Foreign Military Sales Commitments, when an option may be used for 
foreign military sale requirements.
    (1) Use Alternate I when the foreign military sale country is not 
known at the time of solicitation or award.
    (2) Do not use this clause in contracts for establishment or 
replenishment of DoD inventories or stocks, or acquisitions made under 
DoD cooperative logistics support arrangements.
    (b) When a surge option is needed in support of industrial 
preparedness production planning (see subpart 208.72), use the clause at 
252.217-7001, Surge Option, in solicitations and contracts.
    (1) Insert the percentage of increase the option represents in 
paragraph (a) of the clause.
    (2) Change 30 days in paragraphs (b)(2) and (d)(1) to longer 
periods, if appropriate.
    (3) Change the 24-month period in paragraph (c)(3), if appropriate.


<R04>
                Subpart 217.4--Leader Company Contracting


<R05>
217.401  General.

    When leader company contracting is to be considered, take special 
effort to select a small disadvantaged business (SDB) concern as the 
follower company. Where other than an SDB is selected as the follower 
company, the contracting officer shall document the contract file to 
reflect--
    (1) The extent of actions taken to identify SDB concerns for 
participation in the acquisition; and
    (2) The rationale for selection of a non-SDB as the follower 
company.


<R04>
      Subpart 217.5--Interagency Acquisitions Under the Economy Act


<R05>
217.500  Scope of subpart.

    Acquisitions from required sources, as described in FAR part 8, are 
not orders under the Economy Act.
[59 FR 22760, May 3, 1994]


<R05>
217.502  General.

    If requested, the contracting officer who normally would contract 
for the requesting activity should advise in the determination process.
[59 FR 22760, May 3, 1994]


<R05>
217.504  Ordering procedures.

    (b) Do not send invitations for bids or requests for proposals to 
other Government agencies.


<R04>
            Subpart 217.6--Management and Operating Contracts


<R05>
217.600  Scope of subpart.

    FAR subpart 17.6 does not apply to DoD.


<R04>
              Subpart 217.70--Exchange of Personal Property


<R05>
217.7000  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes policy and procedures for exchange of 
nonexcess personal property concurrent with an acquisition. Section 
201(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, 
63 Stat. 384, as amended (40 U.S.C. 481(c)) permits exchange of personal 
property and application of the exchange allowance to the acquisition of 
similar property. This subpart does not authorize the sale of nonexcess 
personal property.


<R05>
217.7001  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart,

[[Page 114]]

    (a) Exchange (trade-in) property means property which--
    (1) Is not excess but is eligible for replacement (because of 
obsolescence, unserviceability, or other reason); and
    (2) Is applied as whole or partial payment toward the acquisition of 
similar items (i.e., items designed and constructed for the same 
purpose).
    (b) Property means items which fall within one of the generic 
categories listed in DoDI 4140.51, Exchange of Nonexcess Personal 
Property in the Department of Defense.


<R05>
217.7002  Policy.

    DoD policy is to exchange, rather than replace, eligible nonexcess 
property whenever exchange promotes economical and efficient program 
accomplishment. Exchange policy, authority, and applicability are 
governed by--
    (a) The Federal Property Management Regulations issued by the 
Administrator of the General Services Administration; and
    (b) DoDI 4140.51, Exchange of Nonexcess Personal Property in the 
Department of Defense.


<R05>
217.7003  Purchase request.

    Ensure that the requiring activity provides all of the following in 
support of the purchase request--
    (a) A certification that the property is eligible for exchange and 
complies with all conditions and limitations of DoDI 4140.51;
    (b) A written determination of economic advantage indicating--
    (1) The anticipated economic advantage to the Government from use of 
the exchange authority;
    (2) That exchange allowances shall be applied toward, or in partial 
payment of, the items to be acquired; and
    (3) That, if required, the exchange property has been rendered safe 
or innocuous or has been demilitarized;
    (c) All applicable approvals for the exchange; and
    (d) A description of the property available for exchange (e.g., 
nomenclature, location, serial number, estimated travel value).


<R05>
217.7004  Solicitation and award.

    (a) Solicitations shall include a request for offerors to state 
prices--
    (1) For the new items being acquired without any exchange; and
    (2) For the new items with the exchange (trade-in allowance) for the 
exchange property listed.
    (b) The contracting officer is not obligated to award on an exchange 
basis. If the lowest evaluated offer is an offer for the new items 
without any exchange, the contracting officer may award on that basis 
and forgo the exchange.
    (c) Exchanges may be made only with the successful offeror. When the 
successful offer includes an exchange, award one contract for both the 
acquisition of the new property and the trade-in of the exchange 
property. The only exception is when the items must be acquired against 
a mandatory Federal supply schedule contract, in which case, award a 
separate contract for the exchange.


<R05>
217.7005  Solicitation provision.

    Use the provision at 252.217-7002, Offering Property for Exchange, 
when offering nonexcess personal property for exchange. Allow a minimum 
of 14 calendar days for the inspection period in paragraph (b) of the 
clause if the exchange property is in the continental United States. 
Allow at least 21 calendar days outside the United States.

           Subpart 217.73--Identification of Sources of Supply


<R05>
217.7300  Scope.

    This subpart implements 10 U.S.C. 2384. It contains policy and 
procedures for requiring contractors to identify the actual manufacturer 
of supplies furnished to DoD.


<R05>
217.7301  Policy.

    Contractors shall identify their sources of supply in contracts for 
supplies. Contractor identification of sources of supply enables 
solicitation, in subsequent acquisitions, of actual manufacturers or 
other suppliers of items. This enhances competition and potentially 
avoids payment of additional costs for no significant added value.


<R05>
217.7302  Procedures.

    (a) Whenever practicable, include a requirement for contractor 
identification of sources of supply in all contracts for the delivery of 
supplies. The identification shall include--
    (1) The item's actual manufacturer or producer, or all the 
contractor's sources for the item;
    (2) The item's national stock number (if there is one);
    (3) The item identification number used by--
    (i) The actual manufacturer or producer of the item; or
    (ii) Each of the contractor's sources for the item; and
    (4) The source of any technical data delivered under the contract.
    (b) The requirement in paragraph (a) of this section does not apply 
to commercial items.
[56 FR 36345, July 31, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 61596, Nov. 30, 1995]


<R05>
217.7303  Solicitation provision.

    (a) Use the provision at 252.217-7026, Identification of Sources of 
Supply, or one substantially the same, in all solicitations for supplies 
when the acquisition is being conducted under other than full and open 
competition, except when--
    (1) Using FAR 6.302-5;
    (2) The contracting officer already has the information required by 
the provision (e.g., the information was obtained under other 
acquisitions);
    (3) The contract is for subsistence, clothing or textiles, fuels, or 
supplies purchased and used outside the United States;
    (4) The contracting officer determines that it would not be 
practicable to require offerors/contractors to provide the information, 
e.g., nonrepetitive local purchases; or
    (5) The contracting officer determines that the exception at 
217.7302(b) applies to all items under the solicitation.
    (b) If appropriate, use the provision at 252.217-7026, 
Identification of Sources of Supply, or one substantially the same, in 
service contracts requiring the delivery of supplies.


<R04>
             Subpart 217.74--Undefinitized Contract Actions


<R05>
217.7400  Scope.

    This subpart prescribes policies and procedures implementing 10 
U.S.C. 2326.


<R05>
217.7401  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart--
    (a) Contract action means an action which results in a contract.
    (1) It includes contract modifications for additional supplies or 
services.
    (2) It does not include change orders, administrative changes, 
funding modifications, or any other contract modifications that are 
within the scope and under the terms of the contract, e.g., engineering 
change proposals, value

[[Page 119]]

engineering change proposals, and over and above work requests as 
described in subpart 217.77.
    (b) Definitization means the agreement on, or determination of, 
contract terms, specifications, and price, which converts the 
undefinitized contract action to a definitive contract.
    (c) Qualifying proposal means a proposal containing sufficient 
information for the DoD to do complete and meaningful analyses and 
audits of the--
    (1) Information in the proposal; and
    (2) Any other information that the contracting officer has 
determined DoD needs to review in connection with the contract.
    (d) Undefinitized contract action means any contract action for 
which the contract terms, specifications, or price are not agreed upon 
before performance is begun under the action. Examples are letter 
contracts, orders under basic ordering agreements, and provisioned item 
orders, for which the price has not been agreed upon before performance 
has begun.


<R05>
217.7402  Exceptions.

    The following undefinitized contract actions (UCAs) are not subject 
to this subpart, but the contracting officer should apply the policy to 
them (and to changes under the Changes clause) to the maximum extent 
practicable--
    (a) UCAs for foreign military sales;
    (b) Purchases at or below the simplified acquisition threshold;
    (c) Special access programs;
    (d) Congressionally mandated long-lead procurement contracts.
[56 FR 36345, July 31, 1991, as amended at 61 FR 7743, Feb. 29, 1996]


<R05>
217.7403  Policy.

    DoD policy is that undefinitized contract actions shall--
    (a) Be used only when--
    (1) The negotiation of a definitive contract action is not possible 
in sufficient time to meet the Government's requirements; and
    (2) The Government's interest demands that the contractor be given a 
binding commitment so that contract performance can begin immediately.
    (b) Be as complete and definite as practicable under the particular 
circumstances.


<R05>
217.7404  Limitations.


<R05>
217.7404-1  Authorization.

    The contracting officer shall obtain approval from the head of the 
contracting activity before--
    (a) Entering into a UCA. The request for approval must fully explain 
the need to begin performance before definitization, including the 
adverse impact on agency requirements resulting from delays in beginning 
performance.
    (b) Including requirements for non-urgent spare parts and support 
equipment in a UCA. The request should show that inclusion of the non-
urgent items is consistent with good business practices and in the best 
interest of the United States.
    (c) Modifying the scope of a UCA when performance has already begun. 
The request should show that the modification is consistent with good 
business practices and in the best interests of the United States.


<R05>
217.7404-2  Price ceiling.

    UCAs shall include a not-to-exceed price.


<R05>
217.7404-3  Definitization schedule.

    (a) UCAs shall contain definitization schedules which provide for 
definitization by the earlier of the following dates--
    (1) The date which is 180 days after issuance of the action (this 
date may be extended but may not exceed the date which is 180 days after 
the contractor submits a qualifying proposal); or
    (2) The date on which the amount of funds obligated under the 
contract action is equal to more than 50 percent of the not-to-exceed 
price.
    (b) Submission of a qualifying proposal in accordance with the 
definitization schedule is a material element of the contract. If the 
contractor does not submit a timely qualifying proposal, the contracting 
officer may suspend or reduce progress payments under FAR 32.503-6, or 
take other appropriate action.
[56 FR 36345, July 31, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 29498, June 5, 1995; 61 
FR 7743, Feb. 29, 1996]

[[Page 120]]


<R05>
217.7404-4  Limitations on obligations.

    The Government shall not obligate more than 50 percent of the not-
to-exceed price before definitization. However, if a contractor submits 
a qualifying proposal before 50 percent of the not-to-exceed price has 
been obligated by the Government, then the limitation on obligations 
before definitization may be increased to no more than 75 percent (see 
232.102-70 for coverage on provisional delivery payments).
[60 FR 29498, June 5, 1995]


<R05>
217.7404-5  Exceptions.

    (a) The limitations in 217.7404-2, 217.7404-3, and 217.7404-4 do not 
apply to UCAs for the purchase of initial spares.
    (b) The head of an agency may waive the limitations in 217.7404-2, 
217.7404-3, and 217.7404-4 for UCAs if the head of the agency determines 
that the waiver is necessary to support a contingency operation.
[60 FR 29498, June 5, 1995]


<R05>
217.7404-6  Allowable profit.

    When the final price of a UCA is negotiated after a substantial 
portion of the required performance has been completed, the head of the 
agency shall ensure the profit allowed reflects--
    (a) Any reduced cost risk to the contractor for costs incurred 
during contract performance before negotiation of the final price; and
    (b) The contractor's reduced cost risk for costs incurred during 
performance of the remainder of the contract.


<R05>
217.7405  Definitizations.

    For each definitization modification, the contracting officer shall 
include all data required by 243.171.
[60 FR 34470, July 3, 1995]


<R05>
217.7406  Contract clauses.

    (a) Use the clause at FAR 52.216-24, Limitation of Government 
Liability, in all UCAs, solicitations associated with UCAs, basic 
ordering agreements, indefinite delivery contracts, and any other type 
of contract providing for the use of UCAs.
    (b) Use the clause at 252.217-7027, Contract Definitization, in all 
UCAs, solicitations associated with UCAs, basic ordering agreements, 
indefinite delivery contracts, and any other type of contract providing 
for the use of UCAs. Insert the applicable information in paragraphs 
(a), (b), and (d) of the clause. If, at the time of entering into the 
UCA, the contracting officer knows that the definitive contract action 
will meet the criteria of FAR 15.804-1 for not requiring submission of 
cost or pricing data, the words ``and cost or pricing data'' may be 
deleted from paragraph (a) of the clause.

    Departments and agencies--
    (a) May acquire replenishment parts concurrently with production of 
the end item.
    (b) Shall provide for full and open competition when fully adequate 
drawings and any other needed data are available with the right to use 
for acquisition purposes (see part 227). However--
    (1) When data is not available for a competitive acquisition, use 
one of the procedures in 217.7503.
    (2) Replenishment parts must be acquired so as to ensure the safe, 
dependable, and effective operation of the equipment. Where this 
assurance is not possible with new sources, competition may be limited 
to the original manufacturer of the equipment or other sources that have 
previously manufactured or furnished the parts as long as the action is 
justified.
    (c) Shall follow the limitations on price increases in 217.7504.


<R05>
217.7502  Spares acquisition integrated with production (SAIP).

technique used to acquire replenishment parts

[[Page 121]]

concurrently with parts being produced for the end item.
    (b) DoD acquisition managers select parts for SAIP under the 
criteria in DoDI 4245.12, Spares Acquisition Integrated With Production 
(SAIP).
    (c) Include appropriately tailored provisions in the contract when 
SAIP is used.


<R05>
217.7503  Acquisition of parts when data is not available.

    When acquiring a part for which the Government does not have 
necessary data with rights to use in a specification or drawing for 
competitive acquisition, use one of the following procedures in order of 
preference--
    (a) When items of identical design are not required, the acquisition 
may still be conducted through full and open competition by using a 
performance specification or other similar technical requirement or 
purchase description that does not contain data with restricted rights. 
Two methods are--
    (1) Two-step sealed bidding; and
    (2) Brand name or equal purchase descriptions.
    (b) When other than full and open competition is authorized under 
FAR part 6, acquire the part from the firm which developed or designed 
the item or process, or its licensees, provided productive capacity and 
quality are adequate and the price is fair and reasonable.
    (c) When additional sources are needed and the procedures in 
paragraph (a) of this section are not practicable, consider the 
following alternatives--
    (1) Encourage the developer to license others to manufacture the 
parts;
    (2) Acquire the necessary rights in data;
    (3) Use a leader company acquisition technique (FAR subpart 17.4) 
when complex technical equipment is involved and establishing 
satisfactory additional sources will require technical assistance as 
well as data; or
    (4) Incorporate a priced option in the contract which allows the 
Government to require the contractor to establish a second source.
    (d) As a last alternative, the contracting activity may develop a 
design specification for competitive acquisition through reverse 
engineering. Contracting activities shall not do reverse engineering 
unless--
    (1) Significant cost savings can be demonstrated; and
    (2) The action is authorized by the head of the contracting 
activity.


<R05>
217.7504  Limitations on price increases.

    This section provides implementing guidance for section 1215 of 
Public Law 98-94 (10 U.S.C. 2452 note).
    (a) The contracting officer shall not award, on a sole source basis, 
a contract for any centrally managed replenishment part when the price 
of the part has increased by 25 percent or more over the most recent 12-
month period.
    (1) Before computing the percentage difference between the current 
price and the prior price, adjust for quantity, escalation, and other 
factors necessary to achieve comparability.
    (2) Departments and agencies may specify an alternate percentage or 
percentages for contracts within the small purchase limitation in FAR 
part 13.
    (b) The contracting officer may award a contract for a part, the 
price of which exceeds the limitation in paragraph (a) of this section, 
if the contracting officer certifies in writing to the head of the 
contracting activity before award that--
    (1) The contracting officer has evaluated the price of the part and 
concluded that the price increase is fair and reasonable; or
    (2) The national security interests of the United States require 
purchase of the part despite the price increase.
    (c) The fact that a particular price has not exceeded the limitation 
in paragraph (a) of this section does not relieve the contracting 
officer of the responsibility for obtaining a fair and reasonable price.
    (d) Contracting officers may include a provision in sole source 
solicitations requiring that the offeror supply with its proposal, price 
and quantity data on any government orders for the replenishment part 
issued within the most recent 12 months.

                   Subpart 217.77--Over and Above Work


<R05>
217.7700  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for acquisition of 
over and above work.

[[Page 124]]


<R05>
217.7701  Procedures.

    (a) Contracts for the performance of maintenance, overhaul, 
modification, and repair of various items (e.g., aircraft, engines, 
ground support equipment, ships) generally contain over and above work 
requirements. When they do, the contracting officer shall establish a 
separate contract line item for the over and above work.
    (b) Over and above requirements task the contractor to identify 
needed repairs and recommend corrective action during contract 
performance. The contractor submits a work request to identify the over 
and above work and, as appropriate, the Government authorizes the 
contractor to proceed.
    (c) The clause at 252.217-7028, Over and Above Work, requires the 
contractor and the contracting officer responsible for administering the 
contract to negotiate specific procedures for Government administration 
and contractor performance of over and above work requests.
    (d) The contracting officer may issue a blanket work request 
authorization describing the manner in which individual over and above 
work requests will be administered and setting forth a dollar limitation 
for all over and above work under the contract. The blanket work request 
authorization may be in the form of a letter or contract modification 
(Standard Form 30).
    (e) Over and above work requests are within the scope of the 
contract. Therefore, procedures in subpart 217.74, Undefinitized 
Contractual Actions, do not apply.
    (f) To the maximum extent practical, over and above work shall be 
negotiated prior to performance of the work.


<R05>

219.000  Scope of part.

    This part also implements 10 U.S.C. 2323, which sets a goal for DoD 
for each of fiscal years 1987 through 2000 to--
    (1) Award five percent of contract and subcontract dollars to small 
disadvantaged business (SDB) concerns, historically black colleges and 
universities (HBCUs), and minority institutions (MIs) (See part 226 for 
policy/procedures on HBCU/MIs); and

[[Page 128]]

    (B) Within the 6 months preceding submission of its offer, the 
offeror was determined by the Small Business Administration to be 
socially and economically disadvantaged, and no circumstances have 
changed to vary that determination.
[56 FR 36353, July 31, 1991, as amended at 59 FR 22131, Apr. 29, 1994; 
62 FR 2613, Jan. 17, 1997]


<R05>
219.302  Protesting a small business representation.


<R05>
219.302-70  Protesting a small disadvantaged business representation.

    This section applies to protests of a small business concern's 
status as socially and economically disadvantaged. Protests of a 
concern's size are processed under FAR 19.302. Any offeror, the 
contracting officer, or the Small Business Administration (SBA) may 
protest a concern's representation of disadvantaged status.
    (a) An offeror may protest a concern's representation of 
disadvantaged status by filing a protest with the contracting officer. 
The protest--
    (1) Must be filed within the times specified in FAR 19.302(d)(1); 
and
    (2) Must contain specific detailed evidence supporting the basis of 
protest.
    (b) The contracting officer or the SBA may protest a concern's 
representation of disadvantaged status at any time.
    (1) If a contracting officer's protest is based on information 
brought to his/her attention by a party ineligible to protest directly 
or ineligible to protest under the timeliness standard, the contracting 
officer must be persuaded by the evidence presented before adopting the 
grounds for protest as his or her own.
    (2) The SBA protests a concern's representation of disadvantaged 
status by filing directly with its Office of Program Eligibility and 
notifying the contracting officer.
    (c) The contracting officer shall return untimely protests to the 
protestor. This includes protests filed before bid opening or 
notification of apparent successful offeror.
    (d) Upon receipt of a timely protest, the contracting officer shall 
withhold award and forward the protest to the SBA Office of Program 
Eligibility, Office of Minority Small Business and Capitol Ownership 
Development, 409 3rd Street, SW., Washington, DC 20416. Send SBA--
    (1) The protest;
    (2) The date the protest was received and a determination of 
timeliness; and
    (3) The date of bid opening or date on which notification of 
apparent successful offeror was sent to unsuccessful offerors.
    (e) Do not withhold award when--
    (1) The contracting officer makes a written determination that award 
must be made to protect the public interest; or
    (2) The offeror represents that, within the 6 months preceding 
submission of its offer, the SBA has determined the concern to be 
socially and economically disadvantaged, and no circumstances have 
changed to vary that determination.
    (f) The SBA Director, Office of Program Eligibility, will determine 
the disadvantaged status of the challenged offeror and notify the 
contracting officer, the challenged offeror, and the protestor. Award 
may be made on the basis of that determination. The determination is 
final for purposes of the instant acquisition, unless--
    (1) It is appealed; and
    (2) The contracting officer receives the appeal decision before 
award.
    (g) If the contracting officer does not receive an SBA determination 
within 15 working days after the SBA's receipt of the protest, the 
contracting officer shall presume that the challenged offeror is 
socially and economically disadvantaged. Do not use the presumption as a 
basis for award without first inquiring as to when a determination can 
be expected and waiting for the determination, unless further delay in 
award would be disadvantageous to the Government.
    (h) An SBA determination may be appealed by--
    (1) The interested party whose protest has been denied;
    (2) The concern whose status was protested; or
    (3) The contracting officer.

[[Page 129]]

    The appeal must be filed with the SBA's Associate Administrator for

solicitations and contracts that contain the clause at FAR 52.219-9, 
Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business Subcontracting 
Plan.
    (B) In contracts with contractors which have comprehensive 
subcontracting plans approved under the test program described in 
219.702(a), use the clause at 252.219-7004, Small, Small Disadvantaged 
and Women-Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan (Test Program), 
instead of the clauses at 252.219-7003, Small, Small Disadvantaged and 
Women-Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan (DoD Contracts), and FAR 
52.219-9, Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business 
Subcontracting Plan.
    (2) In contracts with contractors which have comprehensive 
subcontracting plans approved under the test program described in

Business Subcontracting Plan. Incentives for exceeding SDB 
subcontracting goals shall be paid only if an SDB subcontracting goal 
was exceeded as a result of actual subcontract awards to SDBs, and not 
as a result of developmental assistant credit under the Pilot Mentor-
Protege Program (see subpart 219.71).
    (B) Use the clause at 252.219-7005 with its Alternate I when, in the 
judgement of the contracting officer, inclusion of an incentive is 
necessary to increase subcontracting opportunities for other small 
businesses.
    (C) Determine the percentage to be negotiated and used in the clause 
by considering the type and extent of effort required to exceed the 
goal, for example--
    (1) Unique outreach programs;
    (2) Use of small disadvantaged businesses, historically black 
colleges and universities, and minority institutions in nontraditional 
areas;
    (3) Technical assistance to qualify or assist these entities; and
    (4) Proximity of subcontractors to the prime.
    (D) Do not use the clauses at 252.219-7005 and FAR 52.219-10 in

[[Page 134]]

    (c)(2) For negotiated acquisitions of $10 million or more, the 
contracting officer may use an award fee provision instead of the 
incentive provision required by (c)(1)(A). When an award fee provision 
is used, do not use the clauses at 252.219-7005, Incentive for 
Subcontracting with Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Minority Institutions, 
and FAR 52.219-10, Incentive Subcontracting Program for Small and Small 
Disadvantaged Business Concerns. Do not use award fee provisions in 
contracts with contractors which have comprehensive subcontracting plans 
approved under the test program described in 219.702(a).

less than the emerging small business reserve amount and less than 
$85,000.
    (4) Be considered for small business set-aside (but not SDB set-
aside) if the estimated value is less than $85,000, regardless of 
whether small business set-asides for other architect-engineer services 
are prohibited under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration 
Program, when an ESB set-aside is not appropriate.

under section 831 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 1991, Public Law 101-510, as amended. The purpose of the Program is 
to provide incentives for DoD contractors to assist small disadvantaged 
businesses in enhancing their capabilities and to increase participation 
of such firms in Government and commercial contracts. Qualified 
organizations employing the severely disabled, as defined in section 
8064A of Public Law 102-172, are also eligible to participate as protege 
firms.


<R05>
219.7101  Policy.

    DoD policy and procedures for implementation of the Program are 
contained in appendix I to chapter 2, Policy and Procedures for the DoD 
Pilot Mentor-Protege Program.


<R05>
219.7102  General.

    The Program includes--
    (a) Mentor firms, which are prime contractors with at least one 
active subcontracting plan negotiated under FAR subpart 19.7.
    (b) Protege firms, which are small disadvantaged business (SDB) 
concerns or qualified organizations employing the severely disabled, 
eligible for receipt of Federal contracts and selected by the mentor 
firm.
    (c) Mentor-protege agreements, which establish a developmental 
assistance program for a protege firm.
    (d) Incentives, which may be provided to mentor firms by the DoD 
including:
    (1) Reimbursement for developmental assistance costs through--
    (i) A separate contract;
    (ii) A separately priced contract line item on a DoD contract; or
    (iii) Inclusion of program cost in indirect expense pools.
    (2) Credit toward SDB subcontracting goals, established under a 
subcontracting plan negotiated under FAR subpart 19.7, for developmental 
assistance costs which are either reimbursed through indirect expense 
pools or are not reimbursed; or
    (3) A combination of reimbursement and credit.


<R05>

<R05>
219.7103-1  General.

    The procedures for application, acceptance, and participation in the 
program are in appendix I to chapter 2, Policy and Procedures for the 
DoD Pilot Mentor-Protege Program. The Director of Small and 
Disadvantaged Business Utilization, Office of the Under Secretary of 
Defense (Acquisition and Technology) approves contractors as mentor 
firms, approves mentor-protege agreements, and forwards approved mentor-
protege agreements to the contracting officer when program funding is 
available through a DoD Program Manager.


<R05>
219.7103-2  Contracting officer responsibilities.

    Contracting officers shall--
    (a) Negotiate an advance agreement on the treatment of developmental 
assistance costs for credit, reimbursement, or both, if the mentor firm 
proposes such an agreement, or delegate

[[Page 137]]

authority to negotiate to the administrative contracting officer (see 
FAR 31.109).
    (b) Modify (without consideration) applicable contract(s) to 
incorporate the clause at 252.232-7005, Reimbursement of Subcontractor 
Advance Payments-DoD Pilot Mentor-Protege Program, when advance payments 
are provided by a mentor firm to a protege firm under the Program and 
the mentor firm requests reimbursement of advance payments.
    (c) Modify (without consideration) applicable contract(s) to 
incorporate other than customary progress payments for small 
disadvantaged businesses in accordance with FAR 32.504(c) if such 
payments are provided by a mentor firm to a protege firm and the mentor 
firm requests reimbursement.
    (d) Modify applicable contract(s) to establish a contract line item 
for reimbursement of developmental assistance costs--
    (1) When funds have been made available for that purpose by a DoD 
program manager; and
    (2) The contractor has an approved mentor-protege agreement.
    (e) Advise contractors of reporting requirements in appendix I to 
chapter 2.


<R05>
219.7104  Developmental assistance costs eligible for reimbursement or credit.

    (a) Developmental assistance provided under an approved mentor-
protege agreement is distinct from, and shall not duplicate, any effort 
that is the normal and expected product of the award and administration 
of the mentor firm's subcontracts. Costs associated with the latter 
shall be accumulated and charged in accordance with the contractor's 
approved accounting practices. Mentor firm costs which are eligible for 
reimbursement are set forth in appendix I to chapter 2.
    (b) Before incurring any costs under the Program, mentor firms need 
to establish the accounting treatment of developmental assistance costs 
eligible for reimbursement or credit. Advance agreements are encouraged. 
To be eligible for reimbursement under the Program, costs must be 
incurred before October 1, 1999.
    (c) If the mentor firm is suspended or debarred while performing 
under an approved mentor-protege agreement, the mentor firm may not be 
reimbursed or credited for developmental assistance costs incurred more 
than 30 days after the imposition of the suspension or debarment.
    (d) Developmental assistance costs, incurred by a mentor firm before 
October 1, 1999, that are eligible for crediting under the Program may 
be credited towards subcontracting plan goals as set forth in appendix I 
to chapter 2.

    Mentor firms shall report on the progress made under active mentor-
protege agreements semi-annually as indicated in section I-111 of 
appendix I to chapter 2.

        (SDB) Concerns in Construction Acquisitions--Test Program

    Source:  61 FR 18688, Apr. 29, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
219.7200  Policy.

    DoD policy is to ensure that, during this test program, offers from 
small disadvantaged business (SDB) concerns shall be given an evaluation 
preference in construction acquisitions.


<R05>
219.7201  Administration of the test program.

    The test program will be conducted over a 36-month period. The test 
program will be conducted by all DoD contracting activities that award 
construction contracts. The focal point for the test program is the 
Director, Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (SADBU), Office 
of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (International and Commercial 
Programs). The military departments and defense agencies shall submit 
status reports to the Director, SADBU. The first status report shall be 
submitted 18 months after initiation of the test program;

[[Page 138]]

the second status report shall be submitted 36 months after initiation 
of the test program. These reports shall specify the impact of the 
evaluation preference over each of the reporting periods of the test 
program, and shall provide recommendations with respect to continuation 
and/or modification of the evaluation preference.
[61 FR 18688, Apr. 29, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 50452, Sept. 26, 1996]


<R05>
219.7202  Applicability.

    (a) The evaluation preference shall be used in competitive 
acquisitions for construction (see definition in FAR Subpart 36.1) when 
work is to be performed inside the United States, its territories or 
possessions, Puerto Rico, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or 
the District of Columbia.
    (b) Do not use the evaluation preference in acquisitions which--
    (1) Are less than or equal to the simplified acquisition threshold;
    (2) Are set aside for small businesses; or
    (3) Are awarded under section 8(a) procedures.
    (c) The evaluation preference need not be applied when the head of

having a disproportionate impact on non-SDB concerns or nondisadvantaged 
small business concerns.


<R05>
219.7203  Procedures.

    (a) Solicitations that require bonding shall require offerors to 
separately state bond costs in the offer. Bond costs include the costs 
of bid, performance, and payment bonds.
    (b) Evaluate total offers. If the apparently successful offeror is 
an SDB concern, no preference-based evaluation is required under this 
subpart.
    (c) If the apparently successful offeror is not an SDB concern, 
evaluate offers excluding bond costs. If, after excluding bond costs, 
the apparently successful offeror is an SDB concern, add bond costs back 
to all offers, and give offers from SDB concerns a preference in 
evaluation by adding a factor of 10 percent to the total price of all 
offers, except--
    (1) Offers from SDBs which have not waived the evaluation 
preference; and
    (2) Offers from historically black colleges and universities or 
minority institutions, which have not waived the evaluation preference.

222.101-3-70  Impact of labor disputes on defense programs.

    (a) Each department and agency shall determine the degree of impact 
of potential or actual labor disputes on its own programs and 
requirements. In making these determinations, consider, for example--

    (b) Each contracting activity involved shall obtain and develop data 
reflecting the impact of a labor dispute on its requirements and 
programs. Upon determining the impact, the head of the contracting 
activity shall submit a report of findings and recommendations to the 
labor advisor. The report must be in narrative form and include--

    (d) The labor advisor will expand the report submitted under 
paragraph (c) of this subsection by addressing the following, as 
appropriate--
    (1) Description of military program, project, or service. Identify 
item, project, or service which will be or is being affected by the work 
stoppage. Describe its normal use and current functions in combat, 
combat support, or deterrent operations. For components or raw 
materials, identify the end item(s) for which they are used.
    (2) Requirements and assets. Identify requirements and assets in 
appropriate detail in terms commonly used by the DoD component.
    (i) For production programs, include requirements for each using 
military service. Where applicable, state in detail production schedule, 
inventory objectives, assets against these objectives, and critical 
shortages. For spares and highly expendable items, such as ground and 
air ammunition, show usage (consumption) rates and assets in absolute 
terms and in terms of daily, weekly, or monthly supplies. For 
components, include requirements for spares.
    (ii) For projects, describe the potential adverse effects of a delay 
in meeting schedules, and its impact on the national security.
    (iii) For services, describe how a loss or interruption affects the 
ability to support Defense operations in terms of traffic requirements, 
assets, testing programs, etc.
    (3) Possible measures to minimize strike impact. Describe--
    (i) Capabilities, if any, to substitute items or to use alternate 
sources and indicate the number of other facilities available and the 
relative capabilities

[[Page 141]]

of such facilities in meeting total requirements;
    (ii) How much time would be required to replace the loss of the 
facilities or service affected by a work stoppage; and
    (iii) The feasibility of transferring assets from theater to theater 
to relieve deficits in some areas of urgency.
    (4) Conclusion. (i) Describe the impact on operations of a 15-30, 
30-60, and a 60-90 day work stoppage.
    (ii) Project the degree of criticality of a program, project, or 
service resulting from a work stoppage on a calendar basis, indicating 
the increased impact, if any, as the stoppage lengthens. Criticality is 
measured by the number of days required for the work stoppage to have an 
effect on operational capability. This time must be stated in terms of 
days.


<R05>
222.101-4  Removal of items from contractors' facilities affected by work stoppages.

    (a) When a contractor is unable to deliver urgent and critical items 
because of a work stoppage at its facility, the contracting officer, 
before removing any items from the facility, shall--
    (i) Before initiating any action, contact the labor advisor to 
obtain the opinion of the national office of the Federal Mediation and 
Conciliation Service or other mediation agency regarding the effect 
movement of the items would have on labor negotiations. Normally 
removals will not be made if they will adversely affect labor 
negotiations.
    (ii) Upon the recommendation of the labor advisor, provide a written 
request for removal of the material to the cognizant contract 
administration office. Include the following information in the 
request--
    (A) Contract number;
    (B) A statement as to the urgency and criticality of the item 
needed;
    (C) A description of the items to be moved (nature of the item, 
amount, approximate weight and cubic feet, item number, etc.);
    (D) Mode of transportation by which the items are to be moved, if 
different than in the contract, and whether by Government or commercial 
bill of lading; and
    (E) Destination of the material, if different from that specified in 
the contract.
    (iii) With the assistance of the labor advisor or the commander of 
the contract administration office, attempt to have both the management 
and the labor representatives involved agree to shipment of the material 
by normal means.
    (iv) If agreement for removal of the needed items cannot be reached 
following the procedures in paragraphs (a) (i) through (iii) of this 
subsection, the commander of the contract administration office, after 
obtaining approval from the labor advisor, may seek the concurrence of 
the parties to the dispute to permit movement of the material by 
military vehicles with military personnel. On receipt of such 
concurrences, the commander may proceed to make necessary arrangements 
to move the material.
    (v) If agreement for removal of the needed items cannot be reached 
following any of the procedures in paragraphs (a) (i) through (iv) of 
this subsection, refer the matter to the labor advisor with the 
information required by 222.101-3-70(b). If the labor advisor is 
unsuccessful in obtaining concurrence of the parties for the movement of 
the material and further action to obtain the material is deemed 
necessary, refer the matter to the agency head. Upon review and 
verification that the items are urgently or critically needed and cannot 
be moved with the consent of the parties, the agency head, on a 
nondelegable basis, may order removal of the items from the facility.


<R05>
222.101-70  Acquisition of stevedoring services during labor disputes.

    (a) Use the following procedures only in the order listed when a 
labor dispute delays performance of a contract for stevedoring services

military supplies from the labor dispute by continuing the movement of 
such material.
    (2) Divert vessels to alternate ports able to provide necessary 
stevedoring services.

[[Page 142]]

    (3) Consider contracting with reliable alternative sources of supply 
within the stevedoring industry.

by contract stevedores.
    (5) Utilize military personnel to handle the cargo which was being 
handled by contract stevedores prior to the labor dispute.
    (b) Notify the labor advisor when a deviation from the procedures in 
paragraph (a) of this subsection is required.

<R04>
   Subpart 222.4--Labor Standards for Contracts Involving Construction


<R05>
222.402  Applicability.


<R05>
222.402-70  Installation support contracts.

    (a) Apply both the Service Contract Act (SCA) and the Davis-Bacon 
Act (DBA) to installation support contracts if--
    (1) The contract is principally for services but also requires a 
substantial and segregable amount of construction, alteration, 
renovation, painting, or repair work; and
    (2) The aggregate dollar value of such construction work exceeds or 
is expected to exceed $2,000.
    (b) SCA coverage under the contract. Contract installation support 
requirements, such as plant operation and installation services (i.e., 
custodial, snow removal, etc.) are subject to the SCA. Apply SCA clauses 
and minimum wage and fringe benefit requirements to all contract service 
calls or orders for such maintenance and support work.
    (c) DBA coverage under the contract. Contract construction, 
alteration, renovation, painting, and repair requirements (i.e., roof 
shingling, building structural repair, paving repairs, etc.) are subject 
to the DBA. Apply DBA clauses and minimum wage requirements to all 
contract service calls or orders for construction, alteration, 
renovation, painting, or repairs to buildings or other works.
    (d) Repairs versus maintenance. Some contract work may be 
characterized as either DBA painting/repairs or SCA maintenance. For 
example, replacing broken windows, spot painting, or minor patching of a 
wall could be covered by either the DBA or the SCA. In those instances 
where a contract service call or order requires construction trade 
skills (i.e., carpenter, plumber, painter, etc.), but it is unclear 
whether the work required is SCA maintenance or DBA painting/repairs, 
apply the following rules--
    (1) Individual service calls or orders which will require a total of 
32 or more work-hours to perform shall be considered to be repair work 
subject to the DBA.
    (2) Individual service calls or orders which will require less than 
32 work-hours to perform shall be considered to be maintenance subject 
to the SCA.
    (3) Painting work of 200 square feet or more to be performed under 
an individual service call or order shall be considered to be subject to 
the DBA regardless of the total work-hours required.
    (e) The determination of labor standards application shall be made 
at the time the solicitation is prepared in those cases where 
requirements can be identified. Otherwise, the determination shall be 
made at the time the service call or order is placed against the 
contract. The service call or order shall identify the labor standards 
law and contract wage determination which will apply to the work 
required.
    (f) Contracting officers may not avoid application of the DBA by 
splitting individual tasks between orders or contracts.

223.370  Safety precautions for ammunition and explosives.


<R05>
223.370-1  Scope.

    (a) This section applies to all acquisitions involving the use of 
ammunition and explosives, including acquisitions for--
    (1) Development;
    (2) Testing;
    (3) Research;
    (4) Manufacturing;
    (5) Handling or loading;
    (6) Assembling;
    (7) Packaging;
    (8) Storage;
    (9) Transportation;
    (10) Renovation;
    (11) Demilitarization;
    (12) Modification;
    (13) Repair;
    (14) Disposal;
    (15) Inspection; or
    (16) Any other use, including acquisitions requiring the use or the 
incorporation of materials listed in paragraph (b) of this subsection 
for initiation, propulsion, or detonation as an integral or component 
part of an explosive, an ammunition, or explosive end item or weapon 
system.
    (b) This section does not apply to acquisitions solely for--
    (1) Inert components containing no explosives, propellants, or 
pyrotechnics;
    (2) Flammable liquids;
    (3) Acids;
    (4) Oxidizers;
    (5) Powdered metals; or
    (6) Other materials having fire or explosive characteristics.


<R05>
223.370-2  Definition.

    Ammunition and explosives, as used in this section, is defined in 
the clause at 252.223-7002, Safety Precautions for Ammunition and 
Explosives.


<R05>
223.370-3  Policy.

    (a) DoD policy is to ensure that its contractors take reasonable 
precautions in handling ammunition and explosives so as to minimize the 
potential for mishaps that could--
    (1) Interrupt DoD operations;
    (2) Delay project or product completion dates;
    (3) Adversely impact DoD mission readiness, production base, or 
production capabilities;
    (4) Damage or destroy DoD property; or
    (5) Cause injury to DoD personnel.
    (b) This policy is implemented by DoD Manual 4145.26-M, DoD 
Contractors' Safety Manual for Ammunition and Explosives, which is 
incorporated into contracts under which ammunition and explosives are 
handled. The manual contains mandatory safety requirements for 
contractors. When work is to be performed on a Government-owned 
installation, the contracting officer may use the ammunition and 
explosives regulation of the DoD component or installation as a 
substitute for, or supplement to, DoD Manual 4145.26-M, as long as the 
contract cites these regulations.

[[Page 153]]


<R05>
223.370-4  Procedures.

    (a) Preaward phase--(1) Waiver of the mandatory requirements. (i) 
Before either omitting the clause at 252.223-7002, Safety Precautions 
for Ammunition and Explosives, from solicitations and contracts or 
waiving the mandatory requirements of the manual, obtain approval of--
    (A) The safety personnel responsible for ammunition and explosives 
safety; and
    (B) The head of the contracting activity.
    (ii) If the contracting officer decides to waive the mandatory 
requirements before award, the contracting officer shall set forth in 
the solicitation, or in an amendment of the solicitation, the specific 
requirements to be waived.
    (iii) If the head of the contracting activity declines to approve a 
request for waiver, but the prospective contractor agrees to take 
corrective action to bring the operation into compliance, make the 
corrective action a part of the resulting contract.
    (2) Transportation considerations--If shipment of ammunition and 
explosives is involved in the contract, address in the schedule of the 
contract the applicable Department of Transportation or Military Traffic 
Management Command requirements and any other requirements for 
transportation, packaging, marking, and labeling.
    (3) Disposition of excess--Include instructions within the contract 
concerning final disposition of excess Government furnished material 
containing ammunition and explosives, including defective or rejected 
supplies.
    (4) Preaward survey--Before awarding any contract, including 
purchase orders, involving ammunition and explosives, obtain a preaward 
ammunition and explosives safety survey. If the prospective contractor 
proposes subcontracting any ammunitions or explosive work, include a 
review of the subcontractor's facility in the preaward survey.
    (b) Postaward phase--(1) Contract administration office 
responsibility. (i) The contract administration office is responsible 
for verifying that the safety requirements of the clause at 252.223-

7002, Safety Precautions for Ammunition and Explosives, are being 
implemented in a manner that will reduce, to the maximum extent 
practicable, or eliminate the probability of a mishap occurring.
    (ii) The clause at 252.223-7002, Safety Precautions for Ammunition 
and Explosives, requires the contractor to submit to the administrative 
contracting officer (ACO) any postaward requests for a waiver of the 
contract safety standards, a site plan modification, or a construction 
review. The ACO shall review any request and make recommendations to the 
contracting officer. The contracting officer shall make a decision after 
considering recommendations of the ACO and safety personnel responsible 
for ammunition and explosive safety.
    (A) If the request arrives at the contracting office without 
evidence that the ACO has seen it, immediately send it to the ACO for 
review and recommendations.
    (B) When the contracting officer has made a determination approving 
or disapproving the contractor's request, send the determination to the 
ACO for transmission to the contractor.
    (2) Subcontracts--(i) The clause at 252.223-7002, Safety Precautions 
for Ammunition and Explosives, requires the contractor to notify the 
contracting officer when placing a subcontract for ammunition and 
explosives. The contracting officer should coordinate with the safety 
personnel and request supporting contract administration in accordance 
with FAR 42.204. If the contracting officer believes the nature of the 
subcontract work poses a potential danger to Government property, 
Government personnel, production capability, or contract completion, 
request supporting contract administration.
    (ii) If the preaward safety survey identified areas in which a 
subcontractor was not complying with the manual, and the subcontractor 
was supposed to correct the deficiencies before start-up, the 
contracting officer shall require a preoperations survey to verify that 
the corrections were made.
    (iii) When postaward safety reviews by the Government uncover any 
safety deficiencies in the subcontractor's operation, the review team 
shall inform

[[Page 154]]

the ACO cognizant of the subcontractor, who shall immediately notify the 
ACO cognizant of the prime contractor. The ACO cognizant of the prime 
shall inform the prime contractor of deficiencies requiring correction. 
The notifications shall be made by the most expeditious means 
appropriate to the circumstance. If a critical safety deficiency poses 
an imminent danger, the ACO cognizant of the prime shall make the 
notifications by the most expeditious means available.

before approval of the written determination required by FAR 
23.404(b)(3). The approving official shall be--
    (A) A general or flag officer, or a member of the Senior Executive 
Service, of the requiring activity; or
    (B) For requiring activities without a general or flag officer or 
member of the Senior Executive Service, the commander of the activity.

section, are defined in the clause at 252.223-7004, Drug-Free Work 
Force.


<R05>
223.570-2  Policy.

    DoD policy is to ensure that its contractors maintain a program for 
achieving a drug-free work force.


<R05>
223.570-3  General.

    (a) The use of illegal drugs is inconsistent with the law-abiding 
behavior expected of all citizens. Employees who use illegal drugs tend 
to be less productive, less reliable, and prone to greater absenteeism. 
The use of illegal drugs by contractor employees results in the 
potential for increased cost, delay, and risk in the performance of a 
Government contract.
    (b) If a contractor's employees use illegal drugs at any time, it 
can--
    (1) Impair their ability to perform tasks that are critical to 
proper contract performance;
    (2) Increase the potential for accidents and for failures that can 
pose a serious threat to the national security, health, and safety;
    (3) Cause less than the complete reliability, stability, and good 
judgment required of an individual who has access to sensitive 
information;
    (4) Create the possibility of coercion, influence, and irresponsible 
action under pressure that may post a serious risk to national security, 
health, and safety.


<R05>
223.570-4  Contract clause.

    (a) Use the clause at 252.223-7004, Drug-Free Work Force, in all 
solicitations and contracts--
    (1) That involve access to classified information; or
    (2) When the contracting officer determines that the clause is 
necessary for reasons of national security or for the purpose of 
protecting the health or safety of those using or affected by the 
product of, or performance of, the contract.
    (b) Do not use the clause in solicitations and contracts for--
    (1) Commercial items; or

[[Page 155]]

    (2) Performance or partial performance outside the United States, 
its territories, and possessions, unless the contracting officer 
determines such inclusion to be in the best interest of the Government.

    Section 211.271, Elimination of use of class I ozone-depleting 
substances, places restrictions on award or modification of DoD 
contracts requiring the use of class I ozone-depleting substances. These 
restrictions are in addition to any imposed by the Clean Air Act and 
apply after June 1, 1993, to all DoD contracts, regardless of place of 
performance.

    (a) Remedial action has the meaning given that term by section 
101(24) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and 
Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601(24)).
    (b) Corrective action has the meaning given that term under section 
3004(u) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6924(u)).
[57 FR 14993, Apr. 23, 1992]


<R05>
223.7002  Contract clause.

    (a) Use the clause at 252.223-7005, Hazardous Waste Liability, in

    (i) The Defense Environmental Restoration Program;
    (ii) Other programs or activities of the Department of Defense; or
    (iii) Authorized State hazardous waste programs;
    (2) Under which the generation of the hazardous waste to be disposed 
of is incidental to the performance of the contract; or
    (3) For disposition of ammunition or solid rocket motors.
    Use of the clause at 252.223-7005 may be waived if the Secretary of 
Defense or the Secretary of the military department concerned determines 
that--
    (1) There is only one responsible offeror or there is no responsible 
offeror willing to provide the reimbursement required by paragraph (b) 
of the clause; or
    (2) Failure to award the contract would place the facility concerned 
in violation of any requirement of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 
U.S.C. 6901 et seq.).

Hazardous or Toxic Materials on DoD Installations, implements 10 U.S.C. 
2692.

[[Page 156]]


<R05>
223.7101  Procedures.

    (a) If the contracting officer is uncertain as to whether particular 
activities are prohibited or fall under one of the exceptions in 
223.7102, the contracting officer should seek advice from the cognizant 
office of counsel.
    (b) When storage, treatment, or disposal of non-DoD-owned toxic or 
hazardous materials is authorized in accordance with this subpart, the 
contract or authorization should specify the types, conditions, and 
quantities of toxic or hazardous materials that may be temporarily 
stored, treated, or disposed of in connection with the contract or as a 
result of the authorized commercial use of a DoD industrial-type 
facility.
[60 FR 61597, Nov. 30, 1995]


<R05>
223.7102  Exceptions.

    (a) The prohibition of 10 U.S.C. 2692 does not apply to--
    (1) The storage of strategic and critical materials in the National 
Defense Stockpile under an agreement for such storage with the 
Administrator of General Services Administration;
    (2) The temporary storage or disposal of explosives in order to 
protect the public or to assist agencies responsible for Federal law 
enforcement in storing or disposing of explosives when no alternative 
solution is available, if such storage or disposal is made in accordance 
with an agreement between the Secretary of Defense and the head of the 
Federal agency concerned;
    (3) The temporary storage or disposal of explosives in order to 
provide emergency lifesaving assistance to civil authorities;
    (4) The disposal of excess explosives produced under a DoD contract, 
if the head of the military department concerned determines, in each 
case, that an alternative feasible means of disposal is not available to 
the contractor, taking into consideration public safety, available 
resources of the contractor, and national defense production 
requirements;
    (5) The temporary storage of nuclear materials or nonnuclear 
classified materials in accordance with an agreement with the Secretary 
of Energy;
    (6) The storage of materials that constitute military resources 
intended to be used during peacetime civil emergencies in accordance 
with applicable DoD regulations;

material during a transportation emergency;
    (8) The storage of any material that is not owned by DoD, if the 
Secretary of the military department concerned determines that the 
material is required or generated by a private person in connection with 
the authorized and compatible use by that person of an industrial-type 
DoD facility; or
    (9) The treatment and disposal of any non-DoD-owned material if the 
Secretary of the military department concerned--
    (i) Determines that the material is required or generated by a 
private person in connection with the authorized and compatible 
commercial use by that person of an industrial-type facility of that 
military department; and
    (ii) Enters into a contract with that person that--
    (A) Is consistent with the best interest of national defense and 
environmental security; and
    (B) Provides for that person's continued financial and environmental 
responsibility and liability with regard to the material.
    (b) The Secretary of Defense, where DoD Directive 6050.8 applies, 
may grant exceptions to the prohibition of 10 U.S.C. 2692 when essential

<R05>
225.000-71  General guidelines.

    To apply the policies and procedures of this part, analyze and 
evaluate offers of foreign end products generally as follows--
    (a) Statutory or policy restrictions. (1) Determine whether the 
product is restricted by--
    (i) DoD Authorization or Appropriations Acts (see subpart 225.70); 
or
    (ii) DoD policy (see subpart 225.71 and FAR 6.302-3).
    (2) Where an exception to or waiver of a restriction would result in 
award of a foreign end product, apply the policies and procedures of the 
Buy American Act or the Balance of Payments Program, and, if applicable, 
the trade agreements.
    (b) Memoranda of understanding or other international agreements. 
(1) Determine whether the offered product is the product of one of the 
countries (qualifying country), listed in 225.872-1.
    (2) If the product is the product of a qualifying country, evaluate 
the offer under 225.105 and 225.872-4.
    (c) Trade agreements. (1) Determine whether the product is covered 
by the Trade Agreements Act or the North American Free Trade Agreement 
Implementation Act (see subpart 225.4).
    (2) If the product is an eligible product under subpart 225.4, 
evaluate the offer under FAR 25.402 and 225.105.

[[Page 161]]

    (3) If the product is not an eligible product, a qualifying country 
end product, or a U.S. made end product, purchase of the foreign end 
product may be prohibited (see FAR 25.402(c) and 225.402(c)).
    (d) Contractors controlled by terrorist nations. (1) Determine 
whether the contractor is controlled by a terrorist nation.
    (2) If the contractor is controlled by a terrorist nation, comply 
with 209.104-1(g).
    (e) Buy American Act and Balance of Payments Program. See the 
evaluation procedures in 225.105.
[56 FR 36367, July 31, 1991, as amended at 59 FR 1289, Jan. 10, 1994]


<R04>
                Subpart 225.1--Buy American Act--Supplies


<R05>
225.102  Policy.

    (a)(2) The cost of a domestic end product is unreasonable if it is 
not the low evaluated offer when evaluated under 225.105.
    (3)(A) Specific public interest exceptions for DoD are in 225.872.
    (B) Normally, use the evaluation procedures in 225.105, but consider 
recommending a public interest exception where the purposes of the Buy 
American Act are not served, or in order to meet a need set forth in 10 
U.S.C. 2533. For example, a public interest exception may be 
appropriate--
    (1) If accepting the low domestic offer will involve substantial 
foreign expenditures, or accepting the low foreign offer will involve 
substantial domestic expenditures;
    (2) To ensure access to advanced state-of-the-art commercial 
technology; or
    (3) To maintain the same source of supply for spare and replacement 
parts (also see paragraph (b)(iii)(B) of this section)--
    (i) For an end item that qualifies as an American good; or
    (ii) In order not to impair integration of the military and 
commercial industrial base.
    (C) A determination whether to grant a public interest exception 
shall be made after consideration of the factors in 10 U.S.C. 2533--
    (1) At a level above the contracting officer for acquisitions valued 
at less than $100,000;
    (2) By the head of the contracting activity for acquisitions valued 
at $100,000 or more but less than $1,000,000; or
    (3) By the agency head for acquisitions valued at $1,000,000 or 
more.
    (b)(i) A determination that an article, material, or supply is not 
reasonably available is required where no domestic offer is received or 
when domestic offers are insufficient to meet the requirement and award 
is to be made on a nonqualifying country end product.
    (ii) Except as provided in FAR 25.102(b)(1), the determination must 
be approved--
    (A) At a level above the contracting officer, if the acquisition is 
estimated not to exceed $25,000;
    (B) By the chief of the contracting office if the acquisition is 
estimated not to exceed $250,000;
    (C) By the head of the contracting activity (HCA) or immediate 
deputy if the acquisition is estimated not to exceed $2 million; or
    (D) By the head of the agency, or designee at a level no lower than 
an HCA, if the acquisition is estimated to exceed $2 million.
    (iii) A determination as to whether an article, material, or supply 
is reasonably available is not required for--
    (A) End products or components listed in 225.108(d)(1) or FAR 
25.108(d)(1);
    (B) Acquisitions for spare/replacement parts when the acquisition is 
restricted to the original manufacturer or supplier; or
    (C) Acquisition of foreign drugs by the Defense Personnel Support 
Center when the Chief of the Technical Operations Division, Directorate 
of Medical Materiel, determines that only the requested foreign drug 
will fulfill the requirements.
    (iv) Under coordinated acquisition (see 208.70), the determination 
is the responsibility of the requiring department when the requiring 
department specifies acquisition of a foreign end product.

<R05>
225.103  Agreements with certain foreign governments.

    See 225.872.


<R05>
225.105  Evaluating offers.

    Use the following procedures instead of those in FAR 25.105.
    (1) Evaluate offers by adding a 50 percent factor to the price 
(including duty) of each nonqualifying country offer (see Example 1 in 
Table 25-1, Evaluation).
    (i) Nonqualifying country offers include duty in the offered price. 
When applying the factor, evaluate based on the inclusion of duty, 
whether or not duty is to be exempted. If award is made on the 
nonqualifying country offer and duty is to be exempted through inclusion 
of the clause at FAR 52.225-10, Duty-Free Entry, award at the offered 
price minus the amount of duty identified in the provision at 252.225-
7003, Information for Duty-Free Entry Evaluation. See Example 1, 
Alternate II, in Table 25-1, Evaluation.
    (ii) When a nonqualifying country offer includes more than one line 
item, apply the 50 percent factor--
    (A) On an item-by-item basis; or
    (B) On a group of items, if the solicitation specifically provides 
for award on a group basis.
    (2) When application of the factor would not result in the award of 
a domestic end product, e.g., when no domestic offers are received (see 
Example 3 of Table 25-1, Evaluation) or when a qualifying country offer 
is lower than the domestic offer (see Example 2 of Table 25-1, 
Evaluation), evaluate offers without the 50 percent factor.
    (i) If duty is to be exempted through inclusion of the clause at FAR 
52.225-10, Duty-Free Entry, evaluate the nonqualifying country offer 
exclusive of duty by reducing the offered price by the amount of duty 
identified in the clause at 252.225-7003, Information for Duty-Free 
Entry Evaluation (see Examples 2 and 3, Alternate II, of Table 25-1, 
Evaluation). If award is made on the nonqualifying country offer, award 
at the offered price minus duty.
    (ii) If duty is not to be exempted and duty is to be paid by the 
Government, evaluate the nonqualifying country offer inclusive of duty. 
(See Examples 2 and 3, Alternate I, of Table 25-1, Evaluation.)
    (3) Treat offers of eligible products under acquisitions subject to 
the Trade Agreements Act or NAFTA as if they were qualifying country 
offers. (See Example 4 of Table 25-1, Evaluation.)
    (4) If these evaluation procedures result in a tie between a 
nonqualifying country offer and a domestic offer, make award on the 
domestic offer.
    (5)(i) There are two tests that must be met to determine whether a 
manufactured item is a domestic end product--
    (A) The end product must have been manufactured in the United 
States; and
    (B) The cost of its U.S. and qualifying country components must 
exceed 50 percent of the cost of all of its components. This test is 
applied to end products only, and not to individual components.
    (ii) Because of the component test, the definition of ``domestic end 
product'' is more restrictive than the definition for--
    (A) ``U.S. made end product'' under trade agreements;
    (B) ``Domestically produced or manufactured products'' under small 
business set-asides or small business-small purchase set-asides; and
    (C) Products of small businesses under FAR part 19.
    (iii) If an offer is for a ``U.S. made end product,'' ``domestically 
produced end product,'' or the product of a small business, but is not a 
``domestic end product'' as defined in the clause at 252.225-7001, Buy 
American Act and Balance of Payments Program, treat the offer as a 
nonqualifying country offer. (See Example 4 of Table 25-1, Evaluation.)

                         Table 25-1, Evaluation

                                Example 1

Alternate I: Duty Not Exempted for Nonqualifying Country Offers:
    Nonqualifying Country Offer (including $100 duty)--$6,000
    Domestic Offer--$8,900
    Qualifying Country Offer--$9,100
    Award on Domestic Offer. The 50% evaluation factor is added to the 
nonqualifying country offer, inclusive of duty, yielding an evaluated 
price of $9,000.
Alternate II: Duty Exempted:

[[Page 163]]

    Nonqualifying Country Offer (including $1,000 duty)--$600,000
    Domestic Offer--$910,000
    Qualifying Country Offer--$920,000
    Award on Nonqualifying Country Offer. The addition of the evaluation 
factor yields an evaluated price of $900,000. Since duty is being 
exempted for nonqualifying country offers, the duty is subtracted from 
the offered price which is awarded at $599,000.

                                Example 2

Alternate I: Duty Not Exempted for Nonqualifying Country Offers:
    Nonqualifying Country Offer (including $100 duty)--$6,000
    Domestic Offer--$8,500
    Qualifying Country Offer--$7,800
    Award on Nonqualifying Country Offer. In this case, the application 
of the evaluation factor to the nonqualifying country offer results in a 
price ($9,000) that is higher than the other two offers, but would not 
result in award of a domestic offer, since the qualifying country offer 
is lower. Therefore, all offers are evaluated without the factor. Since 
duty is not being exempted for nonqualifying country offers, the offer 
is evaluated and award is made at the price inclusive of duty ($6,000).
Alternate II: Duty Exempted:
    Nonqualifying Country Offer (including $1,000 duty)--$880,500
    Domestic Offer--$950,000
    Qualifying Country Offer--$880,000
    Award on Nonqualifying Country Offer. Again, the addition of the 
evaluation factor would not result in the award of a domestic offer and 
all offers are evaluated without the factor. Since duty is being 
exempted for nonqualifying country offers, the duty identified by the 
offeror is subtracted from the offered price, which is evaluated and 
awarded at $879,500.

                                Example 3

Alternate I: Duty Not Exempted for Nonqualifying Country Offers:
    Nonqualifying Country Offer (including $1,000 duty)--$10,000
    Qualifying Country Offer--$9,500
    Award on Qualifying Country Offer. Since no domestic offers are 
received, the foreign offers are evaluated without the evaluation 
factor. Since duty is not being exempted and would be paid by the 
Government, the nonqualifying country offer is evaluated inclusive of 
duty.
Alternate II: Duty Exempted:
    Nonqualifying Country Offer (including $1,000 duty)--$880,500
    Qualifying Country Offer--$880,000
    Award on Nonqualifying Country Offer. Since duty is being exempted, 
duty is subtracted from the nonqualifying country offer, which is 
evaluated and awarded at $879,500.

                                Example 4

Alternate I:
    Offer of U.S. Made End Product which is not a Domestic Offer--
$800,000
    Domestic Offer--$820,000
    Eligible Product--$830,000
    Award on Domestic End Product. U.S. made end products which are not 
also domestic end products are evaluated the same as nonqualifying 
country end products. Adding the 50% evaluation factor yields an 
evaluated price of $1,200,000.
Alternate II:
    Offer of U.S. Made End Product which is not a Domestic Offer--
$800,000
    Eligible Product--$820,000
    Domestic Offer--$830,000
    Award on U.S. Made End Product. Adding the 50% evaluation factor to 
the U.S. made end product would not result in the award of a domestic 
end product since the eligible product, which is evaluated the same as a 
qualifying country offer, is lower. All offers are evaluated without the 
factor.

for acquisitions estimated at $500,000 or less in foreign cost.
    (3)(A) This authority is not intended for use in making repetitive 
supply acquisitions or acquisitions of total annual supply requirements 
of items available in the United States but not available within the 
time required.
    (B) DoD has determined that requirements for the items on the lists

construction overseas shall generally be the responsibility of the 
contractor performing the work; but where necessary to comply with 
foreign law, to avoid taxation, or to obtain other advantages, consider

[[Page 166]]

direct purchase. Consider savings that may be obtained by exemptions 
from import and other taxes and, to the extent economical, take 
advantage of tax exemptions available under existing agreements.
    (ii) When purchase of materials is the responsibility of the 
construction contractor, the evaluation differential is determined 
through the estimating process and applied before solicitation.

225.303  Procedures.

    (a) Solicitation of offers. When soliciting orally, advise vendors 
that only domestic and qualifying country end products are acceptable 
unless an exception applies or the price of a domestic end product is 
unreasonable.
    (b) Evaluation. (i) Use the evaluation procedures in 225.105 instead 
of the evaluation procedures in FAR 25.303(b). Treatment of duty may 
differ when delivery is overseas.
    (A) Duty may not be applicable to nonqualifying country offers.
    (B) The U.S. Government cannot guarantee the exemption of duty for 
components or end products imported into foreign countries.
    (C) Foreign governments may impose duties, and offers including such 
duties must be evaluated as offered.
    (ii) Where the evaluation procedures in 225.105 result in the award 
of a nonqualifying country end product, the acquisition of domestic end 
products is unreasonable or inconsistent with public interest. If no 
domestic end product offers are received, the determination in FAR 
25.302(b)(3) is not required.

clause at 252.225-7005, Identification of Expenditures in the United 
States, in all negotiated contracts over $25,000 where--
    (a) For supply contracts, the contract requires end products 
manufactured or produced in the United States; and

     Subpart 225.4--Purchases Under the Trade Agreements Act of 1979


<R05>
225.401  Definitions.

    Caribbean Basin country end product includes petroleum or any 
product derived from petroleum.
    Eligible product means, instead of the definition at FAR 25.401, a 
designated, NAFTA, or Caribbean Basin country end product in the 
categories listed in 225.403.70.
[59 FR 1289, Jan. 10, 1994, as amended at 59 FR 23169, May 5, 1994]


<R05>
225.402  Policy.

    (a) To estimate the value of the acquisition, use the total 
estimated value of end products subject to trade agreement acts (see 
225.403-70).
    (1) See 225.105 for evaluation of eligible products and U.S. made 
end products.
    (c)(i) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) (ii) and (iii) of this 
section, do not purchase nondesignated country end products subject to 
the Trade Agreements Act unless they are NAFTA, Caribbean Basin, or 
qualifying country end products (see 225.872-1).
    (ii) The prohibition in paragraph (c)(i) of this section does not 
apply when the contracting officer determines that offers of U.S. made, 
qualifying country, or eligible products from responsive, responsible 
offerors are either--
    (A) Not received; or
    (B) Insufficient to fill the Government's requirements. In these 
cases,

[[Page 167]]

accept all responsive, responsible offers of U.S. made, qualifying 
country, and eligible products before accepting any other offers.
    (iii) National interest waivers under Section 302(b)(2) of the Trade 
Agreements Act are approved on a case-by-case basis. Except as delegated 
in paragraphs (c)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section, a request for a 
national interest waiver shall include supporting rationale and be 
submitted under department/agency procedures to the Director of Defense 
Procurement.
    (A) The head of the contracting activity may approve a national 
interest waiver for a purchase by an overseas purchasing activity of 
products critical to the support of U.S. forces stationed abroad. The 
waiver must be supported by a written statement from the requiring 
activity stating that the requirement is critical for the support of 
U.S. forces stationed abroad.
    (B) The Commander, Defense Fuel Supply Center, may approve national 
interest waivers for purchases of fuel for use by U.S. forces overseas.

1996]


<R05>
225.403  Exceptions.

    (b) The evaluation preference for small disadvantaged businesses in 
subpart 219.70 does not displace an offer of an eligible product.
    (c)(1)(A) If a department or agency considers an individual 
acquisition of a product to be indispensable for national security or 
national defense purposes and appropriate for exclusion from the 
provisions of FAR subpart 25.4, it may submit a request with supporting 
rationale to the Director of Defense Procurement (USD(A&T)DP).
    (B) The following national security/national defense exceptions do 
not require approval by USD(A&T)DP--
    (1) Where purchase from foreign sources is restricted by the DoD 
annual Appropriations or Authorization Acts (see subpart 225.70) or by 
the establishment of required sources of supplies and services under FAR 
part 8.
    (2) Where competition from foreign sources is restricted under the 
authority of FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(i). Provide USD(A&T)DP a copy of the 
justification for restricting competition in accordance with FAR 
25.402(e) and FAR 6.303-1(d).
    (3) Where competition from foreign sources is restricted under 
subpart 225.71.
    (g)(4) In accordance with Section 8094 of the Fiscal Year 1994 
Defense Appropriations Act (Public Law 103-139), the exception for 
petroleum and any product derived from petroleum does not apply.

<R05>
225.403-70  Products subject to trade agreement acts.

    Foreign end products subject to the Trade Agreements Act and NAFTA 
are those in the following Federal supply groups (FSG). If a product is 
not in one of the listed groups, the Trade Agreements Act and NAFTA do 
not apply. The definition of Caribbean Basin country end products in FAR 
25.401 excludes those end products which are not eligible for duty-free 
treatment under 19 U.S.C. 2703(b). However, 225.401 expands the 
definition of Caribbean Basin country end products to include petroleum 
and any product derived from petroleum. The list of products has been 
annotated to indicate those products which are eligible for designated 
and NAFTA countries, but are not presently eligible for Caribbean Basin 
countries.

225.408  Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.

    (a)(1) Use the provision at 252.225-7006, Buy American Act-Trade 
Agreements-Balance of Payments Program Certificate, instead of the 
provision at FAR 52.225-8, Buy American Act-Trade Agreements-Balance of 
Payments Program Certificate, in all solicitations that include the 
clause at 252.225-7007, Trade Agreements.
    (2) Use the clause at 252.225-7007, Trade Agreements, instead of the 
clause at FAR 52.225-9, Buy American Act--Trade Agreements--Balance of 
Payments Program. The clause need not be used where purchase from 
foreign sources is restricted (see 225.403(d)(1)(B)). The clause may be 
used where the contracting officer anticipates a waiver of the 
restriction. For procurements by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, use 
the clause with its Alternate I.
    (3) Use the provision at 252.225-7035, Buy American Act--North 
American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act--Balance of Payments 
Program Certificate, instead of the provision at FAR 52.225-20, Buy 
American Act--North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act--
Balance of Payments Program Certificate, in all solicitations that 
include the clause at 252.225-7036, North American Free Trade Agreement

Agreement Implementation Act--Balance of Payments Program. The clause 
need not be used where purchase from foreign sources is restricted (see 
225.403(d)(1)(B)). The clause may be used where the contracting officer 
anticipates a waiver of the restriction.
    (B)(i) Use the clause in all solicitations and contracts for the 
items listed at 225.403-70, when the estimated value is $50,000 or more 
and the Trade Agreements Act does not apply. Include the clause in 
solicitations for multiple line items if any line item is subject to 
NAFTA.
    (ii) Use the clause with its Alternate I when the estimated value is 
between $25,000 and $50,000.
    (C) Application of the procedures in 225.402(a) and the acquisition 
of noneligible and eligible products under the same solicitation may 
result in the application of the North American Free Trade Agreement 
Implementation Act to only some of the items solicited. In such case, 
indicate in the schedule those items covered by the Act.

    (i) Qualifying country supplies (end products and components) on all 
defense contracts;
    (ii) Eligible products (end products but not components) on defense

    (iii) Other foreign supplies, if there is reasonable assurance that 
the administrative and other costs of processing and controlling the 
certificates will not exceed the amount of duty that would be paid.
[56 FR 36367, July 31, 1991, as amended at 59 FR 1290, Jan. 10, 1994]


<R05>
225.603  Procedures.

    (1) Issue duty-free entry certificates--
    (i) In accordance with the policy in 225.602;
    (ii) On contracts containing the clauses in--
    (A) FAR 52.225-10, Duty-Free Entry; or
    (B) 252.225-7009, Duty-Free Entry--Qualifying Country End Products 
and Supplies; or
    (C) 252.225-7037, Duty-Free Entry--NAFTA Country End Products and 
Supplies; or
    (iii) On other contracts that fall within one of the following 
categories--
    (A) Direct purchases of foreign supplies under a DoD prime contract, 
whether title passes at point of origin or at destination in the United 
States; provided, the contract states that the final price is exclusive 
of duty;
    (B) Purchases of foreign supplies by a domestic prime contractor 
under a cost-reimbursement type contract or by a cost-reimbursement type 
subcontractor (where no fixed-price prime or fixed-price subcontract 
intervenes between the purchaser and the Government), whether title 
passes at point of origin or at destination in the United States. If a 
fixed-price prime or fixed-price subcontract intervenes, follow the 
criteria stated in paragraph (1)(iii)(C) of this section; or
    (C) Purchases of foreign supplies by a fixed-price domestic prime 
contractor, a fixed-price subcontractor, or a cost-type subcontractor 
where a fixed-price prime contract, or fixed-price subcontract 
intervenes; provided--
    (1) The fixed-price prime contract and, where applicable, fixed-
price subcontract prices are, or are amended to be, exclusive of duty;
    (2) The supplies so purchased will be delivered to the Government or 
incorporated in Government-owned property or in an end product to be 
furnished to the Government, and the duty will be

[[Page 170]]

paid if such supplies or any portion are used for other than the 
performance of the Government contract or disposed of other than for the 
benefit of the Government in accordance with the contract terms; and
    (3) Such acquisition abroad is authorized by the terms of the 
contract, the subcontract, or by the contracting officer. In any case, 
follow the procedures required by the clauses in FAR 52.225-10, Duty-
Free Entry, and 252.225-7009, Duty-Free Entry--Qualifying Country End 
Products and Supples, and 252.225-7037, Duty-Free Entry--NAFTA Country 
End Products and Supplies, to the extent practicable.
    (2) Do not issue duty-free entry certificates or exempt duty for end 
products, components, or supplies already entered into the customs 
territory of the United States for which duty has already been paid.
    (3) If a duty-free entry certificate is issued a contractor under a 
fixed-price contract based on the contractor's providing a domestic or 
qualifying country end product, component, or supply, negotiate an 
equitable reduction in the contract price if the contractor subsequently 
furnishes a nonqualifying country end product, component, or supply.
    (4) Exclude duty from the contract price for end products, 
components, or supplies that are being accorded duty-free entry.
    (5) Except as required under the evaluation procedures in 225.105 
for the Buy American Act, do not evaluate duty for items accorded duty-
free entry.
    (6) Even if duty is evaluated under Subpart 225.1, the supplies may 
still be authorized duty-free entry if to do so is consistent with the 
policies in 225.602. However, if the Government will pay a duty, then 
the cost of the duty must be included in the contract price and 
evaluated as part of the offer.
    (b) Formal entry and release. (i) The administrative contracting 
officer must--
    (A) Ensure that prime contractors are aware of and understand any 
Duty-Free Entry clause requirements. Contractors should understand that 
failure by them or their subcontractors to include the data required by 
the clause will result in treatment of the shipment as without benefit 
of free entry under section XXII, chapter 98, subchapter VIII, Item 
9808.00.30 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.
    (B) Upon receipt of the required notice of purchase of foreign 
supplies from the contractor or any tier subcontractor--
    (1) Verify the duty-free entitlement of goods entering under the 
contract; and
    (2) Review the prime contract to ensure that performance of the 
contract requires the foreign supplies (quantity and price) identified 
in the notice.
    (C) Upon receipt of notification from the contractor that it is 
placing a foreign purchase that was not identified at the time of 
contract award--
    (1) Determine whether a reduction in the contract price is required 
under the clause at FAR 52.225-10, Duty-Free Entry;
    (2) If so, make an equitable adjustment in the contract price, 
unless the procuring contracting officer waives this adjustment;
    (3) Determine the price of the foreign supplies exclusive of duty, 
and advise the contractor that that amount will be the maximum dollar 
value of supplies for which duty-free entry certificates will be issued.
    (D) Within 20 days after receiving the notification of purchase of 
foreign supplies, forward the following information in the format 
indicated to the Commander, DCMAO New York, ATTN Customs Team, DCMDN-
GNIC, 207 New York Avenue, Staten Island, NY 10305-5013--

We have received a contractor notification of the purchase of foreign 
supplies. I have verified that foreign supplies are required for the 
performance of the contract. If required, the prime contract price has 
been or will be adjusted.

notification including the changed data to DCMAO New York.
    (ii) The responsibility for issuing duty-free entry certificates for 
foreign supplies purchased under a DoD contract or subcontract rests 
with the Customs Team, DCMDN-GNIC, DCMAO New York. Upon receipt of 
import documentation for incoming shipments from the contractor, its 
agent, or the U.S. Customs Service, DCMAO New York will verify the duty-
free entitlement and execute the duty-free entry certificate.
    (iii) Upon arrival of foreign supplies at ports of entry, the 
consignee, generally the contractor or its agent (import broker) for 
shipments to other than a military installation, will file U.S. Customs 
Form 7501, 7501A, or 7506, with the District Director of Customs.
    (c) Immediate entry and release. Importations made in the name of a 
DoD military facility or being shipped directly to a military facility 
are entitled to release under the immediate delivery procedure.
    (i) A DoD immediate delivery application has been approved and is on 
file at Customs Headquarters.
    (ii) The application is for an indefinite period and is good for all 
Customs districts, areas, and ports.

countries (referred to in this part as ``qualifying countries'')--

    Australia
    Belgium

    United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland

application of the Buy American Act and Balance of Payments Program as 
inconsistent with the public interest--

    Austria
    Finland
    Sweden
    Switzerland

    (c) The determination in paragraph (a) of this subsection does not 
limit the authority of the cognizant Secretary to restrict acquisitions 
to domestic sources or reject an otherwise acceptable offer from a 
qualifying country source in instances where considered necessary for 
national defense reasons.
    (d) The Secretary of Defense has waived the restrictions of 10 
U.S.C. 2534(a) for the acquisition of defense items manufactured in a 
qualifying country listed in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection, in 
accordance with the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2534(d)(3).
[56 FR 36367, July 31, 1991, as amended at 57 FR 53599, Nov. 12, 1992;

<R05>
225.872-2  Applicability.

    (a) This section applies to all acquisitions of supplies except 
where restricted by--
    (1) Provision of U.S. National Disclosure Policy (NDP), DOD 
Directive 5230.11, Disclosure of Classified Military Information to 
Foreign Governments and International Organizations;
    (2) U.S. defense mobilization base requirements purchased under the 
authority of FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(i) except for quantities in excess of 
that required to maintain the defense mobilization base. This 
restriction does not apply to Canadian planned producers--
    (i) Review individual solicitations to determine whether this 
restriction applies.
    (ii) Information concerning restricted items may be obtained from 
the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Industrial Affairs);
    (3) Other U.S. laws or regulations (e.g., the annual defense 
appropriations act); and
    (4) U.S. industrial security requirements.
    (b) This section does not apply to construction contracts.
[56 FR 36367, July 31, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 61597, Nov. 30, 1995; 
62 FR 34123, June 24, 1997]


<R05>
225.872-3  Solicitation procedures.

    (a) Include qualifying country sources on bidders mailing lists and 
comparable source lists upon their request (see FAR 14.205).
    (b) Except for items developed under the U.S./Canadian Development 
Sharing Program, use the criteria for soliciting and making awards under 
FAR part 19 for small business concerns without regard to whether there 
are potential qualifying country sources for the end product. Do not 
consider an offer of a qualifying country end product if the 
solicitation is identified for the exclusive participation of small 
business firms.
    (c) Send solicitations directly to qualifying country sources. 
Solicit Canadian sources through the Canadian Commercial Corporation in 
accordance with 225.870.
    (d) Use international air mail if solicitation destinations are 
outside the United States and security classification permits such use 
(see FAR 14.202 and FAR 14.203).
    (e) If unusual technical or security requirements preclude the 
acquisition of otherwise acceptable defense equipment from qualifying 
country sources, review the need for such requirements. Do not impose 
unusual technical or security requirements solely for the purpose of 
precluding the acquisition of defense equipment from qualifying 
countries.
    (f) Do not automatically exclude qualifying country sources from 
submitting offers because their supplies

[[Page 179]]

have not been tested and evaluated by the department/agency.
    (1) Consider the adequacy of qualifying country service testing on a 
case-by-case basis. Departments or agencies that must limit 
solicitations to sources whose items have been service tested and 
evaluated by the department/agency shall consider supplies from 
qualifying country sources that have been tested and accepted by the 
qualifying country for service use.
    (2) The department/agency may perform a confirmatory test, if 
necessary.
    (3) Apply U.S. test and evaluation standards, policies, and 
procedures when the department/agency decides that confirmatory tests of 
qualifying country end products are necessary.
    (4) Where it appears that these provisions might adversely delay 
service programs, obtain the concurrence of the DoD Acquisition 
Executive, Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition & Technology), before 
excluding the qualifying country source from consideration.
    (g) Permit industry representatives from a qualifying country to 
attend symposia, program briefings, prebid conferences (FAR 14.207 and 
FAR 15.409), and similar meetings that address U.S. defense equipment 
needs and requirements. When practical, structure these meetings to 
allow attendance by representatives of qualifying country concerns.

<R05>
225.872-4  Evaluation of offers.

    (a) Qualifying country sources competing for DoD requirements must 
be responsive to the terms and conditions of DoD solicitations.
    (b) Evaluate offers of end products from the qualifying country 
sources in 225.872-1(a) without application of the 50 percent Buy 
American Act or Balance of Payments Program evaluation factor, in 
accordance with 225.105 and 225.303.
    (c) Evaluate offers of end products from the qualifying country 
sources in 225.872-1(b) without application of the 50 percent Buy 
American Act or Balance of Payments Program evaluation factor. If the 
offer, as evaluated, is low or otherwise eligible for award, the 
contracting officer shall request an exemption of the Buy American Act/
Balance of Payments Program as inconsistent with the public interest.
    (1) To obtain an exemption, process a Determination and Findings for 
signature--
    (i) At a level above the contracting officer, for acquisitions of 
$25,000 or less;
    (ii) By the chief of the contracting office, for acquisitions of 
$250,000 or less;
    (iii) By the head of the contracting activity (HCA), for 
acquisitions of $2 million or less; or
    (iv) By the head of the agency, or designee at a level no lower than 
an HCA, for acquisitions over $2 million.
    (2) The Determination and Findings shall be substantially as follows 
for end items, or modified as necessary for components--

                            Service or Agency

      Exemption of the Buy American Act/Balance of Payments Program

                       Determination and Findings

    Upon the basis of the following findings and determination which I 
hereby make in accordance with the provisions of FAR 25.102, acquisition 
of (qualifying country--identify country) (describe item) may be made as 
provided below.

                                Findings

    1. The (contracting activity) proposes to purchase under contract 
number, ____________, mined, produced, or manufactured in (country of 
origin). The total estimated cost of this acquisition is ____________.
    2. The United States Government and the Government of ____________ 
have agreed to remove barriers to procurement at the prime and 
subcontract level for defense equipment produced in each other's 
countries insofar as laws and regulations permit.
    3. The agreement provides that competitive offers of (qualifying 
country) end products will be evaluated by the Department of Defense 
without imposing any price differential under the Buy American Act or 
Balance of Payments Program and without taking applicable U.S. customs 
and duties into consideration so that (qualifying country) items may 
better compete for sales of defense equipment to the Department of 
Defense. In addition, the Agreement stipulates that acquisitions of 
(qualifying country) items must fully satisfy Department of Defense 
requirements for performance, quality, and delivery and shall cost the 
Department of Defense no more than would comparable U.S. source or

[[Page 180]]

other foreign source defense equipment eligible for award.
    4. In order to achieve the above objectives, the solicitation 
contained the Buy American Act and Balance of Payments Program clause, 
252.225-7001. Offers were solicited from other sources and the offer 
received for (qualifying country end item) is found to be otherwise 
eligible for award.

                              Determination

    Pursuant to the Buy American Act and Balance of Payments Program, I 
hereby determine that it is inconsistent with the public interest to 
apply the restrictions of the Buy American Act or the Balance of 
Payments Program to the proposed offer.

qualifying country listed in 225.872-1, in accordance with the 
provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2534(d)(3).
    (b) Where provided for elsewhere in this subpart, the restrictions 
on certain foreign purchases under 10 U.S.C. 2534(a) may be waived as 
follows:
    (1) The head of the contracting activity may waive the restriction 
on a case-by-case basis upon execution of a determination and findings 
that any of the following applies:
    (i) The restriction would cause unreasonable dalays.
    (ii) United States producers of the item would not be jeopardized by 
competition from a foreign country, and that country does not 
discriminate against defense items produced in

[[Page 184]]

the United States to a greater degree than the United States 
discriminates against defense items produced in that country.
    (iii) Application of the restriction would impede cooperative 
programs entered into between DoD and a foreign country, and that 
country does not discriminate against defense items produced in the 
United States to a greater degree than the United States discriminates 
against defense items produced in that country.
    (iv) Satisfactory quality items manufactured in the United States or 
Canada are not available.
    (v) Application of the restriction would result in the existence of 
only one source for the item in the United States or Canada.
    (vi) Application of the restriction is not in the national security 
interests of the United States.
    (vii) Application of the restriction would adversely affect a U.S. 
company.
    (2) The restriction is waived when it would cause unreasonable 
costs. The cost of the item of U.S. or Canadian origin is unreasonable 
if it exceeds 150 percent of the offered price, inclusive of duty, of 
items which are not of U.S. or Canadian origin.

    This restriction does not apply in any of the following 
circumstances:
    (a) Buses manufactured in nonqualifying countries are needed for

be postponed. Such use may not, however, exceed the lead time required 
for acquisition and delivery of buses manufactured in the United States 
or a qualifying country.
    (b) The requirement for buses is temporary in nature. For example, 
to meet a special, nonrecurring requirement or a sporadic and infrequent 
recurring requirement, buses manufactured in nonqualifying countries may 
be used for temporary periods of time. Such use may not, however, exceed 
the period of time needed to meet the special requirement.
    (c) Buses manufactured in nonqualifying countries are available at 
no cost to the U.S. Government.

and development in connection with any weapon system or other military 
equipment if there is a U.S. corporation, organization, person, or 
entity--

    (2) Willing to perform at a lower cost.
    (b) The statutory restriction in paragraph (a) of this section does 
not change the rules for selecting research and development contractors

    (1) The contract will be performed within the United States;
    (2) The contract is exclusively for RDT&E in connection with 
antitactical ballistic missile systems; or
    (3) The foreign government or foreign firm agrees to share a 
substantial portion of the total contract cost. Consider the foreign 
share as substantial if it is equitable with respect to the relative 
benefits to be derived from the contract by the United States and the 
foreign parties. For example, if the contract is more beneficial to the 
foreign party, its share of the cost should be correspondingly higher; 
or
    (b) If the head of the contracting activity certifies in writing, 
before contract award, that a contract for research, development, 
testing, or evaluation (other than for RDT&E described in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this subsection) cannot be competently performed by a U.S. 
firm at a price equal to or less than the price at which the RDT&E would 
be performed by a foreign government or firm.

225.7011-4  Procedures.

    (a) When awarding a prime contract to a foreign government or firm 
under 225.7011-3(b), the contracting officer or source selection 
authority, as applicable, shall make a determination that will be the 
basis for the certification.
    (1) The determination must--
    (i) Describe the contract effort;
    (ii) State the number of proposals solicited and received from both 
U.S. and foreign firms;
    (iii) Identify the proposed awardee and the amount of the contract;
    (iv) State that selection of the contractor was based on the 
evaluation factors contained in the solicitation, or the criteria 
contained in the broad agency announcement; and
    (v) State that the effort cannot be competently performed by a U.S. 
firm at a price equal to, or less than, the price at which it would be 
performed by the foreign awardee.
    (2) When either a broad agency announcement (BAA) or program 
research and development announcement (PRDA) is used, or when the 
determination is otherwise not based on direct competition between 
foreign and domestic proposals, the determination must not be merely 
conclusory.
    (i) The determination must specifically explain its basis, include a 
description of the method used to determine the competency of U.S. 
firms, and describe the cost or price analysis performed.
    (ii) Alternately, the determination may contain--
    (A) A finding, including the basis for such finding, that the 
proposal was submitted solely in response to the terms of a BAA or PRDA, 
or other solicitation document without any technical guidance from the 
program office; and
    (B) A finding, including the basis for such finding, that disclosure 
of the information in the proposal for the purpose of conducting a 
competitive acquisition is prohibited.
    (b) Forward a copy of the certification (from 225.7011-3(b)) and, as 
appropriate, the determination or justification and approval (J&A) 
within 30 days of contract award to the Ballistic Missile Defense 
Organization, Attn: BMDO/DRI, 7100 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 
20301-7100, if award is based on--
    (1) A determination under paragraph (a) of this subsection;

requirement;
    (ii) It is not in the best interests of the United States to qualify 
a domestic bearing to replace a qualified nondomestic bearing. This 
determination must be based on a finding that the qualification of a 
domestically manufactured bearing would cause unreasonable costs or 
delay. A finding that a cost is unreasonable should take into 
consideration DoD policy to assist the domestic industrial mobilization 
base.

[[Page 190]]

Contracts should be awarded to domestic bearing manufacturers to 
increase their capability to reinvest and become more competitive;
    (iii) United States producers of the item would not be jeopardized

discriminate against defense items produced in the United States to a 
greater degree than the United States discriminates against defense 
items produced in that country;

programs entered into between DoD and a foreign country, and that 
country does not discriminate against defense items produced in the 
United States to a greater degree than the United States discriminates

only one source for the item in the United States or Canada;
    (vi) Application of the restriction is not in the national security 
interests of the United States; or

company.
    (2) If the acquisition is for an amount less than the simplified 
acquisition threshold and simplified acquisition procedures are being 
used.
    (3) For multiyear contracts or contracts exceeding 12 months, except 
those for miniature and instrument ball bearings, only if--
    (i) The head of the contracting activity executes a determination 
and findings in accordance with paragraph (a) of this subsection;
    (ii) The contractor submits a written plan for transitioning from 
the use of nondomestic to domestically manufactured bearings;
    (iii) The plan--
    (A) States whether a domestically manufactured bearing can be 
qualified, at a reasonable cost, for use during the course of the 
contract period;
    (B) Identifies any bearings that are not domestically manufactured, 
their application, and source of supply; and
    (C) Describes, including cost and timetable, the transition to a 
domestically manufactured bearing. (The timetable for the transition 
should normally take no longer than 24 months from the date the waiver 
is granted); and
    (iv) The contracting officer accepts the plan and incorporates it in 
the contract.
    (4) For miniature and instrument ball bearings, only if the 
contractor agrees to acquire a like quantity and type of domestic 
manufacture for nongovernmental use.
    (b) The Secretary of the department responsible for the acquisition 
may waive the restriction in 225.7019-1(b) on a case-by-case basis, by

    (1) Adequate domestic supplies are not available to meet DoD 
requirements on a timely basis; and
    (2) The acquisition must be made in order to acquire capability for 
national security purposes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
225.7102-2  Exceptions.

    The policy in 225.7102-1 does not apply to acquisitions--
    (a) Using simplified acquisition procedures, unless the restricted 
item is the end item being purchased;
    (b) Overseas for overseas use; or
    (c) When the quantity acquired exceeds the amount needed to maintain 
the U.S. defense mobilization base (provided such quantity is an 
economical purchase quantity). The restriction to domestic sources does 
not apply to the quantity above that required to maintain the base, in 
which case, qualifying country sources may compete.


<R05>
225.7102-3  Waiver.

    Upon request from a prime contractor, the contracting officer may 
waive the requirement for domestic manufacture of the items covered by 
the policy in 225.7102-1.


<R05>
225.7102-4  Contract clause.

    (a) Use the clause at 252.225-7025, Restriction on Acquisition of 
Forgings, in solicitations and contracts, except for acquisitions--
    (1) Excepted in 225.7102-2; or
    (2) Where the contracting officer knows that the supplies being 
acquired do not contain the restricted items.
    (b) If an exception under 225.7102-2 applies to any portion of the 
acquisition, specify the exception in the solicitation and contract.


<R05>
225.7103  Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) carbon fiber.


<R05>
225.7103-1  Policy.

    All new major systems must use U.S. or Canadian manufacturers or 
producers for all PAN carbon fiber requirements.


<R05>
225.7103-2  Waivers.

    Contracting officers may, with the approval of the chief of the 
contracting office, waive, in whole or in part, the requirement of the 
clause at 252.225-7022. For example, a waiver may be justified if a 
qualified U.S. or Canadian source cannot meet scheduling requirements.


<R05>
225.7103-3  Contract clause.

    Use the clause at 252.225-7022, Restriction on Acquisition of 
Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) Carbon Fiber, in all acquisitions for major 
systems (as defined in FAR part 2) that are not yet in production 
(milestone III as defined in DoD 50002.2-R, Mandatory Procedures for 
Major Defense Acquisition

Programs (MDAPS) and Major Automated Information system (MAIS) 
Acquisition Programs). Also use the clause in contracts for major 
systems if the clause was used in prior program contracts.

Subpart 225.72--Reporting Contract Performance Outside the United States

    Source:  58 FR 28469, May 13, 1993, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
225.7200  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes procedures for contractor reporting and DoD 
monitoring of the volume, type, and nature of contract performance 
outside the United States, to include subcontracts, purchases, and 
intracompany transfers. It implements 10 U.S.C. 2410g which requires 
advance notification of contract performance outside the United States 
and Canada when the contract could have been performed inside the United 
States or Canada.


<R05>
225.7201  Exception.

    This subpart does not apply to contracts for commercial items, 
construction, ores, natural gas, utilities, petroleum products and 
crudes, timber (logs), or subsistence.
[60 FR 61597, Nov. 30, 1995]


<R05>
225.7202  Distribution of reports.

    The contracting officer shall forward a copy of reports submitted by 
successful offerors as required by the clause at 252.225-7026, Reporting 
of Contract Performance Outside the United States, to the Deputy 
Director of Defense Procurement (Foreign Contracting), OUSD(A&T)DP(FC), 
Washington, DC 20301-3060. This is necessary to satisfy the requirement 
of 10 U.S.C. 2410g that the notifications (or copies) be maintained in 
compiled form for five years after the date of submission.

<R04>
         Subpart 225.73--Acquisitions for Foreign Military Sales


<R05>
225.7300  Scope of subpart.

    (a) This subpart contains policies and procedures for acquisitions 
for foreign military sales (FMS) under the Arms Export Control Act. 
Section 22 of the Arms Export Control Act (Pub. L. 90-629, as amended) 
authorizes DoD to enter into contracts for resale to foreign countries 
or international organizations.
    (b) This subpart does not apply to--
    (1) Foreign military sales made from inventories or stocks;
    (2) Acquisitions for replenishment of inventories or stocks;
    (3) Acquisitions made under DoD cooperative logistic supply support 
arrangements.


<R05>
225.7301  General.

    (a) The U.S. Government sells defense articles and services to 
foreign governments or international organizations through foreign 
military sales (FMS) agreements. The agreement is documented on a DD 
Form 1513, DoD Offer and Acceptance. The DD Form 1513--
    (1) Lists the items and services, estimated costs, and terms and 
conditions of the sale;
    (2) Is presented to the foreign customer; and
    (3) Provides for signature of the foreign customer to indicate 
acceptance.
    (b) Acquisitions for FMS are conducted under the same acquisition 
and contract management procedures as other defense acquisitions.
    (c) Solicitations shall separately identify known FMS requirements 
and the FMS customer.
    (d) Contracts for known FMS requirements shall clearly be marked 
``FMS requirement'' on the face of the contract along with the FMS 
customer and the case identifier code.


<R05>
225.7302  Procedures.

    On FMS programs that will require an acquisition, the contracting 
officer

[[Page 194]]

assists the departmental/agency activity responsible for preparing the 
DoD Offer and Acceptance by--
    (a) Working with prospective contractors to--
    (1) Identify, in advance of the DoD Offer and Acceptance, any 
unusual provisions or deviations.
    (2) Advise the contractor if the departmental/agency activity 
expands, modifies, or does not accept any requirements proposed by the 
contractor;
    (3) Identify any logistics support necessary to perform the 
contract; and
    (4) For acquisitions over $10,000 that are to be awarded 
noncompetitively, asking the prospective contractor(s) for information 
on price, delivery, and other relevant factors. The request for 
information must identify the fact that the information is for a 
potential foreign military sale and must identify the foreign customer.
    (b) Working with the departmental/agency activity responsible for 
preparing the DoD Offer and Acceptance to--
    (1) Assist, as necessary, in preparation of the DD Form 1513;
    (2) Identify and explain all unusual contractual requirements or 
requests for deviations; and
    (3) Assist in preparing the price and availability data.
[56 FR 36367, July 31, 1991, as amended at 62 FR 2617, Jan. 17, 1997]


<R05>
225.7303  Pricing acquisitions for foreign military sales.

    Price FMS contracts using the same principles as are used in pricing 
other defense contracts. Application of the pricing principles in FAR 
parts 15 and 31 to an FMS contract, however, may result in prices that 
differ from other defense contract prices for the same item due to the 
considerations in this section.
[56 FR 36367, July 31, 1991, as amended at 61 FR 50453, Sept. 26, 1996]


<R05>
225.7303-1  Contractor sales to other foreign customers.

    If the contractor has made sales of the item required for the 
foreign military sale to foreign customers under comparable conditions, 
including quantity and delivery, price the FMS contract in accordance 
with FAR part 15.


<R05>
225.7303-2  Cost of doing business with a foreign government or an international organization.

    (a) In pricing FMS contracts where non-U.S. Government prices as 
described in 225.7303-1 do not exist, except as provided in 225.7303-5, 
recognize the reasonable and allocable costs of doing business with a 
foreign government or international organization, even though such costs 
might not be recognized in the same amounts in pricing other defense 
contracts. Examples of such costs include, but are not limited to--
    (1) Selling expenses (not otherwise limited by FAR part 31), e.g.--
    (i) Maintaining international sales and service organizations;
    (ii) Sales commissions and fees in accordance with FAR subpart 3.4;
    (iii) Sales promotions, demonstrations, and related travel for sales 
to foreign governments. Paragraph 126.8 of the International Traffic in 
Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR part 121) may require Government 
approval for these costs to be allowable. If Government approval is 
required for promotion or demonstration costs to be allowable, the 
approval must be obtained.
    (iv) Configuration studies and related technical services undertaken 
as a direct selling effort to a foreign country.
    (2) Product support and post-delivery service expenses, such as--
    (i) Operations or maintenance training, training or tactics films, 
manuals, or other related data; and
    (ii) Technical field services provided in a foreign country related 
to accident investigations, weapon system problems, operations/tactics 
enhancement, and related travel to foreign countries.
    (3) Offset implementation costs.
    (i) A U.S. defense contractor may recover costs incurred to 
implement its offset agreement with a foreign government or 
international organization if the foreign military sale Letter of Offer 
and Acceptance is financed wholly with customer cash or repayable 
foreign military finance credits.
    (ii) The U.S. Government assumes no obligation to satisfy or 
administer the offset requirement or to bear any of the associated 
costs.

[[Page 195]]

    (4) Costs that are the subject of advance agreement under the 
appropriate provisions of FAR part 31; or where the advance 
understanding places a limit on the amounts of cost that will be 
recognized as allowable in defense contract pricing, and the agreement 
contemplated that it will apply only to DoD contracts for the U.S. 
Government's own requirement (as distinguished from contracts for FMS).
    (b) Costs not allowable under FAR part 31 are not allowable in 
pricing foreign military sale contracts, except as noted in paragraph 
(c) of this subsection.
    (c) The provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2372 do not apply to contracts for 
foreign military sales. Therefore, the cost limitations on independent 
research and development and bid and proposal (IR&D/B&P) costs in FAR 
31.205-18 do not apply to such contracts, except as provided in 
225.7303-5. The allowability of IR&D/B&P costs on contracts for foreign 
military sales not wholly paid for from funds made available on a 
nonrepayable basis shall be limited to the contract's allocable share of 
the contractor's total IR&D/B&P expenditures. In pricing contracts for 
such foreign military sales--
    (1) Use the best estimate of reasonable costs in forward pricing.
    (2) Use actual expenditures, to the extent that they are reasonable, 
in determining final cost.
    (d) Under section 21(e)(1)(A) of the Arms Export Control Act, as 
amended, the United States must charge for administrative services to 
recover the estimated cost of administration of sales made under the 
Arms Export Control Act.
[56 FR 36367, July 31, 1991, as amended at 56 FR 67216, Dec. 30, 1991; 
57 FR 42631, Sept. 15, 1992; 57 FR 53600, Nov. 12, 1992; 59 FR 50511, 
Oct. 4, 1994; 61 FR 7744, Feb. 29, 1996; 61 FR 18987, Apr. 30, 1996]


<R05>
225.7303-3  Government-to-government agreements.

    If a government-to-government agreement between the United States 
and a foreign government for the sale, coproduction, or cooperative 
logistic support of a specifically defined weapon system, major end 
item, or support item, contains language in conflict with the provisions 
of this section, the language of the government-to-government agreement 
prevails.


<R05>
225.7303-4  Contingent fees.

    (a) Contingent fees are allowable under defense contracts provided 
that the fees are paid to a bona fide employee or a bona fide 
established commercial or selling agency maintained by the prospective 
contractor for the purpose of securing business (see FAR part 31 and FAR 
subpart 3.4). For FMS, it is extremely difficult for DoD to verify the 
services, or the value of the services. Therefore, the cost of allowable 
contingent fees (as defined in FAR subpart 3.4) is limited to $50,000.
    (b) Under DoD 5105.38-M, Security Assistance Management Manual, 
Letters of Offer and Acceptance for requirements for the governments of 
Australia, Taiwan, Egypt, Greece, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Republic of 
Korea, Kuwait, Pakistan, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Thailand, or 
Venezuela (Air Force) must provide that all U.S. Government contracts 
resulting from the Letters of Offer prohibit the payment of contingent 
fees unless the payments have been identified and payment approved in 
writing by the foreign customer before contract award. (See 
225.7308(a).)
[62 FR 2617, Jan. 17, 1997]


<R05>
225.7303-5  Aquisitions wholly paid for from nonrepayable funds.

    (a) In accordance with 22 U.S.C. 2762(d), foreign military sales 
wholly paid for from funds made available on a nonrepayable basis shall 
be priced on the same costing basis with regard to profit, overhead, 
IR&D/B&P, and other costing elements, as is applicable to acquisitions 
of like items purchased by DoD for its own use.
    (b) Direct costs associated with meeting a foreign customer's 
additional or unique requirements will be allowable under such 
contracts. Indirect burden rates applicable to such direct costs shall 
be permitted at the same rates applicable to acquisitions of like items 
purchased by DoD for its own use.
    (c) A U.S. defense contractor may not recover costs incurred to 
implement its offset agreement with a foreign government or 
international organization if

[[Page 196]]

the foreign military sale Letter of Offer and Acceptance is financed 
with funds made available on a nonrepayable basis.
[61 FR 18988, Apr. 30, 1996; 61 FR 49531, Sept. 20, 1996]


<R05>
225.7304  Source selection.

    (a) FMS customers may request that a defense article or defense 
service be obtained from a particular contractor. In such cases, FAR 
6.302-4 provides authority to contract without full-and-open 
competition. The FMS customer may also request that a subcontract be 
placed with a particular firm. The contracting officer shall honor such 
requests from the FMS customer only if the Letter of Agreement or other 
written direction sufficiently fulfills the requirements of FAR 6.3.
    (b) Do not allow representatives of the FMS customer to--
    (1) Direct the deletion of names of firms from bidders mailing lists 
or slates of proposed A-E firms. (They may suggest the inclusion of 
certain firms);
    (2) Interfere with a contractor's placement of subcontracts; or
    (3) Participate in the price negotiations between the U.S. 
Government and the contractor.
    (c) Do not accept directions from the FMS customer on source 
selection decisions or contract terms (other than the special contract 
provisions and warranties referred to in Condition A.2 of the DD Form 
1513).
    (d) Do not honor any requests by the FMS customer to reject any bid 
or proposal.


<R05>
225.7305  Limitation of liability.

    The contracting officer must advise the contractor whenever the 
foreign customer will assume the risk for loss or damage under the 
appropriate limitation of liability clause(s) (see FAR subpart 46.8). 
Consider the costs of necessary insurance, if any, obtained by the 
contractor to cover the risk of loss or damage in establishing the FMS 
contract price.


<R05>
225.7306  Exercise of options for foreign military sales.

    Consider changes to cost and profit attributable to pricing 
differences between U.S. and FMS requirements when exercising an option 
to satisfy an FMS requirement. Also consider such changes if the option 
is already identified for FMS, but it is exercised for country B 
requirements instead of the country A requirements for which it was 
priced.


<R05>
225.7307  Offset arrangements.

    In accordance with the Presidential policy statement of April 16, 
1990, DoD does not encourage, enter into, or commit U.S. firms to FMS 
offset arrangements. The decision whether to engage in offsets, and the 
responsibility for negotiating and implementing offset arrangements, 
resides with the companies involved.
[62 FR 34125, June 24, 1997]


<R05>
225.7308  Contract clauses.

    (a) Use the clause at 252.225-7027, Restriction on Contingent Fees 
for Foreign Military Sales, in all solicitations and contracts for 
foreign military sales.
    (b) Use the clause at 252.225-7028, Exclusionary Policies and 
Practices of Foreign Governments, in all solicitations and contracts for 
the purchase of goods and services for international military education 
training and foreign military sales.

Sec. 226.7000  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart implements the historically black college and 
university (HBCU) and minority institution (MI) provisions of 10 U.S.C. 
2323, which--
    (a) Set a goal for DoD for each of fiscal years 1987 through 2000 to 
award five percent of contract and subcontract dollars to small 
disadvantaged business concerns and HBCU/MIs; and
    (b) Require a separate goal, for each of fiscal years 1991 through 
2000, as a subset of the five percent goal, for the participation of 
HBCUs and MIs.
[59 FR 27672, May 27, 1994]


<R05>
226.7001  Definitions.

    Definitions of HBCUs and MIs are in the clause at 252.226-7000.


<R05>
226.7002  General policy.

    The DoD will use outreach efforts, technical assistance programs, 
advance payments, HBCU/MI set-asides, and evaluation preferences to meet 
its contract and subcontract goal for use of HBCUs and MIs. In addition, 
DoD will establish ``infrastructure assistance'' (e.g., scholarships, 
faculty development, teaming agreements with defense laboratories, and 
laboratory renovation) at colleges, universities, and institutions that 
agree to bear a substantial portion of the costs associated with the 
progams.
[56 FR 67216, Dec. 30, 1991]


<R05>
226.7003  Set-asides for HBCUs and MIs.


<R05>
226.7003-1  Set-aside criteria.

    Set-aside acquisitions for exclusive HBCU and MI participation when 
the acquisition is for research, studies, or services of the type 
normally acquired from higher educational institutions and there is a 
reasonable expectation that--
    (a) Offers will be submitted by at least two responsible HBCUs or 
MIs which can comply with the subcontracting limitations in the clause 
at FAR 52.219-14;
    (b) Award will be made at not more than ten percent above fair 
market price; and
    (c) Scientific and/or technological talent consistent with the 
demands of the acquisition will be offered.


<R05>
226.7003-2  Set-aside procedures.

    (a) As a general rule, use competitive negotiation for HBCU/MI set-
asides.
    (b) When using a broad agency announcement (FAR 35.016) for basic or 
applied research, make partial set-asides for HBCU/MIs as explained in 
235.016.

[[Page 198]]

    (c) Follow the special synopsis instructions in 205.207(d) (iii), 
(iv), and (v).
    (d) Cancel the set-aside if the low responsible offer exceeds the 
fair market price (defined in FAR part 19) by more than ten percent.


<R05>
226.7004  Evaluation preference for HBCUs and MIs.

    In acquisitions which use the evaluation preference described in 
subpart 219.70 for small disadvantaged business concerns, the preference 
also applies to offers from HBCUs or MIs.


<R05>
226.7005  Eligibility as an HBCU or MI.

    (a) To be eligible for award as an HBCU or MI under the preference 
procedures of this subpart, an offeror must--
    (1) Be an HBCU or MI, as defined in the clause at 252.226-7000, 
Notice of Historically Black College or University and Minority 
Institution Set-Aside, at the time of submission of its initial offer 
including price; and
    (2) Provide the contracting officer with evidence of its HBCU or MI 
status upon request.
    (b) The contracting officer shall accept an offeror's HBCU or MI 
status under the provision at 252.226-7001, unless--
    (1) Another offeror challenges the status; or
    (2) The contracting officer has reason to question the offeror's 
HBCU/MI status. (A list of HBCUs is published periodically by the 
Department of Education.)
[56 FR 36388, July 31, 1991, as amended at 59 FR 22131, Apr. 29, 1994; 
62 FR 2613, Jan. 17, 1997]


<R05>
226.7006  Protesting an HBCU or MI representation.

    Any offeror or other interested party may challenge an offeror's 
HBCU or MI representation by filing a protest with the contracting 
officer. The protest must contain specific detailed evidence supporting 
the basis for the challenge. Such protests are handled in accordance 
with FAR 33.103 and are decided by the contracting officer.


<R05>
226.7007  Goals and incentives for subcontracting with HBCU/MIs.

    (a) In reviewing subcontracting plans submitted under the clause at 
FAR 52.219-9, Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business 
Subcontracting Plan, the contracting officer shall--
    (1) Ensure that the contractor included anticipated awards to HBCU/
MIs in the small disadvantaged business goal;
    (2) Consider whether subcontracts are contemplated which involve 
research or studies of the type normally performed by higher educational 
institutions.
    (b) Use of incentives for subcontracting with HBCU/MIs is prescribed 
in 219.708(c)(1).


<R05>
226.7008  Solicitation provision and contract clause.

    (a) Use the clause at 252.226-7000, Notice of Historically Black 
College or University and Minority Institution Set-Aside, in 
solicitations and contracts set-aside for HBCU/MIs.
    (b) Use the provision at 252.226-7001, Historically Black College or 
University and Minority Institution Status, in solicitations set-aside 
for HBCU/MIs and in solicitations which contain the clause at 252.219-
7006, Notice of Evaluation Preference for Small Disadvantaged Business 
Concerns.

counties, unless otherwise defined by the agency head.
[60 FR 29499, June 5, 1995]


<R05>
226.7102  Policy.

    Businesses located in the vicinity of a military installation that 
is being closed or realigned under a base closure law, including 10 
U.S.C. 2687, and small and small disadvantaged businesses shall be 
provided maximum practicable opportunity to participate in acquisitions 
that support the closure or realignment, including acquisitions for 
environmental restoration and mitigation.


<R05>
226.7103  Procedure.

    In considering acquisitions for award through the section 8(a) 
program (subpart 219.8 and FAR subpart 19.8) or in making set-aside 
decisions under subpart 219.5 and FAR subpart 19.5 for acquisitions in 
support of a base closure or realignment, the contracting officer 
shall--
    (a) Determine whether there is a reasonable expectation that offers 
will be received from responsible business concerns located in the 
vicinity of the military installation that is being closed or realigned.
    (b) If offers can not be expected from business concerns in the 
vicinity, proceed with section 8(a) or set-aside consideration as 
otherwise indicated in part 219 and FAR part 19.
    (c) If offers can be expected from business concerns in the 
vicinity--
    (1) Consider section 8(a) only if the 8(a) contractor is located in 
the vicinity.
    (2) Set aside the acquisition for small disadvantaged business only 
if one of the expected offers is from a small disadvantaged business 
located in the vicinity.
    (3) Set aside the acquisition for small business only if one of the 
expected offers is from a small business located in the vicinity.
[60 FR 29499, June 5, 1995]


<R05>
226.7104  Other considerations.

    When planning for contracts for services related to base closure 
activities at a military installation affected by a closure or 
realignment under a base closure law, contracting officers shall 
consider including, as a factor in source selection, the extent to which 
offerors specifically identify and commit, in their proposals, to a plan 
to hire residents of the vicinity of the military installation that is 
being closed or realigned.

<R04>
             Subpart 226.72--Base Closures and Realignments


<R05>
226.7200  Scope.

    This subpart identifies the various policies and statutory 
authorities that affect contracts associated with the closure and 
realignment of military installations. These policies and authorities 
are--
    (a) Right of first refusal of employment. This authority is embodied 
in a clause for use in solicitations and contracts arising from the 
closure of a military installation. The clause establishes employment 
rights for Government employees who are adversely affected by closure of 
the installation (see subpart 222.71).
    (b) Preference for local and small business. This authority allows 
contracting officers, when entering into a contract as part of the 
closure or realignment of a military installation, to give preference, 
to the greatest extent practicable, to qualified businesses located in 
the vicinity of the installation and to small and small disadvantaged 
business concerns (see subpart 226.71).
    (c) Services at installations being closed. This authority allows 
DoD, under certain conditions, to contract with local governments for 
police, fire protection, airfield operations and other community 
services at installations being closed (see subpart 237.74).

<R04>
   Subpart 227.6--Foreign License and Technical Assistance Agreements


<R05>
227.670  Scope.

    This subpart prescribes policy with respect to foreign license and 
technical assistance agreements.


<R05>
227.671  General.

    In furtherance of the Military Assistance Program or for other 
national defense purposes, the Government may undertake to develop or 
encourage the development of foreign additional sources of supply. The 
development of such sources may be accomplished by an agreement, often 
called a foreign licensing agreement or technical assistance agreement, 
wherein a domestic concern, referred to in this subpart as a ``primary 
source,'' agrees to furnish to a foreign concern or government, herein 
referred to as a ``second source;'' foreign patent rights; technical 
assistance in the form of data, know-how, trained personnel of the 
primary source, instruction and guidance of the personnel of the second 
source, jigs, dies, fixtures, or other manufacturing aids, or such other 
assistance, information, rights, or licenses as are needed to enable the 
second source to produce particular supplies or perform particular 
services. Agreements calling for one or more of the foregoing may be 
entered into between the primary source and the Government, a foreign 
government, or a foreign concern. The consideration for providing such 
foreign license and technical assistance may be in the form of a lump 
sum payment, payments for each item manufactured by the second source, 
an agreement to exchange data and patent rights on improvements made to 
the article or service, capital stock transactions, or any combination 
of these. The primary source's bases for computing such consideration 
may include actual costs; charges for the use of patents, data, or know-
how reflecting the primary source's investment in developing and 
engineering and production techniques; and the primary source's 
``price'' for setting up a second source. Such agreements often refer to 
the compensation to be paid as a royalty or license fee whether or not 
patent rights are involved.


<R05>
227.672  Policy.

    It is Government policy not to pay in connection with its contracts, 
and not to allow to be paid in connection with contracts made with funds 
derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the 
United States Government, charges for use of patents in which it holds a 
royalty-free license or charges for data which it has a right to use and 
disclose to others, or which is in the public domain, or which the 
Government has acquired without restriction upon its use and disclosure 
to others. This policy shall be applied by the Departments in 
negotiating contract prices for foreign license technical assistance 
contracts (227.675) or supply contracts with second sources (227.674); 
and in commenting on such agreements when they are referred to the 
Department of Defense by the Department of State pursuant to section 414 
of the Mutual Security Act of 1954 as amended (22 U.S.C. 1934) and the 
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (see 227.675).


<R05>
227.673  Foreign license and technical assistance agreements between the Government and domestic concerns.

    (a) Contracts between the Government and a primary source to provide 
technical assistance or patent rights to a second source for the 
manufacture of supplies or performance of services shall, to the extent 
practicable, specify the rights in patents and data and any other rights 
to be supplied to the second source. Each contract shall provide, in 
connection with any separate agreement between the primary source and 
the second source for patent rights or technical assistance relating to 
the articles or services involved in the contract, that--
    (1) The primary source and his subcontractors shall not make, on 
account of any purchases by the Government or by others with funds 
derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the 
Government, any charge to the second source for royalties or 
amortization for patents or inventions in which the Government

[[Page 203]]

holds a royalty-free license; or data which the Government has the right 
to possess, use, and disclose to others; or any technical assistance 
provided to the second source for which the Government has paid under a 
contract between the Government and the primary source; and
    (2) The separate agreement between the primary and second source 
shall include a statement referring to the contract between the 
Government and the primary source, and shall conform to the requirements 
of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (see 227.675-1).
    (b) The following factors, among others, shall be considered in 
negotiating the price to be paid the primary source under contracts 
within (a) of this section:
    (1) The actual cost of providing data, personnel, manufacturing 
aids, samples, spare parts, and the like;
    (2) The extent to which the Government has contributed to the 
development of the supplies or services, and to the methods of 
manufacture or performance, through past contracts for research and 
development or for manufacture of the supplies or performance of the 
services; and
    (3) The Government's patent rights and rights in data relating to 
the supplies or services and to the methods of manufacture or of 
performance.


<R05>
227.674  Supply contracts between the Government and a foreign government or concern.

    In negotiating contract prices with a second source, including the 
redetermination of contract prices, or in determining the allowability 
of costs under a cost-reimbursement contract with a second source, the 
contracting officer:
    (a) Shall obtain from the second source a detailed statement (see 
FAR 27.204-1(a)(2)) of royalties, license fees, and other compensation 
paid or to be paid to a primary source (or any of his subcontractors) 
for patent rights, rights in data, and other technical assistance 
provided to the second source, including identification and description 
of such patents, data, and technical assistance; and
    (b) Shall not accept or allow charges which in effect are--
    (1) For royalties or amortization for patents or inventions in which 
the Government holds a royalty-free license; or
    (2) For data which the Government has a right to possess, use, and 
disclose to others; or
    (3) For any technical assistance provided to the second source for 
which the Government has paid under a contract between the Government 
and a primary source.


<R05>
227.675  Foreign license and technical assistance agreements between a domestic concern and a foreign government or concern.


<R05>
227.675-1  International Traffic in Arms Regulations.

    Pursuant to section 414 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as 
amended (22 U.S.C. 1934), the Department of State controls the 
exportation of data relating to articles designated in the United States 
Munitions List as arms, ammunition, or munitions of war. (The Munitions 
List and pertinent procedures are set forth in the International Traffic 
in Arms Regulations, 22 CFR, et seq.) Before authorizing such 
exportation, the Department of State generally requests comments from 
the Department of Defense. On request of the Office of the Assistant 
Secretary of Defense (International Security Affairs), each Department 
shall submit comments thereon as the basis for a Department of Defense 
reply to the Department of State.


<R05>
227.675-2  Review of agreements.

    (a) In reviewing foreign license and technical assistance agreements 
between primary and second sources, the Department concerned shall, 
insofar as its interests are involved, indicate whether the agreement 
meets the requirements of Secs. 124.07-124.10 of the International 
Traffic in Arms Regulations or in what respects it is deficient. 
Paragraphs (b) through (g) of this subsection provide general guidance.
    (b) When it is reasonably anticipated that the Government will 
purchase from the second source the supplies or services involved in the 
agreement, or that Military Assistance Program

[[Page 204]]

funds will be provided for the procurement of the supplies or services, 
the following guidance applies.
    (1) If the agreement specifies a reduction in charges thereunder, 
with respect to purchases by or for the Government or by others with 
funds derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise 
through the Government, in recognition of the Government's rights in 
patents and data, the Department concerned shall evaluate the amount of 
the reduction to determine whether it is fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances, before indicating its approval.
    (2) If the agreement does not specify any reduction in charges or 
otherwise fails to give recognition to the Government's rights in the 
patents or data involved, approval shall be conditioned upon amendment 
of the agreement to reflect a reduction, evaluated by the Department 
concerned as acceptable to the Government, in any charge thereunder with 
respect to purchases made by or for the Government or by others with 
funds derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise 
through the Government, in accordance with Sec. 124.10 of the 
International Traffic in Arms Regulations.
    (3) If the agreement provides that no charge is to be made to the 
second source for data or patent rights to the extent of the 
Government's rights, the Department concerned shall evaluate the 
acceptability of the provision before indicating its approval.
    (4) If time or circumstances do not permit the evaluation called for 
in (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection, the guidance in (c) of this 
subsection shall be followed.
    (c) When it is not reasonably anticipated that the Government will 
purchase from the second source the supplies or services involved in the 
agreement nor that Military Assistance Program funds will be provided 
for the purchase of the supplies or services, then the following 
guidance applies.
    (1) If the agreement provides for charges to the second source for 
data or patent rights, it may suffice to fulfill the requirements of 
Sec. 124.10 insofar as the Department of Defense is concerned if:
    (i) The agreement requires the second source to advise the primary 
source when he has knowledge of any purchase made or to be made from him 
by or for the Government or by others with funds derived through the 
Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the Government;
    (ii) The primary source separately agrees with the Government that 
upon such advice to him from the second source or from the Government or 
otherwise as to any such a purchase or prospective purchase, he will 
negotiate with the Department concerned an appropriate reduction in his 
charges to the second source in recognition of any Government rights in 
patents or data; and
    (iii) The agreement between the primary and second sources further 
provides that in the event of any such purchase and resulting reduction 
in charges, the second source shall pass on this reduction to the 
Government by giving the Government a corresponding reduction in the 
purchase price of the article or service.
    (2) If the agreement provides that no charge is to be made to the 
second source for data or patent rights to the extent to which the 
Government has rights, the Department concerned shall:
    (i) Evaluate the acceptability of the provision before indicating 
its approval; or
    (ii) Explicitly condition its approval on the right to evaluate the 
acceptability of the provision at a later time.
    (d) When there is a technical assistance agreement between the 
primary source and the Government related to the agreement between the 
primary and second sources that is under review, the latter agreement 
shall reflect the arrangements contemplated with respect thereto by the 
Government's technical assistance agreement with the primary source.
    (e) Every agreement shall provide that any license rights 
transferred under the agreement are subject to existing rights of the 
Government.
    (f) In connection with every agreement referred to in (b) of this 
section, a request shall be made to the primary source--

[[Page 205]]

    (1) To identify the patents, data, and other technical assistance to 
be provided to the second source by the primary source or any of his 
subcontractors,
    (2) To identify any such patents and data in which, to the knowledge 
of the primary source, the Government may have rights, and
    (3) To segregate the charges made to the second source for each such 
category or item of patents, data, and other technical assistance.

Reviewing personnel shall verify this information or, where the primary 
source does not furnish it, obtain such information from Governmental 
sources so far as practicable.
    (g) The Department concerned shall make it clear that its approval 
of any agreement does not necessarily recognize the propriety of the 
charges or the amounts thereof, or constitute approval of any of the 
business arrangements in the agreement, unless the Department expressly 
intends by its approval to commit itself to the fairness and 
reasonableness of a particular charge or charges. In any event, a 
disclaimer should be made to charges or business terms not affecting any 
purchase made by or for the Government or by others with funds derived 
through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the 
Government.


<R05>
227.676  Foreign patent interchange agreements.

    (a) Patent interchange agreements between the United States and 
foreign governments provide for the use of patent rights, compensation, 
free licenses, and the establishment of committees to review and make 
recommendations on these matters. The agreements also may exempt the 
United States from royalty and other payments. The contracting officer 
shall ensure that royalty payments are consistent with patent 
interchange agreements.
    (b) Assistance with patent rights and royalty payments in the United 
States European Command (USEUCOM) area of responsibility is available 
from HQ USEUCOM, ATTN: ECLA, Unit 30400, Box 1000, APO AE 09128;

     Subpart 227.70--Infringement Claims, Licenses, and Assignments


<R05>
227.7000  Scope.

    This subpart prescribes policy, procedures, and instructions for use 
of clauses with respect to processing licenses, assignments, and 
infringement claims.


<R05>
227.7001  Policy.

    Whenever a claim of infringement of privately owned rights in 
patented inventions or copyrighted works is asserted against any 
Department or Agency of the Department of Defense, all necessary steps 
shall be taken to investigate, and to settle administratively, deny, or 
otherwise dispose of such claim prior to suit against the United States. 
This subpart 227.70 does not apply to licenses or assignments acquired 
by the Department of Defense under the Patent Rights clauses.

so, giving reasons, and stating a reasonable basis for his belief that 
his patent or patents are being infringed.
    (b) In addition to the information listed in (a) of this section, 
the following material and information is generally necessary in the 
course of processing a claim of patent infringement. Claimants are 
encouraged to furnish this information at the time of filing a claim to 
permit the most expeditious processing and settlement of the claim.
    (1) A copy of the asserted patent(s) and identification of all 
claims of the patent alleged to be infringed.
    (2) Identification of all procurements known to claimant which 
involve the alleged infringing item or process, including the identity 
of the vendor or contractor and the Government procuring activity.
    (3) A detailed identification of the accused article or process, 
particularly where the article or process relates to a component or 
subcomponent of the item procured, an element by element comparison of 
the representative claims with the accused article or process. If 
available, this identification should include documentation and drawings 
to illustrate the accused article or process in suitable detail to 
enable verification of the infringement comparison.

Patent Office file, particularly publications and foreign art.

In addition in the foregoing, if claimant can provide a statement that 
the investigation may be limited to the specifically identified accused 
articles or processes, or to a specific procurement, it may materially 
expedite determination of the claim.
    (c) Any Department receiving an allegation of patent infringement 
which meets the requirements of this paragraph shall acknowledge the 
same and supply the other Departments which may have an interest therein 
with a copy of such communication and the acknowledgement thereof.

61 FR 50454, Sept. 26, 1996; 62 FR 2613, Jan. 17, 1997]


<R05>
227.7005  Indirect notice of patent infringement claims.

    (a) A communication by a patent owner to a Department of Defense 
contractor alleging that the contractor has committed acts of 
infringement in performance of a Government contract shall not be 
considered a claim within the meaning of 227.7004 until it meets the 
requirements specified therein.
    (b) Any Department receiving an allegation of patent infringement 
which meets the requirements of 227.7004 shall acknowledge the same and 
supply the other Departments (see 227.7004(c)) which may have an 
interest therein with a copy of such communication and the 
acknowledgement thereof.
    (c) If a communication covering an infringement claim or notice 
which does not meet the requirements of 227.7004(a) is received from a 
contractor, the patent owner shall be advised in writing as covered by 
the instructions of 227.7004(d).


<R05>
227.7006  Investigation and administrative disposition of claims.

    An investigation and administrative determination (denial or 
settlement) of each claim shall be made in accordance with instructions 
and procedures established by each Department, subject to the following:
    (a) When the procurement responsibility for the alleged infringing 
item or process is assigned to a single Department or only one 
Department is the purchaser of the alleged infringing item or process, 
and the funds of that Department only are to be charged in the 
settlement of the claim, that Department shall have the sole 
responsibility for the investigation and administrative determination of 
the claim and for the execution of any agreement in settlement of the 
claim. Where, however, funds of another Department are to be charged, in 
whole or in part, the approval of such Department shall be obtained as 
required by 208.7002. Any agreement in settlement of the claim, approved 
pursuant to 208.7002 shall be executed by each of the Departments 
concerned.
    (b) When two or more Departments are the respective purchasers of 
alleged infringing items or processes and the funds of those Departments 
are to be charged in the settlement of the claim, the investigation and 
administrative determination shall be the responsibility of the 
Department having the predominant financial interest in the claim or of 
the Department or Departments as jointly agreed upon by the Departments 
concerned. The Department responsible for negotiation shall, throughout 
the negotiation, coordinate with the other Departments concerned and 
keep them advised of the status of the negotiation. Any agreement in the 
settlement of the claim shall be executed by each Department concerned.


<R05>
227.7007  Notification and disclosure to claimants.

    When a claim is denied, the Department responsible for the 
administrative determination of the claim shall so notify the claimant 
or his authorized representative and provide the claimant a reasonable 
rationale of the basis for denying the claim. Disclosure of information 
or the rationale referred to above shall be subject to applicable 
statutes, regulations, and directives pertaining to security, access to 
official records, and the rights of others.


<R05>
227.7008  Settlement of indemnified claims.

    Settlement of claims involving payment for past infringement shall 
not be

[[Page 208]]

made without the consent of, and equitable contribution by, each 
indemnifying contractor involved, unless such settlement is determined 
to be in the best interests of the Government and is coordinated with 
the Department of Justice with a view to preserving any rights of the 
Government against the contractors involved. If consent of and equitable 
contribution by the contractors are obtained, the settlement need not be 
coordinated with the Department of Justice.


<R05>
227.7009  Patent releases, license agreements, and assignments.

    This section contains clauses for use in patent release and 
settlement agreements, license agreements, and assignments, executed by 
the Government, under which the Government acquires rights. Minor 
modifications of language (e.g., pluralization of ``Secretary'' or 
``Contracting Officer'') in multi-departmental agreements may be made if 
necessary.


<R05>
227.7009-1  Required clauses.

    (a) Covenant Against Contingent Fees. Insert the clause at FAR 
52.203-5.
    (b) Gratuities. Insert the clause at FAR 52.203-3.
    (c) Assignment of Claims. Insert the clause at FAR 52.232-23.

    (e) Non-Estoppel. Insert the clause at 252.227-7000.
[56 FR 36389, July 31, 1991, as amended at 61 FR 50454, Sept. 26, 1996]


<R05>
227.7009-2  Clauses to be used when applicable.

    (a) Release of past infringement. The clause at 252.227-7001, 
Release of Past Infringement, is an example which may be modified or 
omitted as appropriate for particular circumstances, but only upon the 
advice of cognizant patent or legal counsel. (See footnotes at end of 
clause.)
    (b) Readjustment of payments. The clause at 252.227-7002, 
Readjustment of Payments, shall be inserted in contracts providing for 
payment of a running royalty.
    (c) Termination. The clause at 252.227-7003, Termination, is an 
example for use in contracts providing for the payment of a running 
royalty. This clause may be modified or omitted as appropriate for 
particular circumstances, but only upon the advice of cognizant patent 
or legal counsel (see 227.7004(c)).


<R05>
227.7009-3  Additional clauses--contracts except running royalty contracts.

    The following clauses are examples for use in patent release and 
settlement agreements, and license agreements not providing for payment 
by the Government of a running royalty.
    (a) License Grant. Insert the clause at 252.227-7004.
    (b) License Term. Insert one of the clauses at 252.227-7005 
Alternate I or Alternate II, as appropriate.


<R05>
227.7009-4  Additional clauses--contracts providing for payment of a running royalty.

    The clauses set forth below are examples which may be used in patent 
release and settlement agreements, and license agreements, when it is 
desired to cover the subject matter thereof and the contract provides 
for payment of a running royalty.
    (a) License grant--running royalty. No Department shall be obligated 
to pay royalties unless the contract is signed on behalf of such 
Department. Accordingly, the License Grant clause at 252.227-7006 should 
be limited to the practice of the invention by or for the signatory 
Department or Departments.
    (b) License term--running royalty. The clause at 252.227-7007 is a 
sample form for expressing the license term.
    (c) Computation of royalties. The clause at 252.227-7008 providing 
for the computation of royalties, may be of varying scope depending upon 
the nature of the royalty bearing article, the volume of procurement, 
and the type of contract pursuant to which the procurement is to be 
accomplished.
    (d) Reporting and payment of royalties. (1) The contract should 
contain a provision specifying the office designated within the specific 
Department involved to make any necessary reports to the contractor of 
the extent of use of the licensed subject matter by the entire 
Department, and such office shall be charged with the responsibility of 
obtaining from all procuring offices

[[Page 209]]

of that Department the information necessary to make the required 
reports and corresponding vouchers necessary to make the required 
payments. The clause at 252.227-7009 is a sample for expressing 
reporting and payment of royalties requirements.
    (2) Where more than one Department or Government Agency is licensed 
and there is a ceiling on the royalties payable in any reporting period, 
the licensing Departments or Agencies shall coordinate with respect to 
the pro rata share of royalties to be paid by each.
    (e) License to other government agencies. When it is intended that a 
license on the same terms and conditions be available to other 
departments and agencies of the Government, the clause at 252.227-7010 
is an example which may be used.


<R05>
227.7010  Assignments.

    (a) The clause at 252.227-7011 is an example which may be used in 
contracts of assignment of patent rights to the Government.
    (b) To facilitate proof of contracts of assignments, the 
acknowledgement of the contractor should be executed before a notary 
public or other officer authorized to administer oaths (35 U.S.C. 261).


<R05>
227.7011  Procurement of rights in inventions, patents, and copyrights.

    Even though no infringement has occurred or been alleged, it is the 
policy of the Department of Defense to procure rights under patents, 
patent applications, and copyrights whenever it is in the Government's 
interest to do so and the desired rights can be obtained at a fair 
price. The required and suggested clauses at 252.227-7004 and 252.227-
7010 shall be required and suggested clauses, respectively, for license 
agreements and assignments made under this paragraph. The instructions 
at 227.7009-3 and 227.7010 concerning the applicability and use of those 
clauses shall be followed insofar as they are pertinent.


<R05>
227.7012  Contract format.

    The format at 252.227-7012 appropriately modified where necessary, 
may be used for contracts of release, license, or assignment.


<R05>
227.7013  Recordation.

    Executive Order No. 9424 of 18 February 1944 requires all executive 
Departments and agencies of the Government to forward through 
appropriate channels to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, for 
recording, all Government interests in patents or applications for 
patents.

                Subpart 227.71--Rights in Technical Data

    Source:  60 FR 33471, June 28, 1995, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
227.7100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart--
    (a) Prescribes policies and procedures for the acquisition of 
technical data and the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, 
perform, display, or disclose technical data. It implements requirements 
in the following laws and Executive Order:
    (1) 10 U.S.C. 2302(4).
    (2) 10 U.S.C. 2305 (subsection (d)(4)).
    (3) 10 U.S.C. 2320.
    (4) 10 U.S.C. 2321.
    (5) 10 U.S.C. 2325.
    (6) Pub. L. 103-355.
    (7) Executive Order 12591 (Subsection 1(b)(6)).
    (b) Does not apply to computer software or technical data that is 
computer software documentation (see subpart 227.72).


<R05>
227.7101  Definitions.

    (a) As used in this subpart, unless otherwise specifically 
indicated, the terms ``offeror'' and ``contractor'' include an offeror's 
or contractor's subcontractors, suppliers, or potential subcontractors 
or suppliers at any tier.
    (b) Other terms used in this subpart are defined in the clause at 
252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items.
[56 FR 36389, July 31, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 61598, Nov. 30, 1995]


<R05>
227.7102  Commercial items, components, or processes.

    Section 2320(b)(1) of Title 10 U.S.C. establishes a presumption that 
commercial items are developed at private expense whether or not a 
contractor

[[Page 210]]

submits a justification in response to a challenge notice. Therefore, do 
not challenge a contractor's assertion that a commercial item, 
component, or process was developed at private expense unless the 
Government can demonstrate that it contributed to development of the 
item, component or process. Follow the procedures in 227.7103-13 and the 
clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical 
Data, when information provided by the Department of Defense 
demonstrates that an item, component, or process was not developed 
exclusively at private expense. However, when a challenge is warranted, 
a contractor's or subcontractor's failure to respond to the challenge 
notice cannot be the sole basis for issuing a final decision denying the 
validity of an asserted restriction.


<R05>
227.7102-1  Policy.

    (a) DoD shall acquire only the technical data customarily provided 
to the public with a commercial item or process, except technical data 
that--
    (1) Are form, fit, or function data;
    (2) Are required for repair or maintenance of commercial items or 
processes, or for the proper installation, operating, or handling of a 
commercial item, either as a stand alone unit or as a part of a military 
system, when such data are not customarily provided to commercial users 
or the data provided to commercial users is not sufficient for military 
purposes; or
    (3) Describe the modifications made at Government expense to a 
commercial item or process in order to meet the requirements of a 
Government solicitation.
    (b) To encourage offerors and contractors to offer or use commercial 
products to satisfy military requirements, offerors, and contractors 
shall not be required, except for the technical data described in 
paragraph (a) of this subsection, to--
    (1) Furnish technical information related to commercial items or 
processes that is not customarily provided to the public; or
    (2) Relinquish to, or otherwise provide, the Government rights to 
use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical 
data pertaining to commercial items or processes except for a transfer 
of rights mutually agreed upon.


<R05>
227.7102-2  Rights in technical data.

    (a) The clause at 252.227-7015, Technical Data--Commercial Items, 
provides the Government specific license rights in technical data 
pertaining to commercial items or processes. DoD may use, modify, 
reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose data only within the 
Government. The data may not be used to manufacture additional 
quantities of the commercial items and, except for emergency repair or 
overhaul, may not be released or disclosed to, or used by, third parties 
without the contractor's written permission. Those restrictions do not 
apply to the technical data described in 227.7102-1(a).
    (b) If additional rights are needed, contracting activities must 
negotiate with the contractor to determine if there are acceptable terms 
for transferring such rights. The specific additional rights granted to 
the Government shall be enumerated in a license agreement made part of 
the contract.


<R05>
227.7102-3  Contract clause.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, use the 
clause at 252.227-7015, Technical Data--Commercial Items, in all 
solicitations and contracts when the contractor will be required to 
deliver technical data pertaining to commercial items, components, or 
processes. Do not require the contractor to include this clause in its 
subcontracts.
    (b) Use the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data--
Noncommercial Items, in lieu of the clause at 252.227-7015 if the 
Government will pay any portion of the development costs. Do not require 
the contractor to include this clause in its subcontracts for commercial 
items or commercial components.
    (c) Use the clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive 
Markings on Technical Data, in all solicitations and contracts for 
commercial items that include the clause at 252.227-7015 or the clause 
at 252.227-7013. Do not require the contractor to include this clause in

[[Page 211]]

its subcontracts for commercial items or commercial components.
[56 FR 36389, July 31, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 61598, Nov. 30, 1995]


<R05>
227.7103  Noncommercial items or processes.


<R05>
227.7103-1  Policy.

    (a) DoD policy is to acquire only the technical data, and the rights 
in that data, necessary to satisfy agency needs.
    (b) Solicitations and contracts shall--
    (1) Specify the technical data to be delivered under a contract and 
delivery schedules for the data;
    (2) Establish or reference procedures for determining the 
acceptability of technical data;
    (3) Establish separate contract line items, to the extent 
practicable, for the technical data to be delivered under a contract and 
require offerors and contractors to price separately each deliverable 
data item; and
    (4) Require offerors to identify, to the extent practicable, 
technical data to be furnished with restrictions on the Government's 
rights and require contractors to identify technical data to be 
delivered with such restrictions prior to delivery.
    (c) Offerors shall not be required, either as a condition of being 
responsive to a solicitation or as a condition for award, to sell or 
otherwise relinquish to the Government any rights in technical data 
related to items, components or processes developed at private expense 
except for the data identified at 227.7103-5(a)(2) and (a)(4) through 
(9).
    (d) Offerors and contractors shall not be prohibited or discouraged 
from furnishing or offering to furnish items, components, or processes 
developed at private expense solely because the Government's rights to 
use, modify, release, reproduce, perform, display, or disclose technical 
data pertaining to those items may be restricted.
    (e) As provided in 10 U.S.C. 2305, solicitations for major systems 
development contracts shall not require offerors to submit proposals 
that would permit the Government to acquire competitively items 
identical to items developed at private expense unless a determination 
is made at a level above the contracting officer that--
    (1) The offeror will not be able to satisfy program schedule or 
delivery requirements; or
    (2) The offeror's proposal to meet mobilization requirements does 
not satisfy mobilization needs.


<R05>
227.7103-2  Acquisition of technical data.

    (a) Contracting officers shall work closely with data managers and 
requirements personnel to assure that data requirements included in 
solicitations are consistent with the policy expressed in 227.7103-1.
    (b)(1) Data managers or other requirements personnel are responsible 
for identifying the Government's minimum needs for technical data. Data 
needs must be established giving consideration to the contractor's 
economic interests in data pertaining to items, components, or processes 
that have been developed at private expense; the Government's costs to 
acquire, maintain, store, retrieve, and protect the data; reprocurement 
needs; repair, maintenance and overhaul philosophies; spare and repair 
part considerations; and whether procurement of the items, components, 
or processes can be accomplished on a form, fit, or function basis. When 
it is anticipated that the Government will obtain unlimited or 
government purpose rights in technical data that will be required for 
competitive spare or repair parts procurements, such data should be 
identified as deliverable data items. Reprocurement needs may not be a 
sufficient reason to acquire detailed manufacturing or process data when 
items or components can be acquired using performance specifications, 
form, fit and function data, or when there are a sufficient number of 
alternate sources which can reasonably be expected to provide such items 
on a performance specification or form, fit, or function basis.
    (2) When reviewing offers received in response to a solicitation or 
other request for data, data managers must balance the original 
assessment of the Government's data needs with data prices contained in 
the offer.

[[Page 212]]

    (c) Contracting officers are responsible for ensuring that, wherever 
practicable, solicitations and contracts--
    (1) Identify the type and quantity of the technical data to be 
delivered under the contract and the format and media in which the data 
will be delivered;
    (2) Establish each deliverable data item as a separate contract line 
item (this requirement may be satisfied by listing each deliverable data 
item on an exhibit to the contract);
    (3) Identify the prices established for each deliverable data item 
under a fixed-price type contract;
    (4) Include delivery schedules and acceptance criteria for each 
deliverable data item; and
    (5) Specifically identify the place of delivery for each deliverable 
item of technical data.


<R05>
227.7103-3  Early identification of technical data to be furnished to the Government with restrictions on use, reproduction or disclosure.

    (a) 10 U.S.C. 2320 requires, to the maximum extent practicable, an 
identification prior to delivery of any technical data to be delivered 
to the Government with restrictions on use.
    (b) Use the provision at 252.227-7017, Identification and Assertion 
of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions, in all solicitations that 
include the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data--
Noncommercial Items. The provision requires offerors to identify any 
technical data for which restrictions, other than copyright, on use, 
release, or disclosure are asserted and to attach the identification and 
assertions to the offer.
    (c) Subsequent to contract award, the clause at 252.277-7013 permits 
a contractor, under certain conditions, to make additional assertions of 
use, release, or disclosure restrictions. The prescription for the use 
of that clause and its alternate is at 227.7103-6 (a) and (b).


<R05>
227.7103-4  License rights.

    (a) Grant of license. The Government obtains rights in technical 
data, including a copyright license, under and irrevocable license 
granted or obtained for the Government by the contractor. The contractor 
or licensor retains all rights in the data not granted to the 
Government. For technical data that pertain to items, components, or 
processes, the scope of the license is generally determined by the 
source of funds used to develop the item, component, or process. When 
the technical data do not pertain to items, components, or processes, 
the scope of the license is determined by the source of funds used to 
create the data.
    (1) Techical data pertaining to items, components, or processes. 
Contractors or licensors may, with some exceptions (see 227.7103-5(a)(2) 
and (a)(4) through (9)), restrict the Government's rights to use, 
modify, release, reproduce, perform, display or disclose technical data 
pertaining to items, components, or processes developed exclusively at 
private expense (limited rights). They may not restrict the Government's 
rights in items, components, or processes developed exclusively at 
Government expense (unlimited rights) without the Government's approval. 
When an item, component, or process is developed with mixed funding, the 
Government may use, modify, release, reproduce, perform, display or 
disclose the data pertaining to such items, components, or processes 
within the Government without restriction but may release or disclose 
the data outside the Government only for government purposes (government 
purpose rights).
    (2) Technical data that do not pertain to items, components, or 
processes. Technical data may be created during the performance of a 
contract for a conceptual design or similar effort that does not require 
the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, 
components or processes. The Government generally obtains unlimited 
rights in such data when the data were created exclusively with 
Government funds, government purpose rights when the data were created 
with mixed funding, and limited rights when the data were created 
exclusively at private expense.
    (b) Source of funds determination. The determination of the source 
of development funds for technical data pertaining to items, components, 
or processes should be made at any practical sub-item or subcomponent 
level or for any

[[Page 213]]

segregable portion of a process. Contractors may assert limited rights 
in a segregable sub-item, sub-component, or portion of a process which 
otherwise qualifies for limited rights under the clause at 252.227-7013, 
Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items.


<R05>
227.7103-5  Government rights.

    The standard license rights that a licensor grants to the Government 
are unlimited rights, government purpose rights, or limited rights. 
Those rights are defined in the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in 
Technical Data--Noncommercial Items. In unusual situations, the 
standards rights may not satisfy the Government's needs or the 
Government may be willing to accept lesser rights in data in return for 
other consideration. In those cases, a special license may be 
negotiated. However, the licensor is not obligated to provide the 
Government greater rights and the contracting officer is not required to 
accept lesser rights than the rights provided in the standard grant of 
license. The situations under which a particular grant of license 
applies are enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection.
    (a) Unlimited rights. The Government obtains unlimited rights in 
technical data that are--
    (1) Data pertaining to an item, component, or process which has been 
or will be developed exclusively with Government funds;
    (2) Studies, analyses, test data, or similar data produced in the 
performance of a contract when the study, analysis, test, or similar 
work was specified as an element of performance;
    (3) Created exclusively with Government funds in the performance of 
a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, 
construction, or production of items, components, or processes;
    (4) Form, fit, and function data;
    (5) Necessary for installation, operation, maintenance, or training 
purposes (other than detailed manufacturing or process data);
    (6) Corrections or changes to technical data furnished to the 
contractor by the Government;
    (7) Publicly available or have been released or disclosed by the 
contractor or subcontractor without restrictions on further use, release 
or disclosure other than a release or disclosure resulting from the 
sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the software to 
another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business 
entity or its assets to another party;
    (8) Data in which the Government has obtained unlimited rights under 
another Government contract or as a result of negotiations; or
    (9) Data furnished to the Government, under a Government contract or 
subcontract thereunder, with--
    (i) Government purpose license rights or limited rights and the 
restrictive condition(s) has/have expired; or
    (ii) Government purpose rights and the contractor's exclusive right 
to use such data for commercial purposes has expired.
    (b) Government purpose rights. (1) The Government obtains government 
purpose rights in technical data--
    (i) That pertain to items, components, or processes developed with 
mixed funding except when the Government is entitled to unlimited rights 
as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(4) through (9) of this 
subsection; or
    (ii) Created with mixed funding in the performance of a contract 
that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or 
production of items, components, or processes.
    (2) The period during which government purpose rights are effective 
is negotiable. The clause at 252.227-7013 provides a nominal five-year 
period. Either party may request a different period. Changes to the 
government purpose rights period may be made at any time prior to 
delivery of the technical data without consideration from either party. 
Longer periods should be negotiated when a five-year period does not 
provide sufficient time to apply the data for commercial purposes or 
when necessary to recognize subcontractors' interests in the data.
    (3) The government purpose rights period commences upon execution of 
the contract, subcontract, letter contract (or similar contractual 
instrument), contract modification, or option exercise that required the 
development. Upon expiration of the Government rights period, the 
Government

[[Page 214]]

has unlimited rights in the data including the right to authorize others 
to use the data for commercial purposes.
    (4) During the government purpose rights period, the government may 
not use, or authorize other persons to use, technical data marked with 
government purpose rights legends for commercial purposes. The 
Government shall not release or disclose data in which it has government 
purpose rights to any person, or authorize others to do so, unless--
    (i) Prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is 
subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7; or
    (ii) The intended recipient is a Government contractor receiving 
access to the data for performance of a Government contract that 
contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or 
Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive 
Legends.
    (5) When technical data marked with government purpose rights 
legends will be released or disclosed to a Government contractor 
performing a contract that does not include the clause at 252-227-7025, 
the contract may be modified, prior to release or disclosure, to include 
that clause in lieu of requiring the contractor to complete a use and 
non-disclosure agreement.
    (6) Contracting activities shall establish procedures to assure that 
technical data marked with government purpose rights legends are 
released or disclosed, including a release or disclosure through a 
Government solicitation, only to persons subject to the use and non-
disclosure restrictions. Public announcements in the Commerce Business 
Daily or other publications must provide notice of the use and non-
disclosure requirements. Class use and non-disclosure agreements (e.g., 
agreements covering all solicitations received by the XYZ company within 
a reasonable period) are authorized and may be obtained at any time 
prior to release or disclosure of the government purpose rights data. 
Documents transmitting government purpose rights data to persons under 
class agreements shall identify the technical data subject to government 
purpose rights and the class agreement under which such data are 
provided.
    (c) Limited rights. (1) The Government obtains limited rights in 
technical data--
    (i) That pertain to items, components, or processes developed 
exclusively at private expense except when the Government is entitled to 
unlimited rights as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(4) through (9) 
of this subsection; or
    (ii) Created exclusively at private expense in the performance of a 
contract that does not require the development, manufacture, 
construction, or production of items, components, or processes.
    (2) Data in which the Government has limited rights may not be used, 
released, or disclosed outside the Government without the permission of 
the contractor asserting the restriction except for a use, release or 
disclosure that is--
    (i) Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or
    (ii) To a foreign government, other than detailed manufacturing or 
process data, when use, release, or disclosure is in the interest of the 
United States and is required for evaluation or informational purposes.
    (3) The person asserting limited rights must be notified of the 
Government's intent to release, disclose, or authorize others to use 
such data prior to release or disclosure of the data except notification 
of an intended release, disclosure, or use for emergency repair or 
overhaul which shall be made as soon as practicable.
    (4) When the person asserting limited rights permits the Government 
to release, disclose, or have others use the data subject to 
restrictions on further use, release, or disclosure, or for a release 
under paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (ii) of this subsection, the intended 
recipient must complete the use and non-disclosure agreement at 
227.7103-7 prior to release or disclosure of the limited rights data.
    (d) Specifically negotiated license rights. (1) Negotiate specific 
licenses when the parties agree to modify the standard license rights 
granted to the government or when the government wants to obtain rights 
in data in which

[[Page 215]]

it does not have rights. When negotiating to obtain, relinquish, or 
increase the Government's rights in technical data, consider the 
acquisition strategy for the item, component, or process, including 
logistics support and other factors which may have relevance for a 
particular procurement. The Government may accept lesser rights when it 
has unlimited or government purpose rights in data but may not accept 
less than limited rights in such data. The negotiated license rights 
must stipulate what rights the Government has to release or disclose the 
data to other persons or to authorize others to use the data. Identify 
all negotiated rights in a license agreement made part of the contract.
    (2) When the Government needs additional rights in data acquired 
with government purpose or limited rights, the contracting officer must 
negotiate with the contractor to determine whether there are acceptable 
terms for transferring such rights. Generally, such negotiations should 
be conducted only when there is a need to disclose the data outside the 
Government or if the additional rights are required for competitive 
reprocurement and the anticipated savings expected to be obtained 
through competition are estimated to exceed the acquisition cost of the 
additional rights. Prior to negotiating for additional rights in limited 
rights data, consider alternatives such as--
    (i) Using performance specifications and form, fit, and function 
data to acquire or develop functionally equivalent items, components, or 
processes;
    (ii) Obtaining a contractor's contractual commitment to qualify 
additional sources and maintain adequate competition among the sources; 
or
    (iii) Reverse engineering, or providing items from Government 
inventories to contractors who request the items to facilitate the 
development of equivalent items through reverse engineering.


<R05>
227.7103-6  Contract clauses.

    (a) Use the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data--
Noncommercial Items, in solicitations and contracts when the successful 
offeror(s) will be required to deliver technical data to the Government. 
Do not use the clause when the only deliverable items are computer 
software or computer software documentation (see 227.72), commercial 
items (see 227.7102-3), existing works (see 227.7105), special works 
(see 227.7106), or when contracting under the Small Business Innovation 
Research Program (see 227.7104). Except as provided in 227.7107-2, do 
not use the clause in architect-engineer and construction contracts.
    (b) Use the clause at 252.227-7013 with its Alternate I in research 
contracts when the contracting officer determines, in consultation with 
counsel, that public dissemination by the contractor would be--
    (1) In the interest of the government; and
    (2) Facilitated by the Government relinquishing its right to publish 
the work for sale, or to have others publish the work for sale on behalf 
of the Government.
    (c) Use the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or 
Disclosure of Government Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive 
Legends, in solicitations and contracts when it is anticipated that the 
Government will provide the contractor, for performance of its contract, 
technical data marked with another contractor's restrictive legend(s).
    (d) Use the provision at 252.227-7028, Technical Data or Computer 
Software Previously Delivered to the Government, in solicitations when 
the resulting contract will require the contractor to deliver technical 
data. The provision requires offerors to identify any technical data 
specified in the solicitations as deliverable data items that are the 
same or substantially the same as data items the offeror has delivered 
or is obligated to deliver, either as a contractor or subcontractor, 
under any other federal agency contract.
    (e) Use the following clauses in solicitations and contracts that 
include the clause at 252.227-7013:
    (1) 252.227-7016, Rights in Bid or Proposal Information;
    (2) 252.227-7030, Technical Data--Withholding of Payment;
    (3) 252.227-7036, Declaration of Technical Data Conformity; and

[[Page 216]]

    (4) 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical 
Data (paragraph (e) of the clause contains information that must be 
included in a challenge).

<R05>
227.7103-7  Use and non-disclosure agreement.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, 
technical data or computer software delivered to the Government with 
restrictions on use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, 
display, or disclosure may not be provided to third parties unless the 
intended recipient completes and signs the use and non-disclosure 
agreement at paragraph (c) of this subsection prior to release, or 
disclosure of the data.
    (1) The specific conditions under which an intended recipient will 
be authorized to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or 
disclose technical data subject to limited rights or computer software 
subject to restricted rights must be stipulated in an attachment to the 
use and non-disclosure agreement.
    (2) For an intended release, disclosure, or authorized use of 
technical data or computer software subject to special license rights, 
modify paragraph (1)(d) of the use and non-disclosure agreement to enter 
the conditions, consistent with the license requirements, governing the 
recipient's obligations regarding use, modification, reproduction, 
release, performance, display or disclosure of the data or software.
    (b) The requirement for use and non-disclosure agreements does not 
apply to Government contractors which require access to a third party's 
data or software for the performance of a Government contract that 
contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or 
Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive 
Legends.
    (c) The prescribed use and non-disclosure agreement is:

                    Use and Non-Disclosure Agreement

    The undersigned, ________________ (Insert Name) ________________, an 
authorized representative of the ________________ (Insert Company Name) 
________________, (which is hereinafter referred to as the 
``Recipient'') requests the Government to provide the Recipient with 
technical data or computer software (hereinafter referred to as 
``Data'') in which the Government's use, modification, reproduction, 
release, performance, display or disclosure rights are restricted. Those 
Data are identified in an attachment to this Agreement. In consideration 
for receiving such Data, the Recipient agrees to use the Data strictly 
in accordance with this Agreement:
    (1) The Recipient shall--
    (a) Use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose 
Data marked with government purpose rights or SBIR data rights legends 
only for government purposes and shall not do so for any commercial 
purpose. The Recipient shall not release, perform, display, or disclose 
these Data, without the express written permission of the contractor 
whose name appears in the restrictive legend (the ``Contractor''), to 
any person other than its subcontractors or suppliers, or prospective 
subcontractors or suppliers, who require these Data to submit offers 
for, or perform, contracts with the Recipient. The Recipient shall 
require its subcontractors or suppliers, or prospective subcontractors 
or suppliers, to sign a use and non-disclosure agreement prior to 
disclosing or releasing these Data to such persons. Such agreement must 
be consistent with the terms of this agreement.
    (b) Use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose 
technical data marked with limited rights legends only as specified in 
the attachment to this Agreement. Release, performance, display, or 
disclosure to other persons is not authorized unless specified in the 
attachment to this Agreement or expressly permitted in writing by the 
Contractor. The Recipient shall promptly notify the Contractor of the 
execution of this Agreement and identify the Contractor's Data that has 
been or will be provided to the Recipient, the date and place the Data 
were or will be received, and the name and address of the Government 
office that has provided or will provide the Data.
    (c) Use computer software marked with restricted rights legends only 
in performance of Contract Number ________________ (insert contract 
number(s)) ________________. The recipient shall not, for example, 
enhance, decompile, disassemble, or reverse engineer the software; time 
share, or use a computer program with more than one computer at a time. 
The recipient may not release, perform, display, or disclose such 
software to others unless expressly permitted in writing

[[Page 217]]

by the licensor whose name appears in the restrictive legend. The 
Recipient shall promptly notify the software licensor of the execution 
of this Agreement and identify the software that has been or will be 
provided to the Recipient, the date and place the software were or will 
be received, and the name and address of the Government office that has 
provided or will provide the software.
    (d) Use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose 
Data marked with special license rights legends (To be completed by the 
contracting officer. See 227.7103-7(a)(2). Omit if none of the Data 
requested is marked with special license rights legends).
    (2) The Recipient agrees to adopt or establish operating procedures 
and physical security measures designed to protect these Data from 
inadvertent release or disclosure to unauthorized third parties.
    (3) The Recipient agrees to accept these Data ``as is'' without any 
Government representation as to suitability for intended use or warranty 
whatsoever. This disclaimer does not affect any obligation the 
Government may have regarding Data specified in a contract for the 
performance of that contract.
    (4) The Recipient may enter into any agreement directly with the 
Contractor with respect to the use, modification, reproduction, release, 
performance, display, or disclosure of these Data.
    (5) The Recipient agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the 
Government, its agents, and employees from every claim or liability, 
including attorneys fees, court costs, and expenses arising out of, or 
in any way related to, the misuse or unauthorized modification, 
reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of Data 
received from the Government with restrictive legends by the Recipient 
or any person to whom the Recipient has released or disclosed the Data.
    (6) The Recipient is executing this Agreement for the benefit of the 
Contractor. The Contractor is a third party beneficiary of this 
Agreement who, in addition to any other rights it may have, is intended 
to have the rights of direct action against the Recipient or any other 
person to whom the Recipient has released or disclosed the Data, to seek 
damages from any breach of this Agreement or to otherwise enforce this 
Agreement.
    (7) The Recipient agrees to destroy these Data, and all copies of 
the Data in its possession, no later than 30 days after the date shown 
in paragraph (8) of this Agreement, to have all persons to whom it 
released the Data do so by that date, and to notify the Contractor that 
the Data have been destroyed.
    (8) This Agreement shall be effective for the period commencing with

<R05>
227.7103-8  Deferred delivery and deferred ordering of technical data.

    (a) Deferred delivery. Use the clause at 252.227-7026, Deferred 
Delivery of Technical Data or Computer Software, when it is in the 
Government's interests to defer the delivery of technical data. The 
clause permits the contracting officer to require the delivery of 
technical data identified as ``deferred delivery'' data at any time 
until two years after acceptance by the Government of all items (other 
than technical data or computer software) under the contract or contract 
termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors or 
suppliers to deliver such technical data expires two years after the 
date the prime contractor accepts the last item from the subcontractor 
or supplier for use in the performance of the contract. The contract 
must specify which technical data is subject to deferred delivery. The 
contracting officer shall notify the contractor sufficiently in advance 
of the desired delivery date for such data to permit timely delivery.
    (b) Deferred ordering. Use the clause at 252.227-7027, Deferred 
Ordering of Technical Data or Computer Software, when a firm requirement 
for a particular data item(s) has not been established prior to contract 
award but there is a potential need for the data. Under this clause, the 
contracting officer may order any data that has been generated in the 
performance of the contract or any subcontract thereunder at any time 
until three years after acceptance of all items (other than technical 
data or computer software) under the contract or contract termination, 
whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors to deliver such 
data expires three years after the date the contractor accepts the last

[[Page 218]]

item under the subcontract. When the data are ordered, the delivery 
dates shall be negotiated and the contractor compensated only for 
converting the data into the prescribed form, reproduction costs, and 
delivery costs.


<R05>
227.7103-9  Copyright.

    (a) Copyright license. (1) The clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in 
Technical Data--Noncommercial Items, requires a contractor to grant or 
obtain for the Government license rights which permit the Government to 
reproduce data, distribute copies of the data, publicly perform or 
display the data or, through the right to modify data, prepare 
derivative works. The extent to which the Government, and others acting 
on its behalf, may exercise these rights varies for each of the standard 
data rights licenses obtained under the clause. When non-standard 
license rights in technical data will be negotiated, negotiate the 
extent of the copyright license concurrent with negotiations for the 
data rights license. Do not negotiate a copyright license that provides 
less rights than the standard limited rights license in technical data.
    (2) The clause at 252.227-7013 does not permit a contractor to 
incorporate a third party's copyrighted data into a deliverable data 
item unless the contractor has obtained an appropriate license for the 
Government and, when applicable, others acting on the Government's 
behalf, or has obtained the contracting officer's written approval to do 
so. Grant approval to use third party copyrighted data in which the 
Government will not receive a copyright license only when the 
Government's requirements cannot be satisfied without the third party 
material or when the use of the third party material will result in cost 
savings to the Government which outweigh the lack of a copyright 
license.
    (b) Copyright considerations--acquisition of existing and special 
works. See 227.7105 or 227.7106 for copyright considerations when 
acquiring existing or special works.


<R05>
227.7103-10  Contractor identification and marking of technical data to be furnished with restrictive markings.

    (a) Identification requirements. (1) The solicitation provision at 
252.227-7017, Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or 
Disclosure Restrictions, requires offerors to identify to the 
contracting officer, prior to contract award, any technical data that 
the offeror asserts should be provided to the Government with 
restrictions on use, modification, reproduction, release or disclosure. 
This requirement does not apply to restrictions based solely on 
copyright. The notification and identification must be submitted as an 
attachment to the offer. If an offeror fails to submit the attachment or 
fails to complete the attachment in accordance with the requirements of 
the solicitation provision, such failure shall constitute a minor 
informality. Provide offerors an opportunity to remedy a minor 
informality in accordance with the procedures at FAR 14.405 or 15.607. 
An offeror's failure to correct the informality within the time 
prescribed by the contracting officer shall render the offer ineligible 
for award.
    (2) The procedures for correcting minor informalities shall not be 
used to obtain information regarding asserted restrictions or an 
offeror's suggested asserted rights category. Questions regarding the 
justification for an asserted restriction or asserted rights category 
must be pursued in accordance with the procedures at 227.7103-13.
    (3) The restrictions asserted by a successful offeror shall be 
attached to its contract unless, in accordance with the procedures at 
227.7103-13, the parties have agreed that an asserted restriction is not 
justified. The contract attachment shall provide the same information 
regarding identification of the technical data, the asserted rights 
category, the basis for the assertion, and the name of the person 
asserting the restrictions as required by paragraph (d) of the 
solicitation provision at 252.227-7017. Subsequent to contract award, 
the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial 
Items, permits the contractor to make

[[Page 219]]

additional assertions under certain conditions. The additional 
assertions must be made in accordance with the procedures and in the 
format prescribed by that clause.
    (4) Neither the pre- or post-award assertions made by the 
contractor, nor the fact that certain assertions are identified in the 
attachment to the contract, determine the respective rights of the 
parties. As provided at 227.7103-13, the Government has the right to 
review, verify, challenge and validate restrictive markings.
    (5) Information provided by offerors in response to the solicitation 
provision may be used in the source selection process to evaluate the 
impact on evaluation factors that may be created by restrictions on the 
Government's ability to use or disclose technical data. However, 
offerors shall not be prohibited from offering products for which the 
offeror is entitled to provide the Government limited rights in the 
technical data pertaining to such products and offerors shall not be 
required, either as a condition of being responsive to a solicitation or 
as a condition for award, to sell or otherwise relinquish any greater 
rights in technical data when the offeror is entitled to provide the 
technical data with limited rights.
    (b) Contractor marking requirements. The clause at 252.227-7013, 
Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items--
    (1) Requires a contractor that desires to restrict the Government's 
rights in technical data to place restrictive markings on the data, 
provides instructions for the placement of the restrictive markings, and 
authorizes the use of certain restrictive markings; and
    (2) Requires a contractor to deliver, furnish, or otherwise provide 
to the Government any technical data in which the Government has 
previously obtained rights with the Government's pre-existing rights in 
that data unless the parties have agreed otherwise or restrictions on 
the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, 
display, or disclose the data have expired. When restrictions are still 
applicable, the contractor is permitted to mark the data with the 
appropriate restrictive legend for which the data qualified.
    (c) Unmarked technical data. (1) Technical data delivered or 
otherwise provided under a contract without restrictive markings shall 
be presumed to have been delivered with unlimited rights and may be 
released or disclosed without restriction. To the extent practicable, if 
a contractor has requested permission (see paragraph (c)(2) of this 
subsection) to correct an inadvertent omission of markings, do not 
release or disclose the technical data pending evaluation of the 
request.
    (2) A contractor may request permission to have appropriate legends 
placed on unmarked technical data at its expense. The request must be 
received by the contracting officer within six months following the 
furnishing or delivery of such data, or any extension of that time 
approved by the contracting officer. The person making the request must:
    (i) Identify the technical data that should have been marked;
    (ii) Demonstrate that the omission of the marking was inadvertent, 
the proposed marking is justified and conforms with the requirements for 
the marking of technical data contained in the clause at 252.227-7013; 
and
    (iii) Acknowledge, in writing, that the Government has no liability 
with respect to any disclosure, reproduction, or use of the technical 
data made prior to the addition of the marking or resulting from the 
omission of the marking.
    (3) Contracting officers should grant permission to mark only if the 
technical data were not distributed outside the Government or were 
distributed outside the Government with restrictions on further use or 
disclosure.


<R05>
227.7103-11  Contractor procedures and records.

    (a) The clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data--
Noncommercial Items, requires a contractor, and its subcontractors or 
suppliers that will deliver technical data with other than unlimited 
rights, to establish and follow written procedures to assure that 
restrictive markings are used only when authorized and to maintain

[[Page 220]]

records to justify the validity of asserted restrictions on delivered 
data.
    (b) The clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings 
on Technical Data requires contractors and their subcontractors at any 
tier to maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of 
restrictive markings on technical data delivered or to be delivered 
under a Government contract.


<R05>
227.7103-12  Government right to establish conformity of markings.

    (a) Nonconforming markings. (1) Authorized markings are identified 
in the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial 
Items. All other markings are nonconforming markings. An authorized 
marking that is not in the form, or differs in substance, from the 
marking requirements in the clause at 252.227-7013 is also a 
nonconforming marking.
    (2) The correction of nonconforming markings on technical data is 
not subject to 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on 
Technical Data. To the extent practicable, the contracting officer 
should return technical data bearing nonconforming markings to the 
person who has placed the nonconforming markings on such data to provide 
that person an opportunity to correct or strike the nonconforming 
marking at that person's expense. If that person fails to correct the 
nonconformity and return the corrected data within 60 days following the 
person's receipt of the data, the contracting officer may correct or 
strike the nonconformity at that person's expense. When it is 
impracticable to return technical data for correction, contracting 
officers may unilaterally correct any nonconforming markings at 
Government expense. Prior to correction, the data may be used in 
accordance with the proper restrictive marking.
    (b) Unjustified markings. (1) An unjustified marking is an 
authorized marking that does not depict accurately restrictions 
applicable to the Government's use, modification, reproduction, release, 
performance, display, or disclosure of the marked technical data. For 
example, a limited rights legend placed on technical data pertaining to 
items, components, or processes that were developed under a Government 
contract either exclusively at Government expense or with mixed funding 
(situations under which the Government obtains unlimited or government 
purpose rights) is an unjustified marking.
    (2) Contracting officers have the right to review and challenge the 
validity of unjustified markings. However, at any time during 
performance of a contract and notwithstanding existence of a challenge, 
the contracting officer and the person who has asserted a restrictive 
marking may agree that the restrictive marking is not justified. Upon 
such agreement, the contracting officer may, at his or her election, 
either--
    (i) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at that person's 
expense; or
    (ii) Return the technical data to the person asserting the 
restriction for correction at that person's expense. If the data are 
returned and that person fails to correct or strike the unjustified 
restriction and return the corrected data to the contracting officer 
within 60 days following receipt of the data, the unjustified marking 
shall be corrected or stricken at that person's expense.


<R05>
227.7103-13  Government right to review, verify, challenge and validate asserted restrictions.

    (a) General. An offeror's assertion(s) of restrictions on the 
Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, or disclose 
technical data do not, by themselves, determine the extent of the 
Government's rights in the technical data. Under 10 U.S.C. 2321, the 
Government has the right to challenge asserted restrictions when there 
are reasonable grounds to question the validity of the assertion and 
continued adherence to the assertion would make it impractical to later 
procure competitively the item to which the data pertain.
    (b) Pre-award considerations. The challenge procedures required by 
10 U.S.C. 2321 could significantly delay awards under competitive 
procurements. Therefore, avoid challenging asserted restrictions prior 
to a competitive contract award unless resolution of the assertion is 
essential for successful completion of the procurement.

[[Page 221]]

    (c) Challenge and validation. Contracting officers must have 
reasonable grounds to challenge the current validity of an asserted 
restriction. Before issuing a challenge to an asserted restriction, 
carefully consider all available information pertaining to the 
assertion. All challenges must be made in accordance with the provisions 
of the clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on 
Technical Data.
    (1) Challenge period. Asserted restrictions should be reviewed 
before acceptance of technical data deliverable under the contract. 
Assertions must be challenged within three years after final payment 
under the contract or three years after delivery of the data, whichever 
is later. However, restrictive markings may be challenged at any time if 
the technical data--
    (i) Are publicly available without restrictions;
    (ii) Have been provided to the United States without restriction; or
    (iii) Have been otherwise made available without restriction other 
than a release or disclosure resulting from the sale, transfer, or other 
assignment of interest in the technical data to another party or the 
sale or transfer of some or all of a business entity or its assets to 
another party.
    (2) Pre-challenge requests for information. (i) After consideration 
of the situation described in paragraph (c)(3) of this subsection, 
contracting officers may request the person asserting a restriction to 
furnish a written explanation of the facts and supporting documentation 
for the assertion in sufficient detail to enable the contracting officer 
to ascertain the basis of the restrictive markings. Additional 
supporting documentation may be requested when the explanation provided 
by the person making the assertion does not, in the contracting 
officer's opinion, establish the validity of the assertion.
    (ii) If the person asserting the restriction fails to respond to the 
contracting officer's request for information or additional supporting 
documentation, or if the information submitted or any other available 
information pertaining to the validity of a restrictive marking does not 
justify the asserted restriction, a challenge should be considered.
    (3) Transacting matters directly with subcontracts. The clause at 
252.227-7037 obtains the contractor's agreement that the Government may 
transact matters under the clause directly with a subcontractor, at any 
tier, without creating or implying privity of contract. Contracting 
officers should permit a subcontractor or supplier to transact challenge 
and validation matters directly with the Government when--
    (i) A subcontractor's or supplier's business interests in its 
technical data would be compromised if the data were disclosed to a 
higher tier contractor;
    (ii) There is reason to believe that the contractor will not respond 
in a timely manner to a challenge and an untimely response would 
jeopardize a subcontractor's or suppliers right to assert restrictions; 
or
    (iii) Requested to do so by a subcontractor or supplier.
    (4) Challenge notice. Do not issue a challenge notice unless there 
are reasonable grounds to question the validity of an assertion. 
Assertions may be challenged whether or not supporting documentation was 
requested from the person asserting the restriction. Challenge notices 
must be in writing and issued to the contractor or, after consideration 
of the situations described in paragraph (c)(3) of this subsection, the 
person asserting the restriction. The challenge notice must include the 
information in paragraph (e) of the clause at 252.227-7037.
    (5) Extension of response time. The contracting officer, at his or 
her discretion, may extend the time for response contained in a 
challenge notice, as appropriate, if the contractor submits a timely 
written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a 
response.
    (6) Contracting officer's final decision. Contracting officers must 
issue a final decision for each challenged assertion, whether or not the 
assertion has been justified.
    (i) A contracting officer's final decision that an assertion is not 
justified must be issued a soon as practicable following the failure of 
the person asserting the restriction to respond to the contracting 
officer's challenge within 60 days, or any extension to

[[Page 222]]

that time granted by the contracting officer.
    (ii) A contracting officer who, following a challenge and response 
by the person asserting the restriction, determines that an asserted 
restriction is justified, shall issue a final decision sustaining the 
validity of the asserted restriction. If the asserted restriction was 
made subsequent to submission of the contractor's offer, add the 
asserted restriction to the contract attachment.
    (iii) A contracting officer who determine that the validity of an 
asserted restriction has not been justified shall issue a contracting 
officer's final decision within the time frames prescribed in 252.227-
7037. As provided in paragraph (g) of that clause, the Government is 
obligated to continue to respect the asserted restrictions through final 
disposition of any appeal unless the agency head notifies the person 
asserting the restriction that urgent or compelling circumstances do not 
permit the Government to continue to respect the asserted restriction.
    (7) Multiple challenges to an asserted restriction. When more than 
one contracting officer challenges an asserted restriction, the 
contracting officer who made the earliest challenge is responsible for 
coordinating the Government challenges. That contracting officer shall 
consult with all other contracting officers making challenges, verify 
that all challenges apply to the same asserted restriction and, after 
consulting with the contractor, subcontractor, or supplier asserting the 
restriction, issue a schedule that provides that person a reasonable 
opportunity to respond to each challenge.
    (8) Validation. Only a contracting officer's final decision, or 
actions of an agency board of contract appeals or a court of competent 
jurisdiction, that sustain the validity of an asserted restriction 
constitute validation of the asserted restriction.


<R05>
227.7103-14  Conformity, acceptance, and warranty of technical data.

    (a) Statutory requirements. 10 U.S.C. 2320--
    (1) Requires contractors to furnish written assurance, at the time 
technical data are delivered or are made available to the Government, 
that the technical data are complete, accurate, and satisfy the 
requirements of the contract concerning such data;
    (2) Provides for the establishment of remedies applicable to 
technical data found to be incomplete, inadequate, or not to satisfy the 
requirements of the contract concerning such data; and
    (3) Authorizes agency heads to withhold payments (or exercise such 
other remedies an agency head considers appropriate) during any period 
if the contractor does not meet the requirements of the contract 
pertaining to the delivery of technical data.
    (b) Conformity and acceptance. (1) Solicitations and contracts 
requiring the delivery of technical data shall specify the requirements 
the data must satisfy to be acceptable. Contracting officers, or their 
authorized representatives, are responsible for determining whether 
technical data tendered for acceptance conform to the contractual 
requirements.
    (2) The clause at 252.227-7030, Technical Data--Withholding of 
Payment, provides for withholding up to 10 percent of the contract price 
pending correction or replacement of the nonconforming technical data or 
negotiation of an equitable reduction in contract price. The amount 
subject to withholding may be expressed as a fixed dollar amount or as a 
percentage of the contract price. In either case, the amount shall be 
determined giving consideration to the relative value and importance of 
the data. For example--
    (i) When the sole purpose of a contract is to produce the data, the 
relative value of that data may be considerably higher than the value of 
data produced under a contract where the production of the data is a 
secondary objective; or
    (ii) When the Government will maintain or repair items, repair and 
maintenance data may have a considerably higher relative value than data 
that merely describe the item or provide performance characteristics.
    (3) Do not accept technical data that do not conform to the 
contractual requirements in all respects. Except for nonconforming 
restrictive markings (see paragraph (b)(4) of this subsection), 
correction or replacement of

[[Page 223]]

nonconforming data or an equitable reduction in contract price when 
correction or replacement of the nonconforming data is not practicable 
or is not in the Government's interests, shall be accomplished in 
accordance with--
    (i) The provisions of a contract clause providing for inspection and 
acceptance of deliverables and remedies for nonconforming deliverables; 
or
    (ii) The procedures at FAR 46.407(c) through (g), if the contract 
does not contain an inspection clause providing remedies for 
nonconforming deliverables.
    (4) Follow the procedures at 227.7103-12(a)(2) if nonconforming 
markings are the sole reason technical data fail to conform to 
contractual requirements. The clause at 252.227-7030 may be used to 
withhold an amount for payment, consistent with the terms of the clause, 
pending correction of the nonconforming markings.
    (c) Warranty. (1) The intended use of the technical data and the 
cost, if any, to obtain the warranty should be considered before 
deciding to obtain a data warranty (see FAR 46.703). The fact that a 
particular item, component, or process is or is not warranted is not a 
consideration in determining whether or not to obtain a warranty for the 
technical data that pertain to the item, component, or process. For 
example, a data warranty should be considered if the Government intends 
to repair or maintain an item and defective repair or maintenance data 
would impair the Government's effective use of the item or result in 
increased costs to the Government.
    (2) As prescribed in 246.710, use the clause at 252.246-7001, 
Warranty of Data, and its alternates, or a substantially similar clause 
when the Government needs a specific warranty of technical data.


<R05>
227.7103-15  Subcontractor rights in technical data.

    (a) 10 U.S.C. 2320 provides subcontractors at all tiers the same 
protection for their rights in data as is provided to prime contractors. 
The clauses at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial 
Items, and 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical 
Data, implement the statutory requirements.
    (b) 10 U.S.C. 2321 permits a subcontractor to transact directly with 
the Government matters relating to the validation of its asserted 
restrictions on the Government's rights to use or disclose technical 
data. The clause at 252.227-7037 obtains a contractor's agreement that 
the direct transaction of validation or challenge matters with 
subcontractors at any tier does not establish or imply privity of 
contract. When a subcontractor or supplier exercise its right to 
transact validation matters directly with the Government, contracting 
officers shall deal directly with such persons, as provided at 227.7103-
13(c)(3).
    (c) Require prime contractors whose contracts include the following 
clauses to include those clauses, without modification except for 
appropriate identification of the parties, in contracts with 
subcontractors or suppliers, at all tiers, who will be furnishing 
technical data for non-commercial items in response to a Government 
requirement:
    (1) 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items;
    (2) 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of 
Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends;
    (3) 252.227-7028, Technical Data or Computer Software Previously 
Delivered to the Government; and
    (4) 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical 
Data.
    (d) Do not require contractors to have their subcontractors or 
suppliers at any tier relinquish rights in technical data to the 
contractor, a higher tier subcontractor, or to the Government, as a 
condition for award of any contract, subcontract, purchase order, or 
similar instrument except for the rights obtained by the Government 
under the Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items clause contained 
in the contractor's contract with the Government.

<R05>
227.7103-16  Providing technical data to foreign governments, foreign contractors, or international organizations.

    Technical data may be released or disclosed to foreign governments, 
foreign contractors, or international organizations only if release or 
disclosure is otherwise permitted both by Federal export controls and 
other national security laws or regulations. Subject to such laws and 
regulations, the Department of Defense--
    (a) May release or disclose technical data in which it has obtained 
unlimited rights to such foreign entities or authorize the use of such 
data by those entities; and
    (b) Shall not release or disclose technical data for which 
restrictions on use, release, or disclosure have been asserted to 
foreign entities, or authorize the use of technical data by those 
entities, unless the intended recipient is subject to the same 
provisions as included in the use and non-disclosure agreement at 
227.7103-7 and the requirements of the clause at 252.227-7103, Rights in 
Technical Data--Noncommercial Items, governing use, modification, 
reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of such data 
have been satisfied.


<R05>
227.7103-17  Overseas contracts with foreign sources.

    (a) The clause at 252.227-7032, Rights in Technical Data and 
Computer Software (Foreign), may be used in contracts with foreign 
contractors to be performed overseas, except Canadian purchases (see 
paragraph (c) of this subsection), in lieu of the clause at 252.227-
7013, Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items, when the Government 
requires the unrestricted right to use, modify, reproduce, perform, 
display, release or disclose all technical data to be delivered under 
the contract. Do not use the clause in contracts for existing or special 
works.
    (b) When the Government does not require unlimited rights, the 
clause at 252.227-7032 may be modified to accommodate the needs of a 
specific overseas procurement situation. The Government should obtain 
rights in the technical data that are not less than the rights the 
Government would have obtained under the data rights clause(s) 
prescribed in this part for a comparable procurement performed within 
the United States or its possessions.
    (c) Contracts for Canadian purchases shall include the appropriate 
data rights clause prescribed in this part for a comparable procurement 
performed within the United States or its possessions.


<R05>
227.7104  Contracts under the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program.

    (a) Use the clause at 252.227-7018, Rights in Noncommercial 
Technical Data and Computer Software--Small Business Innovation Research 
(SBIR) Program, when technical data or computer software will be 
generated during performance of contracts under the SBIR program.
    (b) Under the clause at 252.227-7018, the Government obtains a 
royalty-free license to use technical data marked with an SBIR data 
rights legend only for government purposes during the period commencing 
with contract award and ending five years after completion of the 
project under which the data were generated. Upon expiration of the 
five-year restrictive license, the Government has unlimited rights in 
the SBIR data. During the license period, the Government may not release 
or disclose SBIR data to any person other than its support services 
contractors except--
    (1) For evaluational purposes;
    (2) As expressly permitted by the contractor; or
    (3) A use, release, or disclosure that is necessary for emergency 
repair or overhaul of items operated by the Government.
    (c) Do not make any release or disclosure permitted by paragraph (b) 
of this section unless, prior to release or disclosure, the intended 
recipient is subject to the use and nondisclosure agreement at 227.7103-
7.
    (d) Use the clause at 252.227-7018 with its Alternate I in research 
contracts when the contracting officer determines, in consultation with 
counsel, that public dissemination by the contractor would be--
    (1) In the interest of the Government; and

[[Page 225]]

    (2) Facilitated by the Government relinquishing its right to publish 
the work for sale, or to have others publish the work for sale on behalf 
of the Government.
    (e) Use the following provision and clauses in SBIR solicitations 
and contracts that include the clause at 252.227-7018:
    (1) 252.227-7016, Rights in Bid or Proposal Information;
    (2) 252.227-7017, Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or 
Disclosure Restrictions;
    (3) 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions--Computer 
Software;
    (4) 252.227-7030, Technical Data--Withholding of Payment;
    (5) 252.227-7036, Declaration of Technical Data Conformity; and
    (6) 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical 
Data (paragraph (e) of the clause contains information that must be 
included in a challenge).
    (f) Use the following clauses and provision in SBIR solicitations 
and contracts in accordance with the guidance at 227.7103-6 (c) and (d):
    (1) 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of 
Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends; and
    (2) 252.227-7028, Technical Data or Computer Software Previously 
Delivered to the Government.

<R05>
227.7105  Contracts for the acquisition of existing works.


<R05>
227.7105-1  General.

    (a) Existing works include motion pictures, television recordings, 
video recordings, and other audiovisual works in any medium; sound 
recordings in any medium; musical, dramatic, and literary works; 
pantomimes and choreographic works; pictorial, graphic, and sculptural 
works; and works of a similar nature. Usually, these or similar works 
were not first created, developed, generated, originated, prepared, or 
produced under a Government contract. Therefore, the Government must 
obtain a license in the work if it intends to reproduce the work, 
distribute copies of the work, prepare derivative works, or perform or 
display the work publicly. When the Government is not responsible for 
the content of an existing work, it should require the copyright owner 
to indemnify the Government for liabilities that may arise out of the 
content, performance, use, or disclosure of such data.
    (b) Follow the procedures at 227.7106 for works which will be first 
created, developed, generated, originated, prepared, or produced under a 
Government contract and the Government needs to control distribution of 
the work or has a specific need to obtain indemnity for liabilities that 
may arise out of the creation, content, performance, use, or disclosure 
of the work or from libelous or other unlawful material contained in the 
work. Follow the procedures at 227.7103 when the Government does not 
need to control distribution of such works or obtain such indemnities.


<R05>
227.7105-2  Acquisition of existing works without modification

    (a) Use the clause at 252.227-7021, Rights in Data--Existing Works, 
in lieu of the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data--
Noncommercial Items, in solicitations and contracts exclusively for 
existing works when--
    (1) The existing works will be acquired without modification; and
    (2) The Government requires the right to reproduce, prepare 
derivative works, or publicly perform or display the existing works; or
    (3) The Government has a specific need to obtain indemnity for 
liabilities that may arise out of the content, performance, use, or 
disclosure of such data.
    (b) The clause at 252.227-7021 provides the Government, and others 
acting on its behalf, a paid-up, non-exclusive, irrevocable, world-wide 
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works and publicly perform or 
display the works called for by a contract and to authorize others to do 
so for government purposes.
    (c) A contract clause is not required to acquire existing works such 
as books, magazines and periodicals, in any storage or retrieval medium, 
when the Government will not reproduce the

[[Page 226]]

books, magazines or periodicals, or prepare derivative works.


<R05>
227.7105-3  Acquisition of modified existing works.

    Use the clause at 252.227-7020, Rights in Special Works, in 
solicitations and contracts for modified existing works in lieu of the 
clause at 252.227-7021, Rights in Data--Existing Works.


<R05>
227.7106  Contracts for special works.

    (a) Use the clause at 252.227-7020, Rights in Special Works, in 
solicitations and contracts where the Government has a specific need to 
control the distribution of works first produced, created, or generated 
in the performance of a contract and required to be delivered under that 
contract, including controlling distribution by obtaining an assignment 
of copyright, or a specific need to obtain indemnity for liabilities 
that may arise out of the creation, delivery, use, modification, 
reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of such 
works. Use the clause--
    (1) In lieu of the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical 
Data--Noncommercial Items, when the Government must own or control 
copyright in all works first produced, created, or generated and 
required to be delivered under a contract; or
    (2) In addition to the clause at 252.227-7013 when the Government 
must own or control copyright in a portion of a work first produced, 
created, or generated and required to be delivered under a contract. The 
specific portion in which the Government must own or control copyright 
must be identified in a special contract requirement.
    (b) Although the Government obtains an assignment of copyright and 
unlimited rights in a special work under the clause at 252.227-7020, the 
contractor retains use and disclosure rights in that work. If the 
Government needs to restrict a contractor's rights to use or disclose a 
special work, it must also negotiate a special license which 
specifically restricts the contractor's use or disclosure rights.
    (c) The clause at 252.227-7020 does not permit a contractor to 
incorporate into a special work any works copyrighted by others unless 
the contractor obtains the contracting officer's permission to do so and 
obtains for the Government a non-exclusive, paid up, world-wide license 
to make and distribute copies of that work, to prepare derivative works, 
to perform or display publicly any portion of the work, and to permit 
others to do so for government purposes. Grant permission only when the 
Government's requirements cannot be satisfied unless the third party 
work is included in the deliverable work.
    (d) Examples of works which may be procured under the Rights in 
Special Works clause include, but are not limited, to audiovisual works, 
computer data bases, computer software documentation, scripts, 
soundtracks, musical compositions, and adaptations; histories of 
departments, agencies, services or units thereof; surveys of Government 
establishments; instructional works or guidance to Government officers 
and employees on the discharge of their official duties; reports, books, 
studies, surveys or similar documents; collections of data containing 
information pertaining to individuals that, if disclosed, would violate 
the right of privacy or publicity of the individuals to whom the 
information relates; or investigative reports.

227.7107  Contracts for architect-engineer services.

    This section sets forth policies and procedures, pertaining to data, 
copyrights, and restricted designs unique to the acquisition of 
construction and architect-engineer services.


<R05>
227.7107-1  Architectural designs and data clauses for architect-engineer or construction contracts.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection and in 
227.7107-2, use the clause at 252.227-7022, Government Rights 
(Unlimited), in solicitations and contracts for architect-engineer 
services and for construction involving architect-engineer services.
    (b) When the purpose of a contract for architect-engineer services, 
or for construction involving architect-engineer services, is to obtain 
a unique architectural design of a building, a monument, or construction 
of similar nature, which for artistic, aesthetic or other special 
reasons the Government

[[Page 227]]

does not want duplicated, the Government may acquire exclusive control 
of the data pertaining to the design by including the clause at 252.227-
7023, Drawings and Other Data to Become Property of Government, in 
solicitations and contracts.
    (c) The Government shall obtain unlimited rights in shop drawings 
for construction. In solicitations and contracts calling for delivery of 
shop drawings, include the clause at 252.227-7033, Rights in Shop 
Drawings.


<R05>
227.7107-2  Contracts for construction supplies and research and development work.

    Use the provisions and clauses required by 227-7103-6 and 227.7203-6 
when the acquisition is limited to--
    (a) Construction supplies or materials;
    (b) Experimental, developmental, or research work, or test and 
evaluation studies of structures, equipment, processes, or materials for 
use in construction; or
    (c) Both.


<R05>
227.7107-3  Approval of restricted designs.

    The clause at 252.227-7024, Notice and Approval of Restricted 
Designs, may be included in architect-engineer contracts to permit the 
Government to make informed decisions concerning noncompetitive aspects 
of the design.


<R05>
227.7108  Contractor data repositories.

    (a) Contractor data repositories may be established when permitted 
by agency procedures. The contractual instrument establishing the data 
repository must require, as a minimum, the data repository management 
contractor to--
    (1) Establish and maintain adequate procedures for protecting 
technical data delivered to or stored at the repository from 
unauthorized release or disclosure;
    (2) Establish and maintain adequate procedures for controlling the 
release or disclosure of technical data from the repository to third 
parties consistent with the Government's rights in such data;
    (3) When required by the contracting officer, deliver data to the 
Government on paper or in other specified media;
    (4) Be responsible for maintaining the currency of data delivered 
directly by Government contractors or subcontractors to the repository;
    (5) Obtain use and non-disclosure agreements (see 227.7103-7) from 
all persons to whom government purpose rights data is released or 
disclosed; and
    (6) Indemnify the Government from any liability to data owners or 
licensors resulting from, or as a consequence of, a release or 
disclosure of technical data made by the data repository contractor or 
its officers, employees, agents, or representatives.
    (b) If the contractor is or will be the data repository manager, the 
contractor's data management and distribution responsibilities must be 
identified in the contract or the contract must reference the agreement 
between the Government and the contractor that establishes those 
responsibilities.
    (c) If the contractor is not and will not be the data repository 
manager, do not require a contractor or subcontractor to deliver 
technical data marked with limited rights legends to a data repository 
managed by another contractor unless the contractor or subcontractor who 
has asserted limited rights agrees to release the data to the repository 
or has authorized, in writing, the Government to do so.
    (d) Repository procedures may provide for the acceptance, delivery, 
and subsequent distribution of technical data in storage media other 
than paper, including direct electronic exchange of data between two 
computers. The procedures must provide for the identification of any 
portions of the data provided with restrictive legends, when 
appropriate. The acceptance criteria must be consistent with the 
authorized delivery format.

    (a) The Government shall have only the rights specified in the 
license under which the commercial computer software or commercial 
computer software documentation was obtained.
    (b) If the Government has a need for rights not conveyed under the 
license customarily provided to the public, the Government must 
negotiate with the contractor to determine if there are acceptable terms 
for transferring such rights. The specific rights granted to the 
Government shall be enumerated in the contract license agreement or an 
addendum thereto.


<R05>
227.7202-4  Contract clause.

    A specific contract clause governing the Government's rights in 
commercial computer software or commercial computer software 
documentation is not prescribed. As required by 227.7202-3, the 
Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, 
display, or disclose computer software or computer software 
documentation shall be identified in a license agreement.


<R05>
227.7203  Noncommercial computer software and noncommercial computer software documentation.


<R05>
227.7203-1  Policy.

    (a) DoD policy is to acquire only the computer software and computer 
software documentation, and the rights in such software or 
documentation, necessary to satisfy agency needs.
    (b) Solicitations and contracts shall--

[[Page 229]]

    (1) Specify the computer software or computer software documentation 
to be delivered under a contract and the delivery schedules for the 
software or documentation;
    (2) Establish or reference procedures for determining the 
acceptability of computer software or computer software documentation;
    (3) Establish separate contract line items, to the extent 
practicable, for the computer software or computer software 
documentation to be delivered under a contract and require offerors and 
contractors to price separately each deliverable data item; and
    (4) Require offerors to identify, to the extent practicable, 
computer software or computer software documentation to be furnished 
with restrictions on the Government's rights and require contractors to 
identify computer software or computer software documentation to be 
delivered with such restrictions prior to delivery.
    (c) Offerors shall not be required, either as a condition of being 
responsive to a solicitation or as a condition for award, to sell or 
otherwise relinquish to the Government any rights in computer software 
developed exclusively at private expense except for the software 
identified at 227.7203-5(a) (3) through (6).
    (d) Offerors and contractors shall not be prohibited or discouraged 
from furnishing or offering to furnish computer software developed 
exclusively at private expense solely because the Government's rights to 
use, modify, release, reproduce, perform, display, or disclose the 
software may be restricted.


<R05>
227.7203-2  Acquisition of noncommercial computer software and computer software documentation.

    (a) Contracting officers shall work closely with data managers and 
requirements personnel to assure that computer software and computer 
software documentation requirements included in solicitations are 
consistent with the policy expressed in 227.7203-1.
    (b)(1) Data managers or other requirements personnel are responsible 
for identifying the Government's minimum needs. In addition to desired 
software performance, compatibility, or other technical considerations, 
needs determinations should consider such factors as multiple site or 
shared use requirements, whether the Government's software maintenance 
philosophy will require the right to modify or have third parties modify 
the software, and any special computer software documentation 
requirements.
    (2) When reviewing offers received in response to a solicitation or 
other request for computer software or computer software documentation, 
data managers must balance the original assessment of the Government's 
needs with prices offered.
    (c) Contracting officers are responsible for ensuring that, wherever 
practicable, solicitations and contracts--
    (1) Identify the types of computer software and the quantity of 
computer programs and computer software documentation to be delivered, 
any requirements for multiple users at one site or multiple site 
licenses, and the format and media in which the software or 
documentation will be delivered;
    (2) Establish each type of computer software or computer software 
documentation to be delivered as a separate contract line item (this 
requirement may be satisfied by an exhibit to the contract);
    (3) Identify the prices established for each separately priced 
deliverable item of computer software or computer software documentation 
under a fixed-price type contract;
    (4) Include delivery schedules and acceptance criteria for each 
deliverable item; and
    (5) Specifically identify the place of delivery for each deliverable 
item.


<R05>
227.7203-3  Early identification of computer software or computer software documentation to be furnished to the Government with restrictions on use, 
          reproduction or disclosure.

    (a) Use the provision at 252.227-7017, Identification and Assertion 
of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions, in all solicitation that 
include the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer 
Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation. The 
provision requires offerors to identify any computer software or 
computer software documentation for

[[Page 230]]

which restrictions, other than copyright, on use, modification, 
reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure are asserted 
and to attach the identification and assertion to the offer.
    (b) Subsequent to contract award, the clause at 252.227-7014 permits 
a contractor, under certain conditions, to make additional assertions of 
restrictions. The prescriptions for the use of that clause and its 
alternates are at 227.7203-6(a).


<R05>
227.7203-4  License rights.

    (a) Grant of license. The Government obtains rights in computer 
software or computer software documentation, including a copyright 
license, under an irrevocable license granted or obtained by the 
contractor which developed the software or documentation or the licensor 
of the software or documentation if the development contractor is not 
the licensor. The contractor or licensor retains all rights in the 
software or documentation not granted to the Government. The scope of a 
computer software license is generally determined by the source of funds 
used to develop the software. Contractors or licensors may, with some 
exceptions, restrict the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, 
release, perform, display, or disclose computer software developed 
exclusively or partially at private expense (see 227.7203-5 (b) and 
(c)). They may not, without the Government's agreement (see 227.7203-
5(d)), restrict the Government's rights in computer software developed 
exclusively with Government funds or in computer software documentation 
required to be delivered under a contract.
    (b) Source of funds determination. The determination of the source 
of funds used to develop computer software should be made at the lowest 
practicable segregable portion of the software or documentation (e.g., a 
software sub-routine that performs a specific function). Contractors may 
assert restricted rights in a segregable portion of computer software 
which otherwise qualifies for restricted rights under the clause at 
252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and 
Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation.


<R05>
227.7203-5  Government rights.

    The standard license rights in computer software that a licensor 
grants to the Government are unlimited rights, government purpose 
rights, or restricted rights. The standard license in computer software 
documentation conveys unlimited rights. Those rights are defined in the 
clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and 
Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation. In unusual situations, 
the standard rights may not satisfy the Government's needs or the 
Government may be willing to accept lesser rights in return for other 
consideration. In those cases, a special license may be negotiated. 
However, the licensor is not obligated to provide the Government greater 
rights and the contracting officer is not required to accept lesser 
rights than the rights provided in the standard grant of license. The 
situations under which a particular grant of license applies are 
enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection.
    (a) Unlimited rights. The Government obtains an unlimited rights 
license in--
    (1) Computer software developed exclusively with Government funds;
    (2) Computer software documentation required to be delivered under a 
Government contract;
    (3) Corrections or changes to computer software or computer software 
documentation furnished to the contractor by the Government;
    (4) Computer software or computer software documentation that is 
otherwise publicly available or has been released or disclosed by the 
contractor or subcontractor without restrictions on further use, release 
or disclosure other than a release or disclosure resulting from the 
sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the software to 
another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business 
entity or it assets to another party;
    (5) Computer software or computer software documentation obtained 
with unlimited rights under another Government contract or as a result 
of negotiations; or
    (6) Computer software or computer software documentation furnished 
to

[[Page 231]]

the Government, under a Government contract or subcontract with--
    (i) Restricted rights in computer software, limited rights in 
technical data, or government purpose license rights and the restrictive 
conditions have expired; or
    (ii) Government purpose rights and the contractor's exclusive right 
to use such software or documentation for commercial purposes has 
expired.
    (b) Government purpose rights. (1) Except as provided in paragraph 
(a) of this subsection, the Government obtains government purpose rights 
in computer software developed with mixed funding.
    (2) The period during which government purpose rights are effective 
is negotiable. The clause at 252.227-7014 provides a nominal five-year 
period. Either party may request a different period. Changes to the 
government purpose rights period may be made at any time prior to 
delivery of the software without consideration from either party. Longer 
periods should be negotiated when a five-year period does not provide 
sufficient time to commercialize the software or, for software developed 
by subcontractors, when necessary to recognize the subcontractors' 
interests in the software.
    (3) The government purpose rights period commences upon execution of 
the contract, subcontract, letter contract (or similar contractual 
instrument), contract modification, or option exercise that required 
development of the computer software. Upon expiration of the government 
purpose rights period, the Government has unlimited rights in the 
software including the right to authorize others to use data for 
commercial purposes.
    (4) During the government purpose rights period, the Government may 
not use, or authorize other persons to use, computer software marked 
with government purpose rights legends for commercial purposes. The 
Government shall not release or disclose, or authorize others to release 
or disclose, computer software in which it has government purpose rights 
to any person unless--
    (i) Prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is 
subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7; or
    (ii) The intended recipient is a Government contractor receiving 
access to the software for performance of a Government contract that 
contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or 
Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive 
Legends.
    (5) When computer software marked with government purpose rights 
legends will be released or disclosed to a Government contractor 
performing a contract that does not include the clause at 252.227-7025, 
the contract may be modified, prior to release or disclosure, to include 
such clause in lieu of requiring the contractor to complete a use and 
non-disclosure agreement.
    (6) Contracting activities shall establish procedures to assure that 
computer software or computer software documentation marked with 
government purpose rights legends are released or disclosed, including a 
release or disclosure through a Government solicitation, only to persons 
subject to the use and non-disclosure restrictions. Public announcements 
in the Commerce Business Daily or other publications must provide notice 
of the use and non-disclosure requirements. Class use and non-disclosure 
agreements (e.g., agreements covering all solicitations received by the 
XYZ company within a reasonable period) are authorized and may be 
obtained at any time prior to release or disclosure of the government 
purpose rights software or documentation. Documents transmitting 
government purpose rights software or documentation to persons under 
class agreements shall identify the specific software or documentation 
subject to government purpose rights and the class agreement under which 
such software or documentation are provided.
    (c) Restricted rights. (1) The Government obtains restricted rights 
in noncommercial computer software required to be delivered or otherwise 
provided to the Government under a contract that were developed 
exclusively at private expense.
    (2) Contractors are not required to provide the Government 
additional rights in computer software delivered

[[Page 232]]

or otherwise provided to the Government with restricted rights. When the 
Government has a need for additional rights, the Government must 
negotiate with the contractor to determine if there are acceptable terms 
for transferring such rights. List or describe all software in which the 
contractor has granted the Government additional rights in a license 
agreement made part of the contract (see paragraph (d) of this 
subsection). The license shall enumerate the specific additional rights 
granted to the Government.
    (d) Specifically negotiated license rights. Negotiate specific 
licenses when the parties agree to modify the standard license rights 
granted to the Government or when the Government wants to obtain rights 
in computer software in which it does not have rights. When negotiating 
to obtain, relinquish, or increase the Government's rights in computer 
software, consider the planned software maintenance philosophy, 
anticipated time or user sharing requirements, and other factors which 
may have relevance for a particular procurement. If negotiating to 
relinquish rights in computer software documentation, consider the 
administrative burden associated with protecting documentation subject 
to restrictions from unauthorized release or disclosure. The negotiated 
license rights must stipulate the rights granted the Government to use, 
modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose the software 
or documentation and the extent to which the Government may authorize 
others to do so. Identify all negotiated rights in a license agreement 
made part of the contract.
    (e) Rights in derivative computer software or computer software 
documentation. The clause at 252.227-7014 protects the Government's 
rights in computer software, computer software documentation, or 
portions thereof that the contractor subsequently uses to prepare 
derivative software or subsequently embeds or includes in other software 
or documentation. The Government retains the rights it obtained under 
the development contract in the unmodified portions of the derivative 
software or documentation.


<R05>
227.7203-6  Contract clauses.

    (a)(1) use the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial 
Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation, in 
solicitations and contracts when the successful offeror(s) will be 
required to deliver computer software or computer software 
documentation. Do not use the clause when the only deliverable items are 
technical data (other than computer software documentation), commercial 
computer software or commercial computer software documentation, 
commercial items (see 227.7102-3), special works (see 227.7205), or 
contracts under the Small Business Innovative Research Program (see 
227.7104), Except as provided in 227.7107-2, do not use the clause in 
architect-engineer and construction contracts..
    (2) Use the clause at 252.227-7014 with its Alternate I in research 
contracts when the contracting officer determines, in consultation with 
counsel, that public dissemination by the contractor would be--
    (i) In the interest of the Government; and
    (ii) Facilitated by the Government relinquishing its right to 
publish the work for sale, or to have others publish the work for sale 
on behalf of the Government.
    (b) Use the clause at 252.227-7016, Rights in Bid or Proposal 
Information, in solicitations and contracts that include the clause at 
252.227-7014.
    (c) Use the clause at 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted 
Restrictions--Computer Software, in solicitations and contracts that 
include the clause at 252.227-7014. The clause provides procedures for 
the validation of asserted restrictions on the Government's rights to 
use, release, or disclose computer software.
    (d) Use the provision at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or 
Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive 
Legends, in solicitations and contracts when it is anticipated that the 
Government will provide the contractor, for performance of its contract, 
computer software or computer software documentation marked with another 
contractor's restrictive legend(s).

[[Page 233]]

    (e) Use the provision at 252.227-7028, Technical Data or Computer 
Software Previously Delivered to the Government, in solicitations when 
the resulting contract will require the contractor to deliver computer 
software or computer software documentation. The provision requires 
offerors to identify any software or documentation specified in the 
solicitation as deliverable items that are the same or substantially the 
same as software or documentation which the offeror has delivered or is 
obligated to deliver, either as a contractor or subcontractor, under any 
other federal agency contract.
    (f) Use the clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive 
Markings on Technical Data, in solicitations and contracts that include 
the clause at 252.227-7014 when the contractor will be required to 
deliver noncommercial computer software documentation (technical data). 
The clause implements statutory requirements under 10 U.S.C. 2321. 
Paragraph (e) of the clause contains information that must be included 
in a formal challenge.


<R05>
227.7203-7  [Reserved]


<R05>
227.7203-8  Deferred delivery and deferred ordering of computer software and computer software documentation.

    (a) Deferred delivery. Use the clause at 252.227-7026, Deferred 
Delivery of Technical Data or Computer Software, when it is in the 
Government's interests to defer the delivery of computer software or 
computer software documentation. The clause permits the contracting 
officer to require the delivery of data identified as ``deferred 
delivery'' data or computer software at any time until two years after 
acceptance by the Government of all items (other than technical data or 
computer software) under the contract or contract termination, whichever 
is later. The obligation of subcontractors or suppliers to deliver such 
data expires two years after the date the prime contractor accepts the 
last item from the subcontractor or supplier for use in the performance 
of the contract. The contract must specify the computer software or 
computer software documentation that is subject to deferred delivery. 
The contracting officer shall notify the contractor sufficiently in 
advance of the desired delivery date for such software or documentation 
to permit timely delivery.
    (b) Deferred ordering. Use the clause at 252.227-7027, Deferred 
Ordering of Technical Data or Computer Software, when a firm requirement 
for software or documentation has not been established prior to contract 
award but there is a potential need for computer software or computer 
software documentation. Under this clause the contracting officer may 
order any computer software or computer software documentation generated 
in the performance of the contract or any subcontract thereunder at any 
time until three years after acceptance of all items (other than 
technical data or computer software) under the contract or contract 
termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors to 
deliver such technical data or computer software expires three years 
after the date the contractor accepts the last item under the 
subcontract. When the software or documentation are ordered, the 
delivery dates shall be negotiated and the contractor compensated only 
for converting the software or documentation into the prescribed form, 
reproduction costs, and delivery costs.


<R05>
227.7203-9  Copyright.

    (a) Copyright license. (1) The clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in 
Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software 
Documentation, requires a contractor to grant, or obtain for the 
Government license rights which permit the Government to reproduce the 
software or documentation, distribute copies, perform or display the 
software or documentation and, through the right to modify data, prepare 
derivative works. The extent to which the Government, and others acting 
on its behalf, may exercise these rights varies for each of the standard 
data rights licenses obtained under the clause. When non-standard 
license rights in computer software or computer software documentation 
will be negotiated, negotiate the extent of the copyright license 
concurrent with negotiations for the data rights license. Do not 
negotiate copyright licenses for computer software that provide less

[[Page 234]]

rights than the standard restricted rights in computer software license. 
For computer software documentation, do not negotiate a copyright 
license that provides less rights than the standard limited rights in 
technical data license.
    (2) The clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data--
Noncommercial Items, does not permit a contractor to incorporate a third 
party's copyrighted software into a deliverable software item unless the 
contractor has obtained an appropriate license for the Government and, 
when applicable, others acting on the Government's behalf, or has 
obtained the contracting officer's written approval to do so. Grant 
approval to use third party copyrighted software in which the Government 
will not receive a copyright license only when the Government's 
requirements cannot be satisfied without the third party material or 
when the use of the third party material will result in cost savings to 
the Government which outweigh the lack of a copyright license.
    (b) Copyright considerations--special works. See 227.7205 for 
copyright considerations when acquiring special works.


<R05>
227.7203-10  Contractor identification and marking of computer software or computer software documentation to be furnished with restrictive markings.

    (a) Identification requirements. (1) The solicitation provision at 
252.227-7017, Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or 
Disclosure Restrictions, requires offerors to identify, prior to 
contract award, any computer software or computer software documentation 
that an offeror asserts should be provided to the Government with 
restrictions on use, modification, reproduction, release or disclosure. 
This requirement does not apply to restrictions based solely on 
copyright. The notification and identification must be submitted as an 
attachment to the offer. If an offeror fails to submit the attachment or 
fails to complete the attachment in accordance with the requirements of 
the solicitation provision, such failure shall constitute a minor 
informality. Provide offerors an opportunity to remedy a minor 
informality in accordance with the procedures at FAR 14.405 or 15.607. 
An offeror's failure to correct an informality within the time 
prescribed by the contracting officer shall render the offer ineligible 
for award.
    (2) The procedures for correcting minor informalities shall not be 
used to obtain information regarding asserted restrictions or an 
offeror's suggested asserted rights category. Questions regarding the 
justification for an asserted restriction or asserted rights category 
must be pursued in accordance with the procedures at 227.7203-13.
    (3) The restrictions asserted by a successful offeror shall be 
attached to its contract unless, in accordance with the procedures at 
227.7203-13, the parties have agreed that an asserted restriction is not 
justified. The contract attachment shall provide the same information 
regarding identification of the computer software or computer software 
documentation, the asserted rights category, the basis for the 
assertion, and the name of the person asserting the restrictions as 
required by paragraph (d) of the solicitation provision at 252.227-7017. 
Subsequent to contract award, the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in 
Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software 
Documentation, permits a contractor to make additional assertions under 
certain conditions. The additional assertions must be made in accordance 
with the procedures and in the format prescribed by that clause.
    (4) Neither the pre- or post-award assertions made by the contractor 
nor the fact that certain assertions are identified in the attachment to 
the contract, determine the respective rights of the parties. As 
provided at 227.7203-13, the Government has the right to review, verify, 
challenge and validate restrictive markings.
    (5) Information provided by offerors in response to the solicitation 
provision at 252.227-7017 may be used in the source selection process to 
evaluate the impact on evaluation factors that may be created by 
restrictions on the Government's ability to use or disclose computer 
software or computer software documentation.
    (b) Contractor marking requirements. The clause at 252.227-7014, 
Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software

[[Page 235]]

and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation--
    (1) Requires a contractor who desires to restrict the Government's 
rights in computer software or computer software documentation to place 
restrictive markings on the software or documentation, provides 
instructions for the placement of the restrictive markings, and 
authorizes the use of certain restrictive markings. When it is 
anticipated that the software will or may be used in combat or 
situations which simulate combat conditions, do not permit contractors 
to insert instructions into computer programs that interfere with or 
delay operation of the software to display a restrictive rights legend 
or other license notice; and
    (2) Requires a contractor to deliver, furnish, or otherwise provide 
to the Government any computer software or computer software 
documentation in which the Government has previously obtained rights 
with the Government's pre-existing rights in that software or 
documentation unless the parties have agreed otherwise or restrictions 
on the Government's rights to use, modify, produce, release, or disclose 
the software or documentation have expired. When restrictions are still 
applicable, the contractor is permitted to mark the software or 
documentation with the appropriate restrictive legend.
    (c) Unmarked computer software or computer software documentation. 
(1) Computer software or computer software documentation delivered or 
otherwise provided under a contract without restrictive markings shall 
be presumed to have been delivered with unlimited rights and may be 
released or disclosed without restriction. To the extent practicable, if 
a contractor has requested permission (see paragraph (c)(2) of this 
subsection) to correct an inadvertent omission of markings, do not 
release or disclose the software or documentation pending evaluation of 
the request.
    (2) A contractor may request permission to have appropriate legends 
placed on unmarked computer software or computer software documentation 
at its expense. The request must be received by the contracting officer 
within six months following the furnishing or delivery of such software 
or documentation, or any extension of that time approved by the 
contracting officer. The person making the request must--
    (i) Identify the software or documentation that should have been 
marked;
    (ii) Demonstrate that the omission of the marking was inadvertent, 
the proposed marking is justified and conforms with the requirements for 
the marking of computer software or computer software documentation 
contained in the clause at 252.227-7014; and
    (iii) Acknowledge, in writing, that the Government has no liability 
with respect to any disclosure, reproduction, or use of the software or 
documentation made prior to the addition of the marking or resulting 
from the omission of the marking.
    (3) Contracting officers should grant permission to mark only if the 
software or documentation were not distributed outside the Government or 
were distributed outside the Government with restrictions on further use 
or disclosure.

227.7203-11  Contractor procedures and records.

    (a) The clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer 
Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation, requires a 
contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver 
computer software or computer software documentation with other than 
unlimited rights, to establish and follow written procedures to assure 
that restrictive markings are used only when authorized and to maintain 
records to justify the validity of restrictive markings.
    (b) The clause at 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted 
Restrictions--Computer Software, requires contractors and their 
subcontractors or suppliers at any tier to maintain records sufficient 
to justify the validity of markings that assert restrictions on the use, 
modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure 
of computer software.


<R05>
227.7203-12  Government right to establish conformity of markings.

    (a) Nonconforming markings. (1) Authorized markings are identified 
in the

[[Page 236]]

clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and 
Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation. All other markings are 
nonconforming markings. An authorized marking that is not in the form, 
or differs in substance, from the marking requirements in the clause at 
252.227-7014 is also a nonconforming marking.
    (2) The correction of nonconforming markings on computer software is 
not subject to 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions--
Computer Software, and the correction of nonconforming markings on 
computer software documentation (technical data) is not subject to 
252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data. To 
the extent practicable, the contracting officer should return computer 
software or computer software documentation bearing nonconforming 
markings to the person who has placed the nonconforming markings on the 
software or documentation to provide that person an opportunity to 
correct or strike the nonconforming markings at that person's expense. 
If that person fails to correct the nonconformity and return the 
corrected software or documentation within 60 days following the 
person's receipt of the software or documentation, the contracting 
officer may correct or strike the nonconformity at the person's expense. 
When it is impracticable to return computer software or computer 
software documentation for correction, contracting officers may 
unilaterally correct any nonconforming markings at Government expense. 
Prior to correction, the software or documentation may be used in 
accordance with the proper restrictive marking.
    (b) Unjustified markings. (1) An unjustified marking is an 
authorized marking that does not depict accurately restrictions 
applicable to the Government's use, modification, reproduction, release, 
or disclosure of the marked computer software or computer software 
documentation. For example, a restricted rights legend placed on 
computer software developed under a Government contract either 
exclusively at Government expense or with mixed funding (situations 
under which the Government obtains unlimited or government purpose 
rights) is an unjustified marking.
    (2) Contracting officers have the right to review and challenge the 
validity of unjustified markings. However, at any time during 
performance of a contract and notwithstanding existence of a challenge, 
the contracting officer and the person who has asserted a restrictive 
marking may agree that the restrictive marking is not justified. Upon 
such agreement, the contracting officer may, at his or her election, 
either----
    (i) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at that person's 
expense; or
    (ii) Return the computer software or computer software documentation 
to the person asserting the restriction for correction at that person's 
expense. If the software or documentation are returned and that person 
fails to correct or strike the unjustified restriction and return the 
corrected software or documentation to the contracting officer within 60 
days following receipt of the software or documentation, the unjustified 
marking shall be corrected or stricken at that person's expense.


<R05>
227.7203-13  Government right to review, verify, challenge and validate asserted restrictions.

    (a) General. An offeror's or contractor's assertion(s) of 
restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, 
release, or disclose computer software or computer software 
documentation do not, by themselves, determine the extent of the 
Government's rights in such software or documentation. The Government 
may require an offeror or contractor to submit sufficient information to 
permit an evaluation of a particular asserted restriction and may 
challenge asserted restrictions when there are reasonable grounds to 
believe that an assertion is not valid.
    (b) Requests for information. Contracting officers should have a 
reason to suspect that an asserted restriction might not be correct 
prior to requesting information. When requesting information, provide 
the offeror or contractor the reason(s) for suspecting that an asserted 
restriction might not

[[Page 237]]

be correct. A need for additional license rights is not, by itself, a 
sufficient basis for requesting information concerning an asserted 
restriction. Follow the procedures at 227.7203-5(d) when additional 
license rights are needed but there is no basis to suspect that an 
asserted restriction might not be valid.
    (c) Transacting matters directly with subcontractors. The clause at 
252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions--Computer Software, 
obtains the contractor's agreement that the Government may transact 
matters under the clause directly with a subcontractor or supplier, at 
any tier, without creating or implying privity of contract. Contracting 
officers should permit a subcontractor or supplier to transact challenge 
and validation matters directly with the Government when--
    (1) A subcontractor's or supplier's business interests in its 
technical data would be compromised if the data were disclosed to a 
higher tier contractor.
    (2) There is reason to believe that the contractor will not respond 
in a timely manner to a challenge and an untimely response would 
jeopardize a subcontractor's or supplier's right to assert restrictions; 
or
    (3) Requested to do so by a subcontractor or supplier.
    (d) Challenging asserted restrictions--(1) Pre-award considerations. 
The challenge procedures in the clause at 252.227-7019 could 
significantly delay competitive procurements. Therefore, avoid 
challenging asserted restrictions prior to a competitive contract award 
unless resolution of the assertion is essential for successful 
completion of the procurement.
    (2) Computer software documentation. Computer software documentation 
is technical data. Challenges to asserted restrictions on the 
Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, 
display, or disclose computer software documentation must be made in 
accordance with the clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive 
Markings on Technical Data, and the guidance at 227.7103-13. The 
procedures in the clause at 252.227-7037 implement requirements 
contained in 10 U.S.C. 2321. Resolution of questions regarding the 
validity of asserted restrictions using the process described at 
227.7103-12(b)(2) is strongly encouraged.
    (3) Computer software. (i) Asserted restrictions should be reviewed 
before acceptance of the computer software deliverable under a contract. 
The Government's right to challenge an assertion expires three years 
after final payment under the contract or three years after delivery of 
the software, whichever is later. Those limitations on the Government's 
challenge rights do not apply to software that is publicly available, 
has been furnished to the Government without restrictions, or has been 
otherwise made available without restrictions.
    (ii) Contracting officers must have reasonable grounds to challenge 
the current validity of an asserted restriction. Before challenging an 
asserted restriction, carefully consider all available information 
pertaining to the asserted restrictions. Resolution of questions 
regarding the validity of asserted restrictions using the process 
described at 227.7203-12(b)(2) is strongly encouraged. After 
consideration of the situations described in paragraph (c) of this 
subsection, contracting officers may request the person asserting a 
restriction to furnish a written explanation of the facts and supporting 
documentation for the assertion in sufficient detail to enable the 
contracting officer to determine the validity of the assertion. 
Additional supporting documentation may be requested when the 
explanation provided by that person does not, in the contracting 
officer's opinion, establish the validity of the assertion.
    (iii) Assertions may be challenged whether or not supporting 
documentation was requested. Challenges must be in writing and issued to 
the person asserting the restriction.
    (4) Extension of response time. The contracting officer, at his or 
her discretion, may extend the time for response contained in a 
challenge, as appropriate, if the contractor submits a timely written 
request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.
    (e) Validating or denying asserted restrictions. (1) Contracting 
officers must promptly issue a final decision denying

[[Page 238]]

or sustaining the validity of each challenged assertion unless the 
parties have agreed on the disposition of the assertion. When a final 
decision denying the validity of an asserted restriction is made 
following a timely response to a challenge, the Government is obligated 
to continue to respect the asserted restrictions through final 
disposition of any appeal unless the agency head notifies the person 
asserting the restriction that urgent or compelling circumstances do not 
permit the Government to continue to respect the asserted restriction. 
See 252.227-7019(g) for restrictions applicable following a 
determination of urgent and compelling circumstances.
    (2) Only a contracting officer's final decision, or actions of an 
agency Board of Contract Appeals or a court of competent jurisdiction, 
that sustain the validity of an asserted restriction constitute 
validation of the restriction.
    (f) Multiple challenges to an asserted restriction. When more than 
one contracting officer challenges an asserted restriction, the 
contracting officer who made the earliest challenge is responsible for 
coordinating the Government challenges. That contracting officer shall 
consult with all other contracting officers making challenges, verify 
that all challenges apply to the same asserted restriction and, after 
consulting with the contractor, subcontractor, or supplier asserting the 
restriction, issue a schedule that provides that person a reasonable 
opportunity to respond to each challenge.


<R05>
227.7203-14  Conformity, acceptance, and warranty of computer software and computer software documentation.

    (a) Computer software documentation. Computer software documentation 
is technical data. See 227.7103-14 for appropriate guidance and 
statutory requirements.
    (b) Computer software. (1) Conformity and acceptance. Solicitations 
and contracts requiring the delivery of computer software shall specify 
the requirements the software must satisfy to be acceptable. Contracting 
officers, or their authorized representatives, are responsible for 
determining whether computer software tendered for acceptance conforms 
to the contractual requirements. Except for nonconforming restrictive 
markings (follow the procedures at 227.7203-12(a) if nonconforming 
markings are the sole reason computer software tendered for acceptance 
fails to conform to contractual requirements), do not accept software 
that does not conform in all respects to applicable contractual 
requirements. Correction or replacement of nonconforming software, or an 
equitable reduction in contract price when correction or replacement of 
the nonconforming data is not practicable or is not in the Government's 
interests, shall be accomplished in accordance with--
    (i) The provisions of a contract clause providing for inspection and 
acceptance of deliverables and remedies for nonconforming deliverables; 
or
    (ii) The procedures at FAR 46.407(c) through (g), if the contract 
does not contain an inspection clause providing remedies for 
nonconforming deliverables.
    (2) Warranties--(i) Weapon systems. Computer software that is a 
component of a weapon system or major subsystem should be warranted as 
part of the weapon system warranty. Follow the procedures at 246.770.
    (ii) Non-weapon systems. Approval of the chief of the contracting 
office must be obtained to use a computer software warranty other than a 
weapon system warranty. Consider the factors at FAR 46.703 in deciding 
whether to obtain a computer software warranty. When approval for a 
warranty has been obtained, the clause at 252.246-7001, Warranty of 
Data, and its alternates, may be appropriately modified for use with 
computer software or a procurement specific clause may be developed.


<R05>
227.7203-15  Subcontractor rights in computer software or computer software documentation.

    (a) Subcontractors and suppliers at all tiers should be provided the 
same protection for their rights in computer software or computer 
software documentation as are provided to prime contractors.
    (b) The clauses at 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted 
Restrictions--Computer Software, and 252.227-7037, Validation of 
Restrictive Markings on

[[Page 239]]

Technical Data, obtain a contractor's agreement that the Government's 
transaction of validation or challenge matters directly with 
subcontractors at any tier does not establish or imply privity of 
contract. When a subcontractor or supplier exercises its right to 
transact validation matters directly with the Government, contracting 
officers shall deal directly with such persons, as provided at 227.7203-
13(c) for computer software and 227.7103-13(c)(3) for computer software 
documentation (technical data).
    (c) Require prime contractors whose contracts include the following 
clauses to include those clauses, without modification except for 
appropriate identification of the parties, in contracts with 
subcontractors or suppliers who will be furnishing computer software in 
response to a Government requirement (see 227.7103-15(c) for clauses 
required when subcontractors or suppliers will be furnishing computer 
software documentation (technical data)):
    (1) 252.227.7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and 
Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation;
    (2) 252.227.7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions--Computer 
Software;
    (3) 252.227.7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government 
Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends; and
    (4) 252.227.7028, Technical Data or Computer Software Previously 
Delivered to the Government.
    (d) Do not require contractors to have their subcontractors or 
suppliers at any tier relinquish rights in technical data to the 
contractor, a higher tier subcontractor, or to the Government, as a 
condition for award of any contract, subcontract, purchase order, or 
similar instrument except for the rights obtained by the Government 
under the provisions of the Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software 
and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation clause contained in 
the contractor's contract with the Government.


<R05>
227.7203-16  Providing computer software or computer software documentation to foreign governments, foreign contractors, or international organizations.

    Computer software or computer software documentation may be released 
or disclosed to foreign governments, foreign contractors, or 
international organizations only if release or disclosure is otherwise 
permitted both by Federal export controls and other national security 
laws or regulations. Subject to such laws and regulations, the 
Department of Defense--
    (a) May release or disclose computer software or computer software 
documentation in which it has obtained unlimited rights to such foreign 
entities or authorize the use of such data by those entities; and
    (b) Shall not release or disclose computer software or computer 
software documentation for which restrictions on use, release, or 
disclosure have been asserted to such foreign entities or authorize the 
use of such data by those entities, unless the intended recipient is 
subject to the same provisions as included in the use and non-disclosure 
agreement at 227.7103-7 and the requirements of the clause at 252.227-
7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial 
Computer Software Documentation, governing use, modification, 
reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of such data 
have been satisfied.


<R05>
227.7203-17  Overseas contracts with foreign sources.

    (a) The clause at 252.227-7032, Rights in Technical Data and 
Computer Software (Foreign), may be used in contracts with foreign 
contractors to be performed overseas, except Canadian purchases (see 
paragraph (c) of this subsection) in lieu of the clause at 252.227-7014, 
Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer 
Software Documentation, when the Government requires the unrestricted 
right to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or

[[Page 240]]

disclose all computer software or computer software documentation to be 
delivered under the contract. Do not use the clause in contracts for 
special works.
    (b) When the Government does not require unlimited rights, the 
clause at 252.227-7032 may be modified to accommodate the needs of a 
specific overseas procurement situation. The Government should obtain 
rights to the computer software or computer software documentation that 
are not less than the rights the Government would have obtained under 
the software rights clause(s) prescribed in this part for a comparable 
procurement performed within the United States or its possessions.
    (c) Contracts for Canadian purchases shall include the appropriate 
software rights clause prescribed in this part for a comparable 
procurement performed within the United States or its possessions.


<R05>
227.7204  Contracts under the Small Business Innovative Research Program.

    When contracting under the Small Business Innovative Research 
Program, follow the procedures at 227-7104.


<R05>
227.7205  Contracts for special works.

    (a) Use the clause at 252.227-7020, Rights in Special Works, in 
solicitations and contracts where the Government has a specific need to 
control the distribution of computer software or computer software 
documentation first produced, created, or generated in the performance 
of a contract and required to be delivered under that contract, 
including controlling distribution by obtaining an assignment of 
copyright, or a specific need to obtain indemnity for liabilities that 
may arise out of the creation, delivery, use, modification, 
reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of such 
software or documentation. Use the clause--

    (1) In lieu of the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial 
Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation, 
when the Government must own or control copyright in all computer 
software or computer software documentation first produced, created, or 
generated and required to be delivered under a contract; or

    (2) In addition to the clause at 252.227-7014 when the Government 
must own or control copyright in some of the computer software or 
computer software documentation first produced, created, or generated 
and required to be delivered under a contract. The specific software or 
documentation in which the Government must own or control copyright must 
be identified in a special contract requirement.

    (b) Although the Government obtains an assignment of copyright and 
unlimited rights in the computer software or computer software 
documentation delivered as a special work under the clause at 252.227-
7020, the contractor retains use and disclosure rights in that software 
or documentation. If the Government needs to restrict a contractor's 
rights to use or disclose a special work, it must also negotiate a 
special license which specifically restricts the contractor's use or 
disclosure rights.

    (c) The clause at 252.227-7020 does not permit a contractor to 
incorporate into a special work any work copyrighted by others unless 
the contractor obtains the contracting officer's permission to do so and 
obtains for the Government a non-exclusive, paid up, world-wide license 
to make and distribute copies of that work, to prepare derivative works, 
to perform or display any portion of that work, and to permit others to 
do so for government purposes. Grant permission only when the 
Government's requirements cannot be satisfied unless the third party 
work is included in the deliverable work.
    (d) Examples of other works which may be procured under the clause 
at 252.227-7020 include, but are not limited to, audiovisual works, 
scripts, soundtracks, musical compositions, and adaptations; histories 
of departments, agencies, services or units thereof; surveys of 
Government establishments; instructional works or guidance to Government 
officers and employees on the discharge of their official duties; 
reports, books, studies, surveys or similar documents; collections of 
data containing information pertaining to individuals that, if 
disclosed, would violate the right of privacy or publicity of the

[[Page 241]]

individuals to whom the information relates; or investigative reports.

227.7206  Contracts for architect-engineer services.

    Follow 227.7107 when contracting for architect-engineer services.


<R05>
227.7207  Contractor data repositories.

    Follow 227.7108 when it is in the Government's interests to have a 
data repository include computer software or to have a separate computer 
software repository. Contractual instruments establishing the repository 
requirements must appropriately reflect the repository manager's 
software responsibilities.

228.102  Performance and payment bonds for construction contracts.


<R05>
228.102-1  General.

    For Defense Environmental Restoration Program construction contracts 
entered into pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2701 and executed between December 5, 
1991, and December 31, 1999--
    (1) Any rights of action under the performance bond shall only 
accrue to, and be for the exclusive use of, the obligee named in the 
bond.
    (2) In the event of default, the surety's liability on the 
performance bond is limited to the cost of completion of the contract 
work, less the balance of unexpended funds. Under no circumstances shall 
the liability exceed the penal sum of the bond.
    (3) The surety shall not be liable for indemnification or 
compensation of the obligee for loss or liability arising from personal 
injury or property damage, even if the injury or damage was caused by a 
breach of the bonded contract.
    (4) Once it has taken action to meet its obligations under the bond, 
the surety is entitled to any indemnification and identical standard of 
liability to which the contractor was entitled under the contract or 
applicable laws and regulations.
    (a) The requirement for performance and payment bonds is waived for 
cost-reimbursement contracts. However, for cost type contracts with 
fixed-price construction subcontracts over $25,000, require the prime 
contractor to obtain from each of its construction subcontractors--
    (i) A payment bond in favor of the prime contractor sufficient to 
pay labor and material costs; and
    (ii) A performance bond in an equal amount if available at no 
additional cost.
[56 FR 36404, July 31, 1991, as amended at 57 FR 42631, Sept. 15, 1992;

<R05>
228.105  Other types of bonds.

    Fidelity and forgery bonds generally are not required but may be 
used when--
    (1) Necessary for the protection of the Government or the 
contractor; or
    (2) The investigative and claims services of a surety company are 
desired.

228.304  Risk-pooling arrangements.

    The DoD has established the National Defense Projects Rating Plan, 
also known as the Special Casualty Insurance Rating Plan, as a risk-
pooling arrangement to minimize the cost to the Government of purchasing 
the liability insurance listed in FAR 28.307-2. Use the plan in 
accordance with the following guidelines when it provides the necessary 
coverage more advantageously than commercially available coverage.
    (1) The plan--
    (i) Is implemented by attaching an endorsement to standard insurance 
policy forms for workers' compensation, employer's liability, 
comprehensive general, and automobile liability. The endorsement states 
that the instant policy is subject to the National Defense Projects 
Rating Plan.
    (ii) Applies to eligible Defense projects of one or more 
departments/agencies. For purposes of this section, a Defense project is 
any eligible contract or group of contracts with the same contractor.
    (A) A Defense project is eligible when--
    (1) Eligible contracts represent, at the inception of the plan, at 
least 90 percent of the payroll for the total operations at project 
locations; and
    (2) The annual insurance premium is estimated to be at least 
$10,000.
    (B) A contract is eligible when it is--
    (1) Either domestic or foreign;
    (2) Cost-reimbursement type; or
    (3) Fixed price with redetermination provisions.
    (2) Under construction contracts, include construction 
subcontractors in the prime contractor's plan only when subcontractor 
operations are at the project site, and the subcontract provides that 
the prime contractor will furnish insurance.
    (3) Use the agreement in Table 28-1, Insurance Rating Plan 
Agreement, when the Government assumes contractor premium payments upon 
contract termination or completion.
    (4) The Federal Tort Claims Act provides protection for Government 
employees while driving Government-owned vehicles in the performance of 
their assigned duties. Include the endorsement in Table 28-2, Automobile 
Insurance Policy Endorsement, in automobile liability insurance policies 
provided under the National Defense Projects Rating Plan.

           Table 28-1.--Insurance Rating Plan Rating Agreement

Special Casualty Insurance Rating Plan Assignment-Assumption of Premium 
                               Obligations

    It is agreed that 100 percent * of the return premiums and premium 
refunds (and dividends) due or to become due the prime contractor under 
the policies to which the National Defense Projects Rating Plan 
Endorsement made a part of policy ____________ applies are hereby 
assigned to and shall be paid to the United States of America, and the 
prime contractor directs the Company to make such payments to the office 
designated for contract administration acting for and on account of the 
United States of America.

    * In the event the Government has less than a 100 percent interest 
in premium funds or dividends, modify the assignment to reflect the 
percentage of interest and extent of the Government's assumption of 
additional premium obligation.

    The United States of America hereby assumes and agrees to fulfill

from the British value added tax and import duties.


<R05>
229.7002-1  Value added tax.

    (a) U.S. Government purchases qualifying for tax relief are 
equipment, materials, facilities, and services for the common defense 
effort and for foreign aid programs.
    (b) To facilitate the resolution of issues concerning specific 
waivers of import duty or tax exemption for U.S. Government purchases 
(see 229.7002-3), contracting offices shall provide the name and 
activity address of personnel who have been granted warranted 
contracting authority to Her Majesty's (HM) Customs and Excise at the

G, Branch 4, Adelaide House, London Bridge, London EC4R 9DB.


<R05>
229.7002-2  Import duty.

    No import duty shall be paid by the United States and contract 
prices shall be exclusive of duty, except when the administrative cost 
compared to the low dollar value of a contract makes it impracticable to 
obtain relief from contract import duty. In this instance, the 
contracting officer shall document the contract file with a statement 
that--
    (a) The administrative burden of securing tax relief under the 
contract was out of proportion to the tax relief involved;
    (b) It is impracticable to secure tax relief;

establish a permanent military installation.

    In the event a value added tax or import duty problem cannot be 
resolved at the contracting officer's level, refer the issue to HQ Third

<R04>
    Subpart 230.70--Facilities Capital Employed for Facilities in Use


<R05>
230.7000  Contract facilities capital estimates.

    (a) The contracting officer will estimate the facilities capital 
cost of money and capital employed using--
    (1) An analysis of the appropriate Forms CASB-CMF and cost of money 
factors; and
    (2) DD Form 1861, Contract Facilities Capital Cost of Money.


<R05>
230.7001  Use of DD Form 1861.


<R05>
230.7001-1  Purpose.

    The DD Form 1861 provides a means of linking the Form CASB-CMF and 
DD Form 1547, Record of Weighted Guidelines Application. It--
    (a) Enables the contracting officer to differentiate profit 
objectives for various types of assets (land, buildings, equipment). The 
procedure is similar to applying overhead rates to appropriate overhead 
allocation bases to determine contract overhead costs.
    (b) Is designed to record and compute the contract facilities 
capital cost of money and capital employed which is carried forward to 
DD Form 1547.


<R05>
230.7001-2  Completion instructions.

    Complete a DD Form 1861 only after evaluating the contractor's cost 
proposal, establishing cost of money factors, and establishing a 
prenegotiation objective on cost. Complete the form as follows:
    (a) List overhead pools and direct-charging service centers (if 
used) in the same structure as they appear on the contractor's cost 
proposal and Form CASB-CMF. The structure and allocation base units-of-
measure must be compatible on all three displays.
    (b) Extract appropriate contract overhead allocation base data, by 
year, from the evaluated cost breakdown or prenegotiation cost objective 
and list against each overhead pool and direct-charging service center.
    (c) Multiply each allocation base by its corresponding cost of money 
factor to get the facilities capital cost of money estimated to be 
incurred each year. The sum of these products represents the estimated 
contract facilities capital cost of money for the year's effort.
    (d) Total contract facilities cost of money is the sum of the yearly 
amounts.
    (e) Since the facilities capital cost of money factors reflect the 
applicable cost of money rate in Column 1 of Form CASB-CMF, divide the 
contract cost of money by that same rate to determine the contract 
facilities capital employed.


<R05>
230.7002  Preaward facilities capital applications.

    To establish cost and price objectives, apply the facilities capital 
cost of money and capital employed, as determined under 230.7000, as 
follows:
    (a) Cost of Money--(1) Cost Objective. Use the imputed facilities 
capital cost of money, with normal, booked costs, to establish a cost 
objective or the target cost when structuring an incentive type 
contract. Do not adjust target costs established at the outset even 
though actual cost of money rates become available during the period of 
contract performance.
    (2) Profit Objective. When measuring the contractor's effort for the 
purpose of establishing a prenegotiation profit objective, restrict the 
cost base to normal, booked costs. Do not include cost of money as part 
of the cost base.
    (b) Facilities Capital Employed. Assess and weight the profit 
objective or risk associated with facilities capital employed in 
accordance with the profit guidelines at 215.970-1(c).

230.7003  Postaward facilities capital applications.


<R05>
230.7003-1  Interim billings based on costs incurred.

    (a) The contractor may include contract facilities capital cost of 
money in cost reimbursement and progress payment invoices. To determine 
the amount that qualifies as cost incurred, multiply the incurred 
portions of the overhead pool allocation bases by the latest available 
cost of money factors. These cost of money calculations are interim 
estimates subject to adjustment.
    (b) As actual cost of money factors under CAS 414 and FAR 31.205-10 
are finalized, use the new factors to calculate contract facilities cost 
of money for the next accounting period.


<R05>
230.7003-2  Final settlement.

    (a) Contract facilities capital cost of money for final cost 
determination or repricing is based on each year's final cost of money 
factors determined under CAS 414 and supported by separate Forms CASB-
CMF.
    (b) Separately compute contract facilities cost of money in a manner 
similar to yearly final overhead rates. Also like overhead costs, 
include in the final settlement an adjustment from interim to final 
contract cost of money. Do not, however, adjust estimated or target 
cost.


<R05>
230.7004  Administrative procedures.


<R05>
230.7004-1  Forms CASB-CMF

    (a) Forms CASB-CMF are normally initiated by the contractor under 
the same circumstances as Forward Pricing Rate Agreements (see FAR 
15.809) and evaluated as complementary documents and procedures.
    (b) Separate forms are required for each prospective cost accounting 
period of contract performance.
    (c) The contractor may submit annually or with individual contract 
price proposals, as agreed with the administrative contracting officer 
(ACO).
    (d) The contractor must submit a final form under CAS 414 as soon as 
possible after the end of each accounting period, together with a 
proposal for actual overhead costs and rates.


<R05>
230.7004-2  DD Form 1861.

    (a) The contracting officer may ask the ACO to complete the forms as 
part of field pricing support.
    (b) When the Weighted Guidelines Method is used, completion of the 
DD Form 1861 requires information not included on the Form CASB-CMF, 
i.e., distribution percentages of land, building, and equipment for the 
business unit performing the contract. Choose the most practical method 
for obtaining this information, for example--
    (1) Contract administration offices could obtain the information 
through the process used to establish factors for facilities capital 
cost of money or could establish advance agreements on distribution 
percentages for inclusion in field pricing reports;
    (2) The corporate ACO could obtain distribution percentages; or
    (3) The contracting officer could request the information through a 
solicitation provision.

    Subpart 230.71--Facilities Capital Employed for Facilities Under 
                              Construction


<R05>
230.7100  Definitions.

    (a) Intangible capital asset is an asset that has no physical 
substance, has more than minimal value, and is expected to be held by an 
enterprise for continued use or possession beyond the current accounting 
period for the benefit it yields.
    (b) Tangible capital asset is an asset that has physical substance, 
more than minimal value, and is expected to be held by an enterprise for 
continued use or possession beyond the current accounting period for the 
service it yields.
    (c) Cost of money rate is either--
    (1) The interest rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury 
under Public Law 92-41 (85 Stat. 97); or
    (2) The time-weighted average of the interest rate for each cost 
accounting period during which the asset is being constructed, 
fabricated, or developed.
    (d) Representative investment is the calculated amount considered 
invested by the contractor during the cost accounting period to 
construct, fabricate, or develop the asset.

[[Page 250]]


<R05>
230.7101  Calculations.


<R05>
230.7101-1  Cost of money.

    (a) The interest rate in 230.7100(c)(1) is established semi-annually 
and is published in the Federal Register during the fourth week of 
December and June.
    (b) To calculate the time-weighted average interest rate--
    (1) Multiply the various rates in effect during the months of 
construction by the number of months each rate was in effect; and
    (2) Divide the sum of the products by the total number of months in 
which the rates were experienced.


<R05>
230.7101-2  Representative investment.

    (a) The calculation of the representative investment requires 
consideration of the rate or expenditure pattern of the costs to 
construct, fabricate, or develop a capital asset.
    (b) If a majority of the costs were incurred toward the beginning, 
middle, or end of the cost accounting period, the contractor shall 
either--
    (1) Determine a representative investment amount for the cost 
accounting period by calculating the average of the month-end balances 
for that cost accounting period; or
    (2) Treat month-end balances as individual representative investment 
amounts.
    (c) If the costs were incurred in a fairly uniform expenditure 
pattern throughout the construction, fabrication, or development period, 
the contractor may--
    (1) Determine a representative investment amount for the cost 
accounting period by averaging the beginning and ending balances of the 
construction, fabrication, or development cost account for the cost 
accounting period; or
    (2) Treat month-end balances as individual representative investment 
amounts.


<R05>
230.7102  Determining imputed cost of money.

    (a) Determine the imputed cost of money for an asset under 
construction, fabrication, or development by applying a cost of money 
rate (see 230.7101-1) to the representative investment amount (see 
230.7101-2).
    (1) When a representative investment amount is determined for a cost 
accounting period in accordance with 230.7101-2(b)(1) or 230.7101-
2(c)(1), the cost of money will be the time-weighted average rate.
    (2) When a monthly representative investment amount is used in 
accordance with 230.7101-2(b)(2) or 230.7101-2(c)(2), the cost of money 
will be the interest rate in effect each month. (Under this method, the 
cost of money is determined monthly and the total for the cost 
accounting period is the sum of the monthly amounts.)
    (b) The imputed cost of money will be capitalized only once in any 
cost accounting period, either at the end of the period or at the end of 
the construction, fabrication, or development period, whichever comes 
first.
    (c) When the construction of an asset takes more than one cost 
accounting period, the cost of money capitalized for the first cost 
accounting period will be included in determining the representative 
investment amount for any future cost accounting periods.

April 15, 1995, and are funded by fiscal year 1995 appropriations 
(Section 8117 of Pub. L. 103-335).
    (B) Costs for individual compensation in excess of $200,000 per year 
are unallowable under DOD contracts that are awarded after July 1, 1996, 
and are funded by fiscal year 1996 appropriations (Section 8086 of Pub. 
L. 104-61).
    (ii) Costs for individual compensation in excess of $250,000 per 
year are unallowable under new DoD contracts funded by fiscal year 1997 
appropriations (Section 8071 of Public Law 104-208). For purposes of 
this limitation, the term ``compensation'' means--
    (A) The total amount of taxable wages paid to the employee for the 
year concerned; plus
    (B) The total amount of elective deferred compensation earned by the 
employee in the year concerned.
    (f)(1) Costs for bonuses or other payments in excess of the normal 
salary paid by the contractor to an employee, that are part of 
restructuring costs associated with a business combination, are 
unallowable under DoD contracts funded by fiscal year 1996 
appropriations (Section 8122 of Pub. L. 104-61) or fiscal year 1997 
appropriations (Section 8095 of Pub. L. 104-208). This limitation does 
not apply to severance payments or early retirement incentive payments.

    (c)(1)(i)(C)(1) Total incurred IR&D/B&P costs, including total IR&D/
B&P ceiling amounts which are negotiated pursuant to FAR 31.205-
18(c)(1), are fully allocable to all final cost objectives of the 
contractor. The amount of IR&D/B&P costs allowable under contracts which 
are subject to advance agreements negotiated by DoD shall not exceed the 
lesser of--
    (i) Such contracts' allocable share of incurred IR&D/B&P costs;
    (ii) Such contracts' allocable share of the total IR&D/B&P ceiling; 
or
    (iii) The amount of incurred IR&D/B&P costs for projects having 
potential interest to DoD.
    (2) Allowable IR&D/B&P costs are limited to those for projects which 
are of potential interest to DoD, including activities that--

[[Page 252]]

    (i) Strengthen the defense industrial and technology base of the 
United States;
    (ii) Enhance the industrial competitiveness of the United States;
    (iii) Promote the development of technologies identified as critical 
in the plan required under 10 U.S.C. 2508;
    (iv) Increase the development of technologies useful for both the 
private commercial sector and the public sector; or
    (v) Develop efficient and effective technologies for achieving such 
environmental benefits as improved environmental data gathering, 
environmental cleanup and restoration, pollution-reduction in 
manufacturing, environmental conservation, and environmentally safe 
management of facilities.
    (3) The contracting officer will--
    (i) Determine whether IR&D/B&P projects are of potential interest to 
DoD; and
    (ii) Provide the results of the determination to the contractor.
    (4) See 225.7303 for additional allowability provisions affecting 
foreign military sale contracts.
    (2) Departments/agencies shall not supplement this regulation in any 
way that limits IR&D/B&P cost allowability. See 225.7303-2 for 
allowability exceptions for foreign military sales contracts.
    (i) In addition to the limitations in FAR 31.205-18(c)(2)(i), for 
major contractors--
    (1) The amount of IR&D/B&P costs allowability under DoD contracts 
shall not exceed the lesser of--
    (i) Such contracts' allocable share of incurred IR&D/B&P costs;
    (ii) Such contracts' allocable share of the contractor's total 
maximum allowable amount; or
    (iii) The amount of incurred IR&D/B&P costs for projects having 
potential interest to DoD.
    (2) Allowable IR&D/B&P costs are limited to those for projects which

[62 FR 47155, Sept. 8, 1997]


<R05>
231.205-70  External restructuring costs.

    (a) Scope. This subsection prescribes policies and procedures for 
allowing contractor external restructuring costs when net savings would 
result for DoD.

[[Page 253]]

This subsection also implements Section 818 of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 (Pub. L. 103-337) and Section 
8115 of the National Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1997 
(Pub. L. 104-208).
    (b) Definitions. As used in this subsection:
    (1) Business combination means a transaction whereby assets or 
operations of two or more companies not previously under common 
ownership or control are combined, whether by merger, acquisition, or 
sale/purchase of assets.
    (2) External restructuring activities means restructuring activities 
occurring after a business combination that affect the operations of 
companies not previously under common ownership or control. They do not 
include restructuring activities occurring after a business combination 
that affect the operations of only one of the companies not previously 
under common ownership or control, or, when there has been no business 
combination, restructuring activities undertaken within one company. 
External restructuring activities are a direct outgrowth of a business 
combination. They normally will be initiated within 3 years of the 
business combination.
    (3) Restructuring activities means nonroutine, nonrecurring, or 
extraordinary activities to combine facilities, operations, or 
workforce, in order to eliminate redundant capabilities, improve future 
operations, and reduce overall costs. Restructuring activities do not 
include routine or ongoing repositionings and redeployments of a 
contractor's productive facilities or workforce (e.g., normal plant 
rearrangement or employee relocation), nor do they include other routine 
or ordinary activities charged as indirect costs that would otherwise 
have been incurred (e.g., planning and analysis, contract administration 
and oversight, or recurring financial and administrative support).
    (4) Restructuring costs means the costs, including both direct and 
indirect, of restructuring activities. Restructuring costs that may be 
allowed include, but are not limited to, severance pay for employees, 
early retirement incentive payments for employees, employee retraining 
costs, relocation expense for retained employees, and relocation and 
rearrangement of plant and equipment. For purposes of this definition, 
if restructuring costs associated with external restructuring activities 
allocated to DoD contracts are less than $2.5 million, the costs shall 
not be subject to the audit, review, and certification requirements of 
231.205-70(c)(1); instead, the normal rules for determining cost 
allowability in accordance with FAR Part 31 shall apply.
    (5) Restructuring savings means cost reductions, including both 
direct and indirect cost reductions, that result from restructuring 
activities. Reassignments of cost to future periods are not 
restructuring savings.
    (c) Limitations on cost allowability. (1) Restructuring costs 
associated with external restructuring activities shall not be allowed 
unless--
    (i) Such costs are allowable in accordance with FAR Part 31 and 
DFARS Part 231;
    (ii) An audit of projected restructuring costs and restructuring 
savings is performed;
    (iii) The cognizant administrative contracting officer (ACO) reviews 
the audit report and the projected costs and projected savings, 
determines that overall reduced costs should result for DoD, and 
negotiates an advance agreement in accordance with 231.205-70(d)(8); and
    (iv) A certification is made by the Under Secretary of Defense 
(Acquisition & Technology), his Principal Deputy or designee (in all 
cases, an individual appointed by the President and confirmed by the 
Senate), that projections of future restructuring savings resulting for 
DoD from the business combination are based on audited cost data and 
should result in overall reduced costs for DoD.
    (2) The audit, review, and certification required by 231.205-
70(c)(1) shall not apply to any business combination for which payments 
for restructuring costs were made before August 15, 1994, or for which 
the cognizant ACO executed an advance agreement establishing cost 
ceilings based on audit/negotiation of detailed cost proposals for

[[Page 254]]

individual restructuring projects before August 15, 1994.
    (3) Additionally, for business combinations that occur after 
September 30, 1996, no fiscal year 1997 appropriated funds may be 
obligated or expended to reimburse a contractor for restructuring costs 
associated with external restructuring activities unless--
    (i) The audited savings for DoD resulting from the restructuring 
will exceed the costs allowed by a factor of at least two to one; or
    (ii) The savings for DoD resulting from the restructuring will 
exceed the costs allowed, and the Secretary of Defense determines that 
the business combination will result in the preservation of a critical 
capability that might otherwise be lost to DoD.
    (d) Procedures and ACO responsibilities. As soon as it is known that 
the contractor will incur restructuring costs for external restructuring 
activities, the cognizant ACO shall:
    (1) Promptly execute a novation agreement, if one is required, in 
accordance with FAR subpart 42.12 and DFARS subpart 242.12 and include 
the provision at DFARS 242.1204(e).
    (2) Direct the contractor to segregate restructuring costs and to 
suspend these amounts from any billings, final contract price 
settlements, and overhead settlements until the certification in 
231.205-70(c)(1)(iv) is obtained.
    (3) Require the contractor to submit an overall plan of 
restructuring activities and an adequately supported proposal for 
planned restructuring projects. The proposal must include a breakout by 
year by cost element, showing the projected restructuring costs and 
projected restructuring savings.
    (4) Notify major buying activities of contractor restructuring 
actions and inform them about any potential monetary impacts on major 
weapons programs, when known.
    (5) Upon receipt of the contractor's proposal, as soon as 
practicable, adjust forward pricing rates to reflect the impact of 
projected restructuring savings. If restructuring costs are included in 
forward pricing rates prior to execution of an advance agreement in 
accordance with 231.205-70(d)(8), the contracting officer shall include 
a repricing clause in each fixed-price action that is priced based on 
the rates. The repricing clause must provide for a downward price 
adjustment to remove restructuring costs if the certification required 
by 231.205-70(c)(1)(iv) is not obtained.
    (6) Upon receipt of the contractor's proposal, immediately request 
an audit review of the contractor's proposal.
    (7) Upon receipt of the audit report, determine if restructuring 
savings will exceed restructuring costs on a present value basis.
    (8) Negotiate an advance agreement with the contractor setting 
forth, at a minimum, a cumulative cost ceiling for restructuring 
projects and, when necessary, a cost amortization schedule. The cost may 
not exceed the amount of projected restructuring savings on a present 
value basis. The advance agreement shall not be executed until the 
certification required by 231.205-70(c)(1)(iv) is obtained.
    (9) Submit to the Director of Defense Procurement, Office of the 
Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition & Technology), ATTN: 
OUSD(A&T)DP/CPF, a recommendation for certification of net benefit.

231.205-71  Defense capability preservation agreements.

    (a) Scope and authority. Where it would facilitate the achievement 
of the policy objectives relating to defense reinvestment, 
diversification, and conversion set forth in 10 U.S.C. 2501(b), DoD may 
enter into a ``defense capability preservation agreement'' with a 
contractor. As authorized by Section 808 of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 (Public Law 104-106), such an 
agreement would permit the contractor to claim certain indirect costs 
attributable to its private sector work as allowable costs on its 
defense contracts.
    (b) Procedure. A contractor may submit a request for such an 
agreement, together with appropriate justification, through the Deputy 
Under Secretary of Defense for Industrial Affairs and Installations, to 
the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, who has 
exclusive approval or disapproval authority. The contractor should also 
provide an informational copy of any such request to the cognizant 
administrative contracting officer.

         Subpart 231.3--Contracts With Educational Institutions


<R05>
231.303  Requirements.

    (1) Pursuant to section 841 of the National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Pub. L. 103-160), no limitation may be placed 
on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred by 
an institution of higher education under a DoD contract awarded on or 
after November 30, 1993, unless that same limitation is applied 
uniformly to all other organizations performing similar work under DoD 
contracts. The 26 percent limitation imposed on administrative indirect 
costs by OMB Circular No. A-21 shall not be applied to DoD contracts 
awarded on or after November 30, 1993, to institutions of higher 
education because the same limitation is not applied to other 
organizations performing similar work.
    (2) The cognizant administrative contracting officer may waive the 
prohibition in 231.303(1) if the governing body of the institution of 
higher education requests the waiver to simplify the institution's 
overall management of DoD cost reimbursements under DoD contracts.
    (3) The limitations on allowable individual compensation at 231.205-
6(a)(2) (i) and (ii) also apply to this subpart.
    (4) Under 10 U.S.C. 2249, the costs cited in 231.205-22(a) are 
unallowable.

    Use the policies and procedures in this section in determining the 
financial capability of current or prospective contractors.

[[Page 258]]


<R05>
232.172-1  Required financial reviews.

    The contracting officer shall perform a financial review when the 
contracting officer does not otherwise have sufficient information to 
make a positive determination of financial responsibility. In addition, 
the contracting officer shall consider performing a financial review--
    (a) Prior to award of a contract, when--
    (1) The contractor is on a list requiring preaward clearance or 
other special clearance before award;
    (2) The contractor is listed on the Consolidated List of Contractors 
Indebted to the Government (Hold-Up List), or is otherwise known to be 
indebted to the Government;
    (3) The contractor may receive Government assets such as contract 
financing payments or Government property;
    (4) The contractor is experiencing performance difficulties on other 
work; or
    (5) The contractor is a new company or a new supplier of the item.
    (b) At periodic intervals after award of a contract, when--
    (1) Any of the conditions of paragraphs (a) (2) through (5) of this

to finance performance and completion of the contract.


<R05>
232.172-2  Appropriate information.

    (a) The contracting officer shall obtain whatever type and depth of 
financial and other information is required to establish a contractor's 
financial capability or disclose a contractor's financial condition. 
While the contracting officer should not request information that is not 
necessary for the protection of the Government's interests, the 
contracting officer must insist upon obtaining that information which is 
necessary. The unwillingness or inability of a contractor to present 
reasonably requested information in a timely manner, especially 
information that a prudent business person would be expected to have and 
use in the professional management of a business, may be a material fact 
in the determination of the contractor's responsibility and prospects 
for contract completion.
    (b) Obtain the following information to the extent required to 
protect the Government's interest. In addition, if the contracting 
officer concludes that information not listed below is required to 
comply with 232.172-1, that information should be requested. The 
information must be for the person(s) who are legally liable for 
contract performance. If the contractor is not a corporation, obtain the 
required information for each individual/joint venturer/partner--
    (1) Balance sheet and income statement--
    (i) For the current fiscal year (interim);
    (ii) For the most recent fiscal year and preferably, for the two 
preceding fiscal years. These should be certified by an independent 
public accountant or by an appropriate officer of the firm; and
    (iii) Forecasted for each fiscal year for the remainder of the 
period of contract performance;
    (2) Summary history of the contractor and its principal managers, 
disclosing any previous insolvencies--corporate or personal, and 
describing its products or services;
    (3) Statement of all affiliations disclosing--
    (i) Material financial interests of the contractor;
    (ii) Material financial interests in the contractor;
    (iii) Material affiliations of owners, officers, directors, major 
stockholders; and
    (iv) The major stockholders if the contractor is not a widely-
traded, publicly-held corporation;
    (4) Statement of all forms of compensation to each officer, manager, 
partner, joint venturer, or proprietor, as appropriate--
    (i) Planned for the current year;
    (ii) Paid during the past 2 years; and
    (iii) Deferred to future periods.
    (5) Business base and forecast which--
    (i) Shows, by significant markets, existing contracts and 
outstanding offers, including those under negotiation; and
    (ii) Is reconcilable to indirect cost rate projections.

[[Page 259]]

    (6) Cash forecast for the duration of the contract (see 232.172-3).
    (7) Financing arrangement information which discloses--
    (i) Availability of cash to finance contract performance;
    (ii) Contractor's exposure to financial crisis from creditor's 
demands;
    (iii) Degree to which credit security provisions could conflict with 
Government title terms under contract financing;
    (iv) Clearly stated confirmations of credit with no unacceptable 
qualifications; and
    (v) Unambiguous written agreement by a creditor if credit 
arrangements include deferred trade payments or creditor subordinations/
repayment suspensions.
    (8) Statement of all state, local, and Federal tax accounts, 
including special mandatory contributions, e.g., environmental 
superfund.
    (9) Description and explanation of the financial effect of issues 
such as--
    (i) Leases, deferred purchase arrangements, patent or royalty 
arrangements;
    (ii) Insurance, when relevant to the contract;
    (iii) Contemplated capital expenditures, changes in equity, or 
contractor debt load;
    (iv) Pending claims either by or against the contractor;
    (v) Contingent liabilities such as guarantees, litigation, 
environmental, or product liabilities;
    (vi) Validity of accounts receivable and actual value of inventory, 
as assets; and
    (vii) Status and aging of accounts payable.
    (10) Significant ratios such as--
    (i) Inventory to annual sales;
    (ii) Inventory to current assets;
    (iii) Liquid assets to current assets;
    (iv) Liquid assets to current liabilities;
    (v) Current assets to current liabilities; and
    (vi) Net worth to net debt.


<R05>
232.172-3  Cash flow forecasts.

    (a) A contractor must be able to sustain a sufficient cash flow to 
perform the contract. Whenever there is a doubt about the sufficiency of 
a contractor's cash flow, the contracting officer should require the 
contractor to submit a cash flow forecast covering the duration of the 
contract.
    (b) A contractor's inability or refusal to prepare and provide cash 
flow forecasts or to reconcile actual cash flow with previous forecasts 
is a strong indicator of serious managerial deficiencies or potential 
contract cost or performance problems.
    (c) Single or one-time cash flow forecasts are of limited 
forecasting power. As such, they should be limited to preaward survey 
situations. Reliability of cash flow forecasts can be established only 
by comparing a series of previous actual cash flows with the 
corresponding forecasts and examining the causes of any differences.
    (d) Cash flow forecasts must--
    (1) Show the origin and use of all material amounts of cash within 
the entire business unit responsible for contract performance, period by 
period, for the length of the contract (or until the risk of a cash 
crisis ends); and
    (2) Provide an audit trail to the data and assumptions used to 
prepare it.
    (e) Cash flow forecasts can be no more reliable than the assumptions 
on which they are based. Most important of these assumptions are--
    (1) Estimated amounts and timing of purchases and payments for 
materials, parts, components, subassemblies, and services;
    (2) Estimated amounts and timing of payments for purchase or 
production of capital assets, test facilities, and tooling;
    (3) Amounts and timing of fixed cash charges such as debt 
installments, interest, rentals, taxes, and indirect costs;
    (4) Estimated amounts and timing of payments for projected labor, 
both direct and indirect;
    (5) Reasonableness of projected manufacturing and production 
schedules;
    (6) Estimated amounts and timing of billings to customers (including 
progress payments), and customer payments;
    (7) Estimated amounts and timing of cash receipts from lenders or 
other credit sources, and liquidation of loans; and

[[Page 260]]

    (8) Estimated amounts and timing of cash receipts from other 
sources.
    (f) The contracting officer should review the assumptions underlying 
the cash flow forecasts. In determining whether the assumptions are 
reasonable and realistic, the contracting officer should consult with--
    (1) The contractor;
    (2) Government personnel in the areas of finance, engineering, 
production, cost, and price analysis; or
    (3) Prospective supply, subcontract, and loan or credit sources.

<R05>
232.173-1  General.

    (a) 10 U.S.C. 2307(e)(2) provides for a reduction or suspension of 
further payments to a contractor when the agency head determines there 
is substantial evidence that the contractor's request for advance, 
partial, or progress payments is based on fraud.
    (b) The agency head may not delegate his or her responsibilities 
under 10 U.S.C. 2307(e) below level IV of the Executive Schedule. For 
purposes of this section, the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition & 
Technology) is the agency head for the defense agencies.
    (c) Authority to reduce or suspend payments under 10 U.S.C. 2307(e) 
is in addition to other Government rights, remedies, and procedures.
    (d) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2310(a), agency head determinations 
and decisions under this section may be made for an individual contract 
or any group of contracts affected by the fraud.

agency who coordinates within that agency the administration of 
criminal, civil, administrative, and contractual remedies resulting from 
investigations of fraud or corruption related to procurement activities.
    (b) Substantial evidence means information sufficient to support the 
reasonable belief that a particular act or omission has occurred.
[57 FR 3359, Jan. 29, 1992]

<R05>
232.173-4  Procedures.

    (a) In any case in which an agency's remedy coordination official 
finds substantial evidence that a contractor's request for advance, 
partial, or progress payments under a contract awarded by that agency is 
based on fraud, the remedy coordination official shall recommend that 
the agency head reduce or suspend further payments to the contractor. 
The remedy coordination official shall submit to the agency head a 
written report setting forth the remedy coordination official's findings 
that support each recommendation.
    (b) Upon receiving a recommendation from the remedy coordination 
official under paragraph (a) of this subsection, the agency head shall 
determine whether substantial evidence exists that the request for 
payment under a contract is based on fraud.
    (c) If the agency head determines that substantial evidence exists, 
the agency head may reduce or suspend further payments to the contractor 
under the affected contract(s). Such reduction or suspension shall be 
reasonably commensurate with the anticipated loss to the Government 
resulting from the fraud.
    (d) In determining whether to reduce or suspend further payment(s), 
as a minimum, the agency head shall consider:
    (1) A recommendation from investigating officers that disclosure of 
the allegations of fraud to the contractor may compromise an ongoing 
investigation;
    (2) The anticipated loss to the Government as a result of the fraud;

[[Page 261]]

    (3) The contractor's overall financial condition and ability to 
continue performance if payments are reduced or suspended;
    (4) The contractor's essentiality to the national defense;
    (5) Assessment of all documentation concerning the alleged fraud, 
including documentation submitted by the contractor in its response to 
the notice required by paragraph (e) of this subsection.
    (e) Before making a decision to reduce or suspend further payments, 
the agency head shall, in accordance with agency procedures--
    (1) Notify the contractor in writing of the action proposed by the 
remedy coordination official and the reasons therefore; and
    (2) Provide the contractor an opportunity to submit information 
within a reasonable time, in response to the action proposed by the 
remedy coordination official.
    (f) When more than one agency has contracts affected by the fraud, 
the agencies shall consider designating one agency as the lead agency 
for making the determination and decision.
    (g) The agency shall retain in its files the written justification 
for each--
    (1) Decision of the agency head whether to reduce or suspend further 
payments; and
    (2) Recommendation received by an agency head in connection with 
such decision.
    (h) Not later than 180 calendar days after the date of the reduction 
or suspension action, the remedy coordination official shall--
    (1) Review the agency head's determination on which the reduction or 
suspension decision is based; and
    (2) Transmit a recommendation to the agency head as to whether the 
reduction or suspension should continue.

232.470  Advance payment pool.

    (a) An advance payment pool agreement--
    (1) Is a means of financing the performance of more than one 
contract held by a single contractor;
    (2) Is especially convenient for the financing of cost-type 
contracts with nonprofit educational or research institutions for 
experimental or research and development work when several contracts 
require financing by advance payments. When appropriate, pooled advance 
payments may also be used to finance other types of contracts held by a 
single contractor; and
    (3) May be established--
    (i) Without regard to the number of appropriations involved;
    (ii) To finance contracts for one or more department(s) or 
contracting activity(ies); or
    (iii) In addition to any other advance payment pool agreement at a 
single contractor location when it is more convenient or otherwise 
preferable to have more than one agreement.

             Subpart 232.5--Progress Payments Based on Costs


<R05>
232.501  General.

    In DoD, customary progress payments may be either uniform or 
flexible (FAR 32.501-1(a)). See also 232.501-1 and 232.502-1-71.


<R05>
232.501-1  Customary progress payment rates.

    (a)(i) The customary uniform progress payment rate for DoD contracts 
is 75 percent for large businesses, 90 percent for small businesses, and 
95 percent for small disadvantaged businesses.
    (ii) The progress payment rates applicable to foreign military sale 
requirements are the same rates applicable to DoD requirements.
    (iii) For customary flexible progress payments, determine the 
appropriate rate using the appropriate CASH computer program (see 
232.502-1-71).
[56 FR 36409, July 31, 1991, as amended at 56 FR 67217, Dec. 30, 1991; 
58 FR 62046, Nov. 24, 1993]


<R05>
232.501-2  Unusual progress payments.

    (a) Unusual progress payment arrangements require the advance 
approval of the USD(A&T)DP. Contracting officers shall submit all 
unusual progress payment requests to the department or agency contract 
financing office for approval, coordination with the Contract Finance 
Committee (232.171), and submission to the USD(A&T)DP.
[56 FR 36409, July 31, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 61598, Nov. 30, 1995]


<R05>
232.501-3  Contract price.

    (b) The contracting officer may approve progress payments when the 
contract price exceeds the funds obligated under the contract; provided, 
the contract contains an appropriate Limitation of Funds clause. 
However, the contracting officer shall limit such payments to the lesser 
of--

[[Page 263]]

    (i) The applicable rate (i.e., the lower of the progress payment 
rate, the liquidation rate, or the loss-ratio adjusted rate); or
    (ii) 100 percent of the funds obligated.


<R05>
232.502  Preaward matters.


<R05>
232.502-1  Use of customary progress payments.

    (b)(1) If the contractor is a small disadvantaged business, progress 
payments may be provided when the contract will involve $50,000 or more.


<R05>
232.502-1-70  Customary foreign military sale progress payments.

    (a) Foreign military sale (FMS) progress payments apply to DoD 
acquisitions on behalf of foreign governments or international 
organizations (Section 22 of the Arms Export Control Act).
    (b) FMS progress payments do not apply to acquisitions--
    (1) For replenishing U.S. Government inventories or stocks; and
    (2) Made under DoD cooperative logistic support arrangements.


<R05>
232.502-1-71  Customary flexible progress payments.

    (a) General. (1) Progress payments reduce contractor investment in 
work in process inventory. In addition to progress payments, other 
factors influence a contractor's actual investment in work in process 
inventory, e.g., delivery schedules, cash management practices, and 
Government payment practices.
    (2) Progress payment amounts that are determined by using customary 
uniform rates are insensitive to the other factors influencing 
contractor investment in work in process inventory. Consequently, 
contractor investments in work in process inventory vary among 
contractors and contracts.
    (3) Flexible progress payment rates are designed to tailor the 
progress payment rate to more closely match the contractor's cash needs 
for financing contract performance. The flexible rate is expressed as a 
percentage which is applied to costs to determine the amount payable as 
a progress payment, in the same manner as customary uniform rates are 
applied.
    (4) For flexible progress payments, cash needs are measured and 
projected based on the investment required for the work in process 
inventory over the life of the contract. Total investment is measured by 
a weighted average of total costs paid by the contractor. The 
contractor's investment is the weighted average of the amount not paid 
by the Government.
    (5) DoD, as a matter of policy, requires contractors to retain a 
minimum investment level in work in process inventory over the life of 
the contract (see Table 32-1, Customary Uniform Progress Payment Rates). 
This minimum investment level is based on the customary uniform progress 
payment rate and its related investment percentage. Accordingly, the DoD 
will make progress payments at a rate (expressed as a whole number) that 
is the highest rate which yields a corresponding investment by the 
contractor in work in process inventory of not less than the minimum 
investment percentage.
    (6) The customary flexible progress payment rate will be determined 
by using the DoD Cash Flow Computer Model. The rate computed shall not--
    (i) Exceed 100 percent; or
    (ii) Be less than the customary uniform progress payment rate that 
would have been applied to the contract in the absence of customary 
flexible progress payments.
    (7) Table 32-1, Customary Uniform Progress Payment Rates, shows the 
customary uniform progress payment rates for other than small or small 
disadvantaged businesses (see also 232.501-1), minimum contractor 
investment (except for contracts funded with FY87 appropriations), and 
the applicable DoD Cash Flow Computer Model. For contracts or line items 
that are funded with FY87 appropriations, a contractor must retain at 
least a 25 percent investment in work in process inventory over the life 
of the contract or over the contract performance period applicable to 
the contract line item.

* Flexible progress payments shall not be used for contracts awarded as a result of solicitations issued on or  
  after November 11, 1993.                                                                                      
** See paragraph (b)(5)(ii) for implementation instructions.                                                    

    (b) Using customary flexible progress payments. (1) Use a flexible 
progress payment rate at the time of award or definitization instead of 
the customary uniform rate if--
    (i) The contractor requests flexible progress payments;
    (ii) The contractor agrees to the requirements of this section;
    (iii) The contract contains the clause at FAR 52.232-16, Progress 
Payments. However, small business contractors may get flexible progress 
payments if they agree to use the clause at FAR 52.232-16 without its 
Alternate I; and
    (iv) The criteria in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this subsection 
are met.
    (2) Do not use flexible progress payments for--
    (i) Sealed bid contracts;
    (ii) Undefinitized contract actions; or
    (iii) Contracts awarded and performed entirely outside of the United 
States, its possessions or territories.
    (3) Contractors who submit cost or pricing data, as defined in FAR 
15.801, for negotiated fixed-price contracts in excess of $1 million may 
request flexible progress payments.
    (4) Subcontractors who request flexible progress payments, meet the 
criteria in paragraph (b)(3) of this subsection, and agree to the 
requirements of this subsection are to receive flexible progress 
payments. The prime contractor determines the flexible progress payment 
rate without regard to the rate in the prime contract. In determining 
the appropriate customary flexible rate, the prime contractor will use 
the DoD Cash Flow Computer Model and review the cash flow data provided 
by the subcontractor.
    (5) Prior to contract award, the contracting officer shall determine 
the customary flexible progress payment rate by applying the appropriate 
version of the DoD Cash Flow Computer Model.
    (i) The model takes into account key cash flow factors including 
contract cost profile, delivery schedules, subcontractor progress 
payments, liquidation rates, and payment/reimbursement cycles. For 
contracts funded with FY87 appropriations, use the CASH-IV model.
    (ii) From time to time the Department of Defense may change the 
uniform progress payment rate and/or the minimum contractor investment 
rate, which may have an effect upon the variables within the DoD Cash 
Flow Computer Program. In order to avoid frequent revision and 
redistribution of the computer program, the program is designed to 
permit use of either a particular model (CASH-II, CASH-V, etc.) or a 
program option to input the equivalent uniform progress payment rate and 
minimum contractor investment rate (90%/5%, 80%/20%, etc.), as shown in 
the table at (a)(7). Either method will result in the same flexible 
progress payment rate calculation. When the Cash Flow Computer Program 
does not contain the model needed for a particular situation, the 
contracting officer shall use the program option.
    (6) If the contractor requests flexible progress payments after 
contract award or definitization, the contracting officer may, if 
warranted, grant their use. However, the contractor must provide 
adequate new consideration (see FAR 32.501-4).
    (c) Contractor cash flow and cost information. (1) Contractors shall 
furnish to the contracting officer cash flow data in the form and 
context specified for use in the DoD Cash Flow Computer Model. 
Contractors should furnish cash flow data prior to the start of 
negotiations. This data includes--

[[Page 265]]

    (i) Actual and projected incurred cost, broken down by element of 
cost and by month, for the duration of the contract;
    (ii) Float times for each element of cost;
    (iii) Dates and lag times of actual and projected progress payment 
and delivery payment receipts; and
    (iv) Associated contract price and profit percentage.
    (2) Contracting officers shall verify the cash flow data using the 
procedures normally used to verify contractor cost and pricing data, and 
establish the customary flexible progress payment rate during the 
negotiation of the contract price.
    (3) If any customary flexible progress payment rate is later 
determined to be overstated because factual data submitted in support of 
the rate computation was not current, accurate, or complete at the time 
the rate was established, the flexible progress payment clause at 
252.232-7003 provides for--
    (i) Reduction of the flexible progress payment rate; and
    (ii) Contractor payment of interest.
    (4) The contracting officer will assess the interest charge on the 
amount of the overpayment resulting from facts that were not current, 
accurate, or complete, whether or not the overpayment has been 
liquidated. Calculate the interest from the date of the overpayment to 
the date of liquidation of the overpayment. In determining the amount of 
interest, the contracting officer may determine an average overpayment 
amount and duration as the basis for the interest computation. Interest 
rates change periodically; therefore, calculate average amounts and 
durations separately for each interest period that has a different 
interest rate.
    (5) Administrative contracting officers are encouraged to establish 
advance agreements at contractor locations for payment float and lag 
times which are common to several contracts. Float and lag times may 
vary significantly from one contract to another due to variances in 
efficiency at different payment offices or due to differing procedures 
for high dollar versus low dollar value contracts. It may, therefore, be 
appropriate to establish advance agreements on several different float 
and lag profiles to suit different contract situations.
    (d) Rate review. (1) The flexible progress payment clause at 
252.232-7003 provides for redetermination of the customary flexible 
progress payment rate whenever the computed investment percentage is 
more than two points above or below the specific minimum investment in 
work in process inventory (see Table at 232.502-1-71(a)(7)). When such a 
redetermination is made--
    (i) Apply the new customary flexible progress payment rate to the 
next contractor progress payment request; and
    (ii) Adjust the unliquidated progress payment balance.
    (2) Either the Government or the contractor may request a rate 
review at any time to determine if the computed investment percentage in 
work in process inventory is outside of the investment tolerance in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this subsection. For contracts funded with FY87 
appropriations, the investment range is 23 to 27 percent with a target 
of 25 percent.
    (3) The administrative contracting officer shall assess changes in 
the following factors during each periodic review required by FAR 
32.503-5 and shall review the customary flexible progress payment rate 
whenever there has been--
    (i) A significant change in the float or lag factors;
    (ii) A significant change in the delivery schedule; or
    (iii) Substantial work added to or deleted from the contract.
    (e) Letter contracts and undefinitized orders. When flexible 
progress payments are contemplated for use on a definitized contract 
superseding a letter contract or an unpriced BOA order, the applicable 
uniform customary progress payment rate shall be used until 
definitization. The flexible progress payment rate shall be determined 
by the contracting officer before definitizing the contract or order.
    (f) Availability of CASH program and user's guide. The flexible 
progress payment program CASH and the user's

[[Page 266]]

guide are available to offerors and contractors from the contracting 
officer.

adjustment using the procedures in FAR 32.503-6(g).
    (ii) The contracting officer may request the contractor to prepare 
the supplementary analysis as an attachment to the progress payment 
request when the contracting officer determines that the contractor's 
methods of estimating the ``Costs to Complete'' are reliable, accurate, 
and not susceptible to improper influences.
    (iii) To maintain an audit trail and permit verification of 
calculations, do not make the loss ratio adjustments by altering or 
replacing data on the contractor's original request for progress payment 
(SF 1443, Contractor's Request for Progress Payment, or computer 
generated equivalent).

<R04>
                      Subpart 232.9--Prompt Payment


<R05>
232.903  Policy.

    DoD policy is to assist small disadvantaged business concerns by 
paying them as quickly as possible after invoices are received and 
before normal payment due dates established in the contract (see 
232.905(2)).


<R05>
232.905  Invoice payments.

    (1) In most cases, Government acceptance or approval can occur 
within the 7 day constructive acceptance period specified in the FAR 
Prompt Payment clauses. Government payment of construction progress 
payments can, in most cases, be made within the 14 day period allowed by 
the Prompt Payment for Construction Contracts clause. While the 
contracting officer may specify a longer period because the period 
specified in the contract is not reasonable or practical, such change 
should be coordinated with the Government offices responsible for 
acceptance or approval and for payment. Reasons for specifying a longer 
period include but are not limited to: the nature of the work or 
supplies or services, inspection or testing requirements, shipping and 
acceptance terms, and resources available at the acceptance activity. A 
constructive acceptance period of less than the cited 7 or 14 days is 
not authorized.
    (2) Designated payment offices are encouraged to pay small 
disadvantaged business (SDB) concerns as quickly as possible after 
invoices are received and before normal payment due dates established in 
the contract. The restrictions of FAR 32.903 prohibiting early payment 
do not apply to invoice payments made to SDBs. Contractors shall not, 
however, be entitled to interest penalties if invoice payments are not 
made before the normal payment due dates established in the contract.
    (f)(6) DoD Manual 4000.25-5-M, Military Standard Contract 
Administration Procedures (MILSCAP), authorizes electronic signature of 
receiving reports.

[[Page 270]]


<R05>
232.906  Contract financing payments.

    (a)(i) DoD policy is to make contract financing payments as quickly 
as possible. Generally, the contracting officer shall insert the 
standard due dates of 7 days for progress payments and 14 days for 
interim payments on cost type contracts in subparagraphs (b)(2) of the 
Prompt Payment clauses at FAR 52.232-25, 52.232-26, and 52.232-27.
    (ii) The contracting officer should coordinate payment terms with 
offices that will be involved in the payment process to ensure that 
terms specified can be met. Where justified, the contracting officer may 
insert a due date greater than but not less than the standard. In 
determining payment terms, consider--
    (A) Geographical separation;
    (B) Workload;
    (C) Contractor ability to submit a proper request; and
    (D) Other factors that could affect timing of payment.


<R05>
232.970  Payment of subcontractors.


<R05>
232.970-1  Subcontractor assertions of nonpayment.

    (a) In accordance with Public Law 102-190, title VIII, section 
806(a)(4), upon the assertion by a subcontractor or supplier of a DoD 
contractor that the subcontractor or supplier has not been paid in 
accordance with the payment terms of the subcontract, purchase order, or 
other agreement with the prime contractor, the contracting officer may 
determine--
    (1) For a construction contract, whether the contractor has made--
    (i) Progress payments to the subcontractor or supplier in compliance 
with chapter 39 of title 31, United States Code (Prompt Payment Act);
    (ii) Final payment to the subcontractor or supplier in compliance 
with the terms of the subcontract, purchase order, or other agreement 
with the prime contractor;
    (2) For a contract other than construction, whether the contractor 
has made progress payments, final payments, or other payments to the 
subcontractor or supplier in compliance with the terms of the 
subcontract, purchase order, or other agreement with the prime 
contractor;
    (3) For any contract, whether the contractor's certification of 
payment of a subcontractor or supplier accompanying its payment request 
to the Government is accurate.
    (b) If, in making the determination in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of 
this subsection, the contracting officer finds the prime contractor is 
not in compliance, the contracting officer may--
    (1) Encourage the contractor to make timely payment to the 
subcontractor or supplier; or
    (2) If authorized by the applicable payment clauses, reduce or 
suspend progress payments to the contractor.
    (c) If the contracting officer determines that a certification 
referred to in (a)(3) of this subsection is inaccurate in any material 
respect, the contracting officer shall initiate administrative or other 
remedial action.
[57 FR 42707, Sept. 16, 1992]


<R05>
232.970-2  Subcontractor requests for information.

    (a) In accordance with Public Law 102-190, title VIII, section 
806(a)(1), upon the request of a subcontractor or supplier under a DoD 
contract, the contracting officer shall promptly advise the 
subcontractor or supplier as to--
    (1) Whether the prime contractor has submitted requests for progress 
payments or other payments under the contract to DoD; and
    (2) Whether final payment has been made by the DoD to the prime 
contractor.
    (b) This subsection does not apply to matters that are--
    (1) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an 
Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or 
foreign policy; and
    (2) Properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order (see 5 
U.S.C. 552(b)(1)).

<R05>
235.001  Definitions.

    The following terms are defined in DoD 7000.14-R, Financial 
Management Regulation. As used in this part--
    Advanced development means all effort directed toward projects which 
have moved into the development of hardware for test. The prime proof of 
this type of effort is proof of design concept rather than the 
development of hardware. Projects in this category have a potential 
military application.
    Basic research means all effort of scientific study and 
experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding 
in those fields of the physical, engineering, environmental, and life 
sciences related to long-term national security needs, It provides 
fundamental knowledge required for the solution of military problems. It 
forms a part of the base for--
    (1) Subsequent exploratory and advanced developments in defense 
related technologies; and
    (2) New or improved military functional capabilities in areas such 
as communications, detection, tracking, surveillance, propulsion, 
mobility, guidance and control, navigation, energy conversion, materials 
and structures, and personnel support.
    Demonstration/validation means those efforts necessary to evaluate 
integrated technologies in as realistic an operating environment as 
possible to assess the performance or cost reduction potential of 
advanced technology. The demonstration/validation phase is system 
specific and also includes advanced technology demonstrations that help 
expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use.
    Engineering and manufacturing development means those projects in 
full-scale engineering development but which have not yet received 
approval for production or had production funds included in the DoD 
budget submission for the budget or subsequent fiscal year. This area is 
characterized by major line item projects where program control is 
exercised by review of individual projects.
    Exploratory development means all effort directed toward the 
solution of specific military problems, short of major development 
projects. This type of effort may vary from fairly fundamental applied 
research to quite sophisticated bread-board hardware, study, 
programming, and planning efforts. It would thus include studies, 
investigations, and minor development effort. The dominant 
characteristic of this category of effort is that it be pointed toward 
specific military problem areas with a view toward developing and 
evaluating the feasibility and practicability of proposed solutions and 
determining their parameters.
    Management and support means all effort directed toward support of 
installations and operations required for general research and 
development use. This includes military construction of a general nature 
unrelated to specific programs, maintenance support of laboratories, 
operation and maintenance of test ranges, and maintenance of test 
aircraft and ships. Costs of laboratory personnel, either in-house or 
contracted, would be assigned to projects or as a line item in the 
research, exploratory development, or advanced development program 
areas, as appropriate. Management and support is not ``research and 
development'' except in exceptional cases. For example, construction of 
recreational facilities at an installation is not ``research and 
development'' work, even if the installation is used only for research 
and development work.
    Operational system development means those projects still in full-
scale engineering development, but which have received approval for 
production through Defense Acquisition Board or other action, or 
production funds have been included in the DoD budget submission for the 
budget or subsequent year. All items in this area are major line item 
projects which appear as RDT&E costs of weapons systems elements in 
other programs. Program control is exercised by review of the individual 
projects.

[[Page 274]]

    Research and development ordinarily covers only the following 
categories--
    (1) Basic research;
    (2) Exploratory development;
    (3) Advanced development;
    (4) Demonstration/validation;
    (5) Engineering and manufacturing development; and
    (6) Operational system development.
[60 FR 29499, June 5, 1995]


<R05>
235.002  General.

    Contracts for research and development may not be performed over a 
period exceeding ten years from the date of initial award, unless the 
department or agency notifies Congress (10 U.S.C. 2352).
    (1) The head of the agency shall notify Congress whenever--
    (i) It is expected, at the time of award, or as a result of a 
modification, that the period of performance will exceed ten years from 
the initial award date; or
    (ii) Performance has extended beyond ten years from the initial 
award date and no notice has otherwise been provided to Congress.
    (2) The notice shall--
    (i) Identify the contract;
    (ii) State the initial award date;
    (iii) State the expected period of performance; and
    (iv) Be submitted not later than 30 days after--
    (A) The initial award date or date of modification, as applicable; 
or
    (B) The date on which performance exceeds ten years if no prior 
notice was given.

    (a) All contracts under the Manufacturing Technology Program (see 
DoDI 4200.15, Manufacturing Technology Program) shall be awarded using 
competitive procedures (10 U.S.C. 2525).
    (b)(i) A fixed-price type contract shall not be awarded for a 
development program effort unless--
    (A) The level of program risk permits realistic pricing;
    (B) The use of a fixed-price type contract permits an equitable and 
sensible allocation of program risk between the Government and the 
contractor; and
    (C) A written determination that the criteria of paragraphs 
(b)(i)(A) and (B) of this section have been met is executed--
    (1) By the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and Technology) 
(USD(A&T)) for--
    (i) Research and development for non-major systems, if the contract 
is over $25 million;
    (ii) The lead ship of a class;
    (iii) The development of a major system (as defined in FAR 2.101) or 
subsystem thereof, if the contract is over $25 million, or is over $10 
million and is funded with FY90 funds (Pub. L. 101-165, section 9048), 
FY91 funds (Pub. L. 101-511, section 8038), FY92 funds (Pub. L. 102-172, 
section 8037), or FY93 funds (Pub. L. 102-396, section 9037).
    (2) By the contracting officer for any development not covered by 
paragraph (b)(i)(C)(1) of this section.
    (ii) The contracting officer must obtain USD(A&T) approval of the 
Government's prenegotiation position before negotiations begin and must 
obtain USD(A&T) approval of the negotiated agreement with the contractor 
before the agreement is executed for any action that is--
    (A) An increase of more than $250 million in the price or ceiling 
price of a fixed-price type development contract, or a fixed-price type 
contract for the lead ship of a class;
    (B) A reduction in the amount of work under a fixed-price type 
development contract or a fixed-price type contract for the lead ship of 
a class, when the value of the work deleted is $100 million or more; or
    (C) A repricing of fixed-price type production options to a

contracts

[[Page 275]]

awarded in support of the Manufacturing Technology Program, unless an 
alternative is approved by the Secretary of Defense (10 U.S.C. 2525). 
Approval by the Secretary of Defense to use other than a cost-sharing 
arrangement for the Manufacturing Technology Program must be based on a 
determination that the contract is for a program that--
    (A) Is not likely to have any immediate and direct commercial 
application;
    (B) Is of sufficiently high risk to discourage cost sharing by non-
Federal Government sources; or
    (C) Will be carried out by an institution of higher education.

235.015  Contracts for research with educational institutions and nonprofit organizations.

    (b) Basic agreements.
    (3) When using a basic agreement--
    (i) Incorporate it by reference in section I of the contract; and
    (ii) Incorporate any special clause requirements in section H.
[59 FR 27673, May 27, 1994]


<R05>
235.015-70  Special use allowances for research facilities acquired by educational institutions.

    (a) Definitions. As used in this subsection--
    (1) Research facility means--
    (i) Real property, other than land; and
    (ii) Includes structures, alterations, and improvements, acquired 
for the purpose of conducting scientific research under contracts with 
departments and agencies of the DoD.
    (2) Special use allowance means a negotiated direct or indirect 
allowance--
    (i) For construction or acquisition of buildings, structures, and 
real property, other than land; and
    (ii) Where the allowance is computed at an annual rate exceeding the 
rate which normally would be allowed under FAR subpart 31.3.
    (b) Policy. (1) Educational institutions are to furnish the 
facilities necessary to perform Defense contracts. FAR 31.3 governs how 
much the Government will reimburse the institution for the research 
programs. However, in extraordinary situations, the Government may give 
special use allowances to an educational institution when the 
institution is unable to provide the capital for new laboratories or 
expanded facilities needed for Defense contracts.
    (2) Decisions to provide a special use allowance must be made on a 
case-by-case basis, using the criteria in paragraph (c) of this 
subsection.
    (c) Authorization for special use allowance. The head of a 
contracting activity may approve special use allowances only when all of 
the following conditions are met--
    (1) The research facility is essential to the performance of DoD 
contracts;
    (2) Existing facilities, either Government or nongovernment, cannot 
meet program requirements practically or effectively;
    (3) The proposed agreement for special use allowances is a sound 
business arrangement;

[[Page 276]]

    (4) The Government's furnishing of Government-owned facilities is 
undesirable or impractical; and
    (5) The proposed use of the research facility is to conduct 
essential Government research which requires the new or expanded 
facilities.
    (d) Application of the special use allowance. (1) In negotiating a 
special use allowance--
    (i) Compare the needs of DoD and of the institution for the research 
facility to determine the amount of the special use allowance;
    (ii) Consider rental costs for similar space in the area where the 
research facility is or will be located to establish the annual special 
use allowance;
    (iii) Do not include or allow--
    (A) The costs of land; or
    (B) Interest charges on capital;
    (iv) Do not include maintenance, utilities, or other operational 
costs;
    (v) The period of allowance generally will be--
    (A) At least ten years; or
    (B) A shorter period if the total amount to be allowed is less than 
the construction or acquisition cost for the research facility;
    (vi) Generally, provide for allocation of the special use allowance 
equitably among the Government contracts using the research facility;
    (vii) Special use allowances apply only in the years in which the 
Government has contracts in effect with the institution. However, if in 
any given year there is a reduced level of Government research effort 
which results in the special use allowance being excessive compared to 
the Government research funding, a separate special use allowance may be 
negotiated for that year;
    (viii) Special use allowances may be adjusted for the period before 
construction is complete if the facility is partially occupied and used 
for Government research during that period.
    (2) A special use allowance may be based on either total or partial 
cost of construction or acquisition of the research facility.
    (i) When based on total cost neither the normal use allowance nor 
depreciation will apply--
    (A) During the special use allowance period; and
    (B) After the educational institution has recovered the total 
construction or acquisition cost from the Government or other users.
    (ii) When based on partial cost, normal use allowance and 
depreciation--
    (A) Apply to the balance of costs during the special use allowance 
period to the extent negotiated in the special use allowance agreement; 
and
    (B) Do not apply after the special use allowance period, except for 
normal use allowance applied to the balance.
    (3) During the special use allowance period, the research facility--
    (i) Shall be available for Government research use on a priority 
basis over nongovernment use; and
    (ii) Cannot be put to any significant use other than that which 
justified the special use allowance, unless the head of the contracting 
activity, who approved the special use allowance, consents.
    (4) The Government will pay only an allocable share of the special 
use allowance when the institution makes any substantial use of the 
research facility for parties other than the Government during the 
period when the special use allowance is in effect.
    (5) In no event shall the institution be paid more than the 
acquisition costs.

    (i) Is in response to a broad agency announcement under FAR 
6.102(d)(2);
    (ii) Contains the information required by 235.015-71(d); and
    (iii) Has been recommended for award under the peer or scientific 
review procedures of FAR 6.102(d)(2).
    (2) The contracting officer may award an SFRC under other than full 
and open competition (FAR subpart 6.3) when--
    (i) The proposal is an unsolicited research proposal submitted, 
evaluated, and accepted under FAR subpart 15.5, which meets the criteria 
of FAR 6.302-1; or
    (ii) Award is necessary to establish or maintain an essential 
engineering research or development capability under FAR 6.302-1.
    (3) When a research proposal (solicited or unsolicited) is 
satisfactory to the Government, the contracting officer should accept 
the proposal by executing a SFRC incorporating--
    (i) The proposal by reference, or
    (ii) The statement of work by reference.
    (4) When acceptance of the entire research proposal is not 
advantageous to the Government, the contracting officer should use the 
acceptable parts of the research proposal. These parts may be either 
attached or incorporated by reference to develop a contract for 
execution by both parties. In this event, the contractor must sign the 
SFRC before the Government signs.
    (5) Use the DD Form 2222, Short Form Research Center (SFRC)

costs, if appropriate.
    (7) FAR 35.014 applies to vesting of title in property to 
organizations defined in 235.015-71(b). DD Form 2222 shall identify 
property, title to which is not vested in the contractor, or for which a 
determination of title is deferred.
    (8) The offeror's submission of its proposal under this section 
235.015-71 constitutes the offeror's agreement to be bound by all terms 
and conditions of the resulting contract.
    (f) Advance payments. The contracting officer shall ensure that 
SFRCs awarded to institutions and organizations authorized to receive 
advance payments under FAR subpart 32.4 are clearly marked to read 
``Advance Payment Pool Contract.''
    (g) Method of funding. If incrementally funded, the SFRC shall 
specify--
    (1) The total estimated cost for the full period of the research 
program, both funded and unfunded; and
    (2) The amount of funds currently obligated.
    (h) Uniform contract format. The SFRC is exempt from uniform 
contract format requirements (FAR 15.406).

235.070  Indemnification against unusually hazardous risks.


<R05>
235.070-1  Indemnification under research and development contracts.

    (a) Under 10 U.S.C. 2354 and if authorized by the Secretary 
concerned, or designee under 10 U.S.C. 2356, contracts for research and/
or development may provide for indemnification of the contractor or 
subcontractors for--
    (1) Claims by third persons (including employees) for death, bodily 
injury, or loss of or damage to property; and
    (2) Loss of or damage to the contractor's property to the extent 
that the liability, loss, or damage--
    (i) Results from a risk that the contract defines as ``unusually 
hazardous;''
    (ii) Arises from the direct performance of the contract; and
    (iii) Is not compensated by insurance or other means.
    (b) Clearly define the specific unusually hazardous risks to be 
indemnified. Submit this definition for approval with the request for 
authorization to grant indemnification. Include the approved definition 
in the contract.


<R05>
235.070-2  Indemnification under contracts involving both research and development and other work.

    These contracts may provide for indemnification under the authority 
of both 10 U.S.C. 2354 and Public Law 85-804. Public Law 85-804 will 
apply only to work to which 10 U.S.C. 2354 does not apply. Actions under 
Public Law 85-804 must also comply with FAR subpart 50.4.

offerors that a conventional solicitation will not be issued but that 
the solicitation will appear in a subsequent edition of the Commerce 
Business Daily (CBD). The synopsis must also advise potential offerors 
to provide address information to the office indicated in order to be 
included on the mailing list for any supplemental packages and/or 
amendments.
    (b) Solicitation. The solicitation is published in a second CBD 
notice. The solicitation consists of the information listed at 
235.7006(d)(A.1), including the statement of work, and incorporates by 
reference the appropriate terms and conditions in the format at 
235.7006. FAR 5.207 limits the submissions to the CBD to 12,000 textual 
characters (approximately 3\1/2\ single-spaced pages).
    (c) Supplemental package. Use a supplemental package if the 
solicitation must exceed 3\1/2\ single-spaced pages, or to provide forms 
or other printed material to potential offerors. Send the supplemental 
package on the date the solicitation is published in the CBD to all 
interested parties that provide address information.
    (d) Amendments. Amend the RDSS as set forth at 235.7004-2(f).

            Section B, Supplies or Services and Prices/Costs

    (Use appropriate CLIN structure. Include item descriptions.)
    (B.1) Type of Contract.
    This is a ________________ Contract.
    *(B.2) Estimated Cost. (Use when no fee will be paid)
    The total estimated cost for this contract is $____________
    *(B.3) Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee. (Applicable to fee-bearing contracts)
    The total estimated cost for this contract is $____________
    The total fixed fee for this contract is $ ____________
    *(B.4) Award Fee. (Applicable to award fee-type contracts)
    In addition to the fee set forth elsewhere in the contract, the 
Contractor may earn an award fee up to $______ on the basis of 
performance during the performance periods, and in the amount specified 
in the award fee plan.
    (i) Monitoring of performance. The contractor's performance will be 
monitored continually by the Award Fee Review Board.
    (ii) Award fee plan. This plan provides necessary administrative 
information, including the evaluation criteria and schedule, for the 
purpose of implementing the award fee provision. Upon contract award, 
the Contractor will be provided the award fee plan subject to any 
withholding authorized by the ____________ (insert appropriate 
contracting official).
    (iii) Modification of award fee plan. Before the start of an 
evaluation period, the Government may unilaterally--
    (A) Modify the award fee performance evaluation criteria and areas 
applicable to the evaluation period; and
    (B) Redistribute the remaining award fee dollars among the remaining 
periods. The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor in writing 
of the changes and modify the award fee plan accordingly.
    (iv) The following standards of performance shall be used in 
determining whether and to what extent the Contractor has earned or may 
be entitled to receive any award fee:
    (A) Excellent performance: Contractor performance of virtually all 
contract task requirements is uniformly well above standard and exceeds 
the standard by a substantial

[[Page 285]]

margin in numerous significant tangible or intangible benefits to the 
Government (i.e., improved quality, responsiveness, increased 
timeliness, or generally enhanced effectiveness of operations). There 
are few areas for improvement; these areas are all minor; there are no 
recurring problems; and management has initiated effective corrective 
action whenever needed.
    (B) Very good performance: The contractor's performance of most 
contract task requirements is uniformly well above standard and exceeds 
the standard in many significant areas. Although some areas may require 
improvements these are minor and are more than offset by better 
performance in other areas. Few, if any, recurring deficiencies have 
been noted in the Contractor's performance and the contractor has 
demonstrated/taken satisfactory corrective action. Innovative management 
actions have resulted intangible or in tangible benefits to the 
Government (i.e., improved quality, responsiveness, increased quantity, 
increased timeliness, or generally enhanced effectiveness of 
operations).
    (C) Good performance: Contractor's performance of most contract task 
requirements meets the standard, and it exceeds the standard in several 
significant areas. While the remainder of the contractor's effort 
generally meets contract requirements, areas requiring improvement are 
more than offset by better performance in other areas. Management 
actions taken or initiated have resulted in some demonstrated benefits 
to the Government (i.e., improved quality, responsiveness, timeliness, 
or effectiveness of operations).
    (D) Marginal performance: Contractor performance meets most contract 
standards. Although there are areas of good or better performance, these 
are more or less offset by lower rated performance in other areas. 
Little additional tangible benefit is observable due to contractor 
effort or initiative.
    (E) Submarginal performance: Contractor performance is below 
standard in several areas. Contractor performance in accordance with 
requirements is inconsistent. Quality, responsiveness, timeliness, and/
or economy in many areas require attention and action. Corrective 
actions have not been taken, or are ineffective. Overall submarginal 
performance shall not be given award fee.
    (v) Maximum payable award fee. The maximum payable award fee in any 
evaluation period shall be determined based on the amount set forth in 
the applicable contract line items and a percentage based on the 
Government's evaluation of the Contractor's performance as follows:

                                                                        
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            Percent of maximum award fee
               Performance                            payable           
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excellent................................  __% to __%                   
Very Good................................  __% to __%                   
Good.....................................  __% to __%                   
Marginal.................................  __% to __%                   
Submarginal..............................  0%                           
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (vi) Self-evaluation. The Contractor may submit to the Contracting 
Officer within five working days after the end of each award fee 
evaluation period, a brief written self-evaluation of its performance 
for the period. This statement may contain information which may be used 
to assist the Award Fee Review Board in its evaluation of the 
Contractor's performance during the period.
    (vii) Disputes. The decision of the Fee Determining Official on the 
amount of award fee will not be subject to the ``Disputes'' clause.
    (viii) Award fee payment.
    (A) As determined by the Fee Determining Official, payment of any 
award fee will not be subject to the ``Allowable Cost and Payment'' and 
``Termination (Cost Reimbursement)'' clauses of this contract.
    (B) The Contractor may submit vouchers for the award fee immediately 
upon receipt of the Contracting Officer's written award fee 
notification.
    *(B.5) Target Cost and Fee. (Applicable to incentive fee-type 
contracts. The following information shall be inserted into the 
appropriate blanks in clause I.54.) The target cost is $__________.
    The target fee is $__________.
    The minimum fee the contractor may receive is $__________.
    The maximum fee the contractor may receive is $__________.
    Share ratio:________________.
(Government/Contractor)
    *(B.6) Payment of Fixed Fee on Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (Completion) 
Contracts. The fixed fee shall be paid in monthly installments based 
upon the percentage of completion of work as determined by the 
Administrative Contracting Officer, subject to the withholding 
provisions of the contract.
    *(B.7) Payment of Fixed Fee on Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (Term) Contracts. 
(Applicable to cost-plus-fixed-fee (term) contracts when the clause at 
FAR 52.216-8 is used.) Pursuant to the clause at FAR 52.216-8, Fixed 
Fee, and subject to withholding provisions contained in that clause or 
elsewhere in this contract, fixed fee shall be paid to the Contractor 
based upon the percentage of hours completed as related to the total 
hours set forth in the contract on each voucher. The Contractor shall 
certify to the level of effort expended during that period. The 
Government technical representative shall sign a statement on the 
certificate that the work performed during the period has been performed 
satisfactorily.

[[Page 286]]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
* The 50-page cost proposal is a goal not a limit. The Contractor may   
  use additional pages if necessary to comply with public law.          

    (B) Any technical proposal pages submitted that exceed the page 
limitations set forth in paragraph (i)(A) of this subsection L.102 will 
not be read or evaluated. Proposal pages failing to meet the format in 
paragraph (i)(D) of this subsection L.102 will not be read or evaluated.
    (C) No program cost data or cross-reference to the cost proposal 
will be included in any other volume.
    (D) Format of the proposal volumes shall be as follows:
    (1) Proposals will be prepared on 8\1/2\ x 11 inch paper except for 
foldouts used for charts, tables, or diagrams, which may not exceed 11 x 
17 inches. Foldouts will not be used for text. Pages will have a one 
inch margin.
    (2) A page is defined as one face of a sheet of paper containing 
information. Two pages may be printed on one sheet.
    (3) Type size will be no smaller than 10 point character height 
(vertical size) and no more than an average of 12 characters per inch. 
Use of type-setting techniques to reduce type size below 10 points or to 
increase characters beyond 12 per inch is not permitted. Such techniques 
are construed as a deliberate attempt to circumvent the intent of page 
limitations set forth in paragraph (i)(A) of this subsection L.102.
    (4) Proposal must lie flat when open; elaborate binding is not 
desirable.
    (5) No models, mockups, or video tapes will be accepted.
    (6) Technical proposals will be prepared in the same sequence as the 
statement of work.
    (ii) Content.
    All proposals must be complete and respond directly to the 
requirements of the solicitation. The factors and subfactors listed in 
Section M of the solicitation shall be addressed. Cost and supporting 
data shall be included only in the cost volume. All other information 
shall be included in the technical volume.
    (L.103) The Government may make multiple awards resulting from this 
solicitation.

                 Section M, Evaluation Factors for Award

    Use of the standard evaluation factors is preferred. If the standard 
evaluation factors are modified in any way, the modifications must be 
clearly expressed so that the result is unambiguous. Additions to and 
deletions from the contents of this Section M must be clearly annotated 
in the solicitation summary (see 235.7006(d)(A.1)(vii)).
    *(M.1) FAR 52.217-5 Evaluation of Options (Applicable if the 
solicitation indicates that options are anticipated in the resulting 
contract. When this provision is included, evaluation criteria for 
options shall be included in Section M.)
    *(M.2) Proposal Evaluation Procedures and Basis for Award. Proposals 
will be evaluated and award made as follows:
    (i) Basis for award.
    The award decision will be based on evaluation of all factors and 
subfactors set forth in this solicitation. The Government may select the 
source whose proposal offers the greatest value to the Government in 
terms of technical, cost or price, and other factors set forth in the 
solicitation. The source selected may or may not have the lowest 
proposed total costs.
    (ii) Evaluation factors.
    Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the following 
factors. The technical factor is more important than the cost factor. 
The technical subfactors are in descending order of importance unless 
otherwise stated in the solicitation. The cost subfactors are of equal 
weight.
    (A) Technical.
    (1) Technical approach. The soundness of the offeror's technical 
approach, including the offeror's demonstrated understanding of the 
technical requirement.

contractors that have a reasonable chance of being selected for award. 
The central data base will provide--
    (1) Overall current performance ratings;
    (2) Descriptions of contracts on which ratings are based (e.g., type 
of facility, contract value, applicable performance elements); and
    (3) A telephone number to obtain transcripts and documentation of 
pertinent evaluation details.
    (B) Consider using the performance records in the data base for 
lower value contracts and to assess a contractor's performance record 
for reasons other than an award decision, such as subcontractor approval 
and awards for excellence.
[56 FR 36421, July 31, 1991, as amended at 61 FR 7749, Feb. 29, 1996]

[61 FR 7749, Feb. 29, 1996]


<R05>
236.272  Prequalification of sources.

    (a) Prequalification procedures may be used when necessary to ensure 
timely and efficient performance of critical construction projects. 
Prequalification--
    (1) Results in a list of sources determined to be qualified to 
perform a specific construction contract; and
    (2) Limits offerors to those with proven competence to perform in 
the required manner.
    (b) The head of the contracting activity must--
    (1) Authorize the use of prequalification by determining, in 
writing, that a construction project is of an urgency or complexity that 
requires prequalification; and
    (2) Approve the prequalification procedures.
    (c) For small businesses, the prequalification procedures must 
require the qualifying authority to--
    (1) Request a preliminary recommendation from the appropriate Small 
Business Administration regional office, if the qualifying authority 
believes a small business is not responsible;
    (2) Permit the small business to submit a bid or proposal if the 
preliminary recommendation is that the small business is responsible; 
and
    (3) Follow the procedures in FAR 19.6, if the small business is in 
line for award and is found nonresponsible.


<R05>
236.273  Network analysis systems.

    Use head of the contracting activity approved procedures for 
preparing and using network analysis systems, whether contractor 
prepared, or Government prepared.


<R05>
236.274  Construction in foreign countries.

    (a) In accordance with Section 112 of Public Law 104-32 and similar 
sections in subsequent military construction appropriations acts, 
military construction contracts that are estimated to exceed $1,000,000 
and are to be performed in the United States territories and possessions 
in the Pacific and on Kwajalein Atoll, or in countries bordering the 
Arabian Gulf, shall be awarded only to United States firms, unless the 
lowest responsive and responsible offer of a United States firm exceeds 
the lowest responsive and responsible offer of a foreign firm by more 
than 20 percent.
    (b)When a technical working agreement with a foreign government is 
required for a construction contract--
    (1) Consider inviting the Army Office of the Chief of Engineers, or 
the Naval Facilities Engineering Command to participate in the 
negotiations.
    (2) The agreement should, as feasible and where not otherwise 
provided for in other agreements, cover all elements necessary for the 
construction that are required by laws, regulations, and customs of the 
United States and the foreign government, including--
    (i) Acquisition of all necessary rights;
    (ii) Expeditious, duty-free importation of labor, material, and 
equipment;
    (iii) Payment of taxes applicable to contractors, personnel, 
materials, and equipment;

<R05>
236.303  Invitations for bids.


<R05>
236.303-70  Additive or deductive items.

    (a) If it appears that sufficient funds may not be available for all 
the desired

[[Page 298]]

construction features, consider using a bid schedule with--
    (1) A first or base bid item covering the work generally as 
specified; and
    (2) A list of priorities that contains one or more additive or 
deductive bid items which progressively add or omit specified features 
of the work in a stated order of priority. (Normally, do not mix 
additive and deductive bid items in the same solicitation.)
    (b) Before opening the bids, record in the contract file the amount 
of funds available for the project.
    (c) Determine the low bidder and the bid items to be awarded as 
follows--
    (1) Use the recorded amount of available funds to determine the low 
bidder, which will be the bidder that--
    (i) Is otherwise eligible for award; and
    (ii) Offers the lowest aggregate amount for the first or base bid 
item, plus or minus (in order of listed priority), those additive or 
deductive bid items that provide the most features within the funds 
available.
    (2) Evaluate all bids, including those using the procedures in 
219.7203, on the basis of the same additive or deductive bid items.
    (i) If adding another item from the bid schedule list of priorities 
would make the award exceed the available funds, skip that item and go 
to the next item from the list of priorities.
    (ii) Add the next item if an award can be made that includes the 
item and is still within the available funds.
    (3) Use the list of priorities only to determine the low bidder. 
After determining the low bidder, an award may be made on any 
combination if--
    (i) It is in the best interests of the Government;
    (ii) Funds are available at time of award; and
    (iii) The low bidder's price for the combination is less than the 
price offered by any other responsive, responsible bidder.

    (1) For cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts, negotiate the fee for a prime 
contractor using departmental procedures approved by the Assistant 
Secretary of Defense (Production and Logistics).
    (2) For cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts, negotiate the target fee 
for a prime contractor using the criteria and fee schedule in 
departmental procedures to determine--
    (i) The reasonableness of the target cost;
    (ii) The maximum and minimum fees to be established; and
    (iii) The fee adjustment formula.


<R04>
                     Subpart 236.5--Contract Clauses


<R05>
236.570  Additional provisions and clauses.

    (a) Use the following clauses in all fixed-price construction 
solicitations and contracts--
    (1) 252.236-7000, Modification Proposals-Price Breakdown; and
    (2) 252.236-7001, Contract Drawings, Maps, and Specifications.
    (b) Use the following provisions and clauses in fixed-price 
construction contracts and solicitations as applicable--
    (1) 252.236-7002, Obstruction of Navigable Waterways, when the 
contract will involve work near or on navigable waterways.
    (2) When the head of the contracting activity has approved use of a 
separate bid item for mobilization and preparatory work, use either--
    (i) 252.236-7003, Payment for Mobilization and Preparatory Work. Use 
this clause for major construction contracts that require--
    (A) Major or special items of plant and equipment; or
    (B) Large stockpiles of material which are in excess of the type, 
kind, and quantity which would be normal for a contractor qualified to 
undertake the work; or
    (ii) 252.236-7004, Payment for Mobilization and Demobilization. Use 
this

[[Page 299]]

clause for contracts involving major mobilization expense, or plant 
equipment and material (other than the situations covered in paragraph 
(b)(2)(i) of this section) made necessary by the location or nature of 
the work.
    (A) Generally, allocate 60 percent of the lump sum price in 
paragraph (a) of the clause to the cost of mobilization.
    (B) Vary this percentage to reflect the circumstances of the 
particular contract, but in no event should mobilization exceed 80 
percent of the payment item.
    (3) 252.236-7005, Airfield Safety Precautions, when construction 
will be performed on or near airfields.
    (4) 252.236-7006, Cost Limitation, if the solicitation's bid

limitations, and if a waiver has not been granted (FAR 36.205).
    (5) 252.236-7007, Additive or Deductive Items, if the procedures in 
236.303-70 are being used.
    (6) 252.236-7008, Contract Prices--Bidding Schedule, if the contract 
will contain only unit prices for some items.
    (c) Use the provision at 252.236-7010, Overseas Military 
Construction-Preference for United States Firms, in solicitations for 
military construction contracts that are estimated to exceed $1,000,000 
and are to be performed in the United States territories and possessions 
in the Pacific and on Kwajalein Atoll, or in countries bordering the 
Arabian Gulf.
    (d) Also see 246.710(4) for an additional clause applicable to 
construction contracts to be performed in Germany.

               Subpart 236.6--Architect-Engineer Services


<R05>
236.601  Policy.

    (1) 10 U.S.C. 2807(b) requires notice to Congress 21 days before the 
initial obligation of funds if a contract is for--
    (i) A-E services or construction design for military construction, 
military family housing, or restoration or replacement of damaged or 
destroyed facilities; and
    (ii) An estimated total contract price of $300,000 or more.
    (2) During the 21 day period, synopsis of the proposed contract 
action and administrative actions leading to the award may be started.


<R05>
236.602  Selection of firms for architect-engineer contracts.


<R05>
236.602-1  Selection criteria.

    (a)(i) Establish the evaluation criteria before making the public 
announcement required by FAR 5.205(c) and include the criteria and their 
relative order of importance in the announcement. The evaluation 
criteria should be project specific. Use the information in the DD Form 
1391, FY---- Military Construction Project Data, when available, and 
other pertinent project data in preparing the evaluation criteria.
    (4) Use performance evaluation data from the central data base 
identified in 236.201.
    (6) The primary factor in A-E selection is the determination of the 
most highly qualified firm. Also consider secondary factors such as 
geographic proximity and equitable distribution of work, but do not 
attribute greater significance to the secondary factors than to 
qualifications and past performance. Do not reject the overall most 
highly qualified firm solely in the interest of equitable distribution 
of contracts.
    (A) Consider the volume of work awarded by DoD during the previous 
12 months. In considering equitable distribution of work among A-E 
firms, include small and small disadvantaged business firms and firms 
that have not had prior DoD contracts--
    (1) Use data extracted from the Defense Contract Action Data System 
(DCADS) compiled from DD Form 350, Individual Contracting Action Report. 
DCADS data may be obtained from the central data base identified in 
236.201(c)(1).
    (2) Do not consider awards to overseas offices for projects outside 
the United States, its territories and possessions. Do not consider 
awards to a subsidiary if the subsidiary is not normally subject to 
management decisions, bookkeeping, and policies of a

[[Page 300]]

holding or parent company or an incorporated subsidiary that operates 
under a firm name different from the parent company. This allows greater 
competition.
    (B) Consider as appropriate superior performance evaluations on 
recently completed DoD contracts.
    (C) Consider the extent to which potential contractors identify and 
commit to small business and to small disadvantaged business, 
historically black college and university, or minority institution 
performance of the contract, whether as a joint venture, teaming 
arrangement, or subcontractor.
[56 FR 36421, July 31, 1991, as amended at 59 FR 27673, May 27, 1994]


<R05>
236.602-2  Evaluation boards.

    (a) Preselection boards are authorized, if the lists they develop 
are approved by the head of the construction activity. If used, 
preselection boards will--
    (i) Be formally constituted;
    (ii) Consist of at least three members; and
    (iii) Prepare a preselection list of the maximum practicable number 
of qualified firms using data described in FAR 36.603, and any other 
pertinent information.


<R05>
236.602-4  Selection authority.

    (a)(i) The following selections require special approval--
    (A) The estimated contract price exceeds $500,000;
    (B) The firm to be selected has already been awarded contracts 
totaling over $500,000 during the current calendar year by the 
construction activity; or
    (C) Supplemental work added to an existing contract causes the total 
contract price to exceed $500,000. Special approval is not, however, 
required for supplemental work added to a contract under the clause at 
FAR 52.243-1, Changes-Fixed Price.
    (ii) Special approval means approval by the next higher 
organizational level above the construction activity or as established 
in contracting activity procedures and must be obtained prior to 
negotiation with the A-E firm.
    (c) A finding that some of the firms on the selection report are 
unqualified does not preclude approval of the report, provided that a 
minimum of three firms remains. The reasons for finding a firm or firms 
unqualified must be recorded.


<R05>
236.602-70  Restriction on award of overseas architect-engineer contracts to foreign firms.

    In accordance with Section 111 of Public Law 104-32 and similar 
sections in subsequent military construction appropriations acts, A-E 
contracts funded by military construction appropriations that are 
estimated to exceed $500,000 and are to be performed in Japan, in any 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization member country, or in countries 
bordering the Arabian Gulf, shall be awarded only to United States firms 
or to joint ventures of United States and host nation firms.
[62 FR 2858, Jan. 17, 1997]


<R05>
236.604  Performance evaluation.

    (a) Preparation of performance reports. Use DD Form 2631, 
Performance Evaluation (Architect-Engineer), instead of SF 1421.
    (2) Prepare a separate performance evaluation after actual 
construction of the project. Ordinarily, the evaluating official should 
be the person most familiar with the A-E's performance.
    (c) Distribution and use of performance reports.
    (i) Forward each performance report to the central data base 
identified in 236.201(c) after completing the review. The procedures in 
236.201 also apply to A-E contracts.
    (ii) File and use the SF 1421, Performance Evaluation (Architect-
Engineer), in a manner similar to the SF 254, Architect-Engineer and 
Related Services Questionnaire.

236.606  Negotiations.


<R05>
236.606-70  Statutory fee limitation.

    (a) 10 U.S.C. 4540, 7212, and 9540 limit the contract price (or fee) 
for A-E services for the preparation of designs, plans, drawings, and 
specifications to six percent of the project's estimated construction 
cost.

[[Page 301]]

    (b) The six percent limit also applies to contract modifications, 
including modifications involving--
    (1) Work not initially included in the contract. Apply the six 
percent limit to the revised total estimated construction cost.
    (2) Redesign. Apply the six percent limit as follows--
    (i) Add the estimated construction cost of the redesign features to 
the original estimated construction cost;
    (ii) Add the contract cost for the original design to the contract 
cost for redesign; and
    (iii) Divide the total contract design cost by the total estimated 
construction cost. The resulting percentage may not exceed the six 
percent statutory limitation.

237.102-70  Prohibition on contracting for firefighting or security-guard functions.

    (a) Under 10 U.S.C. 2465, the DoD is prohibited for entering into 
contracts for the performance of firefighting or security-guard 
functions at any military installation or facility unless--
    (1) The contract is to be carried out at a location outside the 
United States (to include any U.S. commonwealth, territory, or 
possession) at which members of the armed forces would have to be used 
for the performance of firefighting or security-guard functions at the 
expense of unit readiness;
    (2) The contract will be carried out on a Government-owned but 
privately operated installation; or
    (3) The contract (or renewal of a contract) is for the performance 
of a function under contract on September 24, 1983.
    (b) Under Section 2907 of Public Law 103-160, this prohibition does 
not apply to services at installations being closed (see subpart 
237.74).

<R05>
237.104  Personal services contracts.

    (b)(i) Authorization to acquire the personal services of experts and 
consultants is included in Public Law 101-165, section 9002. Personal 
service contracts for expert and consultant services must also be 
authorized by a determination and findings (D&F) in accordance with 
department/agency regulations.
    (A) Generally, the D&F should authorize one contract at a time; 
however, an authorizing official may issue a blanket D&F for classes of 
contracts.
    (B) Prepare each D&F in accordance with FAR 1.7 and include a 
determination that--
    (1) The duties are of a temporary or intermittent nature;
    (2) Acquisition of the services is advantageous to the national 
defense;
    (3) DoD personnel with necessary skills are not available;
    (4) Excepted appointment cannot be obtained;
    (5) A nonpersonal services contract is not practicable;
    (6) Statutory authority, 5 U.S.C. 3109 and other legislation, apply; 
and
    (7) Any other determination required by statues has been made.
    (ii) Personal services contracts for health care are authorized by 
10 U.S.C. 1091.
    (A) This authority may be used to acquire--
    (1) Direct health care services provided in medical treatment 
facilities; and
    (2) Services of clinical counselors, family advocacy program staff, 
and victim's services representatives to members of the Armed Forces and 
covered beneficiaries who require such services, provided in medical 
treatment facilities or elsewhere. Persons

[[Page 303]]

with whom a personal services contract may be entered into under this 
authority include clinical social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, 
and other comparable professionals who have advanced degrees in 
counseling or related academic disciplines and who meet all requirements 
for State licensure and board certification requirements, if any, within 
their fields of specialization.
    (B) Sources for personal services contracts with individuals under 
the authority of 10 U.S.C. 1091 shall be selected through the procedures 
in this section. These procedures do not apply to contracts awarded to 
business entities other than individuals. Selections made using the 
procedures in this section are exempt by statute from FAR part 6 
competition requirements (see 206.001(b)).
    (C) Approval requirements for--
    (1) Direct health care personal service contracts (see 
237.104(b)(ii)(A)(1)) and a pay cap are in DoDI 6025.5, Personal 
Services Contracting Authority for Direct Health Care Providers. 
Requests to enter into a personal service contract for direct health 
care services must be approved by the commander of the medical/dental 
treatment facility where the services will be performed.
    (2) Services of clinical counselors, family advocacy program staff, 
and victim's services representatives (see 237.104(b)(ii)(A)(2)), shall 
be in accordance with agency procedures.
    (D) The contracting officer must ensure that the requiring activity 
provides a copy of the approval with the purchase request.
    (E) The contracting officer must provide adequate advance notice of 
contracting opportunities to individuals residing in the area of the 
facility. The notice must include the qualification criteria against 
which individuals responding will be evaluated. The contracting officer 
shall solicit applicants through at least one local publication which 
serves the area of the facility. Acquisitions under this section for 
personal service contracts are exempt from the posting and synopsis 
requirements of FAR part 5.
    (F) The contracting officer shall provide the qualifications of 
individuals responding to the notice to the commander of the facility 
for evaluation and ranking in accordance with agency procedures. 
Individuals must be considered solely on the basis of the professional 
qualifications established for the particular personal services being 
acquired and the Government's estimate of reasonable rates, fees, or 
other costs. The commander of the facility shall provide the contracting 
officer with rationale for the ranking of individuals, consistent with 
the required qualifications.
    (G) Upon receipt from the facility of the ranked listing of 
applicants, the contracting officer shall either--
    (1) Enter into negotiations with the highest ranked applicant. If a 
mutually satisfactory contract cannot be negotiated, the contracting 
officer shall terminate negotiations with the highest ranked applicant 
and enter into negotiations with the next highest.
    (2) Enter into negotiations with all qualified applicants and select 
on the basis of qualifications and rates, fees, or other costs.
    (H) In the event only one individual responds to an advertised 
requirement, the contracting officer is authorized to negotiate the 
contract award. In this case, the individual must still meet the minimum 
qualifications of the requirement and the contracting officer must be 
able to make a determination that the price is fair and reasonable.
    (I) If a fair and reasonable price cannot be obtained from a 
qualified individual, the requirement should be canceled and acquired 
using procedures other than those set forth in this section.
    (f)(i) Payment to each expert or consultant for personal services 
under 5 U.S.C. 3109 shall not exceed the highest rate fixed by the 
Classification Act Schedules for grade GS-15, except the following which 
shall not exceed the highest rate payable to a GS-18--
    (A) Professional engineering services primarily involving research 
and development; or
    (B) Professional services involving physical sciences, natural 
sciences, or medicine.
    (ii) The contract may provide for the same per diem and travel 
expenses authorized for a Government employee, including actual 
transportation and

[[Page 304]]

per diem in lieu of subsistence for travel between home or place of 
business and official duty station.
    (iii) Coordinate with the civilian personnel office on benefits, 
taxes, personnel ceilings, and maintenance of records.

    (a) Ordering procedures for master agreements are the same as for 
basic ordering agreements, except that requests for proposals for

sources (FAR subpart 6.2).
    (b) Before placing an order under a master agreement, the 
contracting officer--

to be performed;
    (4) Shall accept the offer most advantageous to the Government,

year by any contracting activity (as defined in 202.101) shall not 
exceed 30 percent of the value of all contracts for advisory and 
assistance services awarded by that activity during fiscal year 1989. 
This limitation may be increased from 30 percent to not more than 50 
percent if--
    (a) The head of the contracting activity (HCA) waives the 30 percent 
limitation. Each waiver shall be in the form of a determination and 
finding prepared and processed in accordance with department/agency 
procedures. The determination and finding must specify that the use of 
master agreements is necessary to further the policy of acquiring 
advisory and assistance services on the basis of the task to be 
performed rather than on the basis of the number of hours provided; and
    (b) The agency publishes a notice of the waiver in the Federal 
Register and 60 days have passed since the notice of the HCA waiver 
appeared in the Federal Register. Federal Register notices shall be 
forwarded for publication in accordance with agency procedures.


<R05>
237.270-4  Reporting requirements.

    (a) Each department and agency shall provide an annual report to 
OSD, ATTN: OUSD(A)DP(CPA), not later than November 15 of each year. The

(by contractor) and dollar value of each (including modifications); and
    (3) The period covered by the report.
    (b) Each department and agency shall centrally maintain the 
following information, for all master agreements expected to involve 
work in excess of $2 million (including modifications), on a fiscal year 
basis--
    (1) The number of bid protests filed, number sustained, and number 
of awards terminated during the competition for master agreements and 
task orders;
    (2) The program's effect on the procurement administrative leadtime 
for CAAS;
    (3) Statements of work describing the services contracted for and 
the source evaluation criteria used to evaluate proposals for award;
    (4) The level of small business participation in the program; and
    (5) The number of contracts where a contractor certified that a 
conflict of interest exists under the regulations implementing section 
8141 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY89, the nature of 
the conflict of interest, and the steps taken to resolve such conflicts 
of interest among firms that qualify for master agreements.


<R04>
                    Subpart 237.70--Mortuary Services


<R05>
237.7000  Scope.

    This subpart contains acquisition procedures for contracts for 
mortuary services (the care of remains) for military personnel within 
the U.S. Departments/agencies may use these procedures as guidance in 
areas outside the U.S. for both deceased military and civilian 
personnel.


<R05>
237.7001  Method of acquisition.

    (a) Requirements type contract. By agreement among the military 
activities, one activity in each geographical area will contract for the 
estimated requirements for the care of remains for all military 
activities in the area. Use a requirements type contract (see FAR 
16.503) when the estimated annual requirements for the activities in the 
area are ten or more.
    (b) Purchase order. Where no contract exists, use DD Form 1155, 
Order for Supplies and Services/Request for Quotations, to obtain 
mortuary services.


<R05>
237.7002  Area of performance.

    Determine and define the geographical area to be covered by the 
contract using the following general guidelines--
    (a) Use political boundaries, streets, or other features as 
demarcation lines.
    (b) The size should be roughly equivalent to the contiguous 
metropolitan or municipal area enlarged to include the activities 
served.
    (c) If the area of performance best suited to the needs of a 
particular contract is not large enough to include a carrier terminal 
commonly used by people within such area, the contract area of 
performance shall specifically state that it includes such terminal as a 
pickup or delivery point.


<R05>
237.7003  Distribution of contracts.

    In addition to normal contract distribution, send three copies of 
each contract to each activity authorized to use the contract, and two 
copies to each of the following--
    (a) HQDA (TAPC-PEC-D), Alexandria, VA 22331.
    (b) Commander, Naval Medical Command, Department of the Navy (MED 
3141), 23rd and E Streets, NW, Washington, DC 20372.

    (b) The Contractor shall not establish any tuition or fees which

the Contractor's standard procedures for any students in effect on the

Contractor may provide nominal compensation for part-time service. Base 
the compensation on the Contractor's practices and procedures for other 
students of similar accomplishment in that department or field. The

presented for payment for any period in which the student performed the 
part-time teaching service.

the right, at its option, to continue to receive educational services 
for those students already enrolled in the contractor's institution 
under this agreement until such time that the students complete their 
courses or curricula or the Government withdraws them from the 
Contractor's institution. The terms and conditions of this agreement in 
effect on the effective date of the termination shall continue to apply 
to such students remaining in the Contractor's institution.
    (b) Withdrawal of students under Schedule provision 4 shall not be 
considered a termination within the meaning of this provision 7.
    (c) Termination by either party shall not be the basis for any

239.7000  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart contains unique DoD procedures for the exchange or sale 
of information technology using the exchange authority of the General 
Services Administration (GSA). This subpart only applies to items with 
an original acquisition cost of $1,000,000 or more.


<R05>
239.7001  Policy.

    Agencies should consider exchange/sale when replacing Government-
owned information technology. Exchange/sale is a method of--
    (a) Transferring the equipment to be replaced to--
    (1) Another Government agency, with reimbursement (sale); or
    (2) The supplier of the replacement information technology for a 
trade-in allowance (exchange).
    (b) Applying the proceeds of sale or the exchange allowance toward 
the purchase of replacement information technology.


<R05>
239.7002  Conditions for using exchange/sale.

    (a) The requiring activity must make a written determination that--
    (1) The trade-in allowance of the exchange or the proceeds of the 
sale will be applied to acquire the replacement information technology; 
and
    (2) The exchange/sale transaction will foster the economic and 
efficient accomplishment of a continuing requirement.
    (b) The replacement equipment must be information technology--
    (1) Similar to the resource being sold or exchanged;
    (2) Which will satisfy the continuing requirement currently met by 
the resource being replaced.


<R05>
239.7003  Procedures.

    (a) Comply with--
    (1) This subpart;
    (2) Subpart 217.70; and
    (3) The Defense Automation Resources Management Manual.
    (b) Solicit offers both on an exchange (trade-in for allowance) or 
no exchange (no trade-in) basis.
    (c) Retain the option to exercise any exchange offer at the time of 
award.
    (d) List and describe the information technology to be exchanged in 
the solicitation. At a minimum include--
    (1) A brief description of each item;
    (2) Name of manufacturer;
    (3) Equipment type;
    (4) Model number; and
    (5) The condition code and explanation of the code.
    (e) Allow sufficient time in the contracting schedule to permit 
screening within the Government of the information technology to be 
exchanged prior to contract award.
    (f) Immediately upon receipt of offers, determine the highest 
exchange offer (if any) and use it to initiate screening under the 
Defense Automation Resources Management Manual.
    (1) Send an SF 120, Report of Excess Personal Property, to the 
Defense Information Systems Agency, Chief Information Officer, Defense 
Automation Resources Management Program Division, Attn: D03D, 701 South 
Courthouse Road, Arlington, VA 22204-2199. Prominently display the 
following note on the original and five copies of the SF 120:

[[Page 315]]

                       Exchange/``Sale'' Property

    A written administrative determination has been (will be) made to 
apply the exchange allowance or proceeds of ``sale'' to the acquisition 
of similar items.

    (2) Include the following additional information with the SF 120:
    (i) The identity of the offeror of the exchange;
    (ii) The type of replacement equipment;
    (iii) The acquisition method for the replacement equipment;
    (iv) The anticipated purchase price for the replacement equipment; 
and
    (v) The name and telephone number of the contracting officer.
    (g) Evaluate offers using the solicitation criteria, including 
consideration of any exchange allowance offers. Award can be made 
whether or not the replaced information technology is exchanged.
    (h) Before a contract is awarded, consider the results of the 
screening. Do not make an exchange if another Government agency wants to 
acquire the replaced equipment.
    (1) If another agency is going to acquire the replaced equipment, do 
not include the exchange allowance in the contract price.
    (2) The actual sale price to the agency acquiring the replaced 
equipment will be the exchange allowance (if any) of the successful 
offeror.
    (i) If no Government agency wants to acquire the replaced equipment, 
the contract price shall include the exchange allowance, if any.
    (j) If no exchange allowance was offered by the successful 
contractor, see the Defense Automation Resources Management Manual for 
disposal instructions.

               Subpart 239.74--Telecommunications Services


<R05>
239.7400  Scope.

    This subpart prescribes policy and procedures for acquisition of 
telecommunications services and maintenance of telecommunications 
security. Telecommunications services may also meet the definition of 
information technology.
[62 FR 1060, Jan. 8, 1997]


<R05>
239.7401  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart--
    (a) Common carrier means any entity engaged in the business of 
providing telecommunications services which are regulated by the Federal 
Communications Commission or other governmental body.
    (b) Foreign carrier means any person, partnership, association, 
joint-stock company, trust, governmental body, or corporation not 
subject to regulation by a U.S. governmental regulatory body and not 
doing business as a citizen of the United States, providing 
telecommunications services outside the territorial limits of the United 
States.
    (c) Governmental regulatory body means the Federal Communications 
Commission, any statewide regulatory

[[Page 318]]

body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating 
under the State authority. The following are not ``governmental 
regulatory bodies''--
    (1) Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial 
appeal; and
    (2) Regulatory bodies which regulate a company owned by the same 
entity which creates the regulatory body.
    (d) Noncommon carrier means any entity other than a common carrier 
offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for 
lease.
    (e) Security, sensitive information, and telecommunications systems 
have the meaning given in the clause at 252.239-7016, Telecommunications 
Security Equipment, Devices, Techniques, and Services.
    (f) Telecommunications means the transmission, emission, or 
reception of signals, signs, writing, images, sounds, or intelligence of 
any nature, by wire, cable, satellite, fiber optics, laser, radio, or 
any other electronic, electric, electromagnetic, or acoustically coupled 
means.
    (g) Telecommunications services means the services acquired, whether 
by lease or contract, to meet the Government's telecommunications needs. 
The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment 
necessary to provide such services.


<R05>
239.7402  Policy.

    (a) Acquisition. (1) DoD policy is to acquire telecommunications 
services from common and noncommon telecommunications carriers--
    (i) On a competitive basis, except when acquisition using other than 
full and open competition is justified.
    (ii) Recognizing the regulations, practices, and decisions of the 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and other governmental 
regulatory bodies on rates, cost principles, and accounting practices;
    (iii) Making provision in telecommunications services contracts for 
adoption of--
    (A) FCC approved practices; or
    (B) The generally accepted practices of the industry on those issues 
concerning common carrier services where--
    (1) The governmental regulatory body has not expressed itself;
    (2) The governmental regulatory body has declined jurisdiction; or
    (3) There is no governmental regulatory body to decide.
    (2) DoD's unique consumer needs in both volume and technology 
require DoD to participate actively in the rule making process of 
cognizant governmental regulatory bodies. DoD also must work with the 
government regulatory bodies and common carriers to be sure that in 
those areas in which the FCC cannot or will not rule, sound regulatory 
practices are followed. DoD should make every effort to avoid the time 
and expense of litigation by full and fair disclosure of both the 
carrier's and the DoD's position in advance.
    (3) If actions do not produce reasonable or lawful rates, or when 
there is a refusal to provide required services or file appropriate 
tariffs, DoD should litigate. All contracts with the regulatory bodies 
should be through counsel under department/agency and Defense 
Information Systems Agency procedures.
    (b) Security. (1) The contracting officer shall ensure, in 
accordance with agency procedures, that purchase requests identify--
    (i) The nature and extent of information requiring security during 
telecommunications;
    (ii) The requirement for the contractor to secure telecommunications 
systems;
    (iii) The telecommunications security equipment, devices, 
techniques, or services with which the contractor's telecommunications 
security equipment, devices, techniques, or services must be 
interoperable; and
    (iv) The approved telecommunications security equipment, devices, 
techniques, or services, such as found in the National Security Agency's 
Information Systems Security Products and Services Catalogue.
    (2) Contractors and subcontractors shall provide all 
telecommunications security techniques or services required for 
performance of Government contracts.
    (3) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this subsection, 
contractors

[[Page 319]]

and subcontractors shall normally provide all required 
telecommunications security equipment or devices as plant equipment in 
accordance with FAR part 45. In some cases, such as for communications 
security (COMSEC) equipment designated as controlled cryptographic item 
(CCI), contractors or subcontractors must also meet ownership 
eligibility conditions.
    (4) When the contractor or subcontractor does not meet ownership 
eligibility conditions, the head of the agency may authorize provision 
of the necessary facilities as Government-furnished property or 
acquisition as contractor-acquired property, as long as conditions of 
FAR 45.303 are met.
[56 FR 36429, July 31, 1991, as amended at 56 FR 67220, Dec. 30, 1991; 
62 FR 1060, Jan. 8, 1997]


<R05>
239.7403  Regulatory bodies.

    The FCC and other governmental regulatory bodies publish rules and 
regulations on the operations of common carriers and prescribe 
accounting principles to use to establish rates.


<R05>
239.7404  Foreign carriers.

    (a) Frequently, foreign carriers are owned by the government of the 
country in which they operate. The foreign governments often prescribe 
the methods of doing business. In many countries, an international 
agreement with the host country sets guidelines for acquiring 
communication services. In some countries, a corporate subsidiary of a 
carrier not indigenous to the country (often a U.S. parent) is the sole 
source for telecommunications services.
    (b) Contracts for telecommunications services in foreign countries 
should describe rates and practices in as much detail as possible. It is 
DoD policy not to pay discriminatory rates. DoD should pay a reasonable 
rate for telecommunications services or the rate charged the military of 
that country, whichever is less.
    (c) Refer special problems with telecommunications acquisition in 
foreign countries to higher headquarters for resolution with appropriate 
State Department representatives.


<R05>
239.7405  Authority to contract for telecommunications services.

    (a) The General Services Administration (GSA) has exclusive 
procurement authority for telecommunications services that meet the 
definition of Federal information processing resources in FIRMR 201-4 
and that meet the applicability criteria in FIRMR 201-1. However, GSA 
may authorize agencies to contract for telecommunications services in 
certain instances under a delegation of GSA's exclusive procurement 
authority (see FIRMR 201-20.305).
    (b) Under FIRMR 201-20.306, GSA authorizes the senior information 
resources management (IRM) officials of each military department and the 
senior IRM official of DoD to enter into multiyear contracts for 
telecommunications services under certain conditions. Contracting 
activities may enter into multiyear contracts for telecommunications 
services if--
    (1) The senior IRM official has redelegated to the contracting 
office, GSA's exclusive procurement authority for FIP sources;
    (2) The contract life, including options, does not exceed ten years; 
and
    (3) The contracting activity complies with OMB budget and accounting 
procedures relating to appropriated funds.
    (c) The senior IRM officials are--
    (1) Army. The Assistant Secretary of the Army (Research, 
Development, and Acquisition);
    (2) Navy. The Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, 
Development, and Acquisition);
    (3) Air Force. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force 
(Acquisition); and
    (4) The defense agencies. Assistant Secretary of Defense for 
Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence.
    (d) The ten year authority in paragraph (b) of this section applies 
to communications service authorizations (239.7407-2) and other types of 
telecommunications contracts. It does not apply to basic agreements.


<R05>
239.7406  Cost or pricing data and information other than cost or pricing data.

    (a) Common carriers are not required to submit cost or pricing data 
before

[[Page 320]]

award of contracts for tariffed services. Rates or preliminary estimates 
quoted by a common carrier for tariffed telecommunications services are 
considered to be prices set by regulation within the provisions of 10 
U.S.C. 2306a. This is true even if the tariff is set after execution of 
the contract.
    (b) Rates or preliminary estimates quoted by a common carrier for 
nontariffed telecommunications services or by a noncommon carrier for 
any telecommunications service are not considered prices set by law or 
regulation.
    (c) Contracting officers shall obtain sufficient information to 
determine that the prices are reasonable. For example, cost or pricing 
data, if required in accordance with FAR 15.804-2, or information other 
than cost or pricing data, if required in accordance with FAR 15.804-5, 
may be necessary to support the reasonableness of--
    (1) Nontariffed services;
    (2) Special rates and charges not included in a tariff, whether 
filed or to be filed;
    (3) Special assembly rates and charges;
    (4) Special construction and equipment charges;
    (5) Contingent liabilities that are fixed at the outset of the 
service;
    (6) Proposed cancellation and termination charges under the clause 
at 252.239-7007, Cancellation or Termination of Orders--Common Carriers, 
and reuse arrangements under the clause at 252.239-7008, Reuse 
Arrangements;
    (7) Rates contained in voluntary tariffs filed by nondominant common 
carriers; or
    (8) A tariff, whether filed or to be filed, for new services 
installed or developed primarily for Government use.
[62 FR 40473, July 29, 1997]


<R05>
239.7407-1  General.

    In addition to acquisition methods described in the FAR, the method 
described in this section may be used to acquire telecommunications 
services.


<R05>
239.7407-2  Communication service authorizations (CSAs).

    Basic agreements (see FAR 16.702) are used widely in conjunction 
with communication service authorizations to facilitate award of 
telecommunications services.
    (a) Use DD Form 428, Communication Service Authorization (CSA), or 
an electronic data processing substitute to award, modify, cancel, or 
terminate telecommunications services. The CSA shall--
    (1) Refer to the basic agreement;
    (2) Specify the types and quantities and equipment to be provided as 
well as the tariff (or other price if a tariff is not available) of 
those services and equipment;
    (3) Specify the premises involved;
    (4) Cite the address for billing;
    (5) Identify the disbursing office; and
    (6) Provide funding information.
    (b) Before awarding a CSA, comply with the requirements in FAR and 
DFARS, e.g., for competition, reviews, approvals, and determinations and 
findings.
    (c) Include an expiration date in each CSA.
    (d) Modify CSAs to reflect any price increases.


<R05>
239.7408  Special construction.


<R05>
239.7408-1  General.

    (a) Special construction normally involves a common carrier giving a 
special service or facility related to the performance of the basic 
telecommunications service requirements.
    This may include--
    (1) Moving or relocating equipment;
    (2) Providing temporary facilities;
    (3) Expediting provision of facilities; or
    (4) Providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet 
Government requirements.
    (b) Use this subpart instead of FAR part 36 for acquisition of 
``special construction.''
    (c) Special construction costs may be--
    (1) A contingent liability for using telecommunications services for 
a shorter time than the minimum to reimburse the contractor for 
unamortized nonrecoverable costs. These costs are usually expressed in 
terms of a termination liability, as provided in the contract or by 
tariff;

[[Page 321]]

    (2) A onetime special construction charge;
    (3) Recurring charges for constructed facilities;
    (4) A minimum service charge;
    (5) An expediting charge; or
    (6) A move or relocation charge.
    (d) When a common carrier submits a proposal or quotation which has 
special construction requirements, the contracting officer shall require 
a detailed special construction proposal. Analyze all special 
construction proposals to--
    (1) Determine the adequacy of the proposed construction;
    (2) Disclose excessive or duplicative construction; and
    (3) When different forms of charge are possible, provide for the 
form of charge most advantageous to the Government.
    (e) When possible, analyze and approve special construction charges 
before receiving the service. Impose a ceiling on the special 
construction costs before authorizing the contractor to proceed, if 
prior approval is not possible. Do not make final payment for special 
construction charges unless the charges are approved by the contracting 
officer.


<R05>
239.7408-2  Applicability of construction labor standards for special construction.

    (a) The construction labor standards in FAR 22.4 ordinarily do not 
apply to special construction. However, if the special construction 
includes construction (as defined in FAR 36.102) of a public building or 
public work, the construction labor standards may apply. Determine 
applicability under FAR 22.402.
    (b) Each CSA or other type contract which is subject to construction 
labor standards under FAR 22.402 shall cite that fact.


<R05>
239.7409  Special assembly.

    (a) Special assembly is the designing, manufacturing, arranging, 
assembling, or wiring of equipment to provide telecommunications 
services that cannot be provided with general use equipment.
    (b) Special assembly rates and charges shall be based on estimated 
costs. The contracting officer shall negotiate special assembly rates 
and charges before starting service whenever possible. When it is not 
possible to negotiate in advance, use provisional rates and charges 
subject to adjustment, until final rates and charges are negotiated. The 
CSAs authorizing the special assembly shall be modified to reflect 
negotiated final rates and charges.


<R05>
239.7410  Cancellation and termination.

<R05>
241.001  Definitions.

    As used in this part--
    Definite term contract means a contract for utility services for a 
definite period of not less than one nor more than ten years.
    Dual service area means a geographical area in which two or more 
utility suppliers are authorized under State law to provide services.
    Indefinite term contract means a month-to-month contract for utility 
services which may be terminated by the Government upon proper notice.
    Independent regulatory body means the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission, a state-wide agency, or an agency with less than state-wide 
jurisdiction when operating pursuant to state authority. The body has 
the power to fix, establish, or control the rates and services of 
utility suppliers.
    Nonindependent regulatory body means a body that regulates a utility 
supplier which is owned or operated by the same entity that created the 
regulatory body, e.g., a municipal utility.
    Regulated utility supplier means a utility supplier regulated by an 
independent regulatory body.
    Service power procurement officer means for the--
    Army, the Chief of Engineers;
    Navy, the Commander, Naval Facilities Engineering Command;
    Air Force, the head of a contracting activity; and
    Defense Logistics Agency, the Executive Director of Contracting.


<R05>
241.002  Applicability.

    (a) This part applies to purchases of utility services from 
nonregulated and regulated utility suppliers. It includes the 
acquisition of liquified petroleum gas as a utility service when 
purchased from regulated utility suppliers.
    (b)(7) This part does not apply to third party financed projects. 
However,

[[Page 323]]

it may be used for any purchased utility services directly resulting 
from such projects, including those authorized by--
    (A) 10 U.S.C. 2394 for energy, fuels, and energy production 
facilities for periods not to exceed 30 years;
    (B) 10 U.S.C. 2394(a) for renewable energy for periods not to exceed 
25 years;
    (C) 10 U.S.C. 2689 for geothermal resources that result in energy 
production facilities;
    (D) 10 U.S.C. 2809 for potable and waste water treatment plants for 
periods not to exceed 32 years; and
    (E) 10 U.S.C. 2812 for lease/purchase of energy production 
facilities for periods not to exceed 32 years.


<R05>
241.004  Acquiring utility services.


<R05>
241.004-1  Policy.

    (1) Except as provided in FAR 41.004, DoD, as a matter of comity, 
will comply with the current regulations, practices and decisions of 
independent regulatory bodies which are subject to judicial appeal. This 
policy does not extend to regulatory bodies whose decisions are not 
subject to appeal nor does it extend to nonindependent regulatory 
bodies.
    (2) Purchases of utility services outside the U.S. may use--
    (i) Formats and technical provisions consistent with local practice; 
and
    (ii) Dual language forms and contracts.
    (3) Rates established by an independent regulatory body are 
considered ``prices set by law or regulation'' and do not require 
submission of cost or pricing data (see FAR subpart 15.8).


<R05>
241.004-2  Procedures.

    (a)(i) Competitive proposals. When a new major utility service load 
develops or a new military installation is established, the contracting 
officer shall--
    (A) Determine whether more than one supplier can provide the 
required utility services.
    (1) Competition may be possible where dual franchises exist or where 
no franchise exists.
    (2) Competition should also be considered when an installation is 
served by one supplier and other potential suppliers exist even though 
one supplier has entered into a General Services Administration area-
wide contract.
    (B) Where competition exists, solicit competitive proposals from all 
potential suppliers.
    (ii) Periodic reviews for competition. Conduct periodic review of 
ongoing contracts to determine the availability of competition. If 
available, evaluate the need to rewrite the contract considering--
    (A) The possible loss of rights vested in the Government under the 
existing contract;
    (B) The age and quality of the contract; and
    (C) The number of contract modifications and the ease of 
administration with the existing contract documents.
    (iii) Connection and service charges. The Government may pay a 
connection charge when required to cover the cost of the necessary 
connecting facilities. A connection charge based on the estimated labor 
cost of installing and removing the facility shall not include salvage 
cost. A lump-sum connection charge shall be no more than the agreed cost 
of the connecting facilities less net salvage. The order of precedence 
for contractual treatment of connection and service charges is--
    (A) No connection charge.
    (B) Termination liability. Use when an obligation is necessary to 
secure the required services. The obligation must be not more than the 
agreed connection charge, less any net salvage material costs. Use of a 
termination liability instead of a connection charge requires the 
approval of the service power procurement officer or designee.
    (C) Connection charge, refundable. Use a refundable connection 
charge when the supplier refuses to provide the facilities based on lack 
of capital or published rules which prohibit providing up-front funding. 
The contract should provide for refund of the connection charge within 
five years unless a longer period or omission of the refund requirement 
is authorized by the service power procurement officer or designee.
    (D) Connection and service charges, nonrefundable. The Government 
may

[[Page 324]]

pay certain nonrefundable, nonrecurring charges including service 
initiation charges, a contribution in aid of construction, membership 
fees, and charges required by the supplier's rules and regulations to be 
paid by the customer. If possible, consider sharing with other than 
Government users the use of (and costs for) facilities when large 
nonrefundable charges are required.
    (iv) Construction and labor requirements. (A) Do not use the 
connection charge provisions for the installation of Government-owned 
distribution lines and facilities. The acquisition of such facilities 
must be authorized by legislation and accomplished in accordance with 
FAR part 36. Also, do not use the connection charge provisions for the 
installation of new facilities related to the supplier's production and 
general ``backbone'' system unless authorized by legislation.
    (B) Construction labor standards ordinarily do not apply to 
construction accomplished under the connection charge provisions of this 
part. However, if installation includes construction of a public 
building or public work as defined in FAR 36.102, construction labor 
standards may apply.


<R05>
241.004-3  GSA assistance and approval.

    The General Services Administration (GSA) has delegated DoD 
authority to enter into utility service contracts (FAR 41.003(b)); thus, 
contracting officers need not seek assistance or approval from GSA.


<R05>
241.004-5  Separate contracts.

    (a)(i) Requests for proposals shall state the anticipated service 
period in terms of months or years. Where the period extends beyond the 
current fiscal year, evaluate offers of incentives for a definite term 
contract.
    (ii) The solicitation may permit offerors the choice of proposing on 
the basis of--
    (A) A definite term not to exceed the anticipated service period; or
    (B) An indefinite term contract.
    (iii) Where the expected service period is less than the current 
fiscal year, the solicitation shall be on the basis of an indefinite 
term contract.
    (iv) Contracts for utility services for leased premises shall 
identify the lease document on the face of the contract.
    (d) Use an indefinite term utility service contract when it is 
considered to be in the Government's best interest to--
    (i) Have the right to terminate on a 30-day (or longer) notice. A 
notice of up to one year may be granted by an installation if needed to 
obtain a more favorable rate, more advantageous conditions, or for other 
valid reasons; or
    (ii) Grant the supplier the right to terminate the contract when of 
benefit to the Government in the form of lower rates, larger discounts 
or more favorable terms and conditions.


<R05>
241.005  Pre-award contract review.

    (d) Departments/agencies shall conduct their own pre-award contract 
reviews. FAR 41.005 (a) through (c) may be used as a guide.


<R05>
241.007  Contract clauses.


<R05>
241.007-70  Additional clauses.

    (a) If the Government must execute a superseding contract and 
capital credits, connection charge credits, or termination liability 
exist, use the clause at 252.241-7000, Superseding Contract.
    (b) Use the clause at 252.241-7001, Government Access, when the 
clause at FAR 52.241-4, Contractor's Facilities, is used.

Defense Contract Management Command (DCMC) shall, upon request of the 
military department, and subject to prior agreement, perform contract 
administration services on a military installation.
    (iii) DCMC shall provide preaward survey assistance for post, camp, 
and station work performed on a military installation. The contracting

242.1204  Agreement to recognize a successor in interest (novation agreement).

    (e) When a novation agreement is required and the transferee intends 
to incur restructuring costs as defined at 213.205-70, the cognizant 
contracting officer shall include the following provision as paragraph 
(b)(7) of the novation agreement instead of the paragraph (b)(7) 
provided in the sample format at FAR 42.1204(e):

    ``(7)(i) Except as set forth in subparagraph (7)(ii) below, the 
Transferor and the Transferee agree that the Government is not obligated 
to pay or reimburse either of them for, or otherwise give effect to, any 
costs, taxes, or other expenses, or any related increases, directly or 
indirectly arising out of or resulting from the transfer or this 
Agreement, other than those that the Government in the absence of this 
transfer or Agreement would

[[Page 333]]

have been obligated to pay or reimburse under the terms of the 
contracts.
    (ii) The Government recognizes that restructuring by the Transferee 
incidental to the acquisition/merger may be in the best interests of the 
Government. Restructuring costs that are allowable under Part 31 of the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) or Part 231 of the Defense Federal 
Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) may be reimbursed under 
flexibily-priced novated contracts, provided the Transferee demonstrates 
that the restructuring will reduce overall costs to the Department of 
Defense (DoD) (and to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
(NASA), where there is a mix of DoD and NASA contracts), and the 
requirements included in DFARS 231.205-70 are met. Restructuring costs 
shall not be allowed on novated contracts unless there is an audit of 
the restructuring proposal; a determination by the contracting officer 
of overall reduced costs to DoD/NASA; and an Advance Agreement setting 
forth a cumulative cost ceiling for restructuring projects and the 
period to which such costs shall be assigned.''

carrier equipment beyond a reasonable period for loading, unloading, 
forwarding directions, or any other reason. Detention rules and charges

                        Subpart 242.70 [Reserved]


<R04>
                    Subpart 242.71--Voluntary Refunds


<R05>
242.7100  General.

    (a) A voluntary refund is a payment or credit (adjustment under one 
or more contracts or subcontracts) to the Government from a contractor 
or subcontractor which is not required by any contractual or other legal 
obligation.
    (b) A voluntary refund may be solicited (requested by the 
Government) or unsolicited.
    (1) Generally, request voluntary refunds only after determining that 
no contractual remedy is readily available to recover the amount sought.
    (2) Acceptance of unsolicited refunds does not prejudice remedies 
otherwise available to the Government.
    (c) Before soliciting a voluntary refund or accepting an unsolicited 
one, the contracting officer should have legal counsel review the 
contract and related data to--
    (1) Confirm that there are no readily available contractual 
remedies; and
    (2) Advise whether the proposed action would jeopardize or impair 
the Government's rights.


<R05>
242.7101  Solicited refunds.

    (a) Request voluntary refunds only when--
    (1) The contracting officer concludes that the contractor 
overcharged under a contract, or inadequately compensated the Government 
for the use of Government-owned property, or inadequately compensated 
the Government in the disposition of contractor inventory; and
    (2) Retention of the amount in question by the contractor or 
subcontractor would be contrary to good conscience and equity.
    (b) Do not solicit voluntary refunds without approval of the head of 
the contracting activity, or as provided in department/agency 
regulations.
    (c) Voluntary refunds may be requested during or after contract 
performance.


<R05>
242.7102  Disposition of voluntary refunds.

    A contract modification, rather than a check, is the preferred means 
of effecting a solicited or unsolicited refund transacted before final 
payment.
    (a) For modifications, adjust the price for the refund and credit 
the refund to the applicable appropriation cited in the contract.
    (b) For checks--
    (1) Advise the contractor to--
    (i) Make the check payable to the agency which awarded the contract;

[[Page 335]]

    (ii) Forward the check to the contracting officer or when the 
contract is assigned to another office for administration, to that 
office; and
    (iii) Include a letter with the check--
    (A) Identifying it as a voluntary refund;
    (B) Giving the contract number involved; and
    (C) Where possible, giving the appropriation and account number to 
be credited.
    (2) Forward the check to the office responsible for control of 
funds.


<R04>
  Subpart 242.72--Contractor Material Management and Accounting System


<R05>
242.7200  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart provides policies, procedures, and standards for use in 
the evaluation of a contractor's material management and accounting 
system (MMAS).


<R05>
242.7201  Definitions.

    Material management and accounting system and valid time-phased 
requirements are defined in the clause at 252.242-7004, Material 
Management and Accounting System.


<R05>
242.7202  Policy.

    DoD policy is for all contractors to have an MMAS that--
    (a) Reasonably forecasts material requirements;
    (b) Ensures the costs of purchased and fabricated material charged 
or allocated to a contract are based on valid time-phased requirements;
    (c) Maintains a consistent, equitable, and unbiased logic for 
costing of material transactions; and
    (d) Conforms to the standards at 252.242-7004(f) when the contractor 
has cost-reimbursement or fixed-price contracts exceeding the simplified 
acquisition threshold, with progress or other contract financing 
provisions, except when all of the contracts and subcontracts are 
awarded under the set-aside or Section 8(a) procedures of FAR part 19.
[56 FR 36437, July 31, 1991, as amended at 57 FR 42632, Sept. 15, 1992; 
61 FR 50455, Sept. 26, 1996]


<R05>
242.7203  MMAS disclosure, demonstration, and maintenance requirements.

    (a) A large business contractor is subject to MMAS disclosure, 
demonstration, and maintenance if in its preceding fiscal year the 
contractor received DoD prime contracts or subcontracts (including 
modifications) totaling--
    (1) $70 million or more; or
    (2) $30 million or more (but less than $70 million), and the 
contracting officer determines it to be in the best interests of the 
Government (e.g., contractor disclosure, demonstration, or other 
activities indicate significant MMAS problems exist).
    (b) After the administrative contracting officer determines the 
contractor's MMAS is adequate (see 242.7204(b)), written disclosure will 
not be required for the next MMAS review unless the contractor's 
policies, procedures, or practices have changed in the interim 
period(s). Similarly, once the contractor demonstrates that its MMAS 
contains no significant deficiencies, demonstration requirements for 
subsequent reviews may be satisfied if internal audits are reasonably 
current and contain sufficient transaction tests to demonstrate MMAS 
compliance with each standard.
[61 FR 50455, Sept. 26, 1996]


<R05>
242.7204  Responsibilities.

    (a) The contracting officer shall--
    (1) Through use of the clause at 252.242-7004, Material Management 
and Accounting System, apply the disclosure, demonstration, and 
maintenance requirements to large business contractors meeting the 
criteria in 242.7203(a);
    (2) Consider whether to apply the disclosure, demonstration, and 
maintenance requirements to other large business contractors under 
242.7203(a)(2) after concurrence from, or at the request of, the 
administrative contracting officer; and
    (3) Not apply the disclosure, demonstration, and maintenance 
requirements to small businesses, educational institutions, or nonprofit 
organizations.

[[Page 336]]

    (b) For contractors subject to the disclosure, demonstration, and 
maintenance requirements, the administrative contracting officer (ACO) 
determines the adequacy of the contractor's MMAS and pursues correction 
of deficiencies.
    (c) The contract auditor shall--
    (1) Assist the ACO in evaluating the contractor's MMAS;
    (2) Assess the significance of contractor deficiencies and provide 
the ACO an estimate of the resulting adverse material impact to the 
Government; and
    (3) Assist the ACO in evaluating the contractor's correction of 
deficiencies.
[56 FR 36437, July 31, 1991, as amended at 61 FR 50455, Sept. 26, 1996]


<R05>
242.7205  Review procedures.

    (a) System Evaluation. Cognizant contract administration and audit 
activities shall jointly establish and manage programs for evaluating 
the MMAS systems of contractors subject to disclosure, demonstration, 
and maintenance requirements and annually establish a schedule of 
contractors to be reviewed. They shall--
    (1) Conduct reviews as a team effort.
    (i) The administrative contracting officer--
    (A) Appoints a team leader; and
    (B) Ensures that the team includes appropriate functional 
specialists (i.e., industrial specialists, engineer, property 
administrator, auditor, etc.).
    (ii) The team leader--
    (A) Advises the ACO and contractor of findings during the review and 
at the exit conference.
    (B) Makes every effort to resolve differences regarding questions of 
fact during the review.
    (2) Tailor reviews to take full advantage of the day-to-day work 
done by both organizations.
    (3) Prepare a review report.
    (4) Conduct a review every 3 years. The ACO, with advice from the 
auditor, may lengthen or shorten the 3 year period based on a risk 
assessment of the contractor's past experience and current 
vulnerability.
    (b) Disposition of evaluation team findings. The team leader shall 
document the evaluation team findings and recommendations in a report to 
the ACO. If there are significant MMAS deficiencies, the report must 
provide an estimate of the adverse impact on the Government resulting 
from those deficiencies.
    (1) Initial notification to the contractor. The ACO shall 
immediately provide a copy of the report to the contractor upon receipt 
from the team leader.
    (i) The ACO shall notify the contractor in a timely manner if there 
are no deficiencies.
    (ii) If there are deficiencies, the ACO shall request the contractor 
to provide a written response within 30 days from the date of initial 
notification.
    (iii) If the contractor agrees with the report, the contractor has 
60 days to correct any identified deficiencies or submit a corrective 
action plan showing milestones and actions to eliminate the 
deficiencies.
    (iv) If the contractor disagrees, request rationale in the written 
response.
    (2) Evaluation of the contractor's response. The administrative 
contracting officer, in consultation with the auditor, evaluates the 
contractor's response and determines whether--
    (i) The MMAS contains deficiencies which need correction;
    (ii) The deficiencies are significant enough to result in the 
reduction or suspension of progress payments or of payments under public 
vouchers; and
    (iii) Proposed corrective actions (if the contractor submitted them) 
are adequate to correct the deficiencies.
    (3) Reduction or Suspension of payments. (i) When the administrative 
contracting officer (ACO) determines that there is a significant MMAS 
deficiency, the ACO shall reduce progress payment claims by an 
appropriate percentage based on affected costs (in accordance with FAR 
32.503-6) and/or suspend questionable costs on public vouchers in 
accordance with FAR 42.803). The reductions or suspensions shall remain 
in effect until the ACO determines that--
    (A) The deficiencies are corrected; or
    (B) The amount of the impact is immaterial.
    (ii) The maximum payment adjustment is the adverse material impact 
to the Government as specified in the team's report. The ACO should use 
the maximum adjustment when the contractor did not submit a corrective 
action plan with its response, or the plan

[[Page 337]]

is unacceptable. In other cases, the ACO should consider the quality of 
the contractor's self-assessment, demonstration, and corrective action 
plan in determining the appropriate percentage.
    (iii) As the contractor implements its accepted corrective action 
plan, the ACO should reinstate a portion of withheld amounts 
commensurate with the contractor's progress in making corrections. 
However, the ACO shall not fully reinstate withheld amounts until the 
contractor corrects the deficiency, or until the impact of the 
deficiency becomes immaterial.
    (4) Notification of administrative contracting officer 
determination. (i) The administrative contracting officer (ACO) shall 
notify the contractor in writing (copy to auditor and functional 
specialists) of--
    (A) Deficiencies needing correction;
    (B) Acceptability of the contractor's corrective action plan (if one 
was submitted) or the need for a corrective action plan; and
    (C) Any decision to reduce or suspend progress payments or public 
vouchers because of significant deficiencies.
    (ii) The Government does not approve or disapprove the contractor's 
MMAS system. ACO notifications should avoid any such implications.
    (iii) From the time the ACO determines that there is a significant 
material management and accounting system deficiency until the time the 
deficiency is corrected, all field pricing reports for that contractor 
shall contain a recommendation relating to proposed cost or pricing data 
adjustments necessary to protect the Government's interests.
    (iv) The ACO should consider the effect of significant MMAS 
deficiencies in reviews of the contractor's estimating system (215.811).
    (5) Monitoring contractor's corrective action. The administrative 
contracting officer (ACO) and auditor shall monitor the contractor's 
progress in correcting deficiencies. If the contractor fails to make 
adequate progress, the ACO shall take further action. Actions for 
consideration may include--
    (i) Elevate the issue to higher level management;
    (ii) Further reduce or suspend progress payments;
    (iii) Notify the contractor of the inadequacy of the contractor's 
cost estimating system and/or cost accounting system.
    (iv) Take appropriate contractual action, i.e., disallow charges as 
unreasonable; and
    (v) Issue cautions to contracting activities regarding the award of 
future contracts.


<R05>
242.7206  Contract clause.

    Use the clause at 252.242-7004, Material Management and Accounting 
System, in all solicitations and contracts exceeding the simplified 
acquisition threshold that are not for the acquisition of commercial 
items and--
    (a) Are not awarded under the set-aside or section 8(a) procedures 
of FAR part 19; and
    (b) Are either--
    (1) Cost-reimbursement contracts; or
    (2) Fixed-price contracts with progress payments or other Government 
financing.

<R04>
           Subpart 242.73--Contractor Insurance/Pension Review


<R05>
242.7300  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart provides the requirements for conducting a Contractor 
Insurance/Pension Review (CIPR).


<R05>
242.7301  General.

    (a) The administrative contracting officer (ACO) is responsible for 
determining the reasonableness of insurance/pension costs in Government 
contracts. Insurance/pension specialists assist ACOs in making these 
determinations by conducting CIPRs. A CIPR is an in-depth evaluation of 
a contractor's--
    (1) Insurance program;
    (2) Pension plan;
    (3) Other deferred compensation plans; and
    (4) Related policies, procedures, practices, and costs.
    (b) As the DoD Executive Agency, the Defense Logistics Agency 
performs

[[Page 338]]

CIPRs at all contractor locations meeting criteria in 242.7302.
    (c) Insurance/pension specialists are located at the Defense 
Contract Management Districts in Los Angeles and Chicago and at the 
Defense Contract Management Area Operations in New York.
    (d) The CIPR should be the only formal review of a contractor's 
insurance/pension program except for periodic tests of the system 
performed by contract administration and DCAA, or any special reviews 
initiated by the administrative contracting officer. If any organization 
believes that additional reviews of the contractor's insurance/pension 
program should be performed, that request should be conveyed to the ACO. 
The ACO should perform the review as part of an ACO-initiated special 
review, of if possible, as part of the CIPR if one is scheduled to be 
conducted in the near future.


<R05>
242.7302  Requirements.

    (a) A CIPR shall be conducted for each contractor whose qualifying 
sales to the Government exceeded $40 million during the contractor's 
preceding fiscal year. Qualifying sales are sales for which certified 
cost or pricing data were required under 10 U.S.C. 2306, as implemented 
in FAR 15.804 (unless exempt in accordance with FAR 15.804-3), or which 
are cost-reimbursement type contracts. Sales include prime contracts, 
subcontracts, and modifications to such contracts and subcontracts.
    (b) A CIPR shall be conducted at least every two years for 
contractors who continue to meet the requirements. A more or less 
frequent cycle may be appropriate under certain circumstances, e.g., 
prior to a major contract award, in conjunction with in-depth overhead 
review, or subsequent to mergers or divestitures.
    (c) Special reviews may be performed in the intervening period--
    (1) To follow-up contractor implementation of recommendations and 
verify Government recovery of credits; or
    (2) When information reveals a deficiency or major change in the 
contractor's insurance/pension program.
    (d) Reviews of selected insurance and pension elements may be 
conducted for contractors not meeting the criteria in paragraph (a) of 
this section if significant problems have been identified.
[56 FR 36437, July 31, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 29500, June 5, 1995]


<R05>
242.7303  Responsibilities.

    (a) The administrative contracting officer is responsible for--
    (1) Determining the need for a CIPR or special review under 
242.7302;
    (2) Requesting and scheduling the reviews with the appropriate 
Defense Logistics Agency activity;
    (3) Notifying the contractor of the proposed date and purpose of the 
review, and obtaining any preliminary data needed by the insurance/
pension specialist;
    (4) Reviewing the CIPR report, advising the contractor of the 
results, and telling the contractor to submit any significant changes in 
insurance/pension plans for review and acceptance prior to making the 
change;
    (5) Providing other interested contracting officers copies of 
documents related to the CIPR; and
    (6) Ensuring adequate follow-up on all CIPR recommendations.
    (b) The insurance/pension specialist is responsible for--
    (1) Preparing and maintaining the schedule of CIPRs to be performed 
during the next 12 months and providing the Military Departments and 
Defense Contract Audit Agency a copy of the schedule;
    (2) Heading the team that conducts the review;
    (3) Maintaining complete documentation for CIPR reports;
    (4) To the extent possible, resolving discrepancies between audit 
reports and CIPR draft reports prior to releasing the final CIPR report;
    (5) Preparing and distributing the final CIPR report;
    (6) Providing the final audit report as an attachment to the CIPR 
report;
    (7) Preparing a draft letter for the administrative contracting 
officer's use in notifying the contractor of CIPR results; and
    (8) When requested, advising administrative contracting officers and 
other Government representatives concerning contractor insurance/pension 
matters.

[[Page 339]]

    (c) The Defense Contract Audit Agency auditor is responsible for--
    (1) Participating as a member of the CIPR team;
    (2) Submitting information and advice to the team based on analysis 
of the contractor's books, accounting records, and other related data; 
and
    (3) Issuing an audit report to the insurance/pension specialist for 
incorporation into the final CIPR report.


<R04>
    Subpart 242.74--Technical Representation at Contractor Facilities


<R05>
242.7400  General.

    (a) Contract administration offices (CAOs) are the designated 
representatives of DoD for the administration of contracts (see FAR 
42.202 and 42.302). DoD activities shall use CAOs to perform contract 
administration service functions at or near contractor facilities (see 
242.203(a) (i) and (v).
    (b) Program managers may conclude that they need technical 
representation in contractor facilities to perform non-contract 
administration service (CAS) technical duties and to provide liaison, 
guidance, and assistance on systems and programs. In these cases, the 
program manager may assign technical representatives under the 
procedures in 242.7401.
    (c) Program managers should carefully assess the number of technical 
representatives required to perform the non-CAS technical functions so 
as to keep the total assigned in-plant to the minimum necessary.
    (d) A technical representative is a representative of a DoD program, 
project, or system office performing non-CAS technical duties at or near 
a contractor facility. A technical representative is not--
    (1) A representative of a contract administration or contract audit 
component; or
    (2) A contracting officer's representative (COR) (see 201.602).


<R05>
242.7401  Procedures.

    (a) When the program, project, or system manager determines that a 
technical representative is required, the manager shall issue a letter 
of intent to the contract administration office commander listing the 
assignment location, starting and ending assignment dates, technical 
duties assigned, delegated authority, and support required from the 
contract administration office. Any issues regarding the assignment of a 
technical representative should be resolved promptly. However, final 
decision on the assignment remains with the program manager. Issues 
regarding the assignment of technical duties which cannot be resolved 
between the program office and the defense plant representative office 
will be escalated.
    (b) The program, project, or system manager shall furnish the 
designated technical representative a letter of assignment of delegated 
technical duties, with copies to the contract administration office, the 
contracting officer, and contractor, at least 30 days before the 
assignment date (or termination date). Any changes to the requirements 
of the assignment letter will be made by a new letter of intent and 
processed in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) The contract administration office normally provides the 
technical representative with office space, equipment, supplies, and 
part-time clerical support. The program, project, or system manager 
provides supervision, technical direction, administrative services 
(e.g., pay, travel, maintenance of personnel records), and, when 
required, full-time clerical support.
    (d) The program manager or designee and the contract administration 
office, at the local level, shall negotiate a memorandum of agreement 
(MOA) delineating their functional administrative interrelationships, 
with annual updates as necessary. The agreements may be included in an 
existing MOA, if one exists, or as a separate MOA.
    (e) The technical representative shall keep the contract 
administration office commander fully informed of matters discussed with 
the contractor. The contract administration office shall also keep the 
technical representative fully informed of contractor discussions which 
relate to technical matters within the purview of the technical 
representative's assigned duties.

   Subpart 242.75--Contractor Accounting Systems and Related Controls

    Source:  60 FR 29500, June 5, 1995, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
242.7500  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart provides policies and procedures applicable to 
contractor accounting systems and related internal controls.


<R05>
242.7501  Definition.

    Internal controls means those policies and procedures established by 
contractor management to provide reasonable assurance that applicable 
laws and regulations are complied with and that actual and estimated 
costs are equitably allocated within the accounting system.


<R05>
242.7502  Policy.

    Contractors receiving cost-reimbursement or incentive type 
contracts, or contracts which provide for progress payments based on 
costs or on a percentage or stage of completion, shall maintain an 
accounting system and related internal controls throughout contract 
performance which provide reasonable assurance that--
    (a) Applicable laws and regulations are complied with;
    (b) The accounting system and cost data are reliable;
    (c) Risk of misallocations and mischarges are minimized; and
    (d) Contract allocations and charges are consistent with invoice 
procedures.


<R05>
242.7503  Procedures.

    (a) Upon receipt of an audit report identifying significant 
accounting system or related internal control deficiencies, the ACO 
will--
    (1) Provide a copy of the report to the contractor and allow 30 
days, or a reasonable extension, for the contractor to respond;
    (2) If the contractor agrees with the report, the contractor has 60 
days from the date of initial notification to correct any identified 
deficiencies or submit a corrective action plan showing milestones and 
actions to eliminate the deficiencies.
    (3) If the contractor disagrees, the contractor should provide 
rationale in its written response.
    (4) The ACO will consider whether it is appropriate to suspend a 
percentage of progress payments or reimbursement of costs proportionate 
to the estimated cost risk to the Government, considering audit reports 
or other relevant input, until the contractor submits a corrective 
action plan acceptable to the ACO and corrects the deficiencies. (See 
FAR 32.503-6 (a) and (b) and FAR 42.302(a)(7)).

<R05>
243.204  Administration.

    (b) Definitization. The administrative contracting officer (ACO) 
must review change orders issued by the contracting officer to ensure 
compatibility with the status of performance. If the contractor has 
progressed beyond the effective point specified in the change order, the 
ACO must determine the earliest practical point at which the change 
order could be made effective and advise the contracting officer. The 
contracting officer must issue another change order to correct, revise, 
or supersede the first change order, then definitize by supplemental 
agreement citing both change orders.

    Engineering changes can originate with either the contractor or the 
Government. In either case, the Government will need detailed 
information from the contractor for evaluation of the technical, cost, 
and schedule effects of implementing the change. When the contracting 
officer wants this information submitted in the format prescribed by 
MIL-STD-973, use the clause at 252.243-7000, Engineering Change 
Proposals. Use the clause with its Alternate I, when appropriate, to 
discourage submission of a large number of small dollar, contractor 
originated engineering change proposals.

<R05>
244.301  Objective.

    The administrative contracting officer (ACO) is responsible for 
reviewing the contractor's purchasing systems. Members of other

problem, recommend that the ACO initiate a special review.


<R05>
244.304  Surveillance.

    (b) The ACO, or the purchasing system analyst (PSA) with the 
concurrence of the ACO, may initiate a special review of specific 
weaknesses in the contractor's purchasing system. The weaknesses, for 
example--
    (i) May arise because of--
    (A) Major changes in the contractor's purchasing policies, 
procedures, or key personnel; or
    (B) Changes in plant workload or type of work.
    (ii) May be discovered--
    (A) During reviews of subcontracts submitted under advance 
notification and consent (FAR subpart 44.2); or
    (B) From information provided by Government personnel.

    (2) Request the contractor submit its plan for correcting 
deficiencies or making improvements within 15 days; and
    (3) Not comment on the pending or planned decision to grant or 
withhold approval of the contractor's purchasing system.
    (b) The PSA should submit the complete report to the ACO, or any 
department or agency established review board, within ten days after 
receipt of the contractor's response under paragraph (a)(2) of this 
subsection.
    (c) The ACO should completely review the report and consider the 
contractor's response before making a decision on granting, withholding, 
or withdrawing purchasing system approval. The ACO shall notify the 
contractor of the decision within ten days after receipt of the report 
with a copy of the decision to the PSA and the contracting office, when 
requested.
    (d) When a contractor advises that it has corrected deficiencies 
that led the ACO to withhold or withdraw the purchasing system approval, 
the ACO--
    (1) Shall request the PSA to verify that the contractor has--
    (i) Corrected the deficiencies; and
    (ii) Implemented any other ACO recommendations.
    (2) Should ask for a review of purchasing policies and procedures 
issued since the last review.

    Government use includes use on contracts for foreign military sales. 
Use on contracts for foreign military sales shall be on a rent-free 
basis.


<R05>
245.403  Rental--Use and charges clause.

    (1) The DoD normally recovers a fair share of nonrecurring costs of 
special tooling and special test equipment by including these costs in 
its calculation of the nonrecurring cost recoupment charge when major 
defense equipment is sold by foreign military sales or direct commercial 
sales to foreign governments or international organizations. Major 
defense equipment is defined in DODD 2140.2, Recoupment of Nonrecurring 
Costs on Sales of U.S. Products and Technology, as any item of 
significant combat equipment on the United States Munitions List having 
a nonrecurring RDT&E cost of more than $50 million or a total production 
cost of more than $200 million.
    (2) When these cost thresholds are not met, the contracting officer 
shall assess rental charges for use of special tooling and special test 
equipment pursuant to the Use and Charges clause when administratively 
practicable.


<R05>
245.405  Contracts with foreign governments or international organizations.

    (1) Approval. A contractor may use Government production and 
research property on work for foreign governments and international 
organizations only when approved in writing by the contracting officer 
having cognizance of the property. The contracting officer shall grant 
approval only if--
    (i) The use will not interfere with foreseeable requirements of the 
United States;
    (ii) The work is undertaken as a DoD foreign military sale; or
    (iii) For a direct commercial sale, the foreign country or 
international organization would be authorized to contract with the 
department concerned under the Arms Export Control Act.
    (2) Use charges. (i) The Use and Charges clause is applicable on 
direct commercial sales to foreign governments or international 
organizations.
    (ii) When a particular foreign government or international 
organization has funded the acquisition of specific production and 
research property, do not assess the foreign government or international 
organization rental charges or nonrecurring recoupments for the use of 
such property.
    (3) Waivers. (i) Rental charges for use of U.S. production and 
research property on commercial sales transactions to the Government of 
Canada are waived for all commercial contracts. This waiver is based on 
an understanding wherein the Government of Canada has agreed to waive 
its rental charges.
    (ii) Requests for waivers or reduction of charges for the use of 
Government facilities on work for foreign governments or international 
organizations shall be submitted to the contracting officer who shall 
refer the matter through contracting channels. In response to these 
requests, approvals may be granted only by the Director, Defense 
Security Assistance Agency for particular sales which are consistent 
with paragraph (1)(iii) of this section.

<R05>
246.101  Definitions.

    Metrology is the science of weights and measures used to determine 
conformance to technical requirements including the development of 
standards and systems for absolute and relative measurements.
    Quality means the composite of material attributes including 
performance features and characteristics of a product or service to 
satisfy a given need.
    Quality assurance is a planned and systematic pattern of all actions 
necessary to provide adequate confidence that adequate technical 
requirements are established; products and services conform to 
established technical requirements; and satisfactory performance is 
achieved.
    Quality audit is a systematic examination of the acts and decisions 
with respect to quality in order to independently verify or evaluate the 
operational requirements of the quality

[[Page 367]]

program or the specification or contract requirements of the product or 
service.
    Quality program is a program which is developed, planned, and 
managed to carry out cost-effectively all efforts to effect the quality 
of materials and services from concept exploration and definition 
through demonstration and validation, engineering and manufacturing 
development, production and deployment, and operations and support.
[56 FR 36460, July 31, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 33145, June 27, 1995]

maintained, or disposed of by contractors.
    (2) Conduct quality audits to ensure the quality of products and 
services meet contractual requirements.
    (3) Base the type and extent of Government contract quality 
assurance actions on the particular acquisition.
    (4) Provide contractors the maximum flexibility in establishing 
efficient and effective quality programs to meet contractual 
requirements. Contractor quality programs may be modeled on military, 
commercial, national, or international quality standards.

    (i) Critical nonconformance is a nonconformance that judgment and 
experience indicate--
    (A) Is likely to result in hazardous or unsafe conditions for 
individuals using, maintaining, or depending upon the supplies or 
services; or
    (B) Is likely to prevent performance of a vital agency mission.
    (ii) Major nonconformance is a nonconformance, other than critical, 
that is likely to result in failure, or to materially reduce the 
usability of the supplies or services for their intended purpose.
    (iii) Minor nonconformance is a nonconformance that is not likely to 
materially reduce the usability of the supplies or services for their 
intended purpose, or is a departure from established standards having 
little bearing on the effective use or operation of the supplies or 
services.
    (2) Contracting officers shall ensure that--
    (i) Nonconformances are identified; and
    (ii) The significance of a nonconformance is established when 
considering the acceptability of supplies or services which do not meet 
contract requirements.
    (f) If nonconforming material or services are discovered after 
acceptance, the defect appears to be the fault of the contractor, any 
warranty has expired, and there are no other contractual remedies, the 
contracting officer--
    (i) Shall notify the contractor in writing of the nonconforming 
material or service;
    (ii) Shall request that the contractor repair or replace the 
material, or perform the service, at no cost to the Government; and
    (iii) May accept consideration if offered. For guidance on 
solicitation of a refund, see subpart 242.71.

    (1) Include medical service personnel of the military departments; 
and
    (2) Be on a reimbursable basis.


<R05>
246.408-71  Aircraft.

    (a) The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has certain 
responsibilities and prerogatives in connection with some commercial 
aircraft and of aircraft equipment and accessories (Pub. L. 85-726 (72 
Stat 776, 49 U.S.C. 1423)). This includes the issuance of various 
certificates applicable to design, manufacture, and airworthiness.
    (b) FAA evaluations are not a substitute for normal DoD evaluations 
of the contractor's quality assurance measures. Actual records of FAA 
evaluations may be of use to the contract administration office (CAO) 
and should be used to their maximum advantage.
    (c) The CAO shall ensure that--
    (1) The supplies and services conform to the terms of the contract; 
and
    (2) The contractor possesses any required FAA certificates and 
approvals prior to acceptance.


<R05>
246.408-72  Construction projects.

    (a) The department or agency responsible for the construction of a 
building or other structure is normally responsible for on-site 
inspection.
    (b) The contract administration office performs quality assurance 
for construction materials and supplies acquired for military and civil

equipment.


<R05>
246.470  Government contract quality assurance actions.


<R05>
246.470-1  Planning.

    In systematically planning Government contract quality assurance 
actions used to determine a contractor's compliance with contract 
quality requirements, consider--
    (a) The relative importance of the product; and
    (b) The variety of tasks required of the available resources.


<R05>
246.470-2  Evidence of conformance.

    Use objective evidence of quality to determine conformance to 
contract quality requirements.


<R05>
246.470-3  Assessment of additional costs.

    (a) Under the clause at FAR 52.246-2, Inspection of Supplies--Fixed-
Price, the Government may charge the contractor for additional costs 
incurred by the Government due to delays in tests or inspections caused 
by the contractor, or due to the necessity for reinspection or retest. 
This action may be necessary when--
    (1) Supplies are not ready at the time such inspection and test are 
requested by the contractor; or
    (2) Reinspection or retest is necessitated by prior rejection.
    (b) After considering the factors in paragraph (d) of this 
subsection, the quality assurance representative (QAR) may believe that 
the assessment of additional costs is warranted. If so, the 
representative shall recommend that the contracting officer take the 
necessary action and provide a recommendation as to the amount of 
additional costs. Costs are based on the applicable Federal agency, 
foreign military sale, or public rate in effect at the time of the 
delay, reinspection, or retest.
    (c) If the contracting officer agrees with the QAR, the contracting 
officer shall--
    (1) Notify the contractor, in writing, of the determination to 
exercise the Government's right under the clause at FAR 52.246-2, 
Inspection of Supplies--Fixed Price; and
    (2) Demand payment of the costs in accordance with the collection 
procedures contained in FAR subpart 32.6.
    (d) In making a determination to assess additional costs, the 
contracting officer shall consider--
    (1) The frequency of delays, reinspection, or retest under both 
current and prior contracts;
    (2) The cause of such delay, reinspection, or retest; and
    (3) The expense of recovering the additional costs.

[[Page 371]]


<R05>
246.470-4  Maintenance of Government records.

    The contract administration office shall maintain suitable records 
of the quality assurance performance of contractors.


<R05>
246.470-5  Quality evaluation data.

    The contract administration office shall establish a system that 
provides, as a minimum, for the collection, evaluation, and use of--
    (a) Quality data developed by the contractor during performance;
    (b) Data developed by the Government through contract quality 
assurance actions; and
    (c) Reports by users and customers.


<R05>
246.471  Authorizing shipment of supplies.

    (a) General. (1) Ordinarily, a representative of the contract 
administration office signs or stamps the shipping papers that accompany 
Government source-inspected supplies to release them for shipment. This 
is done for both prime and subcontracts.
    (2) An alternative procedure (see paragraph (b) of this section) 
permits the contractor to assume the responsibility for releasing the 
supplies for shipment.
    (3) The alternative procedure may include prime contractor release 
of supplies inspected at a subcontractor's facility.
    (4) The use of the alternative procedure releases DoD manpower to 
perform technical functions by eliminating routine signing or stamping 
of the papers accompanying each shipment.
    (b) Alternative Procedures--Contract Release for Shipment. (1) The 
contract administration office may authorize, in writing, the contractor 
to release supplies for shipment when--
    (i) The stamping or signing of the shipping papers by a 
representative of the contract administration office interferes with the 
operation of the Government contract quality assurance program or takes 
too much of the Government representative's time;
    (ii) There is sufficient continuity of production to permit the 
Government to establish a systematic and continuing evaluation of the 
contractor's control of quality; and
    (iii) The contractor has a record of satisfactory quality, including 
that pertaining to preparation for shipment.
    (2) The contract administration office shall withdraw, in writing, 
the authorization when there is an indication that the conditions in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this subsection no longer exist.
    (3) When the alternative procedure is used, require the contractor 
to--
    (i) Type or stamp, and sign, the following statement on the required 
copy or copies of the shipping paper(s), or on an attachment--

    The supplies in this shipment--
    1. Have been subjected to and have passed all examinations and tests 
required by the contract;
    2. Were shipped in accordance with authorized shipping instructions;
    3. Conform to the quality, identity, and condition called for by the 
contract; and
    4. Are of the quantity shown on this document.
    This shipment was--
    1. Released in accordance with section 246.471 of the Defense FAR 
Supplement; and
    2. Authorized by (name and title of the authorized representative of 
the contract administration office) in a letter dated (date of 
authorizing letter). (Signature and title of contractor's designated 
official.)

    (ii) Release and process, in accordance with established 
instructions, the DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, 
or other authorized receiving report.


<R05>
246.472  Inspection stamping.

    (a) There are two DoD quality inspection approval marking designs 
(stamps). Both stamps are used--
    (1) Only by, or under the direct supervision of, the Government 
representative; and
    (2) For both prime and subcontracts.
    (b) The designs of the two stamps and the differences in their uses 
are--
    (1) Partial (Circle) Inspection Approval Stamp. (i) This circular 
stamp is used to identify material inspected for conformance to only a 
portion of the contract quality requirements.
    (ii) Further inspection is to be performed at another time and/or 
place.
    (iii) Material not inspected is so listed on the associated DD Form 
250 (Material Inspection and Receiving Report), packing list, or 
comparable document.

[[Page 372]]

    (2) Complete (Square) Inspection Approval Stamp. (i) This square 
stamp is used to identify material completely inspected for all contract 
quality requirements at source.
    (ii) The material satisfies all contract quality requirements and is 
in complete conformance with all contract quality requirements 
applicable at the time and place of inspection.
    (iii) Complete inspection approval establishes that material which 
once was partially approved has subsequently been completely approved.
    (iv) One imprint of the square stamp voids multiple imprints of the 
circle stamp.
    (c) The marking of each item is neither required nor prohibited. 
Ordinarily, the stamping of shipping containers, packing lists, or 
routing tickets serves to adequately indicate the status of the material 
and to control or facilitate its movement.
    (d) Stamping material does not mean that it has been accepted by the 
Government. Evidence of acceptance is ordinarily a signed acceptance 
certificate on the DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving 
Report.
    (e) Policies and procedures regarding the use of National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) quality status stamps are 
contained in NASA publications. When requested by NASA centers, the DoD 
inspector shall use NASA quality status stamps in accordance with 
current NASA requirements.

authorized representative of the Government.
    Defect, as used in this subpart, means any condition or 
characteristic in any supply or service furnished by the contractor 
under the contract that is not in compliance with the requirements of 
the contract.


<R05>
246.702  General.

    (c) Departments and agencies shall establish procedures to track and 
accumulate data on warranty costs.


<R05>
246.703  Criteria for use of warranties.

    The use of warranties in the acquisition of weapon systems is 
mandatory (10 U.S.C. 2403) unless a waiver is authorized (see 246.770-
8).
    (b) Cost. Contracting officers may include the cost of a warranty as 
part of an item's price or as a separate contract line item.


<R05>
246.704  Authority for use of warranties.

    The chief of the contracting office must approve use of a warranty, 
except in acquisitions for--
    (1) Weapon systems (see 246.770);

[[Page 373]]

    (2) Commercial items (see FAR 46.709);
    (3) Technical data, unless the warranty provides for extended 
liability (see 246.708);
    (4) Supplies and services in fixed-price type contracts containing 
quality assurance provisions that reference higher-level contract 
quality requirements (see 246.202-4); or
    (5) Supplies and services in construction contracts when using the 
warranties that are contained in Federal, military, or construction 
guide specifications.
[56 FR 36460, July 31, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 33145, June 27, 1995; 
60 FR 61599, Nov. 30, 1995]


<R05>
246.705  Limitations.

    (a) Warranties in the clause at 252.246-7001, Warranty of Data, are 
also an exception to the prohibition on use of warranties in cost-
reimbursement contracts.


<R05>
246.706  Warranty terms and conditions.

    (b)(5) Markings. Use MIL Standard 129, Marking for Shipments and 
Storage, and MIL Standard 130, Identification Marking of U.S. Military 
Property, when marking warranty items.


<R05>
246.708  Warranties of data.

    Obtain warranties on technical data when practicable and cost 
effective. Consider the factors in FAR 46.703 in deciding whether to 
obtain warranties of technical data. Consider the following in deciding 
whether to use extended liability provisions--
    (1) The likelihood that correction or replacement of the 
nonconforming data, or a price adjustment, will not give adequate 
protection to the Government; and
    (2) The effectiveness of the additional remedy as a deterrent 
against furnishing nonconforming data.


<R05>
246.710  Contract clauses.

    (1) Use a clause substantially the same as the clause at 252.246-
7001, Warranty of Data, in solicitations and contracts that include the 
clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software, 
and there is a need for greater protection or period of liability than 
provided by other contract clauses, such as the clauses at--

    (i) FAR 52.246-3, Inspection of Supplies--Cost-Reimbursement;
    (ii) FAR 52.246-6, Inspection--Time-and-Material and Labor-Hour;
    (iii) FAR 52.246-8, Inspection of Research and Development--Cost-

Alternate I when extended liability is desired and a fixed price 
incentive contract is contemplated.
    (3) Use the clause at 252.246-7001, Warranty of Data, with its 
Alternate II when extended liability is desired and a firm fixed price 
contract is contemplated.
    (4) Use the clause at 252.246-7002, Warranty of Construction 
(Germany), in solicitations and contracts for construction when a fixed-
price contact will be awarded and contract performance will be in 
Germany.

<R05>
246.770  Warranties in weapon system acquisitions.

    This section sets forth policies and procedures for use of 
warranties in contracts for weapon system production.


<R05>
246.770-1  Definitions.

    As used in this section--
    (a) At no additional cost to the Government means--
    (1) At no increase in price for firm fixed price contracts;
    (2) At no increase in target or ceiling price for fixed price 
incentive contracts (see also FAR 46.707); or
    (3) At no increase in estimated cost or fee for cost-reimbursement 
contracts.
    (b) Design and manufacturing requirements means structural and 
engineering plans and manufacturing particulars, including precise 
measurements, tolerances, materials and finished product tests for the 
weapon system being produced.
    (c) Essential performance requirements means the operating 
capabilities and

[[Page 374]]

maintenance and reliability characteristics of a weapon system that the 
agency head determines to be necessary to fulfill the military 
requirement.
    (d) Initial production quantity means the number of units of a 
weapon system contracted for in the first program year of full-scale 
production.
    (e) Mature full-scale production means follow-on production of a 
weapon system after manufacture of the lesser of the initial production 
quantity or one-tenth of the eventual total production quantity.
    (f) Weapon system means a system or major subsystem used directly by 
the Armed Forces to carry out combat missions.
    (1) The term includes, but is not limited to, the following (if 
intended for use in carrying out combat missions)--
    (i) Tracked and wheeled combat vehicles;
    (ii) Self-propelled, towed and fixed guns, howitzers and mortars;
    (iii) Helicopters;
    (iv) Naval vessels;
    (v) Bomber, fighter, reconnaissance and electronic warfare aircraft;
    (vi) Strategic and tactical missiles including launching systems;
    (vii) Guided munitions;
    (viii) Military surveillance, command, control, and communication 
systems;
    (ix) Military cargo vehicles and aircraft;
    (x) Mines;
    (xi) Torpedoes;
    (xii) Fire control systems;
    (xiii) Propulsion systems;
    (xiv) Electronic warfare systems; and
    (xv) Safety and survival systems.
    (2) The term does not include--
    (i) Commercial items;
    (ii) Spares, repairs, or replenishment parts; or
    (iii) Related support equipment (e.g., ground-handling equipment, 
training devices and accessories, ammunition), unless an effective 
warranty would require inclusion of such items.


<R05>
246.770-2  Policy.

    (a) Under 10 U.S.C. 2403, departments and agencies may not contract 
for the production of a weapon system with a unit weapon system cost of 
more than $100,000 or an estimated total procurement cost in excess of 
$10 million unless--
    (1) Each contractor for the weapon system provides the Government 
written warranties that--
    (i) The weapon system conforms to the design and manufacturing 
requirements in the contract (or any modifications to that contract),
    (ii) The weapon system is free from all defects in materials and 
workmanship at the time of acceptance or delivery as specified in the 
contract; and
    (iii) The weapon system, if manufactured in mature full-scale 
production, conforms to the essential performance requirements of the 
contract (or any modification to that contract); and
    (2) The contract terms provide that, in the event the weapon system 
fails to meet the terms of the above warranties, the contracting officer 
may--
    (i) Require the contractor to promptly take necessary corrective 
action (e.g., repair, replace, and/or redesign) at no additional cost to 
the Government;
    (ii) Require the contractor to pay costs reasonably incurred by the 
Government in taking necessary corrective action, or
    (iii) Equitably reduce the contract price; or
    (3) A waiver is granted under 246.770-8.
    (b) Contracting officers and program managers shall consider the 
following when developing and negotiating weapon system warranty 
provisions:
    (1) Warranties may not be appropriate in all situations, and a 
waiver should be sought if a warranty would not be cost-effective or 
would otherwise be inconsistent with the national defense. In drafting 
warranty provisions, the drafters must ensure they understand the 
planned operational, maintenance, and supply concepts of the weapon 
system to be fielded, and must structure a warranty that matches those 
concepts. A warranty plan should be prepared in consonance with 
development of the warranty provision early in the weapon system's life 
cycle. The plan should contain program warranty strategy, terms of the 
warranty, administration and enforcement

[[Page 375]]

requirements, and should be coordinated with the user and support 
activities.
    (2) A cost/benefit analysis must be accomplished in support of each 
warranty (see 246.770-7). The cost/benefit analysis compares all costs 
associated with the warranty to the expected benefits. An estimate shall 
be made of the likelihood of defects and the estimated cost of 
correcting such defects. Also, if substantive changes are required to 
the planned operational, maintenance, or supply concepts, any increased 
costs should be weighed against the expected benefits in deciding 
whether a warranty is cost-effective.
    (3) The Warranty Guidebook prepared by the Defense Systems 
Management College, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5426, is a valuable reference 
that can assist in the development, negotiation, and administration of 
an effective weapon system warranty.
    (c) Contracting officers may require warranties that provide greater 
coverage and remedies than specified in paragraph (a) of this 
subsection.
    (d) When the contract includes an essential performance requirement 
warranty, the warranty must identify redesign as a remedy available to 
the Government.
    (1) The period during which redesign must be available as a remedy 
shall not end before operational use, operational testing, or a 
combination of operational use and operational testing has demonstrated 
that the warranted item's design has satisfied the essential performance 
requirements.
    (2) When essential performance requirements are warranted in 
contracts with alternate source contractors, do not include redesign as 
a remedy available to the Government under those contracts until the 
alternate source has manufactured the first ten percent of the eventual 
total production quantity anticipated to be acquired from that 
contractor (see 246.770-5).
[56 FR 36460, July 31, 1991, as amended at 59 FR 7749, Feb. 29, 1996]


<R05>
246.770-3  Tailoring warranty terms and conditions.

    (a) Since the objectives and circumstances vary considerably among 
weapon system acquisition programs, contracting officers must tailor the 
required warranties on a case-by-case basis. The purpose of tailoring is 
to get a cost-effective warranty in light of the technical risk, or 
other program uncertainties, while ensuring that the Government still 
acquires the basic warranties described in 246.770-2. Tailoring shall 
not be used as a substitute for acquiring a warranty waiver.
    (1) Tailoring may affect remedies, exclusions, limitations, and 
duration provided such are consistent with the specific requirements of 
this section (see also FAR 46.706).
    (2) Clearly relate the duration of any warranty to the contract 
requirements and allow sufficient time to demonstrate achievement of the 
requirements after acceptance.
    (3) Tailor the terms of the warranty, if appropriate, to exclude 
certain defects for specified supplies (exclusions) or to limit the 
contractor's liability under the terms of the warranty (limitations).
    (4) Structure broader and more comprehensive warranties when 
advantageous or narrow the scope when appropriate. For example, it may 
be inappropriate to require warranty of all essential performance 
requirements for a contractor that did not design the system.
    (b) DoD policy is to exclude any terms that cover contractor 
liability for loss, damage, or injury to third parties from warranty 
clauses.
    (c) Ensure acquisition of subsystems and components in a manner 
which does not affect the validity of the weapon system warranty.


<R05>
246.770-4  Warranties on Government-furnished property.

    Contracting officers shall not require contractors to provide the 
warranties specified in 246.770-2 on any property furnished the 
contractor by the Government, except for--
    (a) Defects in installation;
    (b) Installation or modification in such a manner that invalidates a 
warranty provided by the manufacturer of the property; or
    (c) Modifications made to the property by the contractor.

[[Page 376]]


<R05>
246.770-5  Exemption for alternate source contractor(s).

    Agency heads may exempt alternate source contractor(s) from the 
essential performance warranty requirements of 246.770-2(a)(1)(iii) 
until that contractor manufactures the first ten percent of its 
anticipated total production quantity.


<R05>
246.770-6  Applicability to foreign military sales (FMS).

    (a) The warranty requirements of 246.770-2 are not mandatory for FMS 
production contracts. DoD policy is to obtain the same warranties on 
conformance to design and manufacturing requirements and against defects 
in material and workmanship as it gets for U.S. supplies.
    (b) DoD normally will not obtain essential performance warranties 
for FMS purchasers. However, where contracting officer cannot separately 
identify the cost for the warranty of essential performance 
requirements, the foreign purchaser shall be given the same warranty 
that the United States gets.
    (c) If an FMS purchaser expressly requests a performance warranty in 
the letter of acceptance, the Government will exert its best efforts to 
obtain the same warranty obtained for U.S. equipment. Or, if 
specifically requested by the FMS purchaser, obtain a unique warranty.
    (d) The costs for warranties for FMS purchasers may be different 
from the costs for such warranties for the Government due to factors 
such as overseas transportation and any tailoring to reflect the unique 
aspects of the FMS purchaser.
    (e) Ensure that FMS purchasers bear all of the acquisition and 
administrative costs of any warranties.


<R05>
246.770-7  Cost-benefit analysis.

    (a) In assessing the cost effectiveness of a proposed warranty, 
perform an analysis which considers both the quantitative and 
qualitative costs and benefits of the warranty. Consider--
    (1) Costs of warranty acquisition, administration, enforcement, and 
user costs, and any costs resulting from limitations imposed by the 
warranty provisions;
    (2) Costs incurred during development specifically for the purpose 
of reducing production warranty risks;
    (3) Logistical and operational benefits as a result of the warranty 
as well as the impact of the additional contractor motivation provided 
by the warranty.
    (b) Where possible, make a comparison with the costs of obtaining 
and enforcing similar warranties on similar systems.
    (c) Document the analysis in the contract file. If the warranty is 
not cost effective, initiate a waiver request under 246.770-8.


<R05>
246.770-8  Waiver and notification procedures.

    (a) The Secretary of Defense has delegated waiver authority within 
the limits specified in 10 U.S.C. 2403. The waiving authority for the 
defense agencies is the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and 
Technology). Submit defense agency waiver requests to the Director, 
Defense Procurement, for processing. The waiving authority for the 
military departments is the Secretary of the department with authority 
to redelegate no lower than an Assistant Secretary. The waiving 
authority may waive one or more of the weapon system warranties required 
by 246.770-2 if--
    (1) The waiver is in the interests of national defense; or

waiving official must notify the Committees in writing of an intention 
to waive one or more of the required warranties. Include an explanation 
of the reasons for the waiver in the notice. Ordinarily provide the 
notice 30 days before granting a waiver.
    (2) Weapon systems not in mature full-scale production. Although a 
waiver is not required, if a production contract for a major weapon 
system not yet in mature full-scale production will not

[[Page 377]]

include a warranty on essential performance requirements, the waiving 
officials must comply with the notice requirements for major weapon 
systems.
    (c) Departments and agencies shall issue procedures for processing 
waivers and notifications to Congress.
    (1) Requests for waiver shall include--
    (i) A brief description of the weapon system and its stage of 
production, e.g., the number of units delivered and anticipated to be 
delivered during the life of the program;
    (ii) Identification of the specific warranty or warranties required 
by 246.770-2(a)(1) for which the waiver is requested;
    (iii) The duration of the waiver if it is to go beyond the contract;
    (iv) The rationale for the waiver (if the waiver request is based on 
cost effectiveness, include the results of the cost-benefit analysis);
    (v) A description of the warranties or other techniques used to 
ensure acceptable field performance of the weapon system, e.g., 
warranties, commercial or other guarantees obtained on individual 
components; and
    (vi) Exercise date of the warranty option, if applicable.
    (2) Notifications shall include--
    (i) A brief description of the weapon system and its stage of 
production; and
    (ii) Rationale for not obtaining a warranty.
    (3) Keep a written record of each waiver granted and notification 
and report made, together with supporting documentation such as a cost-
benefit analysis, for use in answering inquiries.

<R05>
247.270  Stevedoring contracts.


<R05>

    This section contains procedures peculiar to stevedoring. Other 
portions of the FAR and DFARS dealing with service contracting also 
apply to stevedoring contracts.


<R05>
247.270-2  Definitions.

    Commodity rate is--

[[Page 379]]

    (1) The price quoted for handling a ton (weight or measurement) of a 
specified commodity.
    (2) Computed by dividing the hourly stevedoring gang cost by the 
estimated number of tons of the specified commodity which can be handled 
in 1 hour.
    Gang cost is--
    (1) The total hourly wages paid to the workers in the gang, in 
accordance with the collective bargaining agreement between the maritime 
industry and the unions at a specific port; and
    (2) Payments for workmen's compensation, social security taxes, 
unemployment insurance, taxes, liability and property damage insurance, 
general and administrative expenses, and profit.
    Stevedoring is the--
    (1) Loading of cargo from an agreed point of rest on a pier or 
lighter and its storage aboard a vessel; or
    (2) Breaking out and discharging of cargo from any space in the 
vessel to an agreed point of rest dockside or in a lighter.

247.270-3  Type of contract.

    Normally, use an indefinite-quantity type contract.


<R05>
247.270-4  Technical provisions.

    (a) Because conditions vary at different ports, and sometimes within 
the same port, it is not practical to develop standard technical 
provisions covering all phases of stevedoring operations.
    (b) When including car loading and unloading or other dock and 
terminal work under a stevedoring contract, include these requirements 
as separate items of work.


<R05>

    At a minimum, require that offers include--
    (a) Tonnage or commodity rates which apply to the bulk of the cargo 
worked under normal conditions;
    (b) Labor-hour rates which apply to services not covered by 
commodity rates, or to work performed under hardship conditions; and
    (c) Cost of equipment rental.
[59 FR 50852, Oct. 6, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 247.270-6  Award of contract.

    Make the award to the contractor submitting the offer most 
advantageous to the Government, considering cost or price and other 
factors specified elsewhere in the solicitation. Evaluation will 
include, but is not limited to--
    (a) Total estimated cost of tonnage to be moved at commodity rates;
    (b) Estimated cost at labor-hour rates; and
    (c) Cost of equipment rental.

party to terminate the contract;
    (e) 252.247-7004, Indefinite Quantities-Fixed Charges, when the

both services in a single schedule. However, items shall follow the same 
sequential order as in the basic format.
    (6) Process any modification of schedule format, other than those 
authorized in paragraphs (c) (1) through (5) of this subsection, as a

247.570  Scope.

    This subpart--
    (a) Implements the Cargo Preference Act of 1904, 10 U.S.C. 2631, 
which applies to the ocean transportation of cargo owned by, or destined 
for use by, the DoD.
    (b) Does not specifically implement the Cargo Preference Act of 
1954, 46 U.S.C. 1241(b). The 1954 Act is applicable to the DoD, but 
DFARS coverage is not required because compliance with the 1904 Act 
historically has resulted in the DoD exceeding the 1954 Act's 
requirements.
    (c) Is an approved class deviation from FAR subpart 47.5 in its 
entirety (but see 247.571(c)).


<R05>
247.571  Policy.

    (a) DoD contractors shall transport supplies, as defined in the 
clause at 252.247-7023, Transportation of Supplies by Sea, exclusively 
on U.S.-flag vessels unless--
    (1) Those vessels are not available, and notices are given and 
approvals received in accordance with this subpart;
    (2) The Secretary of the Navy determines that the freight charged is 
excessive or unreasonable; or
    (3) The contracting officer finds that the charges to the Government 
are higher than charges to private persons for the transportation of 
like goods.
    (b) Contracts shall provide for the use of Government-owned vessels 
when security classifications prohibit the use of other than Government-
owned vessels.
    (c)(1) Any vessel used under a time charter contract for the 
transportation of supplies shall have any reflagging or repair work, as 
defined in the clause at 252.247-7205, Reflagging or Repair Work, 
performed in the United States or its territories, if the reflagging or 
repair work is performed--
    (i) On a vessel for which the contractor submitted an offer in 
response to the solicitation for the contract; and
    (ii) Prior to acceptance of the vessel by the Government.
    (2) The Secretary of Defense may waive this requirement if the 
Secretary determines that such waiver is critical to the national 
security of the United States.
    (d) The Cargo Preference Act of 1904 does not apply to ocean 
transportation of--

[[Page 384]]

    (1) Products obtained for contributions to foreign assistance 
programs; or
    (2) Products owned by agencies other than the DoD. In these cases, 
FAR subpart 47.5 applies.

<R05>
247.572  Procedures.


<R05>
247.572-1  Ocean transportation incidental to a contract for supplies, services, or construction.

    (a) This subsection applies when ocean transportation is not the 
purpose of the contract. However, effective May 1, 1996, this subsection 
does not apply to subcontracts for the acquisition of commercial items 
or commercial components (see 212.504(a)(xxii)).
    (b) The contracting officer shall obtain assistance from the 
cognizant transportation activity (see 247.105), in developing--
    (1) The Government estimate for transportation costs, irrespective 
of whether freight will be paid directly by the Government;
    (2) Shipping instructions and delivery terms for inclusion in 
solicitations and contracts that may involve transportation of supplies 
by sea.
    (c) The contracting officer shall ask each offeror whether it will 
transport supplies by sea if awarded the contract (see 247.573(a)). Even 
if the successful offeror responds that it does not anticipate sea 
transport of supplies, it may discover during contract performance that 
ocean transportation is required. In that event, the Act will apply to 
the contract, and it must--
    (1) Notify the Government that it now intends to use ocean 
transportation;
    (2) Use U.S.-flag vessels unless certain conditions exist (see 
247.571(a)); and
    (3) Comply with the other requirements of the clause at 252.247-
7023, Transportation of Supplies by Sea.
    (d) When the contracting officer is notified that the contractor or 
subcontractor considers that--
    (1) No U.S.-flag vessels are available, the contracting officer 
shall request confirmation of the nonavailability from the Director, 
Office of Contracts and Business Management, Military Sealift Command 
(MSC).
    (2) The freight charges to the Government, the contractor or any 
subcontractor, are higher than charges for transportation of like goods 
to private persons, the contracting officer may approve any request for 
a waiver of the requirement to ship on U.S.-flag vessels for a 
particular shipment.
    (i) Prior to granting a waiver, the contracting officer shall 
request advice, oral or written, from the Commander, MSC.
    (ii) In advising the contracting officer whether to grant the 
waiver, the Commander, MSC, shall consider, as appropriate, evidence 
from--
    (A) Published tariffs;
    (B) Industry publications;
    (C) The Maritime Administration; and
    (D) Any other available sources.
    (3) The freight charged by U.S.-flag carriers is considered 
excessive or otherwise unreasonable, the contracting officer shall 
forward a report to the Commander, MSC, through the head of the 
contracting activity, and the Director, Office of Contracts and Business 
Management, MSC.
    (i) The report shall be in determination and finding format, and--
    (A) Take into consideration that the 1904 Act is, in part, a subsidy 
of the U.S.-flag commercial shipping industry that recognizes that lower 
prices may be available from foreign shippers;
    (B) Consider, accordingly, not only excessive profits to the vessel 
owner, if ascertainable, but also excessive costs (i.e., costs beyond 
the economic penalty normally incurred by excluding foreign competition) 
resulting from the use of U.S.-flag vessels in extraordinarily 
inefficient circumstances;
    (C) Include, as appropriate--
    (1) An analysis of whether the cost is excessive, taking into 
account factors such as the differential between freight charges by the 
U.S.-flag carrier and an estimate of what foreign-flag carriers would 
charge based upon a price analysis;
    (2) A comparison of U.S.-flag rates charged on comparable routes;
    (3) Efficiency of operation regardless of rate differential (i.e., 
suitability of

[[Page 385]]

the vessel for the required transportation in terms of cargo 
requirements/vessel capacity; the commercial reasonableness of vessel 
positioning required, etc.); and
    (4) Any other relevant economic and financial considerations.
    (D) Consider that the fact that it would be less expensive to use a 
foreign-flag vessel is not a sufficient basis, on its own, to determine 
that the freight rate proposed by the U.S.-flag carrier is excessive or 
otherwise unreasonable. However, such a differential may indicate a need 
for further review.
    (ii) If the Commander, MSC, concurs with the contracting officer, 
the Commander will forward the report to the Secretary of the Navy, via 
ASN(RDA)(PP), for a determination as to whether the freight charges are 
excessive or otherwise unreasonable.

<R05>
247.572-2  Direct purchase of ocean transportation services.

    (a) This subsection applies when ocean transportation is the 
principal purpose of the contract, including--
    (1) Time charters;
    (2) Voyage charters;
    (3) Contracts of affreightment;
    (4) Dedicated contractor contracts of affreightment;
    (5) Ocean bills of lading; and
    (6) Subcontracts under Government contracts or agreements for ocean 
transportation services.
    (b) Coordinate these acquisitions, as appropriate, with the MSC in 
accordance with DoDD 5160.10, Single Manager Assignment for Ocean 
Transportation.
    (c) The Commander, MSC, is authorized to make any determination as 
to the availability of U.S.-flag vessels, in order to ensure the proper 
utilization of Government and private U.S. vessels.
    (d) All solicitations for ocean transportation services for supplies 
owned by the military departments shall provide a preference for U.S.-
flag vessels as an evaluation factor.
    (e) The contracting officer shall not award a contract of the type 
described in paragraph (a) of this subsection for a foreign-flag vessel 
unless--
    (1) The contracting officer determines that no U.S.-flag vessels are 
available, and obtains approval of the Commander, MSC; or
    (2) The contracting officer determines that the freight charges 
proposed by U.S.-flag vessels to the Government are higher than charges 
to private persons for transportation of like goods, and obtains the 
approval of the Commander; MSC; or
    (3) The Secretary of the Navy determines (see paragraph (f) of this 
subsection) that the freight charges for U.S.-flag vessels are excessive 
or otherwise unreasonable.
    (f) When the contracting officer concludes, based solely on economic 
considerations, that the charge offered for a U.S.-flag vessel is 
excessive or otherwise unreasonable, the contracting officer will send a 
report through the head of the contracting activity to the Commander, 
MSC.
    (1) The fact that it would be less expensive to use a foreign-flag 
vessel is an insufficient basis, on its own, to determine that the 
freight rate proposed by the U.S.-flag carrier is excessive or otherwise 
unreasonable. However, such a differential may indicate a need for 
further review.
    (2) The Commander, MSC, will forward the report, if in agreement 
with the contracting officer, to the Secretary of the Navy for a 
determination.
    (3) The report shall be in determination and finding format; take 
into consideration the factors in 247.572-1(d)(3); and include, as 
appropriate--
    (i) An analysis of the carrier's cost in accordance with FAR subpart 
15.8, or profit in accordance with DFARS subpart 215.9. The costs or 
profit should not be so high as to make it unreasonable to apply the 
preference for U.S.-flag vessels;
    (ii) A description of efforts taken pursuant to FAR 15.803(d), to 
negotiate a reasonable price. For the purpose of FAR 15.803(d), this 
report is the referral to higher authority; and
    (iii) An analysis of whether the cost is excessive (i.e., cost 
beyond the economic penalty normally incurred by excluding foreign 
competition), taking into consideration such factors as--
    (A) The differential between freight charges by the U.S.-flag 
carrier and an

[[Page 386]]

estimate of what foreign-flag carriers would charge based upon a price 
analysis;
    (B) A comparison of rates charged by other U.S.-flag carriers on 
comparable routes;
    (C) Efficiency of operation regardless of rate differential (i.e., 
suitability of the vessel capacity/cargo requirements; the commercial 
reasonableness of the vessel positioning required, etc.); and
    (D) Any other relevant economic and financial considerations 
affecting the Government.

<R05>
249.501  General.


<R05>
249.501-70  Special termination costs.

    (a) The clause at 252.249-7000, Special Termination Costs, may be 
used in an incrementally funded contract when its use is approved by the 
agency head.
    (b) The clause is authorized when--
    (1) The contract term is 2 years or more;
    (2) The contract is estimated to require--
    (i) Total RDT&E financing in excess of $25 million; or
    (ii) Total production investment in excess of $100 million; and
    (3) Adequate funds are available to cover the contingent reserve 
liability for special termination costs.
    (c) The contractor and the contracting officer must agree upon an 
amount that represents their best estimate of the total special 
termination costs to which the contractor would be entitled in the event 
of termination of the contract. Insert this amount in paragraph (c) of 
the clause.
    (d)(1) Consider substituting an alternate paragraph (c) for 
paragraph (c) of the basic clause when--
    (i) The contract covers an unusually long performance period; or
    (ii) The contractor's cost risk associated with contingent special 
termination costs is expected to fluctuate extensively over the period 
of the contract.
    (2) The alternate paragraph (c) should provide for periodic 
negotiation and adjustment of the amount reserved for special 
termination costs. Occasions for periodic adjustment may include--
    (i) The Government's incremental assignment of funds to the 
contract;
    (ii) The time when certain performance milestones are accomplished 
by the contractor; or

[[Page 392]]

    (iii) Other specific time periods agreed upon by the contracting 
officer and the contractor.


<R04>
            Subpart 249.70--Special Termination Requirements


<R05>
249.7000  Terminated contracts with Canadian Commercial Corporation.

    (a) Terminate contracts with the Canadian Commercial Corporation in 
accordance with--
    (1) The Letter of Agreement (LOA) between the Department of Defence 
Production (Canada) and the U.S. DoD, ``Canadian Agreement'' (for a copy 
of the LOA or for questions on its currency, contact the Foreign 
Contracting Directorate, Office of the Director of Defense Procurement, 
(703) 697-9351, DSN 227-9351));
    (2) Policies in the Canadian Agreement and part 249; and
    (3) The Manual of Procedure on Termination of Contracts, Department 
of Supply and Services (Canada).
    (b) Contracting officers shall ensure that the Canadian Commercial 
Corporation submits termination settlement proposals in the format 
prescribed in FAR 49.602 and that they contain the amount of settlements 
with subcontractors. The termination contracting officer (TCO) shall 
prepare an appropriate settlement agreement. (See FAR 49.603.) The 
letter transmitting a settlement proposal must certify--
    (1) That disposition of inventory has been completed; and
    (2) That the Contracts Settlement Committee of the Supply and 
Services Canada (SSC) has approved settlements with Canadian 
subcontractors when the Manual of Procedure on Termination of Contracts, 
SSC, requires such approval.
    (c)(1) The Canadian Commercial Corporation will--
    (i) Settle all Canadian subcontractor termination claims under the 
Canadian Agreement; and
    (ii) Submit schedules listing serviceable and usable contractor 
inventory for screening to the TCO (see FAR 45.6).
    (2) After screening, the TCO must provide guidance to the Canadian 
Commercial Corporation for disposition of the contractor inventory.
    (3) Settlement of Canadian subcontractor claims are not subject to 
the approval and ratification of the TCO. However, when the proposed 
negotiated settlement exceeds the total contract price of the prime 
contract, the TCO shall obtain from the U.S. contracting officer prior 
to final settlement--
    (i) Ratification of the proposed settlement; and
    (ii) A contract modification increasing the contract price and 
obligating the additional funds.
    (d) The Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC) should send all 
termination settlement proposals submitted by U.S. subcontractors and 
suppliers to the TCO, Defense Contract Management Area Operations, 
Ottawa, for settlement. The TCO will inform the CCC of the amount of the 
net settlement of U.S. subcontractors and suppliers so that this amount 
can be included in the CCC termination proposal. The Canadian Commercial 
Corporation is responsible for execution of the settlement agreement 
with these subcontractors.


<R05>

    (a) Congressional notification is required for any termination 
involving a reduction in employment of 100 or more contractor employees. 
Proposed terminations must be cleared through department/agency liaison 
offices before release of the termination notice, or any information on 
the proposed termination, to the contractor.
    (b) Department and agency liaison offices will coordinate timing of 
the congressional notification and public release of the information 
with release of the termination notice to the contractor. Department and 
agency liaison offices are--

250.104  Reports.

    Prepare reports required by this section in accordance with DoDI 
4105.69, Miscellaneous Procurement Report. Department and agency 
supplements identify officials responsible for preparing and processing 
the reports required by this section.


<R05>
250.105  Records.

    (1) Departments and agencies will--
    (i) Prepare a preliminary record when a request for a contract 
adjustment under FAR 50.3 is filed (see 250.305-70).
    (ii) Prepare a final record stating the disposition of the request 
(see 250.306-70).
    (iii) Designate the offices or officials responsible for preparing, 
submitting, and receiving all records required by this part 250. Records 
shall be maintained by the contract adjustment boards of the Army, Navy, 
and Air Force, respectively, and by the headquarters of the defense 
agencies.
    (2) A suggested format for the record is in Table 50-1, Record of 
Request for Adjustment. This format permits the information required for 
the preliminary and final records to be combined on one form.
    (3) The following instructions are provided for those items which 
are not self-explanatory:
    (i) Extent of performance as of date of request. State degree of 
completion of contract; e.g., 50 percent completed or performance not 
yet begun. If work is completed, state date of completion and whether 
final payment has been made.
    (ii) Award procedure. State whether contract was awarded under 
sealed bidding or negotiated procedures. Cite specific authority for 
using other than full and open competition, if applicable, e.g., 10 
U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).
    (iii) Type of contract. State type of contract (see FAR part 16); 
e.g., FFP (firm fixed-price).
    (iv) Category of case. State whether the request involves a 
modification without consideration, a mistake, or an informal 
commitment. If the case involves more than one category, identify both; 
list the most significant category first.
    (v) Amount or description of request. If the request is expressed in 
dollars, state the amount and whether it is an increase or decrease. If 
the request cannot be expressed in monetary terms, provide a brief 
description; e.g., ``Cancellation'' or ``Modification.'' Even if the 
adjustment is not easily expressed in terms of dollars, if the 
contractor has made an estimate in the request, that estimate should be 
stated.
    (vi) Action below Secretarial level. State the disposition of the 
case, the office that took the action and the date the action was taken. 
The disposition should be stated as ``Withdrawn,'' ``Denied,'' 
``Approved,'' or ``Forwarded.'' If the request was approved, in whole or 
in part, state the dollar amount or nature of the action (as explained 
in paragraph (v) of this section). The date should correspond with the 
date of the

[[Page 395]]

memorandum of decision or of the letter forwarding the request to the 
contract adjustment board or other deciding body.
    (vii) Action by contract adjustment board and date. State the 
disposition and date of disposition of the case by the contract 
adjustment board. Provide the same information as for paragraph (vi).
    (viii) Implementation and date. State the appropriate action; e.g., 
``Modification,'' ``New Contract,'' or ``Letter of Denial.''

  Economic Price Adjustment--Basic Steel, Aluminum, Brass, Bronze, or 
                     Copper Mill Products (Jul 1997)

    (a) Definitions.
    As used in this clause--
    Established price means a price which is an established catalog or 
market price for a commercial item sold in substantial quantities to the 
general public.
    Unit price excludes any part of the price which reflects 
requirements for preservation, packaging, and packing beyond standard 
commercial practice.
    (b) The Contractor warrants that the unit price stated for (Identify 
the item) is not in excess of the Contractor's established price in 
effect on the date set for opening of bids (or the contract date if this 
is a negotiated contract) for like quantities of the same item. This 
price is the net price after applying any applicable standard trade 
discounts offered by the Contractor from its catalog, list, or schedule 
price.
    (c) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of 
the amount and effective date of each decrease in any established price.
    (1) Each corresponding contract unit price shall be decreased by the 
same percentage that the established price is decreased.
    (2) This decrease shall apply to items delivered on or after the 
effective date of the decrease in the Contractor's established price.
    (3) This contract shall be modified accordingly.
    (d) If the Contractor's established price is increased after the 
date set for opening of bids (or the contract date if this is a 
negotiated contract), upon the Contractor's written request to the 
Contracting Officer, the corresponding contract unit price shall be 
increased by the same percentage that the established price is 
increased, and this contract shall be modified accordingly, provided--
    (1) The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price under 
this contract shall not exceed 10 percent of the original contract unit 
price;
    (2) The increased contract unit price shall be effective on the 
effective date of the increase in the applicable established price if

[[Page 414]]

the Contractor's written request is received by the Contracting Officer 
within ten days of the change. If it is not, the effective date of the 
increased unit price shall be the date of receipt of the request by the 
Contracting Officer; and
    (3) The increased contract unit price shall not apply to quantities 
scheduled for delivery before the effective date of the increased 
contract unit price unless the Contractor's failure to deliver before 
that date results from causes beyond the control and without the fault 
or negligence of the Contractor, within the meaning of the Default 
clause of this contract.
    (4) The Contracting Officer shall not execute a modification 
incorporating an increase in a contract unit price under this clause 
until the increase is verified.
    (e) Within 30 days after receipt of the Contractor's written 
request, the Contracting Officer may cancel, without liability to either 
party, any portion of the contract affected by the requested increase 
and not delivered at the time of such cancellation, except as follows--
    (1) The Contractor may, after that time, deliver any items that were 
completed or in the process of manufacture at the time of receipt of the 
cancellation notice, provided the Contractor notifies the Contracting 
Officer of such items within 10 days after the Contractor receives the 
cancellation notice.
    (2) The Government shall pay for those items at the contract unit 
price increased to the extent provided by paragraph (d) of this clause.
    (3) Any standard steel supply item shall be deemed to be in the 
process of manufacture when the steel for that item is in the state of 
processing after the beginning of the furnace melt.
    (f) Pending any cancellation of this contract under paragraph (e) of 
this clause, or if there is no cancellation, the Contractor shall 
continue deliveries according to the delivery schedule of the contract. 
The Contractor shall be paid for those deliveries at the contract unit 
price increased to the extent provided by paragraph (d) of this clause.

252.216-7001  Economic price adjustment--nonstandard steel items.

    As prescribed in 216.203-4-70(b), use the following clause:

      Economic Price Adjustment--Nonstandard Steel Items (Jul 1997)

    (a) Definitions.
    As used in this clause--
    Base labor index means the average of the labor indices for the 
three months which consist of the month of bid opening (or offer 
submission) and the months immediately preceding and following that 
month.
    Base steel index means the Contractor's established price (see note 
6) including all applicable extras of $________ per __________ (see note 
1) for __________ (see note 2) on the date set for bid opening (or the 
date of submission of the offer).
    Current labor index means the average of the labor indices for the 
month in which delivery of supplies is required to be made and the month 
preceding.
    Current steel index means the Contractor's established price (see 
note 6) for that item, including all applicable extras in effect 
________ days (see note 3) prior to the first day of the month in which 
delivery is required.
    Established price is--
    (1) A price which is an established catalog or market price of a 
commercial item sold in substantial quantities to the general public; 
and
    (2) The net price after applying any applicable standard trade 
discounts offered by the Contractor from its catalog, list, or schedule 
price. (But see Note 6.)
    Labor index means the average straight time hourly earnings of the 
Contractor's employees in the ________ shop of the Contractor's 
__________ plant (see note 4) for any particular month.
    Month means calendar month. However, if the Contractor's accounting 
period does not coincide with the calendar month, then that accounting 
period shall be used in lieu of month.
    (b) Each contract unit price shall be subject to revision, under the 
terms of this clause, to reflect changes in the cost of labor and steel. 
For purpose of this price revision, the proportion of the contract unit 
price attributable to costs of labor not otherwise included in the price 
of the steel item identified under the base steel index definition in 
paragraph (a) shall be ______ percent, and the proportion of the 
contract unit price attributable to the cost of steel shall be ______ 
percent. (See note 5.)
    (c)(1) Unless otherwise specified in this contract, the labor index 
shall be computed by dividing the total straight time earnings of the 
Contractor's employees in the shop identified in paragraph (a) for any 
given month by the total number of straight time hours worked by those 
employees in that month.
    (2) Any revision in a contract unit price to reflect changes in the 
cost of labor shall be computed solely by reference to the ``base labor 
index'' and the ``current labor index.''
    (d) Any revision in a contract unit price to reflect changes in the 
cost of steel shall be

[[Page 415]]

computed solely by reference to the ``base steel index'' and the 
``current steel index.''
    (e)(1) Each contract unit price shall be revised for each month in 
which delivery of supplies is required to be made.
    (2) The revised contract unit price shall apply to the deliveries of 
those quantities required to be made in that month regardless of when 
actual delivery is made.
    (3) Each revised contract unit price shall be computed by adding--
    (i) The adjusted cost of labor (obtained by multiplying ______ 
percent of the contract unit price by a fraction, of which the numerator 
shall be the current labor index and the denominator shall be the base 
labor index);
    (ii) The adjusted cost of steel (obtained by multiplying ______ 
percent of the contract unit price by a fraction, of which the numerator 
shall be the current steel index and the denominator shall be the base 
steel index); and
    (iii) The amount equal to ______ percent of the original contract 
unit price (representing that portion of the unit price which relates 
neither to the cost of labor nor the cost of steel, and which is 
therefore not subject to revision (see note 5)).
    (4) The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price under 
this contract shall not exceed ten percent of the original contract unit 
price.
    (5) Computations shall be made to the nearest one-hundredth of one 
cent.
    (f)(1) Pending any revisions of the contract unit prices, the 
Contractor shall be paid the contract unit price for deliveries made.
    (2) Within 30 days after final delivery (or such other period as may 
be authorized by the Contracting Officer), the Contractor shall furnish 
a statement identifying the correctness of--
    (i) The average straight time hourly earnings of the Contractor's 
employees in the shop identified in paragraph (a) that are relevant to 
the computations of the base labor index and the current labor index; 
and
    (ii) The Contractor's established prices (see note 6), including all 
applicable extras for like quantities of the item that are relevant to 
the computation of the base steel index and the current steel index.
    (3) Upon request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall 
make available all records used in the computation of the labor indices.
    (4) Upon receipt of the statement, the Contracting Officer will 
compute the revised contract unit prices and modify the contract 
accordingly. No modification to this contract will be made pursuant to 
this clause until the Contracting Officer has verified the revised 
established price (see note 6).
    (g)(1) In the event any item of this contract is subject to a total 
or partial termination for convenience, the month in which the 
Contractor receives notice of the termination, if prior to the month in 
which delivery is required, shall be considered the month in which 
delivery of the terminated item is required for the purposes of 
determining the current labor and steel indices under paragraphs (c) and 
(d).
    (2) For any item which is not terminated for convenience, the month 
in which delivery is required under the contract shall continue to apply 
for determining those indices with respect to the quantity of the non-
terminated item.
    (3) If this contract is terminated for default, any price revision 
shall be limited to the quantity of the item which has been delivered by 
the Contractor and accepted by the Government prior to receipt by the 
Contractor of the notice of termination.
    (h) If the Contractor's failure to make delivery of any required 
quantity arises out of causes beyond the control and without the fault 
or negligence of the Contractor, within the meaning of the clause of 
this contract entitled ``Default,'' the quantity not delivered shall be 
delivered as promptly as possible after the cessation of the cause of 
the failure, and the delivery schedule set forth in this contract shall 
be amended accordingly.
    Notes:
    1 Offeror insert the unit price and unit measure of the standard 
steel mill item to be used in the manufacture of the contract item.
    2 Offeror identify the standard steel mill item to be used in the 
manufacture of the contract item.

mill item identified under the base steel index definition will be 
finally fabricated or processed into the contract item.
    5 Offeror insert the same percentage figures for the corresponding 
blanks in paragraphs (b), (e)(3)(i), and (e)(3)(ii). In paragraph 
(e)(3)(iii), insert the percentage representing the difference between 
the sum of the percentages inserted in paragraph (b) and 100 percent.
    6 In negotiated acquisitions of nonstandard steel items, when there 
is no established price or when it is not desirable to use this price, 
this paragraph may refer to another appropriate price basis, e.g., an 
established interplant price.

    (3) The Contracting Officer shall approve progress payments based on

Contracting Officer may require.
    (c) The Government will retain until final completion and acceptance

Where performance and payment bond is required, the offer price shall be

premium of a corporate surety bond.
    (d) If any surety upon any bond furnished in connection with a job 
order under this agreement fails to submit requested reports as to its 
financial condition or otherwise becomes unacceptable to the Government, 
the Contracting Officer may require the Contractor to furnish whatever 
additional security the Contracting Officer determines necessary to 
protect the interests of the Government and of persons supplying labor

of this clause, by written notice of default to the Contractor, 
terminate the whole or any part of a job order if the Contractor fails 
to--
    (1) Make delivery of the supplies or to perform the services within 
the time specified in a job order or any extension;
    (2) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of the job order; 
or
    (3) Perform any of the other provisions of this agreement or a job 
order.
    (b) Except for defaults of subcontractors, the Contractor shall not 
be liable for any excess costs if failure to perform the job order 
arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or 
negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes include acts of 
God or of the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its 
sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine 
restrictions, strikes, freight embargoes, and unusually severe weather.

[[Page 421]]

    (c) If the Contractor's failure to perform is caused by the default 
of a subcontractor, and if such default arises out of causes beyond the 
control of both the Contractor and subcontractor, and without the fault 
or negligence of either, the Contractor shall not be liable for any 
excess costs for failure to perform, unless the supplies or services to 
be furnished by the subcontractor were obtainable from other sources in 
sufficient time to permit the Contractor to perform the job order within 
the time specified.
    (d) If the Government terminates the job order in whole or in part 
as provided in paragraph (a) of this clause--
    (1) The Government may, upon such terms and in such manner as the 
Contracting Officer may deem appropriate, arrange for the completion of 
the work so terminated, at such plant or plants, including that of the 
Contractor, as may be designated by the Contracting Officer.
    (i) The Contractor shall continue the performance of the job order 
to the extent not terminated under the provisions of this clause.
    (ii) If the work is to be completed at the plant, the Government may 
use all tools, machinery, facilities, and equipment of the Contractor 
determined by the Contracting Office to be necessary for that purpose.
    (iii) If the cost to the Government of the work procured or 
completed (after adjusting such cost to exclude the effect of changes in 
the plans and specifications made subsequent to the date of termination) 
exceeds the price fixed for work under the job order (after adjusting 
such price on account of changes in the plans and specifications made 
before the date of termination), the Contractor, or the Contractor's 
surety, if any, shall be liable for such excess.
    (2) The Government, in addition to any other rights provided in this 
clause, may require the Contractor to transfer title and delivery to the 
Government, in the manner and to the extent directed by the Contracting 
Officer, any completed supplies and such partially completed supplies 
and materials, parts, tools, dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, 
information and contract rights (hereinafter called ``manufacturing 
materials'') as the Contractor has specifically produced or specifically 
acquired for the performance of the terminated part of the job order.
    (i) The Contractor shall, upon direction of the Contracting Officer, 
protect and preserve property in possession of the Contractor in which 
the Government has an interest.
    (ii) The Government shall pay to the Contractor the job order price 
for completed items of work delivered to and accepted by the Government, 
and the amount agreed upon by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer 
for manufacturing materials delivered to and accepted by the Government, 
and for the protection and preservation of property. Failure to agree 
shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of 
the Disputes clause.
    (e) If, after notice of termination of the job order, it is 
determined that the Contractor was not in default, or that the default 
was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the 
same as if the notice of termination had been issued for the convenience 
of the Government.
    (f) If the Contractor fails to complete the performance of a job 
order within the time specified, or any extension, the actual damage to 
the Government for the delay will be difficult or impossible to 
determine.
    (1) In lieu of actual damage, the Contractor shall pay to the 
Government as fixed, agreed, and liquidated damages for each calendar 
day of delay the amount, if any, set forth in the job order (prorated to 
the nearest hour for fractional days).
    (2) If the Government terminates the job order, the Contractor shall 
be liable, in addition to the excess costs provided in paragraph (d) of 
this clause, for liquidated damages accruing until such time as the 
Government may reasonably obtain completion of the work.
    (3) The Contractor shall not be charged with liquidated damages when 
the delay arises out of causes beyond the control and without the fault 
or negligence of the Contractor. Subject to the provisions of the 
Disputes clause of the Master Agreement, the Contracting Officer shall 
ascertain the facts and the extent of the delay and shall extend the 
time for performance when in the judgment of the Contracting Officer, 
the findings of fact justify an extension.
    (g) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this 
clause shall not be exclusive and are in addition to any other rights 
and remedies provided by law under this agreement.

Testing clause of the contract to reimburse the Government for 
deficiencies in the amount of butterfat, milk solids non-fat, or total 
solids, reimbursement

[[Page 427]]

shall be determined by the following formula--
    (1) Butterfat. Subtract the total pounds of butterfat delivered from 
the total pounds of butterfat required to be delivered, and multiply the 
remainder by the butterfat value. The butterfat value is 1.30 multiplied 
by the average Central States top ``Wholesale Selling Price'' of Grade 
A, 92 score butter during the monthly period for which the deficiency is 
computed, as reported in the Dairy Market News, published by the 
Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Marketing Service, Madison, 
Wisconsin.
    (2) Milk solids nonfat. Subtract the total pounds of milk solids 
non-fat delivered from the total pounds of milk solids non-fat required 
to be delivered, and multiply the remainder by the milk solids non-fat 
value. The milk solids non-fat value is 1.45 multiplied by the average 
Central States top price for ``Extra Grade, Non-fat Dry Milk, Spray 
(bags)'' during the monthly period for which the deficiency is computed, 
as reported in the Dairy Market News.
    (3) Total solids. Add to the total solids delivered the total amount 
of any shortages for butterfat and milk solids non-fat that the 
Contractor has already reimbursed. Subtract this amount from the total 
solids required to be delivered. Multiply the remainder by the milk 
solids non-fat value.
    (b) The Government will not assess amounts totaling $25 or less 
during a monthly accounting period. Monthly periods begin on the first 
day of the contract period and on the same day of each succeeding month.
    (c) The butterfat, milk solids non-fat, and total solids content of 
one type of product shall not be averaged with or offset against the 
content of another type of product, and the content of products 
delivered in any one monthly period will not be averaged with or offset 
against the content of products delivered in any other monthly period.
    (d) The Contractor shall identify the tare weights of all containers 
on the shipping documents, and furnish a copy to the Government 
inspector at destination. The tare weight of dispenser containers shall 
include all parts of the container delivered as a unit, including lids, 
tubes, and seals. If different types of containers with different tares 
are included in a single delivery, the Contractor shall furnish the tare 
weight and identifying characteristics of each type of container.
    (e) The Government shall inspect a representative sample of the line 
item. If volume and net weight shortages are found, the Government will 
adjust the entire quantity of the line item delivered on the day the 
shortage is discovered. For the purpose of determining net weight, the 
following weight factors apply:

specified elsewhere in the contract.
    (2) The Contractor has 30 days from the date of notification by the

within the time period specified by the Contracting Officer, the 
Government has the right to direct the Contractor to cease performance 
on all or part of this contract. The Contractor shall not resume

corrective action was effective and the Contracting Officer so informs 
the Contractor.
    (4) The Contracting Officer may remove Government personnel at any 
time the Contractor is in noncompliance with any safety requirement of 
this clause.
    (5) If the direction to cease work or the removal of Government

the number or frequency of inspections performed by the Government, nor 
the degree of surveillance exercised by the Government, relieve the 
Contractor of its responsibility for contract performance.

enforcement of the safety requirements of this contract, this does not 
impose or add to any liability of the Government.
    (g) Subcontractors. (1) The Contractor shall insert this clause, 
including this paragraph (g), in every subcontract that involves 
ammunition or explosives.
    (i) The clause shall include a provision allowing authorized 
Government safety representatives to evaluate subcontractor safety 
programs, implementation, and facilities as the Government determines 
necessary.
    (ii) Note: The Government Contracting Officer or authorized 
representative shall notify the prime Contractor of all findings 
concerning subcontractor safety and compliance with the manual. The 
Contracting Officer or authorized representative may furnish copies to 
the subcontractor. The Contractor in turn shall communicate directly 
with the subcontractor, substituting its name for references to ``the 
Government''. The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors shall also 
include provisions to allow direction to cease performance of the 
subcontract if a serious uncorrected or recurring safety deficiency 
potentially causes an imminent hazard to DoD personnel, property, or 
contract performance.
    (2) The Contractor agrees to ensure that the subcontractor complies 
with all contract safety requirements. The Contractor will determine the 
best method for verifying the adequacy of the subcontractor's 
compliance.
    (3) The Contractor shall ensure that the subcontractor understands 
and agrees to the Government's right to access to the subcontractor's 
facilities, personnel, and safety program documentation to perform 
safety surveys. The Government performs these safety surveys of 
subcontractor facilities solely to prevent the occurrence of any mishap 
which would endanger the safety of DoD personnel or otherwise adversely 
impact upon the Government's contractual interests.
    (4) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer or 
authorized representative before issuing any subcontract when it 
involves ammunition or explosives. If the proposed subcontract 
represents a change in the place of performance, the Contractor shall 
request approval for such change in accordance with the clause of this 
contract entitled ``Change in Place of Performance--Ammunition and 
Explosives''.

    As prescribed in 225.109(d), use the following clause:

      Buy American Act and Balance of Payments Program (Jan. 1994)

    (a) Definitions. (1) Components means those articles, materials, and 
supplies directly incorporated into end products.
    (2) Qualifying country means any country set forth in subsection 
225.872-1 of the Defense FAR Supplement.
    (3) Qualifying country component means an item mined, produced, or 
manufactured in a qualifying country.
    (4) End product means those articles, materials, and supplies to be 
acquired for public use under the contract. For this contract, the end 
products are the line items to be delivered to the Government (including 
supplies to be acquired by the Government for

[[Page 443]]

public use in connection with service contracts, but excluding 
installation and other services to be performed after delivery).
    (5) Domestic end product means--
    (i) An unmanufactured end product which has been mined or produced 
in the United States; or
    (ii) An end product manufactured in the United States if the cost of 
its qualifying country components and its components which are mined, 
produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the 
cost of all its components. The cost of components shall include 
transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the end product 
and U.S. duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate may be 
issued). Consider a component to have been mined, produced, or 
manufactured in the United States (regardless of its source in fact) if 
the end product in which it is incorporated is manufactured in the 
United States and the component is of a class or kind--
    (A) Determined to be not mined, produced, or manufactured in the 
United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial 
quantities and of a satisfactory quality; or
    (B) Which the Secretary concerned determines would be inconsistent 
with the public interest to apply the restrictions of the Buy American 
Act.
    (6) Nonqualifying country end product means an end product which is 
neither a domestic end product nor a qualifying country end product.
    (7) Qualifying country end product means--
    (i) An unmanufactured end product mined or produced in a qualifying 
country; or
    (ii) An end product manufactured in a qualifying country if the cost 
of the components mined, produced, or manufactured in the qualifying 
country and its components mined, produced, or manufactured in the 
United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components.
    (b) This clause implements the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10a-d) in 
a manner that will encourage a favorable international balance of 
payments by providing a preference to domestic end products over other 
end products, except for end products which are qualifying country end 
products.
    (c) The Contractor agrees that it will deliver only domestic end 
products unless, in its offer, it specified delivery of other end 
products in the Buy American Act and Balance of Payments Certificate or 
the Buy American Act--Trade Agreements--Balance of Payments Program 
Certificate. An offer certifying that a qualifying country end product 
will be supplied requires the Contractor to deliver a qualifying country 
end product or a domestic end product.
    (d) The offered price of nonqualifying country end products must 
include all applicable duty. Generally, when the Buy American Act is 
applicable, each nonqualifying country offer is adjusted for the purpose 
of evaluation by adding 50 percent of the offer, inclusive of duty.

Notice of Prohibition of Certain Contracts With Foreign Entities for the 
          Conduct of Ballistic Missile Defense RDT.E (JAN 1997)

    (a) Definitions.
    (1) Competent means the ability of an offeror to satisfy the 
requirements of the solicitation. This determination is based on a 
comprehensive assessment of each offeror's proposal including 
consideration of the specific areas of evaluation criteria in the 
relative order of importance described in the solicitation.
    (2) Foreign firm means a business entity owned or controlled by one 
or more foreign nationals or a business entity in which more than 50 
percent of the stock is owned or controlled by one or more foreign 
nationals.
    (3) U.S. firm means a business entity other than a foreign firm.
    (b) This provision implements section 222 of the Defense 
Authorization Act for FYs 1988 and 1989 (Pub. L. 100-180) prohibiting 
the award of certain contracts, for the conduct of Ballistic Missile 
Defense (BMD) Program research, development, test, or evaluation 
(RDT&E), to foreign governments or firms.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this provision, any funds 
appropriated to, or for the use of, the DoD, may not be used to enter 
into or carry out any contract, including any contract awarded as a 
result of a broad agency announcement (BAA), with a foreign government 
or firm if the contract provides for the conduct of RDT&E in connection 
with the BMD. Foreign governments and firms, however, are encouraged to 
submit offers since this provision is not intended to restrict BMD 
access to unique foreign expertise when contract performance requires a 
level of competency unavailable in the United States.
    (d) The prohibition does not apply to a foreign government or firm 
if--
    (1) The contract will be performed within the United States;
    (2) The contract is exclusively for RDT&E in connection with 
antitactical ballistic missile systems;
    (3) The foreign government or firm agrees to share a substantial 
portion of the total contract cost. The foreign share is considered 
substantial where it is equitable with respect to the relative benefits 
to be derived from the contract by the United States and the foreign 
parties. For example, if the contract is more beneficial to the foreign 
party, its share of the costs should be correspondingly higher; or
    (4) The U.S. Government determines that the contract cannot be 
competently performed by a U.S. firm at a price equal to or less than 
the price at which the RDT&E can be performed by a foreign government or 
firm.
    (e) The offeror (________) is (________) is not a U.S. firm.

Government to pay royalties which have accrued prior to the effective 
date of such termination.

252.227-7013  Rights in technical data--Noncommercial items.

    As prescribed in 227.7103-6(a), use the following clause:

        Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items (NOV 1995)

    (a) Definitions. As used in this clause:
    (1) Computer data base means a collection of data recorded in a form 
capable of being processed by a computer. The term does not include 
computer software.
    (2) Computer program means a set of instructions, rules, or routines 
recorded in a form that is capable of causing a computer to perform a 
specific operation or series of operations.
    (3) Computer software means computer programs, source code, source 
code listings, object code listings, design details, algorithms, 
processes, flow charts, formulae and related material that would enable 
the software to be reproduced, recreated, or recompiled. Computer 
software does not include computer data bases or computer software 
documentation.
    (4) Computer software documentation means owner's manuals, user's 
manuals, installation instructions, operating instructions, and other 
similar items, regardless of storage medium, that explain the 
capabilities of the computer software or provide instructions for using 
the software.
    (5) Detailed manufacturing or process data means technical data that 
describe the steps, sequences, and conditions of manufacturing, 
processing or assembly used by the manufacturer to produce an item or 
component or to perform a process.
    (6) Developed means that an item, component, or process exists and 
is workable. Thus, the item or component must have been constructed or 
the process practiced. Workability is generally established when the 
item, component, or process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to 
demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that 
there is a high probability that it will operate as intended. Whether, 
how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish 
workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, 
and the state of the art. To be considered ``developed,'' the item, 
component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered 
for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component, 
or process be actually reduced to practice within the

[[Page 465]]

meaning of Title 35 of the United States Code.
    (7) Developed exclusively at private expense means development was 
accomplished entirely with costs charged to indirect cost pools, costs 
not allocated to a government contract, or any combination thereof.
    (i) Private expense determinations should be made at the lowest 
practicable level.
    (ii) Under fixed-price contracts, when total costs are greater than 
the firm-fixed-price or ceiling price of the contract, the additional 
development costs necessary to complete development shall not be 
considered when determining whether development was at government, 
private, or mixed expense.
    (8) Developed exclusively with government funds means development 
was not accomplished exclusively or partially at private expense.
    (9) Developed with mixed funding means development was accomplished 
partially with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not 
allocated to a government contract, and partially with costs charged 
directly to a government contract.
    (10) Form, fit, and function data means technical data that 
describes the required overall physical, functional, and performance 
characteristics (along with the qualification requirements, if 
applicable) of an item, component, or process to the extent necessary to 
permit identification of physically and functionally interchangeable 
items.
    (11) Government purpose means any activity in which the United 
States Government is a party, including cooperative agreements with 
international or multi-national defense organizations, or sales or 
transfers by the United States Government to foreign governments or 
international organizations. Government purposes include competitive 
procurement, but do not include the rights to use, modify, reproduce, 
release, perform, display, or disclose technical data for commercial 
purposes or authorize others to do so.
    (12) Government purpose rights means the rights to--
    (i) Use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose 
technical data within the Government without restriction; and
    (ii) Release or disclose technical data outside the Government and 
authorize persons to whom release or disclosure has been made to use, 
modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose that data for 
United States government purposes.
    (13) Limited rights means the rights to use, modify, reproduce, 
release, perform, display, or disclose technical data, in whole or in 
part, within the Government. The Government may not, without the written 
permission of the party asserting limited rights, release or disclose 
the technical data outside the Government, use the technical data for 
manufacture, or authorize the technical data to be used by another 
party, except that the Government may reproduce, release or disclose 
such data or authorize the use or reproduction of the data by persons 
outside the Government if reproduction, release, disclosure, or use is--
    (i) Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or
    (ii) A release or disclosure of technical data (other than detailed 
manufacturing or process data) to, or use of such data by, a foreign 
government that is in the interest of the Government and is required for 
evaluational or informational purposes;
    (iii) Subject to a prohibition on the further reproduction, release, 
disclosure, or use of the technical data; and
    (iv) The contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction is 
notified of such reproduction, release, disclosure, or use.
    (14) Technical data means recorded information, regardless of the 
form or method of the recording, of a scientific or technical nature 
(including computer software documentation). The term does not include 
computer software or data incidental to contract administration, such as 
financial and/or management information.
    (15) Unlimited rights means rights to use, modify, reproduce, 
perform, display, release, or disclose technical data in whole or in 
part, in any manner, and for any purpose whatsoever, and to have or 
authorize others to do so.

Contractor by the Government;

[[Page 466]]

    (vii) Otherwise publicly available or have been released or 
disclosed by the Contractor or subcontractor without restrictions on 
further use, release or disclosure, other than a release or disclosure 
resulting from the sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in 
the technical data to another party or the sale or transfer of some or 
all of a business entity or its assets to another party;
    (viii) Data in which the Government has obtained unlimited rights 
under another Government contract or as a result of negotiations; or
    (ix) Data furnished to the Government, under this or any other 
Government contract or subcontract thereunder, with--
    (A) Government purpose license rights or limited rights and the 
restrictive condition(s) has/have expired; or
    (B) Government purpose rights and the Contractor's exclusive right 
to use such data for commercial purposes has expired.
    (2) Government purpose rights. (i) The Government shall have 
government purpose rights for a five-year period, or such other period 
as may be negotiated, in technical data--

in such data as provided in paragraphs (b)(ii) and (b)(iv) through 
(b)(ix) of this clause; or
    (B) Created with mixed funding in the performance of a contract that 
does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or 
production of items, components, or processes.
    (ii) The five-year period, or such other period as may have been 
negotiated, shall commence upon execution of the contract, subcontract, 
letter contract (or similar contractual instrument), contract 
modification, or option exercise that required development of the items, 
components, or processes or creation of the data described in paragraph 
(b)(2)(i)(B) of this clause. Upon expiration of the five-year or other 
negotiated period, the Government shall have unlimited rights in the 
technical data.
    (iii) The Government shall not release or disclose technical data in 
which it has government purpose rights unless--
    (A) Prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is 
subject to the non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7 of the Defense 
Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS); or
    (B) The recipient is a Government contractor receiving access to the 
data for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause 
at DFARS 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of 
Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.
    (iv) The Contractor has the exclusive right, including the right to 
license others, to use technical data in which the Government has

required to provide the Government additional rights to use, modify, 
reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data 
furnished to the Government with limited rights. However, if the 
Government desires to obtain additional rights in technical data in 
which it has limited rights, the Contractor agrees to promptly enter 
into negotiations with the Contracting Officer to determine whether 
there are acceptable terms for transferring such rights. All technical 
data in which the Contractor has granted the Government additional 
rights shall be listed or described in a license agreement made part of

data made in accordance with paragraph (a)(13) or (b)(2)(iii) of this 
clause, in accordance with the terms of a license negotiated under 
paragraph (b)(4) of this clause, or by others to whom the recipient has 
released or disclosed the data and to seek relief solely from the party 
who has improperly used, modified, reproduced, released, performed, 
displayed, or disclosed Contractor data marked with restrictive legends.
    (c) Contractor rights in technical data. All rights not granted to 
the Government are retained by the Contractor.

the written approval of the Contracting Officer, incorporate any

\1\ If the assertion is applicable to items, components or processes developed at private expense, identify both
  the data and each such item, component, or process.                                                           
\2\ Generally, the development of an item, component, or process at private expense, either exclusively or      
  partially, is the only basis for asserting restrictions on the Government's rights to use, release, or        
  disclose technical data pertaining to such items, components, or processes. Indicate whether development was  
  exclusively or partially at private expense. If development was not at private expense, enter the specific

                  (End of identification and assertion)

    (4) When requested by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall 
provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to 
evaluate the Contractor's assertions. The Contracting Officer reserves 
the right to add the Contractor's assertions to the Attachment and 
validate any listed assertion, at a later date, in accordance with the 
procedures of the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data 
clause of this contract.
    (f) Marking requirements. The Contractor, and its subcontractors or 
suppliers, may only assert restrictions on the Government's rights to 
use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical 
data to be delivered under this contract by marking the deliverable data 
subject to restriction. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(5) of this 
clause, only the following legends are authorized under this contract: 
the government purpose rights legend at paragraph (f)(2) of this clause; 
the limited rights legend at paragraph (f)(3) of this clause; or the 
special license rights legend at paragraph (f)(4) of this clause; and/or 
a notice of copyright as prescribed under 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402.
    (1) General marking instructions. The Contractor, or its 
subcontractors or suppliers, shall conspicuously and legibly mark the 
appropriate legend on all technical data that qualify for such markings. 
The authorized legends shall be placed on the transmittal document or 
storage container and, for printed material, each page of the printed 
material containing technical data for which restrictions are asserted. 
When only portions of a page of printed material are subject to the 
asserted restrictions, such portions shall

[[Page 468]]

be identified by circling, underscoring, with a note, or other 
appropriate identifier. Technical data transmitted directly from one 
computer or computer terminal to another shall contain a notice of 
asserted restrictions. Reproductions of technical data or any portions 
thereof subject to asserted restrictions shall also reproduce the 
asserted restrictions.
    (2) Government purpose rights markings. Data delivered or otherwise 
furnished to the Government purpose rights shall be marked as follows:

                        Government Purpose Rights

 Contract No.___________________________________________________________

 Contractor Name________________________________________________________

 Contractor Address_____________________________________________________

 _______________________________________________________________________

Expiration Date_________________________________________________________
    The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, 
display, or disclose these technical data are restricted by paragraph 
(b)(2) of the Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items clause 
contained in the above identified contract. No restrictions apply after 
the expiration date shown above. Any reproduction of technical data or 
portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the 
markings.

                             (End of legend)

    (3) Limited rights markings. Data delivered or otherwise furnished 
to the Government with limited rights shall be marked with the following 
legend:

                             Limited Rights

 Contract No.___________________________________________________________

 Contractor Name________________________________________________________

 Contractor Address_____________________________________________________

 _______________________________________________________________________
    The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, 
display, or disclose these technical data are restricted by paragraph 
(b)(3) of the Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items clause 
contained in the above identified contract. Any reproduction of 
technical data or portions thereof marked with this legend must also 
reproduce the markings. Any person, other than the Government, who has 
been provided access to such data must promptly notify the above named 
Contractor.

                             (End of legend)

    (4) Special license rights markings. (i) Data in which the 
Government's rights stem from a specifically negotiated license shall be 
marked with the following legend:

                         Special License Rights

    The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, 
display, or disclose these data are restricted by Contract No. 
________________ (Insert contract number) ________________, License No. 
________________ (Insert license identifier) ________________. Any 
reproduction of technical data or portions thereof marked with this 
legend must also reproduce the markings.

                             (End of legend)

    (ii) For purposes of this clause, special licenses do not include 
government purpose license rights acquired under a prior contract (see 
paragraph (b)(5) of this clause).
    (5) Pre-existing data markings. If the terms of a prior contract or 
license permitted the Contractor to restrict the Government's rights to 
use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical 
data deliverable under this contract, and those restrictions are still 
applicable, the Contractor may mark such data with the appropriate 
restrictive legend for which the data qualified under the prior contract 
or license. The marking procedures in paragraph (f)(1) of this clause 
shall be followed.
    (g) Contractor procedures and records. Throughout performance of 
this contract, the Contractor and its subcontractors or suppliers that 
will deliver technical data with other than unlimited rights, shall--
    (1) Have, maintain, and follow written procedures sufficient to 
assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized by the 
terms of this clause; and
    (2) Maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any 
restrictive markings on technical data delivered under this contract.
    (h) Removal of unjustified and nonconforming markings. (1) 
Unjustified technical data markings. The rights and obligations of the 
parties regarding the validation of restrictive markings on technical 
data furnished or to be furnished under this contract are contained in 
the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clause of this 
contract. Notwithstanding any provision of this contract concerning 
inspection and acceptance, the Government may ignore or, at the 
Contractor's expense, correct or strike a marking if, in accordance with 
the procedures in the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical 
Data clause of this contract, a restrictive marking is determined to be 
unjustified.
    (2) Nonconforming technical data markings. A nonconforming marking 
is a marking placed on technical data delivered or otherwise furnished 
to the Government under this contract that is not in the format 
authorized by this contract. Correction of nonconforming markings is not 
subject to the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data 
clause of this contract. If the Contracting

[[Page 469]]

Officer notifies the Contractor of a nonconforming marking and the 
Contractor fails to remove or correct such marking within sixty (60) 
days, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, remove 
or correct any nonconforming marking.
    (i) Relation to patents. Nothing contained in this clause shall 
imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as 
affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to 
the Government under any patent.
    (j) Limitation on charges for rights in technical data. (1) The 
Contractor shall not charge to this contract any cost, including, but 
not limited to, license fees, royalties, or similar charges, for rights 
in technical data to be delivered under this contract when--
    (i) The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater 
rights in the data; or
    (ii) The data are available to the public without restrictions.
    (2) The limitation in paragraph (j)(1) of this clause--
    (i) Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any 
tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in 
subcontractor or supplier technical data, if the subcontractor or 
supplier has been paid for such rights under any other Government 
contract or under a license conveying the rights to the Government; and
    (ii) Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, 
or mailing the documents or other media in which the technical data will 
be delivered.
    (k) Applicability to subcontractors or suppliers. (1) The Contractor 
shall ensure that the rights afforded its subcontractors and suppliers 
under 10 U.S.C. 2320, 10 U.S.C. 2321, and the identification, assertion, 
and delivery processes of paragraph (e) of this clause are recognized 
and protected.
    (2) Whenever any technical data for noncommercial items is to be 
obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the Government 
under this contract, the Contractor shall use this same clause in the 
subcontract or other contractual instrument, and require its 
subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to 
identify the parties. No other clause shall be used to enlarge or 
diminish the Government's, the Contractor's, or a higher-tier 
subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's 
technical data.
    (3) Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or 
supplier shall normally be delivered to the next higher-tier contractor, 
subcontractor, or supplier. However, when there is a requirement in the 
prime contract for data which may be submitted with other than unlimited 
rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor or 
supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such data directly to 
the Government, rather than through a higher-tier contractor, 
subcontractor, or supplier.
    (4) The Contractor and higher-tier subcontractors or suppliers shall 
not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain 
rights in technical data from their subcontractors or suppliers.
    (5) In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize 
and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data as an 
excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligations to the 
Government.

                             (End of clause)

                         Alternate I (June 1995)

    As prescribed in 227.7103-6(b), add the following paragraph (l) to 
the basic clause:
    (l) Publication for sale. (1) This paragraph only applies to 
technical data in which the Government has obtained unlimited rights or 
a license to make an unrestricted release of technical data.
    (2) The Government shall not publish a deliverable technical data 
item or items identified in this contract as being subject to paragraph 
(l) of this clause or authorize others to publish such data on its 
behalf if, prior to publication for sale by the Government and within 
twenty-four (24) months following the date specified in this contract 
for delivery of such data or the removal of any national security or 
export control restrictions, whichever is later, the Contractor 
publishes that item or items for sale and promptly notifies the 
Contracting Officer of such publication(s). Any such publication shall 
include a notice identifying the number of this contract and the 
Government's rights in the published data.
    (3) This limitation on the Government's right to publish for sale 
shall continue as long as the data are reasonably available to the 
public for purchase.

reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose the data have expired 
or no longer apply.
    (6) Release from liability. The Contractor agrees to release the 
Government from liability for any release or disclosure of computer 
software made in accordance with paragraph (a)(14) or (b)(2)(iii) of 
this clause, in accordance with the terms of a license negotiated under 
paragraph (b)(4) of this clause, or by others to whom the recipient has 
released or disclosed the software, and to seek relief solely from the 
party who has improperly used, modified, reproduced, released, 
performed, displayed, or disclosed Contractor software marked with 
restrictive legends.
    (c) Rights in derivative computer software or computer software 
documentation. The Government shall retain its rights in the unchanged 
portions of any computer software or computer software documentation 
delivered under this contract that the Contractor uses to prepare, or 
includes in, derivative computer software or computer software 
documentation.
    (d) Third party copyrighted computer software or computer software 
documentation. The Contractor shall not, without the written approval of 
the Contracting Officer, incorporate any copyrighted computer software 
or computer software documentation in the software or documentation to 
be delivered under this contract unless the Contractor is the copyright 
owner or has obtained for the Government the license rights necessary to 
perfect a license or licenses in the deliverable software or

    (1) Computer software, has provided a statement of the license 
rights obtained in a form acceptable to the Contracting Officer; or
    (2) Computer software documentation, has affixed to the transmittal 
document a statement of the license rights obtained.
    (e) Identification and delivery of computer software and computer 
software documentation to be furnished with restrictions on use, 
release, or disclosure. (1) This paragraph does not apply to 
restrictions based solely on copyright.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this clause, computer 
software that the Contractor asserts should be furnished to the

[[Page 473]]

Government with restrictions on use, release, or disclosure is 
identified in an attachment to this contract (the Attachment). The 
Contractor shall not deliver any software with restrictive markings 
unless the software is listed on the Attachment.
    (3) In addition to the assertions made in the Attachment, other 
assertions may be identified after award when based on new information 
or inadvertent omissions unless the inadvertent omissions would have 
materially affected the source selection decision. Such identification 
and assertion shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer as soon as 
practicable prior to the scheduled data for delivery of the software, in 
the following format, and signed by an official authorized to 
contractually obligate the Contractor: Identification and Assertion of

    (4) When requested by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall 
provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to 
evaluate the Contractor's assertions. The Contracting Officer reserves 
the right to add the Contractor's assertions to the Attachment and 
validate any listed assertion, at a later date, in accordance with the 
procedures of the Validation of Asserted Restrictions--Computer Software 
clause of this contract.
    (f) Marking requirements. The Contractor, and its subcontractors or 
suppliers, may only assert restrictions on the Government's rights to 
use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer 
software by marking the deliverable software or documentation subject to 
restriction. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(5) of this clause, only 
the following legends are authorized under this contract; the government 
purpose rights legend at paragraph (f)(2) of this clause; the restricted 
rights legend at paragraph (f)(3) of this clause; or the special license 
rights legend at paragraph (f)(4) of this clause; and/or a notice of 
copyright as prescribed under 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402.
    (1) General marking instructions. The Contractor, or its 
subcontractors or suppliers, shall conspicuously and legibly mark the 
appropriate legend on all computer software that qualify for such 
markings. The authorized legends shall be placed on the transmitted 
document or software storage container and each page, or portions 
thereof, of printed material containing computer software for which 
restrictions are asserted. Computer software transmitted directly from 
one computer or computer terminal to another shall contain a notice of 
asserted restrictions. However, instructions that interfere with or 
delay the operation of computer software in order to display a 
restrictive rights legend or other license statement at any time prior 
to or during use of the computer software, or otherwise cause such 
interference or delay, shall not be inserted in software that will or 
might be used in combat or situations that simulate combat conditions, 
unless the Contracting Officer's written permission to deliver such 
software has been obtained prior to delivery. Reproductions of computer 
software or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, shall 
also reproduce the asserted restrictions.
    (2) Government purpose rights markings. Computer software delivered 
or otherwise furnished to the Government with government purpose rights 
shall be marked as follows:

                        GOVERNMENT PURPOSE RIGHTS

 Contract No.___________________________________________________________

 Contractor Name________________________________________________________

 Contractor Address_____________________________________________________

 _______________________________________________________________________

Expiration Date_________________________________________________________
    The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, 
display, or disclose this software are restricted by paragraph (b)(2) of 
the Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer 
Software Documentation clause contained in the above identified 
contract. No restrictions apply after the expiration date shown above. 
Any reproduction of the software or portions thereof marked with this 
legend must also reproduce the markings.
(End of legend)

[[Page 474]]

    (3) Restricted rights markings. Software delivered or otherwise 
furnished to the Government with restricted rights shall be marked with 
the following legend:

 Contract No.___________________________________________________________

 Contractor Name________________________________________________________

 Contractor Address_____________________________________________________
 _______________________________________________________________________
    The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, 
display, or disclose this software are restricted by paragraph (b)(3) of 
the Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer 
Software Documentation clause contained in the above identified 
contract. Any reproduction of computer software or portions thereof 
marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings. Any person, 
other than the Government, who has been provided access to such software 
must promptly notify the above named Contractor.

(End of legend)
    (4) Special license rights markings. (i) Computer software or 
computer documentation in which the Government's rights stem from a 
specifically negotiated license shall be marked with the following 
legend:

                         SPECIAL LICENSE RIGHTS

    The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, 
display, or disclose this software are restricted by Contract No. 
________(Insert contract number)________, License No.________(Insert 
license identifier)________. Any reproduction of computer software, 
computer software documentation, or portions thereof marked with this 
legend must also reproduce the markings.

                             (End of legend)

    (ii) For purposes of this clause, special licenses do not include 
government purpose license rights acquired under a prior contract (see 
paragraph (b)(5) of this clause).
    (5) Pre-existing markings. If the terms of a prior contract or 
license permitted the Contractor to restrict the Government's rights to 
use, modify, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software or 
computer software documentation and those restrictions are still 
applicable, the Contractor may mark such software or documentation with 
the appropriate restrictive legend for which the software qualified 
under the prior contract or license. The marking procedures in paragraph 
(f)(1) of this clause shall be followed.
    (g) Contractor procedures and records. Throughout performance of 
this contract, the Contractor and its subcontractors or suppliers that 
will deliver computer software or computer software documentation with 
other than unlimited rights, shall--
    (1) Have, maintain, and follow written procedures sufficient to 
assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized by the 
terms of this clause; and
    (2) Maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any 
restrictive markings on computer software or computer software 
documentation delivered under this contract.
    (h) Removal of unjustified and nonconforming markings. (1) 
Unjustified computer software or computer software documentation 
markings. The rights and obligations of the parties regarding the 
validation of restrictive markings on computer software or computer 
software documentation furnished or to be furnished under this contract 
are contained in the Validation of Asserted Restrictions--Computer 
Software and the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data 
clauses of this contract, respectively. Notwithstanding any provision of 
this contract concerning inspection and acceptance, the Government may 
ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, correct or strike a marking if, 
in accordance with the procedures of those clauses, a restrictive 
marking is determined to be unjustified.
    (2) Nonconforming computer software or computer software 
documentation markings. A nonconforming marking is a marking placed on 
computer software or computer software documentation delivered or 
otherwise furnished to the Government under this contract that is not in 
the format authorized by this contract. Correction of nonconforming 
markings is not subject to the Validation of Asserted Restrictions--
Computer Software or the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical 
Data clause of this contract. If the Contracting Officer notifies the 
Contractor of a nonconforming marking or markings and the Contractor 
fails to remove or correct such markings within sixty (60) days, the 
Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, remove or correct 
any nonconforming markings.
    (i) Relation to patents. Nothing contained in this clause shall 
imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as 
affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to 
the Government under any patent.
    (j) Limitation on charges for rights in computer software or 
computer software documentation. (1) The Contractor shall not charge to 
this contract any cost, including but not limited to license fees, 
royalties, or similar charges, for rights in computer software or 
computer software documentation to be delivered under this contract 
when--
    (i) The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater 
rights in the software or documentation; or

[[Page 475]]

    (ii) The software or documentation are available to the public 
without restrictions.
    (2) The limitation in paragraph (j)(1) of this clause--
    (i) Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any 
tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in 
subcontractor or supplier computer software or computer software 
documentation, if the subcontractor or supplier has been paid for such 
rights under any other Government contract or under a license conveying 
the rights to the Government; and
    (ii) Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, 
or mailing the documents or other media in which the software or 
documentation will be delivered.
    (k) Applicability to subcontractors or suppliers. (1) Whenever any 
noncommercial computer software or computer software documentation is to 
be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the 
Government under this contract, the Contractor shall use this same 
clause in its subcontracts or other contractual instruments, and require 
its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to 
identify the parties. No other clause shall be used to enlarge or 
diminish the Government's, the Contractor's, or a higher tier 
subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's 
computer software or computer software documentation.
    (2) The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors or suppliers shall 
not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain 
rights in computer software or computer software documentation from 
their subcontractors or suppliers.
    (3) The Contractor shall ensure that subcontractor or supplier 
rights are recognized and protected in the identification, assertion, 
and delivery processes required by paragraph (e) of this clause.
    (4) In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize 
and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in computer software or 
computer software documentation as an excuse for failing to satisfy its 
contractual obligation to the Government.

                             (End of clause)

                         Alternate I (Jun. 1995)

    As prescribed in 227.7203-6(a)(2), add the following paragraph (l) 
to the basic clause:

    (l) Publication for sale. (1) This paragraph only applies to 
computer software or computer software documentation in which the 
Government has obtained unlimited rights or a license to make an 
unrestricted release of the software or documentation.
    (2) The Government shall not publish a deliverable item or items of 
computer software or computer software documentation identified in this 
contract as being subject to paragraph (l) of this clause or authorize 
others to publish such software or documentation on its behalf if, prior 
to publication for sale by the Government and within twenty-four (24) 
months following the date specified in this contract for delivery of 
such software or documentation, or the removal of any national security 
or export control restrictions, whichever is later, the Contractor 
publishes that item or items for sale and promptly notifies the 
Contracting Officer of such publication(s). Any such publication shall 
include a notice identifying the number of this contract and the 
Government's rights in the published software or documentation.
    (3) This limitation on the Government's rights to publish for sale 
shall continue as long as the software or documentation are reasonably 
available to the public for purchase.

<R05>
252.227-7018  Rights in noncommercial technical data and computer software--Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program.

    As prescribed in 227.7104(a), use the following clause:

  Rights in Noncommercial Technical Data and Computer Software--Small 
         Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program (Jun. 1995)

    (a) Definitions. As used in this clause:
    (1) Commercial computer software means software developed or 
regularly used for nongovernmental purposes which--
    (i) Has been sold, leased, or licensed to the public;
    (ii) Has been offered for sale, lease, or license to the public;
    (iii) Has not been offered, sold, leased, or licensed to the public 
but will be available for commercial sale, lease, or license in time to 
satisfy the delivery requirements of this contract; or
    (iv) Satisfies a criterion expressed in paragraph (a)(1)(i), (ii), 
or (iii) of this clause and would require only minor modification to 
meet the requirements of this contract.
    (2) Computer database means a collection of recorded data in a form 
capable of being processed by a computer. The term does not include 
computer software.
    (3) Computer program means a set of instructions, rules, or 
routines, recorded in a form that is capable of causing a computer to 
perform a specific operation or series of operations.
    (4) Computer software means computer programs, source code, source 
code listings, object code listings, design details, algorithms, 
processes, flow charts, formulae, and related material that would enable 
the software to be reproduced, re-created, or recompiled. Computer 
software does not include computer databases or computer software 
documentation.
    (5) Computer software documentation means owner's manuals, user's 
manuals, installation instructions, operating instructions, and other 
similar items, regardless of storage medium, that explain the 
capabilities of the computer software or provide instructions for using 
the software.
    (6) Detailed manufacturing or process data means technical data that 
describe the steps, sequences, and conditions of manufacturing, 
processing or assembly used by the manufacturer to produce an item or 
component or to perform a process.
    (7) Developed means--
    (i) (Applicable to technical data other than computer software 
documentation.) An item, component, or process, exists and is workable. 
Thus, the item or component must have been constructed or the process 
practiced. Workability is generally established when the item, 
component, or process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to 
demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that 
there is a high probability that it will operate as intended. Whether, 
how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish 
workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, 
and the state of the art. To be considered ``developed,'' the item, 
component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered 
for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component 
or process be actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title 
35 of the United States Code;
    (ii) A computer program has been successfully operated in a computer 
and tested to the extent sufficient to demonstrate to reasonable persons 
skilled in the art that the program can reasonably be expected to 
perform its intended purpose;
    (iii) Computer software, other than computer programs, has been 
tested or analyzed to the extent sufficient to demonstrate to reasonable 
persons skilled in the art that the software can reasonably be expected 
to perform its intended purpose; or
    (iv) Computer software documentation required to be delivered under 
a contract has been written, in any medium, in sufficient

[[Page 479]]

detail to comply with requirements under that contract.
    (8) Developed exclusively at private expense means development was 
accomplished entirely with costs charged to indirect cost pools, costs 
not allocated to a government contract, or any combination thereof.
    (i) Private expense determinations should be made at the lowest 
practicable level.
    (ii) Under fixed-price contracts, when total costs are greater than 
the firm-fixed-price or ceiling price of the contract, the additional 
development costs necessary to complete development shall not be 
considered when determining whether development was at government, 
private, or mixed expense.
    (9) Developed exclusively with government funds means development 
was not accomplished exclusively or partially at private expense.
    (10) Developed with mixed funding means development was accomplished 
partially with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not 
allocated to a government contract, and partially with costs charged 
directly to a government contract.
    (11) Form, fit, and function data means technical data that describe 
the required overall physical, functional, and performance 
characteristics (along with the qualification requirements, if 
applicable) of an item, component, or process to the extent necessary to 
permit identification of physically and functionally interchangeable 
items.
    (12) Generated means technical data or computer software first 
created in the performance of this contract.
    (13) Government purpose means any activity in which the United 
States Government is a party, including cooperative agreements with 
international or multi-national defense organizations or sales or 
transfers by the United States Government to foreign governments or 
international organizations. Government purposes include competitive 
procurement, but do not include the rights to use, modify, reproduce, 
release, perform, display, or disclose technical data or computer 
software for commercial purposes or authorize others to do so.
    (14) Limited rights means the rights to use, modify, reproduce, 
release, perform, display, or disclose technical data, in whole or in 
part, within the Government. The Government may not, without the written 
permission of the party asserting limited rights, release or disclose 
the technical data outside the Government, use the technical data for 
manufacture, or permit the technical data to be used by another party, 
except that the Government may reproduce, release or disclose such data 
or permit the use or reproduction of the data by persons outside the 
Government if reproduction, release, disclosure, or use is--
    (i) Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or
    (ii) A release or disclosure of technical data (other than detailed 
manufacturing or process data) to, or use of such data by, a foreign 
government that is in the interest of the Government and is required for 
evaluational or informational purposes;
    (iii) Subject to a prohibition on the further reproduction, release 
disclosure, or use of the technical data; and
    (iv) The Contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction is 
notified of such reproduction, release, disclosure, or use.
    (15) Minor modification means a modification that does not 
significantly alter the nongovernmental function or purpose of computer 
software or is of the type customarily provided in the commercial 
marketplace.
    (16) Noncommercial computer software means software that does not 
qualify as commercial computer software under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
clause.
    (17) Restricted rights apply only to noncommercial computer software 
and mean the Government's rights to--
    (i) Use a computer program with one computer at one time. The 
program may not be accessed by more than one terminal or central 
processing unit or time shared unless otherwise permitted by this 
contract;
    (ii) Transfer a computer program to another Government agency 
without the further permission of the Contractor if the transferor 
destroys all copies of the program and related computer software 
documentation in its possession and notifies the licensor of the 
transfer. Transferred programs remain subject to the provisions of this 
clause;
    (iii) Make the minimum number of copies of the computer software 
required for safekeeping (archive), backup, or modification purposes;
    (iv) Modify computer software provided that the Government may--
    (A) Use the modified software only as provided in paragraphs (a)(17) 
(i) and (iii) of this clause; and
    (B) Not release or disclose the modified software except as provided 
in paragraphs (a)(17) (ii), (v) and (vi) of this clause;
    (v) Permit contractors or subcontractors performing service 
contracts (see 37.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation) in support 
of this or a related contract to use computer software to diagnose and 
correct deficiencies in a computer program, to modify computer software 
to enable a computer program to be combined with, adapted to, or merged 
with other computer programs or when necessary to respond to urgent 
tactical situations, provided that--
    (A) The Government notifies the party which has granted restricted 
rights that a release or disclosure to particular contractors or 
subcontractors was made;
    (B) Such contractors or subcontractors are subject to the non-
disclosure agreement at

software for which restrictions are asserted. When only portions of a 
page of printed material are subject to the asserted restrictions, such 
portions shall be identified by circling, underscoring, with a note, or 
other appropriate identifier. Technical data or computer software 
transmitted directly from one computer or computer terminal to another 
shall contain a notice of asserted restrictions. However, instructions 
that interfere with or delay the operation of computer software in order 
to display a restrictive rights legend or other license statement at any 
time prior to or during use of the computer software, or otherwise cause 
such interference or delay, shall not be inserted in software that will 
or might be used in combat or situations that simulate combat 
conditions, unless the Contracting Officer's written permission to 
deliver such software has been obtained prior to delivery. Reproductions 
of technical data, computer software, or any portions thereof subject to 
asserted restrictions shall also reproduce the asserted restrictions.

contained in the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data 
and the Validation of Asserted Restrictions--Computer Software clauses 
of this contract, respectively. Notwithstanding any provision of this 
contract concerning inspection and acceptance, the Government may ignore 
or, at the Contractor's expense, correct or strike a marking if, in 
accordance with the applicable procedures of those clauses, a 
restrictive marking is determined to be unjustified.
    (2) Nonconforming markings. A nonconforming marking is a marking 
placed on technical data or computer software delivered or otherwise 
furnished to the Government under this contract that is not in the 
format authorized by this contract. Correction of nonconforming markings 
is not subject to the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical 
Data or the Validation of Asserted Restrictions--Computer Software 
clause of

[[Page 484]]

this contract. If the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor of a 
nonconforming marking or markings and the Contractor fails to remove or 
correct such markings within sixty (6)) days, the Government may ignore 
or, at the Contractor's expense, remove or correct any nonconforming 
markings.
    (i) Relation to patents. Nothing contained in this clause shall 
imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as 
affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to 
the Government under any patent.
    (j) Limitation on charges for rights in technical data or computer 
software. (1) The Contractor shall not charge to this contract any cost, 
including but not limited to, license fees, royalties, or similar 
charges, for rights in technical data or computer software to be 
delivered under this contract when--
    (i) The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater 
rights in the data or software; or
    (ii) The data are available to the public without restrictions.
    (2) The limitation in paragraph (j)(1) of this clause--
    (i) Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any 
tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in 
subcontractor of supplier technical data or computer software, if the 
subcontractor or supplier has been paid for such rights under any other 
Government contract or under a license conveying the rights to the 
Government; and
    (ii) Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, 
or mailing the documents or other media in which the technical data or 
computer software will be delivered.
    (k) Applicability to subcontractors or suppliers. (1) the Contractor 
shall assure that the rights afforded its subcontractors and suppliers 
under 10 U.S.C. 2320, 10 U.S.C. 2321, and the identification, assertion, 
and delivery processes required by paragraph (e) of this clause are 
recognized and protected.
    (2) Whenever any noncommercial technical data or computer software 
is to be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the 
Government under this contract, the Contractor shall use this same 
clause in the subcontract or other contractual instrument, and require 
its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to 
identify the parties. The Contractor shall use the Technical Data--
Commercial Items clause of this contract to obtain technical data 
pertaining to commercial items, components, or processes. No other 
clause shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government's, the 
Contractor's, or a higher tier subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a 
subcontractor's or supplier's technical data or computer software.
    (3) Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or 
supplier shall normally be delivered to the next higher tier contractor, 
subcontractor, or supplier. However, when there is a requirement in the 
prime contract for technical data which may be submitted with other than 
unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor 
or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such technical 
data directly to the Government, rather than through a higher tier 
contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.
    (4) The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors or suppliers shall 
not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain 
rights in technical data or computer software from their subcontractors 
or suppliers.
    (5) In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize 
and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data or 
computer software as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual 
obligation to the Government.

                             (End of clause)

                         Alternate I (June 1995)

    As prescribed in 227.7104(d), add the following paragraph (l) to the 
basic clause:
    (l) Publication for sale. (1) This paragraph applies only to 
technical data or computer software delivered to the Government with 
SBIR data rights.
    (2) Upon expiration of the SBIR data rights period, the Government 
will not exercise its right to publish or authorize others to publish an 
item of technical data or computer software identified in this contract 
as being subject to paragraph (l) of this clause if the Contractor, 
prior to the expiration of the SBIR data rights period, or within two 
years following delivery of the data or software item, or within twenty-
four months following the removal of any national security or export 
control restrictions, whichever is later, publishes such data or 
software item(s) and promptly notifies the Contracting Officer of such 
publication(s). Any such publication(s) shall include a notice 
identifying the number of this contract and the Government's rights in 
the published data.
    (3) This limitation on the Government's right to publish for sale 
shall continue as long as the technical data or computer software are 
reasonably available to the public for purchase.

<R05>
252.227-7019  Validation of asserted restrictions--Computer software.

    As prescribed in 227.7104(e)(3) or 227.7203-6(c), use the following 
clause:

[[Page 485]]

   Validation of Asserted Restrictions--Computer Software (June 1995)

    (a) Definitions. (1) As used in this clause, unless otherwise 
specifically indicated, the term ``Contractor'' means the Contractor and 
its subcontractors or suppliers.
    (2) Other terms used in this clause are defined in the Rights in 
Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software 
Documentation clause of this contract.
    (b) Justification. The Contractor shall maintain records sufficient 
to justify the validity of any markings that assert restrictions on the 
Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, perform, display, 
release, or disclose computer software delivered or required to be 
delivered under this contract and shall be prepared to furnish to the 
Contracting Officer a written justification for such restrictive 
markings in response to a request for information under paragraph (d) or 
a challenge under paragraph (f) of this clause.
    (c) Direct contact with subcontractors or suppliers. The Contractor 
agrees that the Contracting Officer may transact matters under this 
clause directly with subcontractors or suppliers at any tier who assert 
restrictions on the Government's right to use, modify, reproduce, 
release, perform, display, or disclose computer software. Neither this 
clause, nor any action taken by the Government under this clause, 
creates or implies privity of contract between the Government and the 
Contractor's subcontractors or suppliers.
    (d) Requests for information. (1) The Contracting Officer may 
request the Contractor to provide sufficient information to enable the 
Contracting Officer to evaluate the Contractor's asserted restrictions. 
Such information shall be based upon the records required by this clause 
or other information reasonably available to the Contractor.
    (2) Based upon the information provided, if the--
    (i) Contractor agrees that an asserted restriction is not valid, the 
Contracting Officer may--
    (A) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at the Contractor's 
expense; or
    (B) Return the computer software to the Contractor for correction at 
the Contractor's expense. If the Contractor fails to correct or strike 
the unjustified restrictions and return the corrected software to the 
Contracting Officer within sixty (60) days following receipt of the 
software, the Contracting Officer may correct the strike the markings at 
the Contractor's expense.
    (ii) Contracting Officer concludes that the asserted restriction is 
appropriate for this contract, the Contracting Officer shall so notify 
the Contractor in writing.
    (3) The Contractor's failure to provide a timely response to a 
Contracting Officer's request for information or failure to provide 
sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate an 
asserted restriction shall constitute reasonable grounds for questioning 
the validity of an asserted restriction.
    (e) Government right to challenge and validate asserted 
restrictions. (1) The Government, when there are reasonable grounds to 
do so, has the right to review and challenge the validity of any 
restrictions asserted by the Contractor on the Government's rights to 
use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer 
software delivered, to be delivered under this contract, or otherwise 
provided to the Government in the performance of this contract. Except 
for software that is publicly available, has been furnished to the 
Government without restrictions, or has been otherwise made available 
without restrictions, the Government may exercise this right only within 
three years after the date(s) the software is delivered or otherwise 
furnished to the Government, or three years following final payment 
under this contract, whichever is later.
    (2) The absence of a challenge to an asserted restriction shall not 
constitute validation under this clause. Only a Contracting Officer's 
final decision or actions of an agency Board of Contract Appeals or a 
court of competent jurisdiction that sustain the validity of an asserted 
restriction constitute validation of the restriction.
    (f) Challenge procedures. (1) A challenge must be in writing and 
shall--
    (i) State the specific grounds for challenging the asserted 
restriction;
    (ii) Require the Contractor to respond within sixty (60) days;
    (iii) Require the Contractor to provide justification for the 
assertion based upon records kept in accordance with paragraph (b) of 
this clause and such other documentation that are reasonably available 
to the Contractor, in sufficient detail to enable the Contracting 
Officer to determine the validity of the asserted restrictions; and
    (iv) State that a Contracting Officer's final decision, during the 
three-year period preceding this challenge, or action of a court of 
competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals that sustained the 
validity of an identical assertion made by the Contractor (or a 
licensee) shall serve as justification for the asserted restriction.
    (2) The Contracting Officer shall extend the time for response if 
the Contractor submits a written request showing the need for additional 
time to prepare a response.
    (3) The Contracting Officer may request additional supporting 
documentation if, in the Contracting Officer's opinion, the Contractor's 
explanation does not provide sufficient evidence to justify the validity 
of the asserted restrictions. The Contractor agrees

[[Page 486]]

to promptly respond to the Contracting Officer's request for additional 
supporting documentation.
    (4) Notwithstanding challenge by the Contracting Officer, the 
parties may agree on the disposition of an asserted restriction at any 
time prior to a Contracting Officer's final decision or, if the 
Contractor has appealed that decision, filed suit, or provided notice of 
an intent to file suit, at any time prior to a decision by a court of 
competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals.
    (5) If the Contractor fails to respond to the Contracting Officer's 
request for information or additional information under paragraph (f)(1) 
of this clause, the Contracting Officer shall issue a final decision, in 
accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract, pertaining to the 
validity of the asserted restriction.
    (6) If the Contracting Officer, after reviewing the written 
explanation furnished pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this clause, or 
any other available information pertaining to the validity of an 
asserted restriction, determines that the asserted restriction has--
    (i) Not been justified, the Contracting Officer shall issue promptly 
a final decision, in accordance with the Disputes clause of this 
contract, denying the validity of the asserted restriction; or
    (ii) Been justified, the Contracting Officer shall issue promptly a 
final decision, in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract, 
validating the asserted restriction.
    (7) A Contractor receiving challenges to the same asserted 
restriction(s) from more than one Contracting Officer shall notify each 
Contracting Officer of the other challenges. The notice shall also state 
which Contracting Officer initiated the first in time unanswered 
challenge. The Contracting Officer who initiated the first in time 
unanswered challenge, after consultation with the other Contracting 
Officers who have challenged the restrictions and the Contractor, shall 
formulate and distribute a schedule that provides the contractor a 
reasonable opportunity for responding to each challenge.
    (g) Contractor appeal--Government obligation. (1) The Government 
agrees that, notwithstanding a Contracting Officer's final decision 
denying the validity of an asserted restriction and except as provided 
in paragraph (g)(3) of this clause, it will honor the asserted 
restriction--
    (i) For a period of ninety (90) days from the date of the 
Contracting Officer's final decision to allow the Contractor to appeal 
to the appropriate Board of Contract Appeals or to file suit in an 
appropriate court;
    (ii) For a period of one year from the date of the Contracting 
Officer's final decision if, within the first ninety (90) days following 
the Contracting Officer's final decision, the Contractor has provided 
notice of an intent to file suit in an appropriate court; or
    (iii) Until final disposition by the appropriate Board of Contract 
Appeals or court of competent jurisdiction, if the Contractor has: (A) 
appealed to the Board of Contract Appeals or filed suit an appropriate 
court within ninety (90) days; or (B) submitted, within ninety (90) 
days, a notice of intent to file suit in an appropriate court and filed 
suit within one year.
    (2) The Contractor agrees that the Government may strike, correct, 
or ignore the restrictive markings if the Contractor fails to--
    (i) Appeal to a Board of Contract Appeals within ninety (90) days 
from the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision;
    (ii) File suit in an appropriate court within ninety (90) days from 
such date; or
    (iii) File suit within one year after the date of the Contracting 
Officer's final decision if the Contractor had provided notice of intent 
to file suit within ninety (90) days following the date of the 
Contracting Officer's final decision.
    (3) The agency head, on a nondelegable basis, may determine that 
urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit awaiting the filing of 
suit in an appropriate court, or the rendering of a decision by a court 
of competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals. In that event, 
the agency head shall notify the Contractor of the urgent or compelling 
circumstances. Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(1) of this clause, the 
Contractor agrees that the agency may use, modify, reproduce, release, 
perform, display, or disclose computer software marked with (i) 
government purpose legends for any purpose, and authorize others to do 
so; or (ii) restricted or special license rights for government purposes 
only. The Government agrees not to release or disclose such software 
unless, prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is 
subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7 of the 
Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), or is a 
Government contractor receiving access to the software for performance 
of a Government contract that contains the clause at DFARS 252.227-7025, 
Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information 
Marked with Restrictive Legends. The agency head's determination may be 
made at any time after the date of the Contracting Officer's final 
decision and shall not affect the Contractor's right to damages against 
the United States, or other relief provided by law, if its asserted 
restrictions are ultimately upheld.
    (h) Final disposition of appeal or suit. If the Contractor appeals 
or files suit and if, upon final disposition of the appeal or suit, the 
Contracting Officer's decision is:
    (1) Sustained--

[[Page 487]]

    (i) Any restrictive marking on such computer software shall be 
struck or corrected at the contractor's expense or ignored; and
    (ii) If the asserted restriction is found not to be substantially 
justified, the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for payment 
of the cost to the Government of reviewing the asserted restriction and 
the fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) 
incurred by the Government in challenging the restriction, unless 
special circumstances would make such payment unjust.
    (2) Not sustained--
    (i) The Government shall be bound by the asserted restriction; and
    (ii) If the challenge by the Government is found not to have been 
made in good faith, the Government shall be liable to the Contractor for 
payment of fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 
2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Contractor in defending the restriction.
    (i) Flowdown. The Contractor shall insert this clause in all 
contracts, purchase orders, and other similar instruments with its 
subcontractors or suppliers, at any tier, who will be furnishing 
computer software to the Government in the performance of this contract. 
The clause may not be altered other than to identify the appropriate 
parties.

terms ``limited rights'' and ``Government purpose rights'' are defined 
in the Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items clause of this 
contract.
    (2) For contracts that do not require the delivery of technical

    (b) Technical data or computer software provided to the Contractor 
as Government furnished information (GFI) under this contract may be 
subject to restrictions on use, modification, reproduction, release,

    (1) GFI marked with limited or restricted rights legends. The 
Contractor shall use, modify, reproduce, perform, or display technical 
data received from the Government with limited rights legends or 
computer software received with restricted rights legends only in the 
performance of this contract. The Contractor shall not, without the 
express written permission of the party whose name appears in the 
legend, release or disclose such data or software to any person.
    (2) GFI marked with government purpose rights legends. The 
Contractor shall use technical data or computer software received from 
the Government with government purpose rights legends for government 
purposes only. The Contractor shall not, without the express written 
permission of the party whose name appears in the restrictive legend, 
use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, or display such data or 
software for any commercial purpose or disclose such data or software to 
a person other than its subcontractors, suppliers, or prospective

persons to whom disclosure will be made to complete and sign the non-
disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7 of the Defense Federal Acquisition 
Regulation Supplement (DFARS).
    (3) GFI marked with specially negotiated license rights legends. The 
Contractor shall use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, or display 
technical data or computer software received from the Government with 
specially negotiated license legends only as permitted in the license. 
Such data or software may not be released or disclosed to other persons 
unless permitted by the license and, prior to release or disclosure, the 
intended recipient has completed the non-disclosure agreement at DFARS 
227.7103-7. The Contractor shall modify paragraph (1)(c) of the non-
disclosure agreement to reflect the recipient's obligations regarding 
use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, and 
disclosure of the data or software.
    (c) Indemnification and creation of third party beneficiary rights. 
The Contractor agrees--
    (1) To indemnify and hold harmless the Government, its agents, and 
employees from every claim or liability, including attorneys fees, court 
costs, and expenses, arising out of, or in any way related to, the 
misuse or unauthorized modification, reproduction, release, performance,

from the Government with restrictive legends by the Contractor or any 
person to whom the Contractor has released or disclosed such data or 
software; and

252.227-7037  Validation of restrictive markings on technical data.

    As prescribed in 227.7102-3(c), 227.7103(e)(4), 227.7104(e)(6), or 
227.7203-6(f), use the following clause:

     Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data (NOV 1995)

    (a) Definitions. The terms used in this clause are defined in the 
Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items clause of this contract.
    (b) Contracts for commercial items--presumption of development at 
private expense. Under a contract for a commercial item, component, or 
process, the Department of Defense shall presume that a Contractor's 
asserted use or release restrictions are justified on the basis that the 
item, component, or process was developed exclusively at private 
expense. The Department shall not challenge such assertions unless 
information the Department demonstrates that the item, component, or 
process was not developed exclusively at private expense.
    (c) Justification. The Contractor or subcontractor at any tier is 
responsible for maintaining records sufficient to justify the validity 
of its markings that impose restrictions on the Government and others to 
use, duplicate, or disclose technical data delivered or required to be 
delivered under the contract or subcontract. Except under contracts for 
commercial items, the Contractor or subcontractor shall be prepared to 
furnish to the Contracting Officer a written justification for such 
restrictive markings in response to a challenge under paragraph (e) of 
this clause.
    (d) Prechallenge request for information. (1) The Contracting 
Officer may request the Contractor or subcontractor to furnish a written 
explanation for any restriction asserted by the Contractor or 
subcontractor on the right of the United States or others to use 
technical data. If, upon review of the explanation submitted, the 
Contracting Officer remains unable to ascertain the basis of the 
restrictive marking, the Contracting Officer may further request the 
Contractor or subcontractor to furnish additional information in the 
records of, or otherwise in the possession of or reasonably available 
to, the Contractor or subcontractor to justify the validity of any 
restrictive marking on technical data delivered or to be delivered under 
the contract or subcontract (e.g., a statement of facts accompanied with 
supporting documentation). The Contractor or subcontractor shall submit 
such written data as requested by the Contracting Officer within the 
time required or such longer period as may be mutually agreed.
    (2) If the Contracting Officer, after reviewing the written data 
furnished pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this clause, or any other 
available information pertaining to the validity of a restrictive 
marking, determines that reasonable grounds exist to question the 
current validity of the marking and that continued adherence to the 
marking would make impracticable the subsequent competitive acquisition 
of the item, component, or process to which the technical data relates, 
the Contracting Officer shall follow the procedures in paragraph (e) of 
this clause.
    (3) If the Contractor or subcontractor fails to respond to the 
Contracting Officer's request for information under paragraph (d)(1) of 
this clause, and the Contracting Officer determines that continued 
adherence to the marking would make impracticable the subsequent 
competitive acquisition of the item, component, or process to which the 
technical data relates, the Contracting Officer may challenge the 
validity of the marking as described in paragraph (e) of this clause.
    (e) Challenge. (1) Notwithstanding any provision of this contract 
concerning inspection and acceptance, if the Contracting Officer 
determines that a challenge to the restrictive marking is warranted, the 
Contracting Officer shall send a written challenge notice to the 
Contractor or subcontractor asserting the restrictive markings. Such 
challenge shall--
    (i) State the specific grounds for challenging the asserted 
restriction;
    (ii) Require a response within sixty (60) days justifying and 
providing sufficient evidence as to the current validity of the asserted 
restriction;
    (iii) State that a DoD Contracting Officer's final decision, issued 
pursuant to paragraph (g) of this clause, sustaining the validity of a 
restrictive marking identical to the asserted restriction, within the 
three-year period preceding the challenge, shall serve as justification 
for the asserted restriction if the validated restriction was asserted 
by the same Contractor or subcontractor (or any licensee of such 
Contractor or subcontractor) to which such notice is being provided; and
    (iv) State that failure to respond to the challenge notice may 
result in issuance of a final decision pursuant to paragraph (f) of this 
clause.
    (2) The Contracting Officer shall extend the time for response as 
appropriate if the Contractor or subcontractor submits a written request 
showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.
    (3) The Contractor's or subcontractor's written response shall be 
considered a claim within the meaning of the Contract Disputes Act of 
1978 (41 U.S.C. 601, et seq.), and shall be certified in the form 
prescribed at 33.207 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, regardless 
of dollar amount.
    (4) A Contractor or subcontractor receiving challenges to the same 
restrictive markings from more than one Contracting Officer shall

[[Page 493]]

notify each Contracting Officer of the existence of more than one 
challenge. The notice shall also state which Contracting Officer 
initiated the first in time unanswered challenge. The Contracting 
Officer initiating the first in time unanswered challenge after 
consultation with the Contractor or subcontractor and the other 
Contracting Officers, shall formulate and distribute a schedule for 
responding to each of the challenge notices to all interested parties. 
The schedule shall afford the Contractor or subcontractor an opportunity 
to respond to each challenge notice. All parties will be bound by this 
schedule.
    (f) Final decision when Contractor or subcontractor fails to 
respond. Upon a failure of a Contractor or subcontractor to submit any 
response to the challenge notice, other than a failure to respond under 
a contract for commercial items, the Contracting Officer will issue a 
final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor in accordance with the 
Disputes clause of this contract pertaining to the validity of the 
asserted restriction. This final decision shall be issued as soon as 
possible after the expiration of the time period of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) 
or (e)(2) of this clause. Following issuance of the final decision, the 
Contracting Officer will comply with the procedures in paragraphs (g)(2) 
(ii) through (iv) of this clause.
    (g) Final decision when Contractor or subcontractor responds. (1) if 
the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor or subcontractor 
has justified the validity of the restrictive marking, the Contracting 
Officer shall issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor 
sustaining the validity of the restrictive marking, and stating that the 
Government will continue to be bound by the restrictive marking. This 
final decision shall be issued within sixty (60) days after receipt of 
the Contractor's or subcontractor's response to the challenge notice, or 
within such longer period that the Contracting Officer has notified the 
Contractor or subcontractor that the Government will require. The 
notification of a longer period for issuance of a final decision will be 
made within sixty (60) days after receipt of the response to the 
challenge notice.
    (2)(i) If the Contracting Officer determines that the validity of 
the restrictive marking is not justified, the Contracting Officer shall 
issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor in accordance 
with the Disputes clause of this contract. Notwithstanding paragraph (e) 
of the Disputes clause, the final decision shall be issued within sixty 
(60) days after receipt of the Contractor's or subcontractor's response 
to the challenge notice, or within such longer period that the 
Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor or subcontractor of the 
longer period that the Government will require. The notification of a 
longer period for issuance of a final decision will be made within sixty 
(60) days after receipt of the response to the challenge notice.
    (ii) The Government agrees that it will continue to be bound by the 
restrictive marking of a period of ninety (90) days from the issuance of 
the Contracting Officer's final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of 
this clause. The Contractor or subcontractor agrees that, if it intends 
to file suit in the United States Claims Court it will provide a notice 
of intent to file suit to the Contracting Officer within ninety (90) 
days from the issuance of the Contracting Officer's final decision under 
paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this clause. If the Contractor or subcontractor 
fails to appeal, file suit, or provide a notice of intent to file suit 
to the Contracting Officer within the ninety (90)-day period, the 
Government may cancel or ignore the restrictive markings, and the 
failure of the Contractor or subcontractor to take the required action 
constitutes agreement with such Government action.
    (iii) The Government agrees that it will continue to be bound by the 
restrictive marking where a notice of intent to file suit in the United 
States Claims Court is provided to the Contracting Officer within ninety 
(90) days from the issuance of the final decision under paragraph 
(g)(2)(i) of this clause. The Government will no longer be bound, and 
the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the Government may strike or 
ignore the restrictive markings, if the Contractor or subcontractor 
fails to file its suit within one (1) year after issuance of the final 
decision. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the head of an agency 
determines, on a nondelegable basis, that urgent or compelling 
circumstances will not permit waiting for the filing of a suit in the 
United States Claims Court, the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that 
the agency may, following notice to the Contractor or subcontractor, 
authorize release or disclosure of the technical data. Such agency 
determination may be made at any time after issuance of the final 
decision and will not affect the Contractor's or subcontractor's right 
to damages against the United States where its restrictive markings are 
ultimately upheld or to pursue other relief, if any, as may be provided 
by law.
    (iv) The Government agrees that it will be bound by the restrictive 
marking where an appeal or suit is filed pursuant to the Contract 
Disputes Act until final disposition by an agency Board of Contract 
Appeals or the United States Claims Court. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, where the head of an agency determines, on a nondelegable 
basis, following notice to the Contractor that urgent or compelling 
circumstances will not permit awaiting the decision by such Board of 
Contract Appeals or the United States Claims Court, the Contractor or 
subcontractor

[[Page 494]]

agrees that the agency may authorize release or disclosure of the 
technical data. Such agency determination may be made at any time after 
issuance of the final decision and will not affect the Contractor's or 
subcontractor's right to damages against the United States where its 
restrictive markings are ultimately upheld or to pursue other relief, if 
any, as may be provided by law.
    (h) Final disposition of appeal or suit. (1) If the Contractor or 
subcontractor appeals or files suit and if, upon final disposition of 
the appeal or suit, the Contracting Officer's decision is sustained--
    (i) The restrictive marking on the technical data shall be 
cancelled, corrected or ignored; and
    (ii) If the restrictive marking is found not to be substantially 
justified, the Contractor or subcontractor, as appropriate, shall be 
liable to the Government for payment of the cost to the Government of 
reviewing the restrictive marking and the fees and other expenses (as 
defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Government in 
challenging the marking, unless special circumstances would make such 
payment unjust.
    (2) If the Contractor or subcontractor appeals or files suit and if, 
upon final disposition of the appeal or suit, the Contracting Officer's 
decision is not sustained--
    (i) The Government shall continue to be bound by the restrictive 
marking; and
    (ii) The Government shall be liable to the Contractor or 
subcontractor for payment of fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 
U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Contractor or subcontractor in 
defending the marking, if the challenge by the Government is found not 
to have been made in good faith.
    (i) Duration of right to challenge. The Government may review the 
validity of any restriction on technical data, delivered or to be 
delivered under a contract, asserted by the Contractor or subcontractor. 
During the period within three (3) years of final payment on a contract 
or within three (3) years of delivery of the technical data to the 
Government, whichever is later, the Contracting Officer may review and 
make a written determination to challenge the restriction. The 
Government may, however, challenge a restriction on the release, 
disclosure or use of technical data at any time if such technical data--
    (1) Is publicly available;
    (2) Has been furnished to the United States without restriction; or
    (3) Has been otherwise made available without restriction. Only the 
Contracting Officer's final decision resolving a formal challenge by 
sustaining the validity of a restrictive marking constitutes 
``validation'' as addressed in 10 U.S.C. 2321.
    (j) Decision not to challenge. A decision by the Government, or a 
determination by the Contracting Officer, to not challenge the 
restrictive marking or asserted restriction shall not constitute 
``validation.''
    (k) Privity of contract. The Contractor or subcontractor agrees that 
the Contracting Officer may transact matters under this clause directly 
with subcontractors at any tier that assert restrictive markings. 
However, this clause neither creates nor implies privity of contract 
between the Government and subcontractors.
    (l) Flowdown. The Contractor or subcontractor agrees to insert this 
clause in contractual instruments with its subcontractors or suppliers 
at any tier requiring the delivery of technical data, except contractual 
instruments for commercial items or commercial components.

for the purpose of conducting any flight on behalf of the Contractor. If 
required, a defense systems operator may also be assigned as a flight 
crew member.
    (5) In the open means located wholly outside of buildings on the 
Contractor's premises or other places described in the Schedule as being 
in the open. Government furnished aircraft shall be considered to be 
located in the open at all times while in the Contractor's possession, 
care, custody, or control.
    (6) Operation means operations and tests of the aircraft and its 
installed equipment, accessories, and power plants, while the aircraft 
is in the open or in motion. The term does not apply to aircraft on any 
production line or in flight.
    (b) Except as may be specifically provided in the Schedule as an 
exception to this clause, the Government assumes the risk of

[[Page 496]]

damage to, or loss or destruction of aircraft in the open, during 
operation, and in flight. The Contractor shall not be liable to the 
Government for such damage, loss, or destruction.
    (c) The Government's assumption of risk for aircraft in the open 
shall continue unless the Contracting Officer finds that the aircraft is 
in the open under unreasonable conditions, and the Contractor fails to 
take prompt corrective action.
    (1) The Contracting Officer, when finding aircraft in the open under 
unreasonable conditions, shall notify the Contractor in writing of the 
unreasonable conditions and require the Contractor to make corrections 
within a reasonable time.
    (2) Upon receipt of the notice, the Contractor shall promptly 
correct the cited conditions, regardless of whether there is agreement 
that the conditions are unreasonable. If the Contracting Officer later 
determines that the cited conditions were not unreasonable, an equitable 
adjustment shall be made in the contract price for any additional costs 
incurred in correcting the conditions. Any dispute as to the 
unreasonableness of the conditions or the equitable adjustment shall be 
considered a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.
    (3) If the Contracting Officer finds that the Contractor failed to 
act promptly to correct the cited conditions or failed to correct the 
conditions within a reasonable time, the Contracting Officer may 
terminate the Government's assumption of risk for any aircraft in the 
open under the cited conditions. The termination will be effective at 
12:01 am on the fifteenth day following the day the written notice is 
received by the Contractor. If the Contracting Officer later determines 
that the Contractor acted promptly to correct the cited conditions or 
that the time taken by the Contractor was not unreasonable, an equitable 
adjustment shall be made in the contract price for any additional costs 
incurred as a result of termination of the Government's assumption of 
risk. Any dispute as to the timeliness of the Contractor's action or the 
equitable adjustment shall be considered a dispute under the Disputes 
clause of this contract.
    (4) If the Government terminates its assumption of risk, the risk of 
loss for Government-furnished property shall be determined in accordance 
with the Government Property clause of this contract.
    (5) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer 
when unreasonable conditions have been corrected. If the Government 
elects to again assume the risk of loss and relieve the Contractor of 
liabilities, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor. The 
Contractor shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment in the contract 
price for any insurance costs extending from the end of the third 
working day after the Contractor notice of correction until the 
Contractor is notified that the Government will assume the risk of loss. 
If the Government does not again assume the risk of loss and conditions 
have been corrected, the Contractor shall be entitled to an equitable 
adjustment for insurance costs, if any, extending after the third 
working day.
    (d) The Government's assumption of risk shall not extend to damage, 
loss, or destruction of aircraft which--
    (1) Results from failure of the Contractor, due to willful 
misconduct or lack of good faith of any of the Contractor's managerial 
personnel, to maintain and administer a program for the protection and 
preservation of aircraft in the open and during operation in accordance 
with sound industrial practice. The term Contractor's managerial 
personnel means the Contractor's directors, officers, and any of the 
Contractor's managers, superintendents, or other equivalent 
representatives who supervise or direct all or substantially all of the 
Contractor's business; or all or substantially all of the Contractor's 
operations at any one plant or separate location at which this contract 
is performed; or a separate and complete major industrial operation in 
connection with the performance of this contract;
    (2) Is sustained during flight if the flight crew members have not 
been approved in writing by the Government Flight Representative, who 
has been authorized in accordance with the combined regulation entitled 
``Contractor's Flight and Ground Operations'' (Air Force Regulation 55-
22, Army Regulation 95-20, NAVAIR Instruction 3710.1C, and Defense 
Logistics Agency Manual 8210.1);
    (3) Occurs in the course of transportation by rail, or by conveyance 
on public streets, highways, or waterways, except for Government-
furnished property;
    (4) Is covered by insurance;
    (5) Consists of wear and tear; deterioration (including rust and 
corrosion); freezing; or mechanical, structural, or electrical breakdown 
or failure, unless these are the result of other loss, damage or 
destruction covered by this clause. (This exclusion does not apply to 
Government-furnished property if damage consists of reasonable wear and 
tear or deterioration, or results from inherent vice in the property.); 
or
    (6) Is sustained while the aircraft is being worked on and is a 
direct result of the work unless such damage, loss, or destruction would 
be covered by insurance which would have been maintained by the 
Contractor, but for the Government's assumption of risk.
    (e) With the exception of damage, loss, or destruction in flight, 
the Contractor assumes the risk and shall be responsible for the first 
$25,000 of loss or damage to aircraft in the open or during operation 
resulting from each separate event, except for reasonable wear

[[Page 497]]

and tear and to the extent the loss or damage is caused by negligence of 
Government personnel. If the Government elects to require that the 
aircraft be replaced or restored by the Contractor to its condition 
immediately prior to the damage, the equitable adjustment in the price 
authorized by paragraph (i) of this clause shall not include the dollar 
amount of the risk assumed by the Contractor. In the event the 
Government does not elect repair or replacement, the Contractor agrees 
to credit the contract price or pay the Government $25,000 (or the 
amount of the loss, if less) as directed by the Contracting Officer.
    (f) A subcontractor shall not be relieved from liability for damage, 
loss, or destruction of aircraft while in its possession or control, 
except to the extent that the subcontract, with the written approval of 
the Contracting Officer, provides for relief from each liability. In the 
absence of approval, the subcontract shall contain provisions requiring 
the return of aircraft in as good condition as when received, except for 
reasonable wear and tear or for the utilization of the property in 
accordance with the provisions of this contract. Where a subcontractor 
has not been relieved from liability, and damage, loss, or destruction 
occurs, the Contractor shall enforce liability against the subcontractor 
for the benefit of the Government.
    (g) The Contractor warrants that the contract price does not and 
will not include, except as may be authorized in this clause, any charge 
or contingency reserve for insurance covering damage, loss, or 
destruction of aircraft while in the open, during operation, or in 
flight when the risk has been assumed by the Government, even if the 
assumption may be terminated for aircraft in the open.
    (h) In the event of damage, loss, or destruction of aircraft in the 
open, during operation, or in flight, the Contractor shall take all 
reasonable steps to protect the aircraft from further damage, to 
separate damaged and undamaged aircraft, to put all aircraft in the best 
possible order and further, except in cases covered by paragraph (e) of 
this clause, the Contractor shall furnish to the Contracting Officer a 
statement of--
    (1) The damaged, lost, or destroyed aircraft;
    (2) The time and origin of the damage, loss, or destruction;
    (3) All known interests in commingled property of which aircraft are 
a part; and
    (4) The insurance, if any, covering the interest in commingled 
property.
    Except in cases covered by paragraph (e) of this clause, the 
Contracting Officer will make an equitable adjustment in the contract 
price for expenditures made by the Contractor in performing the 
obligations under this paragraph.
    (i) If prior to delivery and acceptance by the Government, aircraft 
is damaged, lost, or destroyed and the Government assumed the risk, the 
Government shall either--
    (1) Require that the aircraft be replaced or restored by the 
Contractor to the condition immediately prior to the damage, in which 
event the Contracting Officer will make an equitable adjustment in the 
contract price and the time for contract performance; or
    (2) Terminate this contract with respect to the aircraft, in which 
event the Contractor shall be paid the contract price for the aircraft 
(or, if applicable, any work to be performed on the aircraft) less any 
amount the Contracting Officer determines--
    (i) It would have cost the Contractor to complete the aircraft (or 
any work to be performed on the aircraft) together with anticipated 
profit on uncompleted work; and
    (ii) Would be the value of the damaged aircraft or any salvage 
retained by the Contractor.
    The Contracting Officer shall prescribe the manner of disposition of 
the damaged, lost, or destroyed aircraft, or any parts of the aircraft. 
If any additional costs of such disposition are incurred by the 
Contractor, a further equitable adjustment will be made in the amount 
due the Contractor. Failure of the parties to agree upon termination 
costs or an equitable adjustment with respect to any aircraft shall be 
considered a dispute under the Disputes clause.
    (j) In the event the Contractor is reimbursed or compensated by a 
third person for damage, loss, or destruction of aircraft and has also 
been compensated by the Government, the Contractor shall equitably 
reimburse the Government. The Contractor shall do nothing to prejudice 
the Government's right to recover against third parties for damage, 
loss, or destruction. Upon the request of the Contracting Officer or 
authorized representative, the Contractor shall at Government expense 
furnish to the Government all reasonable assistance and cooperation 
(including the prosecution of suit and the execution of instruments of 
assignment of subrogation) in obtaining recovery.
    (k) The Contractor agrees to be bound by the operating procedures 
contained in the combined regulation entitled ``Contractor's Flight and 
Ground Operations'' in effect on the date of contract award.

252.229-7004  Status of contractors as a direct contractor (Spain).

    As prescribed in 229.402-70(d), use the following clause:

     Status of Contractor as a Director Contract (Spain) (June 1997)

    (a) ``Direct Contractor,'' as used in this clause, means an 
individual, company, or entity with whom an agency of the United States 
Department of Defense has executed a written agreement that allows duty-
free import of equipment, materials, and supplies into Spain for the 
construction, development, maintenance, and operation of Spanish-
American installations and facilities.
    (b) The Contractor is hereby designated as a Direct Contractor under 
the provisions of Complementary Agreement 5, articles 11, 14, 15, 17, 
and 18 of the Agreement on Friendship, Defense and Cooperation between 
the United States Government and the Kingdom

[[Page 502]]

of Spain, dated July 2, 1982. The Agreement relates to contacts to be 
performed in whole or part in Spain, the provisions of which are hereby 
incorporated into and made a part of this contract by reference.
    (c) The Contractor shall apply to the appropriate Spanish 
authorities for approval of status as a Direct Contractor in order to 
complete duty-free import of non-Spanish equipment, materials, and 
supplies represented as necessary for contract performance by the 
Contracting Officer. Orders for equipment, materials, and supplies 
placed prior to official notification of such approval shall be at the 
Contractor's own risk. The Contractor must submit its documentation in 
sufficient time to permit processing by the appropriate United States 
and Spanish Government agencies prior to the arrival of the equipment, 
material, or supplies in Spain. Seasonal variations in processing times 
are common, and the Contractor should program its projects accordingly. 
Any delay or expense arising directly or indirectly from this process 
shall not excuse untimely performance (except as expressly allowed in 
other provisions of this contract), constitute a direct or constructive 
change, or otherwise provide a basis for additional compensation or 
adjustment of any kind.
    (d) To ensure that all duty-free imports are properly accounted for, 
exported, or disposed of, in accordance with Spanish law, the Contractor 
shall obtain a written bank letter of guaranty payable to the Treasurer 
of the United States, or such other authority as may be designated by 
the Contracting Officer, in the amount set forth in paragraph (g) of 
this clause, prior to effecting any duty-free imports for the 
performance of this contract.
    (e) If the Contractor fails to obtain the required guaranty, the 
Contractor agrees that the Contracting Officer may withhold a portion of 
the contract payments in order to establish a fund in the amount set 
forth in paragraph (g) of this clause. The fund shall be used for the 
payment of import taxes in the event that the Contractor fails to 
properly account for, export, or dispose of equipment, materials, or 
supplies imported on a duty-free basis.
    (f) The amount of the bank letter of guaranty or size of the fund 
required under paragraph (d) or (e) of this clause normally shall be 5 
percent of the contract value. However, if the Contractor demonstrates 
to the Contracting Officer's satisfaction that the amount retained by 
the United States Government or guaranteed by the bank is excessive, the 
amount shall be reduced to an amount commensurate with contingent import 
tax and duty-free liability. This bank guaranty or fund shall not be 
released to the Contractor until the Spanish General Directorate of 
Customs verifies the accounting, export, or disposition of the 
equipment, material, or supplies imported on a duty-free basis.
    (g) The amount required under paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this 
clause is (Contracting Officer insert amount at time of contract award).
    (h) The Contractor agrees to insert the provisions of this clause, 
including this paragraph (h), in all subcontracts.

This percentage applies instead of the customary uniform progress 
payment rate and liquidation rate of the Progress Payments clause.

the minimum rate for the Contractor's investment (as a weighted average 
of costs) in its work in process inventory over the life of the 
contract.

performance reveal that the customary flexible progress payment rate 
will result in a Contractor investment in work in process inventory more 
than two percentage points higher or lower than the minimum rate of 
Contractor investment specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause, the 
progress payment rate shall be redetermined by using the DoD Cash Flow 
Computer Model. Unless it contained an error, the version of the DoD 
Cash Flow Computer Model identified in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause 
shall be used for any redetermination. The customary flexible progress 
payment rate shall not be less than the customary uniform progress 
payment rate that would have applied to this contract absent flexible 
progress payment procedures, and the progress payment rate shall not be 
greater than 100 percent.

computation was not current, accurate, and complete at the time the 
flexible progress payment rate was established, the progress payment 
rate shall be reduced to the rate that should have been calculated using 
the model specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. The Contractor 
shall pay interest in accordance with paragraph (d) of this clause on 
all resulting overpayments, computed from the date of the Government's 
overpayment, to the date of liquidation of the overpayment. Payment of

Secretary of the Treasury as provided in section 12 of the Contract 
Disputes Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-563), which is applicable at the time 
the Government made the overpayment, and then at the rate applicable for

Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount 
payable by the Government, including reimbursement in the event of 
termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, 
approximates the total amount currently allotted to the contract. The 
Contractor will not be obligated to continue work on those item(s) 
beyond that point. The Government will not be obligated in any event to 
reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the

Officer in writing at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the 
Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the 
total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for 
termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total

the parties will agree as to the period of contract performance which 
will be covered by the funds. The provisions of paragraph (b) through 
(d) of this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted 
funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified

    (e) If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot 
additional funds, by the dates indicated below, in amounts sufficient

252.236-7005  Airfield safety precautions.

    As prescribed in 236.570(b)(3), use the following clause. At some 
airfields, the width of the primary surface is 1,500 feet (750 feet on 
each side of the runway centerline). In such instances, substitute the 
proper width in the clause.

                 Airfield Safety Precautions (Dec. 1991)

    (a) Definitions. As used in this clause--
    (1) Landing areas means--
    (i) The primary surfaces, comprising the surface of the runway, 
runway shoulders, and lateral safety zones. The length of each primary 
surface is the same as the runway length. The width of each primary 
surface is 2,000 feet (1,000 feet on each side of the runway 
centerline);
    (ii) The clear zone beyond the ends of each runway, i.e., the 
extension of the primary surface for a distance of 1,000 feet beyond 
each end of each runway;
    (iii) All taxiways, plus the lateral clearance zones along each side 
for the length of the taxiways (the outer edge of each lateral clearance 
zone is laterally 250 feet from the far or opposite edge of the taxiway, 
e.g., a 75-foot-wide taxiway would have a combined width of taxiway and 
lateral clearance zones of 425 feet); and
    (iv) All aircraft parking aprons, plus the area 125 feet in width 
extending beyond each edge all around the aprons.
    (2) Safety precaution areas means those portions of approach-
departure clearance zones and transitional zones where placement of 
objects incident to contract performance might result in vertical 
projections at or above the approach-departure clearance, or the 
transitional surface.
    (i) The approach-departure clearance surface is an extension of the 
primary surface and the clear zone at each end of each runway, for a 
distance of 50,000 feet, first along an inclined (glide angle) and then 
along a horizontal plane, both flaring symmetrically about the runway 
centerline extended.
    (A) The inclined plane (glide angle) begins in the clear zone 200 
feet past the end of the runway (and primary surface) at the same 
elevation as the end of the runway. It continues upward at a slope of 
50:1 (1 foot vertically for each 50 feet horizontally) to an elevation 
of 500 feet above the established airfield elevation. At that point the 
plane becomes horizontal, continuing at that same uniform elevation to a 
point 50,000 feet longitudinally from the beginning of the inclined 
plane (glide angle) and ending there.
    (B) The width of the surface at the beginning of the inclined plane 
(glide angle) is the same as the width of the clear zone. It then flares 
uniformly, reaching the maximum width of 16,000 feet at the end.
    (ii) The approach-departure clearance zone is the ground area under 
the approach-departure clearance surface.
    (iii) The transitional surface is a sideways extension of all 
primary surfaces, clear zones, and approach-departure clearance surfaces 
along inclined planes.
    (A) The inclined plane in each case begins at the edge of the 
surface.
    (B) The slope of the incline plane is 7:1 (1 foot vertically for 
each 7 feet horizontally). It continues to the point of intersection 
with the--
    (1) Inner horizontal surface (which is the horizontal plane 150 feet 
above the established airfield elevation); or
    (2) Outer horizontal surface (which is the horizontal plane 500 feet 
above the established airfield elevation), whichever is applicable.
    (iv) The ``transitional zone'' is the ground area under the 
transitional surface. (It adjoins the primary surface, clear zone, and 
approach-departure clearance zone.)
    (b) General. (1) The Contractor shall comply with the requirements 
of this clause while--
    (i) Operating all ground equipment (mobile or stationary);
    (ii) Placing all materials; and
    (iii) Performing all work, upon and around all airfields.
    (2) The requirements of this clause are in addition to any other 
safety requirements of this contract.
    (c) The Contractor shall--
    (1) Report to the Contracting Officer before initiating any work;
    (2) Notify the Contracting Officer of proposed changes to locations 
and operations;
    (3) Not permit either its equipment or personnel to use any runway 
for purposes other than aircraft operation without permission of the 
Contracting Officer, unless the runway is--
    (i) Closed by order of the Contracting Officer; and
    (ii) Marked as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this clause;
    (4) Keep all paved surfaces, such as runways, taxiways, and 
hardstands, clean at all times and, specifically, free from small stones 
which might damage aircraft propellers or jet aircraft;
    (5) Operate mobile equipment according to the safety provisions of 
this clause, while actually performing work on the airfield. At all 
other times, the Contractor shall remove all mobile equipment to 
locations--
    (i) Approved by the Contracting Officer;
    (ii) At a distance of at least 750 feet from the runway centerline, 
plus any additional distance; and
    (iii) Necessary to ensure compliance with the other provisions of 
this clause; and

[[Page 517]]

    (6) Not open a trench unless material is on hand and ready for 
placing in the trench. As soon as practicable after material has been 
placed and work approved, the Contractor shall backfill and compact 
trenches as required by the contract. Meanwhile, all hazardous 
conditions shall be marked and lighted in accordance with the other 
provisions of this clause.
    (d) Landing areas. The Contractor shall--
    (1) Place nothing upon the landing areas without the authorization 
of the Contracting Officer;
    (2) Outline those landing areas hazardous to aircraft, using (unless 
otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer) red flags by day, and 
electric, battery-operated low-intensity red flasher lights by night;
    (3) Obtain, at an airfield where flying is controlled, additional 
permission from the control tower operator every time before entering 
any landing area, unless the landing area is marked as hazardous in 
accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this clause;
    (4) Identify all vehicles it operates in landing areas by means of a 
flag on a staff attached to, and flying above, the vehicle. The flag 
shall be three feet square, and consist of a checkered pattern of 
international orange and white squares of 1 foot on each side (except 
that the flag may vary up to ten percent from each of these dimensions);
    (5) Mark all other equipment and materials in the landing areas, 
using the same marking devices as in paragraph (d)(2) of this clause; 
and
    (6) Perform work so as to leave that portion of the landing area 
which is available to aircraft free from hazards, holes, piles of 
material, and projecting shoulders that might damage an airplane tire.
    (e) Safety precaution areas. The Contractor shall--
    (1) Place nothing upon the safety precaution areas without 
authorization of the Contracting Officer;
    (2) Mark all equipment and materials in safety precaution areas, 
using (unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer) red flags 
by day, and electric, battery-operated, low-intensity red flasher lights 
by night; and
    (3) Provide all objects placed in safety precaution areas with a red 
light or red lantern at night, if the objects project above the 
approach-departure clearance surface or above the transitional surface.

    (a) The low offeror and the items to be awarded shall be determined 
as follows--
    (1) Prior to the opening of bids, the Government will determine the 
amount of funds available for the project.
    (2) The low offeror shall be the Offeror that--
    (i) Is otherwise eligible for award; and
    (ii) Offers the lowest aggregate amount for the first or base bid 
item, plus or minus (in the order stated in the list of priorities in 
the bid schedule) those additive or deductive items that provide the 
most features within the funds determined available.
    (3) The Contracting Officer shall evaluate all bids on the basis of 
the same additive or deductive items.
    (i) If adding another item from the bid schedule list of priorities 
would make the award exceed the available funds for all offerors, the 
Contracting Officer will skip that item and go to the next item from the 
bid schedule of priorities; and
    (ii) Add that next item if an award may be made that includes that 
item and is within the available funds.
    (b) The Contracting Officer will use the list of priorities in the 
bid schedule only to determine the low offeror. After determining the 
low offeror, an award may be made on any combination of items if--
    (1) It is in the best interest of the Government;

[[Page 518]]

    (2) Funds are available at the time of award; and
    (3) The low offeror's price for the combination to be awarded is 
less than the price offered by any other responsive, responsible 
offeror.
    (c) Example. The amount available is $100,000. Offeror A's base bid 
and four additives (in the order stated in the list of priorities in the 
bid Schedule) are $85,000, $10,000, $8,000, $6,000, and $4,000. Offeror 
B's base bid and four additives are $80,000, $16,000, $9,000, $7,000, 
and $4,000. Offeror A is the low offeror. The aggregate amount of 
offeror A's bid for purposes of award would be $99,000, which includes a 
base bid plus the first and fourth additives. The second and third 
additives were skipped because each of them would cause the aggregate 
bid to exceed $100,000.

    As prescribed in 237.170-3, use the following provision:

          Identification of Uncompensated Overtime (Apr. 1992)

    (a) Definitions. As used in this provision--
    (1) Uncompensated overtime means the hours worked in excess of an 
average of 40 hours per week by direct charge employees who are exempt 
from the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), without additional 
compensation. Compensated personal absences, such as holidays, 
vacations, and sick leave, shall be included in the normal work week for 
purposes of computing uncompensated overtime hours.
    (2) Uncompensated overtime rate is the rate which results from 
multiplying the hourly rate for a 40 hour work week by 40, and then 
dividing by the proposed hours per week. For example, 45 hours proposed 
on a 40 hour work week basis at $20.00 would be converted to an 
uncompensated overtime rate of $17.78 per hour. ($20  x  40) divided by 
45=$17.78.
    (b) For any hours proposed against which an uncompensated overtime 
rate is applied, the Offeror shall identify in its proposal the hours in 
excess of an average of 40 hours per week, at the same level of detail 
as compensated hours, and the uncompensated overtime rate per hour, 
whether at the prime or subcontract level. This includes uncompensated 
overtime hours that are in indirect cost pools for personnel whose 
regular hours are normally charged direct.
    (c) The Offeror's accounting practices used to estimate 
uncompensated overtime must be consistent with its cost accounting 
practices used to accumulate and report uncompensated overtime hours.
    (d) Proposals which include unrealistically low labor rates, or 
which do not otherwise demonstrate cost realism, will be considered in a 
risk assessment and evaluated for award in accordance with that 
assessment.
    (e) The Offeror shall include a copy of its policy addressing 
uncompensated overtime with its proposal.

                           (End of provision)

    (a) Definition--Governmental regulatory body means the Federal 
Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body 
with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state 
authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial 
appeal and regulatory bodies which regulate a company owned by the same 
entity which creates the regulatory body are not ``governmental 
regulatory bodies.''
    (b) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under 
this agreement/contract in accordance with--
    (1) All applicable tariffs, rates, charges, rules, regulations, or 
requirements;
    (i) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and
    (ii) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by 
the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;
    (2) Rates, terms, and conditions of service and facilities furnished 
or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's 
subscribers; or
    (3) Rates, terms, and conditions of service as may be agreed upon, 
subject, when appropriate, to jurisdiction of a governmental regulatory 
body.
    (c) The Government shall not prepay for services.
    (d) For nontariffed services, the Contractor shall charge the 
Government at the lowest rate and under the most favorable terms and 
conditions for similar service and facilities offered to any other 
customer.
    (e) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each 
case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of 
facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.
    (f) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders--Common 
Carriers clause, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the 
use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract 
at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for 
services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of 
discontinuance.
    (g) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier 
than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When 
authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by 
the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay 
expediting charges only when--
    (1) They are provided for in the tariff established by a 
governmental regulatory body; or
    (2) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or 
other contractual document.
    (h) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and 
the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is 
required, the Government may--
    (1) Provide the equipment; or
    (2) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If 
the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition 
shall be competitive, if practicable.
    (i) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for 
any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount 
paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified 
shall be equitably adjusted under applicable tariffs filed by the 
Contractor with the regulatory commission in effect at the time of 
deferral or change. If no tariffs are in effect, the Government and the 
Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure 
to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of 
fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.

252.239-7007  Cancellation or termination of orders--common carriers.

    As prescribed in 239.7411(a), use the following clause:

    Cancellation or Termination of Orders--Common Carriers (JAN 1997)

    (a) If the Government cancels any of the services ordered under this 
agreement/contract, before the services are made available to the 
Government, or terminates any of these services after they are made 
available to the Government, the Government shall reimburse the 
Contractor for the actual nonrecoverable costs the Contractor has 
reasonably incurred in providing facilities and equipment for which the 
Contractor has no foreseeable reuse.
    (b) The amount of the Government's liability upon cancellation or 
termination of any of the services ordered under this agreement/contract 
will be determined under applicable tariffs governing cancellation and 
termination charges which--
    (1) Are filed by the Contractor with a governmental regulatory body, 
as defined in the Rates, Charges, and Services--Common Carriers clause 
of this agreement/contract;
    (2) Are in effect on the date of termination; and
    (3) Provide specific cancellation or termination charges for the 
facilities and equipment involved or show how to determine the charges.
    (c) The amount of the Government's liability upon cancellation or 
termination of any of the services ordered under this agreement/
contract, which are not subject to a governmental regulatory body, will 
be determined under a mutually agreed schedule in the communication 
services authorization (CSA) or other contractual document.
    (d) If no applicable tariffs are in effect on the date of 
cancellation or termination or set forth in the applicable CSA or other 
contractual document, the Government's liability will be determined 
under the following settlement procedures--
    (1) The Contractor agrees to provide the Contracting Officer, in 
such reasonable detail as the Contracting Officer may require, inventory 
schedules covering all items of property or facilities in the 
Contractor's possession, the cost of which is included in the Basic 
Cancellation or Termination Liability for which the Contractor has no 
foreseeable reuse.
    (2) The Contractor shall use its best efforts to sell property or 
facilities when the Contractor has no foreseeable reuse or when the 
Government has not exercised its option to take title under the title to 
Telecommunications Facilities and Equipment clause of this agreement/
contract. The Contractor shall apply any proceeds of the sale to reduce 
any payments by the Government to the Contractor under a cancellation or 
termination settlement.
    (3) The Contractor shall record actual nonrecoverable costs under 
established accounting procedures prescribed by the cognizant 
governmental regulatory authority or, if no such procedures have been 
prescribed, under generally accepted accounting procedures applicable to 
the provision of telecommunication services for public use.
    (4) The actual nonrecoverable costs are the installed costs of the 
facilities and equipment, less cost of reusable materials, and less net 
salvage value. Installed costs shall include the actual cost of 
equipment and materials specifically provided or used, plus the actual 
cost of installing (including engineering, labor, supervision, 
transportation, rights-of-way, and any other items which are chargeable 
to the capital accounts of the Contractor) less any costs the Government 
may have directly reimbursed the Contractor under the Special 
Construction and Equipment Charges clause of this agreement/contract. 
Deduct from the Contractor's installed cost, the net salvage value 
(salvage value less cost of removal). In determining net salvage value, 
give consideration to foreseeable reuse of the facilities and equipment 
by the Contractor. Make allowance for the cost of dismantling, removal, 
reconditioning, and disposal of the facilities and equipment when 
necessary either to the sale of facilities

[[Page 527]]

or their reuse by the Contractor in another location.
    (5) The Basic Cancellation Liability is defined as the actual 
nonrecoverable cost which the Government shall reimburse the Contractor 
at the time services are cancelled. The Basic Termination Liability is 
defined as the nonrecoverable cost amortized in equal monthly increments 
throughout the liability period. Upon termination of services, the 
Government shall reimburse the Contractor for the nonrecoverable cost 
less such costs amortized to the date services are terminated. Establish 
the liability period as mutually agreed to but not to exceed ten years.
    (6) When the Basic Cancellation or Termination Liability established 
by the CSA or other contractual document is based on estimated costs, 
the Contractor agrees to settle on the basis of actual cost at the time 
of termination or cancellation.
    (7) The Contractor agrees that, if after settlement but within the 
termination liability period of the services, should the Contractor make 
reuse of equipment or facilities which were treated as nonreusable or 
nonsalvagable in the settlement, the Contractor shall reimburse the 
Government for the value of the equipment or facilities.
    (8) The Contractor agrees to exclude--
    (i) Any costs which are not included in determining cancellation and 
termination charges under the Contractor's standard practices or 
procedures; and
    (ii) Charges not ordinarily made by the Contractor for similar 
facilities or equipment, furnished under similar circumstances.
    (e) The Government may, under such terms and conditions as it may 
prescribe, make partial payments and payments on account against costs 
incurred by the Contractor in connection with the canceled or terminated 
portion of this agreement/contract. The Government may make these 
payments if in the opinion of the Contracting Officer the total of the 
payments is within the amount the Contractor is entitled. If the total 
of the payments is in excess of the amount finally agreed or determined 
to be due under this clause, the Contractor shall pay the excess to the 
Government upon demand.
    (f) Failure to agree shall be a dispute concerning a question of 
fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause.

facilities or equipment to minimize the charges to the Government.
    (b) If at any time the Government requires that telecommunications 
facilities or equipment be relocated within the Contractor's service 
area, the Government shall have the option of paying the costs of 
relocating the facilities or equipment in lieu of paying any termination 
or cancellation charge under the Cancellation or Termination of Orders-
Common Carriers clause of this agreement/contract. The Basic Termination 
Liability applicable to the facilities or equipment in their former 
location shall continue to apply to the facilities and equipment in 
their new location. Monthly rental charges shall continue to be paid 
during the period.
    (c) When there is another requirement or foreseeable reuse in place 
of canceled or terminated facilities or equipment, no charge shall apply 
and the Basic Cancellation or Termination Liability shall be 
appropriately reduced. When feasible, the Contractor shall promptly 
reuse discontinued channels or facilities, including equipment for which 
the Government is obligated to pay a minimum service charge.

252.242-7004  Material management and accounting system.

    As prescribed in 242.7206, use the following clause:

          Material Management and Accounting System (SEP 1996)

    (a) Definitions. As used in this clause--
    (1) Material management and accounting system means the Contractor's 
system or systems for planning, controlling, and accounting for the 
acquisition, use, issuing, and disposition of material. Material 
management and accounting systems may be manual or automated. They may 
be stand-alone systems or they may be integrated with planning, 
engineering, estimating, purchasing, inventory, accounting, or other 
systems.
    (2) Valid time-phased requirements means material which is--
    (i) Needed to fulfill the production plan, including reasonable 
quantities for scrap, shrinkage, yield, etc.; and
    (ii) Charged/billed to contracts or other cost objectives in a 
manner consistent with the need to fulfill the production plan.
    (3) Contractor means a business unit as defined in section 31.001 of 
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).
    (b) General. The Contractor agrees to--
    (1) Maintain a material management and accounting system (MMAS) 
that--
    (i) Reasonably forecasts material requirements;
    (ii) Ensures that costs of purchased and fabricated material charged 
or allocated to a contract are based on valid time-phased requirements; 
and
    (iii) Maintains a consistent, equitable, and unbiased logic for 
costing of material transactions.
    (2) Assess its MMAS and take reasonable action to comply with the 
MMAS standards in paragraph (f) of this clause.
    (c) Applicability. Paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause apply only 
if the Contractor--
    (1) Is a large business; and
    (2) Received, in its fiscal year preceding award of this contract, 
Department of Defense prime contracts or subcontracts, and their 
modifications totaling--
    (i) $70 million or more; or
    (ii) $30 million or more (but less than $70 million), and is 
notified in writing by the Contracting Officer that paragraphs (d) and 
(e) apply.
    (d) Disclosure, demonstration, and maintenance requirements. (1) The 
Contractor shall--
    (i) Disclose its MMAS to the Administrative Contracting Officer in 
writing; and
    (ii) If requested by the Administrative Contracting Officer, 
demonstrate that the MMAS conforms to the standards in paragraph (f) of 
this clause.
    (2) An MMAS disclosure is adequate when the Contractor has provided 
the Administrative Contracting Officer with documentation which--
    (i) Accurately describes those policies, procedures, and practices 
that the Contractor currently uses in its MMAS; and
    (ii) Provides sufficient detail for the Government to reasonably 
make an informed judgment regarding the adequacy of the MMAS.
    (3) An MMAS demonstration is adequate when the Contractor has 
provided the Administrative Contracting Officer--
    (i) Sufficient evidence to demonstrate the degree of compliance of 
its MMAS with the standards at paragraph (f) of this clause; and
    (ii) Identification of any significant deficiencies, the estimated 
cost impact of the deficiency, and a comprehensive corrective action 
plan.
    (4) The Contractor shall disclose significant changes in its MMAS to 
the Administrative Contracting Officer within 30 days of implementation.
    (5) If the contractor desires the Government to protect such 
information as privileged or confidential, the Contractor shall--
    (i) Notify the Government representative to whom the information is 
submitted, i.e., the ACO, or the auditor; and
    (ii) Ensure an appropriate legend is on the face of the document(s) 
at the time of submission.
    (e) Deficiencies. (1) If the Contractor receives a report which 
identifies deficiencies in its MMAS, the Contractor agrees to respond as 
follows--
    (i) If the Contractor agrees with the report findings and 
recommendations, the Contractor shall--

[[Page 531]]

    (A) Within 30 days, state its agreement in writing; and
    (B) Within 60 days, correct the deficiencies or submit a corrective 
action plan.
    (ii) If the Contractor disagrees with the report findings and 
recommendations, the Contractor shall, within 30 days, state its 
rationale for each area of disagreement.
    (2) The Administrative Contracting Officer shall evaluate the 
Contractor's response and notify the Contractor of the--
    (i) Determination concerning remaining deficiencies;
    (ii) Adequacy of any proposed or completed corrective action plan; 
and
    (iii) Need for any new or revised corrective action plan.
    (f) MMAS standards. MMAS systems shall have adequate internal 
accounting and administrative controls to ensure system and data 
integrity, and comply with the following:
    (1) Have an adequate system description including policies, 
procedures, and operating instructions which comply with the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation and Defense FAR Supplement;
    (2) Ensure that costs of purchased and fabricated material charged 
or allocated to a contract are based on valid time-phased requirements 
as impacted by minimum/economic order quantity restrictions--
    (i) A 98 percent bill of material accuracy and a 95 percent master 
production schedule accuracy are desirable as a goal in order to ensure 
that requirements are both valid and appropriately time-phased.
    (ii) If systems have accuracy levels below these, the Contractor 
shall demonstrate that--
    (A) There is no material harm to the Government due to lower 
accuracy levels; and
    (B) The cost to meet the accuracy goals is excessive in relation to 
the impact on the Government;
    (3) Provide a mechanism to identify, report, and resolve system 
control weaknesses and manual override. Systems should identify 
operational exceptions such as excess/residual inventory as soon as 
known;
    (4) Provide audit trails and maintain records (manual and those in 
machine readable form) necessary to evaluate system logic and to verify 
through transaction testing that the system is operating as desired;
    (5) Establish and maintain adequate levels of record accuracy, and 
include reconciliation of recorded inventory quantities to physical 
inventory by part number on a periodic basis. A 95 percent accuracy 
level is desirable. If systems have an accuracy level below 95 percent, 
the Contractor shall demonstrate that--
    (i) There is no material harm to the Government due to lower 
accuracy levels; and
    (ii) The cost to meet the accuracy goal is excessive in relation to 
the impact on the Government;
    (6) Provide detailed descriptions of circumstances which will result 
in manual or system generated transfers of parts;
    (7) Maintain a consistent, equitable, and unbiased logic for costing 
of material transactions--
    (i) The Contractor shall maintain and disclose written policies 
describing the transfer methodology and the loan/pay-back technique.
    (ii) The costing methodology may be standard or actual cost, or any 
of the inventory costing methods in 48 CFR 9904.411-50(b). Consistency 
shall be maintained across all contract and customer types, and from 
accounting period to accounting period for initial charging and transfer 
charging.
    (iii) The system should transfer parts and associated costs within 
the same billing period. In the few instances where this may not be 
appropriate, the Contractor may accomplish the material transaction 
using a loan/pay-back technique. The ``loan/pay-back technique'' means 
that the physical part is moved temporarily from the contract, but the 
cost of the part remains on the contract. The procedures for the loan/
pay-back technique must be approved by the Administrative Contracting 
Officer. When the technique is used, the Contractor shall have controls 
to ensure--
    (A) Parts are paid back expeditiously;
    (B) Procedures and controls are in place to correct any overbilling 
that might occur;
    (C) Monthly, at a minimum, identification of the borrowing contract 
and the date the part was borrowed; and
    (D) The cost of the replacement part is charged to the borrowing 
contract;
    (8) Where allocations from common inventory accounts are used, have 
controls (in addition to those in paragraphs (b)(2) and (7) of this 
clause) to ensure that--
    (i) Reallocations and any credit due are processed no less 
frequently than the routine billing cycle;
    (ii) Inventories retained for requirements which are not under 
contract are not allocated to contracts; and
    (iii) Algorithms are maintained based on valid and current data;
    (9) Notwithstanding FAR 45.505-3(f)(1)(ii), have adequate controls 
to ensure that physically commingled inventories that may include 
material for which costs are charged or allocated to fixed-price, cost-
reimbursement, and commercial contracts do not compromise requirements 
of any of the standards in paragraphs (f)(1) through (8) of this clause. 
Government furnished material shall not be--
    (i) Physically commingled with other material; or
    (ii) Used on commercial work; and

[[Page 532]]

    (10) Be subjected to periodic internal audits to ensure compliance 
with established policies and procedures.

252.242-7005  Cost/Schedule Status Report.

    As prescribed in 242.1107-70(a), use the following clause:

                 Cost/Schedule Status Report (Mar 1997)

    (a) The Contractor shall use management procedures in the 
performance of this contract that provide for--
    (1) Planning and control of costs;
    (2) Measurement of performance (value for completed tasks); and
    (3) Generation of timely and reliable information for the cost/
schedule status report (C/SSR).
    (b) As a minimum, these procedures must provide for--
    (1) Establishing the time-phased budgeted cost of work scheduled 
(including work authorization, budgeting, and scheduling), the budgeted 
cost for work performed, the actual cost of work performed, the budget 
at completion, the estimate at completion, and provisions for 
subcontractor performance measurement and reporting;
    (2) Applying all direct and indirect costs and provisions for use 
and control of management reserve and undistributed budget;
    (3) Incorporating changes to the contract budget base for both 
Government directed changes and internal replanning;
    (4) Establishing constraints to preclude subjective adjustment of 
data to ensure performance measurement remains realistic. Unless the 
Contracting Officer provides prior written approval, in no case shall 
the total allocated budget exceed the contract budget base. For cost-
reimbursement contracts, the contract budget base shall exclude changes 
for cost growth increases, other than for authorized changes to the 
contract scope; and
    (5) Establishing the capability to accurately identify and explain 
significant cost and schedule variances, both on a cumulative basis and 
projected at completion basis.
    (c) The Contractor may use a cost/schedule control system that has 
been recognized by the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer 
(ACO) as complying with the earned value management system criteria 
provided in DoD 5000.2-R, Mandatory Procedures for Major Defense 
Acquisition Programs (MDAPs) and Major Automated Information System 
(MAIS) Acquisition Programs.
    (d) The Government may require an integrated baseline review within 
180 calendar days after (1) contract award, (2) the exercise of 
significant contract options, or (3) the incorporation of major 
modifications. The purpose of the integrated baseline review is for the 
Government and the Contractor to jointly assess areas, such as the 
Contractor's planning, to ensure complete coverage of the statement of 
work, logical scheduling of the work activities, adequate resourcing, 
and identification of inherent risks. The Contractor shall provide 
necessary documents and data which describe the methods of planning, 
control and data generation in actual operation and satisfy the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this clause.
    (e) The Contractor shall provide access to all pertinent records, 
company procedures, and data requested by the ACO, or authorized 
representative, to--
    (1) Show proper implementation of the procedures generating the cost 
and schedule information being used to satisfy the C/SSR contractual 
data requirements to the Government; and
    (2) Ensure continuing application of the accepted company procedures 
in satisfying the C/SSR data item.
    (f) The Contractor shall submit any substantive changes to the 
procedures and their impact to the ACO for review.
    (g) The Contractor shall require a subcontractor to furnish C/SSR in 
each case where the subcontract is other than firm-fixed-price, is 12 
months or more in duration, and has critical or significant tasks 
related to the prime contract. Critical or significant tasks shall be 
defined by mutual agreement between the Government and Contractor. Each 
subcontractor's reported cost and schedule information shall be 
incorporated into the Contractor's C/SSR.

Contracting Officer and the Contractor may agree to increase or decrease 
such prices in accordance with this clause.
    (c) Demand for negotiation. (1) At any time, subject to the 
limitations specified in this clause, either the Contracting Officer or 
the Contractor may deliver to the other a written demand that the 
parties negotiate to revise the prices under this contract.
    (2) No such demand shall be made before 90 days after the date of 
this contract, and thereafter neither party shall make a demand having 
an effective date within 90 days of the effective date of any prior 
demand. However, this limitation does not apply to a wage adjustment 
during the 90 day period.
    (3) Each demand shall specify a date (the same as or subsequent to 
the date of the delivery of the demand) as to when the revised prices 
shall be effective. This date is the effective date of the price 
revision.

shall briefly state the basis of the demand and include the statements 
and data referred to in paragraph (d) of this clause.

reports, and accounting statements as may be of assistance in 
determining the accuracy and reliability of the new estimate;
    (4) A statement of the actual costs of performance under this 
contract to the extent that they are available at the time of the 
negotiation of the revision of prices under this clause; and

Contracting Officer considers necessary.

required by paragraph (d) of this clause, the Contractor and the 
Contracting Officer shall negotiate promptly in good faith to agree upon 
prices for services the Contractor will perform on and after the 
effective date of the price revision.
    (2) If the prices in this contract were established by competitive 
negotiation, they shall not be revised upward unless justified by 
changes in conditions occurring after the contract was awarded.
    (3) The agreement reached after each negotiation will be 
incorporated into the contract by supplemental agreement.
    (f) Disagreements. If, within 30 days after the date on which 
statements and data are required pursuant to paragraph (c) of this

event of a retroactive wage adjustment, the Contractor or the 
Contracting Officer may request an equitable adjustment in the prices in 
this contract.

arbitration award, or other document evidencing the retroactive wage 
adjustment.
    (3) Subject to the limitation in paragraph (g)(2) of this clause as 
to the time of making a request, completion or termination of this

[[Page 539]]

contract shall not affect the Contractor's right under paragraph (g) of 
this clause.
    (4) In case of disagreement concerning any question of fact, 
including whether any adjustment should be made, or the amount of such 
adjustment, the disagreement will be resolved in accordance with the 
Disputes clause of this contract.
    (5) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing 
of any request by or on behalf of the employees of the Contractor which 
may result in a retroactive wage adjustment. The notice shall be given

work is directly related to the defense contract; or
    (2) If there is no such representative, each such employee;
    (3) The State dislocated worker unit or office described in section 
311(b)(2) of the Job Training Partnership Act (29 U.S.C. 1661(b)(2));

subcontractors with subcontracts of $100,000 or more.
    (e) The notice provided an employee under paragraph (c) of this

employee for the purposes of determining whether such employee is 
eligible for training, adjustment assistance, and employment services 
under section 325 or 325A of the Job Training Partnership Act (29 U.S.C. 
1662d, 1662d-1). If the Contractor has specified that the anticipated 
contract termination or reduction is not likely to result in plant 
closure or mass layoff, as defined in 29 U.S.C. 2101, the employee shall 
be eligible only for services under section 314(b) and paragraphs (1) 
through (14), (16), and (18) of section 314(c) of the Job Training

252.251-7000  Ordering from Government supply sources.

    As prescribed in 251.107, use the following clause:

           Ordering From Government Supply Sources (May 1995)

    (a) When placing orders under Federal Supply Schedules or Personal 
Property Rehabilitation Price Schedules, the Contractor shall follow the 
terms of the applicable schedule and authorization. Include in each 
order:
    (1) A copy of the authorization (unless a copy was previously 
furnished to the Federal Supply Schedule or Personal Property 
Rehabilitation Price Schedule contractor).
    (2) The following statement: This order is placed under written 
authorization from ____________ dated ____________.

In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of 
this order and those of your Federal Supply Schedule contract or 
Personal Property Rehabilitation Price Schedule contract, the latter 
will govern.
    (3) The completed address(es) to which the Contractor's mail, 
freight, and billing documents are to be directed.
    (b) If a Federal Supply Schedule contractor refuses to honor an 
order placed by a Government contractor under an agency authorization, 
the Contractor shall report the circumstances to the General Services 
Administration, FFN, Washington, DC 20406, with a copy to the 
authorizing office.
    (c) When placing orders under nonmandatory schedule contracts and 
requirements contracts, issued by the General Services Administration 
(GSA) Office of Information Resources Management, for automated data 
processing equipment, software and maintenance, communications equipment 
and supplies, and teleprocessing services, the Contractor shall follow 
the terms of the applicable contract and the procedures in paragraph (a) 
of this clause.
    (d) When placing orders for Government stock, the Contractor shall--

[[Page 548]]

    (1) Comply with the requirements of the Contracting Officer's 
authorization, using FEDSTRIP or MILSTRIP procedures, as appropriate;
    (2) Use only the GSA Form 1948-A, Retail Services Shopping Plate, 
when ordering from GSA Self-Service Stores;
    (3) Order only those items required in the performance of Government 
contracts; and
    (4) Pay invoices from Government supply sources promptly. For 
purchases made from DoD supply sources, this means within 30 days of the 
date of a proper invoice (see also Defense Federal Acquisition 
Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 251.105). For purposes of computing 
interest for late Contractor payments, the Government's invoice is 
deemed to be a demand for payment in accordance with the Interest clause 
of this contract. The Contractor's failure to pay may also result in the 
DoD supply source refusing to honor the requisition (see DFARS 
251.102(f)) or in the Contracting Officer terminating the Contractor's 
authorization to use DoD supply sources. In the event the Contracting 
Officer decides to terminate the authorization due to the Contractor's 
failure to pay in a timely manner, the Contracting Officer shall provide 
the Contractor with prompt written notice of the intent to terminate the 
authorization and the basis for such action. The Contractor shall have 
10 days after receipt of the Government's notice in which to provide 
additional information as to why the authorization should not be 
terminated. Such termination shall not provide the Contractor with an 
excusable delay for failure to perform or complete the contract in 
accordance with the terms of the contract, and the Contractor shall be 
solely responsible for any increased costs.
    (e) Only the Contractor may request authorization for subcontractor 
use of Government supply sources. The Contracting Officer will not grant 
authorizations for subcontractor use without approval of the Contractor.
    (f) Government invoices shall be submitted to the Contractor's 
billing address, and Contractor payments shall be sent to the Government 
remittance address specified below:

Contractor's Billing Address (include point of contact and telephone 
number):

Government Remittance Address (include point of contact and telephone 
number):

                             (End of clause)

other than performance of Government contracts.
    (d) The Contractor shall assume, without the right of reimbursement 
from the Government, the cost or expense of any use of IFMS vehicles and 
services not related to the performance of the contract.
    (e) Only the Contractor may request authorization for subcontractor 
use of IFMS vehicles. The Contracting Officer will not grant

codes to choose from. In some cases, use a 4-character code from a list 
of 4-character codes; in other cases, construct a code using the 
instructions in the Manual. If more than one category or code applies to 
the contracting action, enter the one that best identifies the product 
or service representing the largest dollar value.
    (A) Supplies. If the contracting action is for the purchase (not 
lease or rental) of supplies, enter an FSC code in Block B12A. FSC codes 
are all numeric. Look in Section I, Part C, of the DoD Procurement

letter ``A''. Do not use an RDT&E code for--
    (1) Purchase, lease, or rental of equipment, supplies, or services 
separately purchased in support of RDT&E work, even if RDT&E funds are 
cited. Instead, use an FSC or Service code under the instructions in

Service code under the instructions in paragraphs (i) (A) or (B).
    (ii) BLOCK B12B, DOD CLAIMANT PROGRAM CODE. Enter a code that 
identifies the commodity described in Block B12E. These codes are in 
Section III of the DoD Procurement Coding Manual (MN02). If more than 
one code applies to the contracting action, enter the one that best 
identifies the product or service representing the largest dollar value. 
If the description in Block B12E is for--
    (A) Research and development (R&D), enter the code that best 
represents the objective of the R&D. For example, if the objective of 
the research and development is a guided missile, enter code A20. If the 
R&D cannot be identified to any particular objective, enter code S10.
    (B) Ship repair, inspect and repair as necessary (IRAN), 
modification of aircraft, overhaul of engines, or similar maintenance, 
repair or modification services, enter the code that best identifies the 
program.
    (C) Equipment rental (including rental of automated data processing 
equipment), enter code S10.
    (D) Utility services, enter code S10.

[[Page 553]]

    (E) Services that cannot be identified to any listed program, enter 
code S10.
    (F) Supplies or equipment that cannot be identified to any listed 
program, enter code C9E.
    (iii) BLOCK B12C PROGRAM, SYSTEM OR EQUIPMENT CODE.
    (A) Enter a code that describes the program, weapons system or 
equipment. These codes are in Section II of the DoD Procurement Coding 
Manual (MN02). If there is no code that applies to the contracting 
action, enter three zeros. If more than one code applies to the action, 
enter the one that best identifies the product or service representing 
the largest dollar value.
    (B) If the contracting action is funded by the Ballistic Missile 
Defense Organization, enter code CAA.
    (C) If the contracting action supports environmental cleanup 
programs, enter one of the codes listed in Section II of the DoD 
Procurement Coding Manual (MN02) under the heading ``Description and Use 
of Program Codes--Environmental Cleanup Programs.''
    (D) Defense Logistics Agency activities must use the code assigned 
by the sponsoring service.
    (iv) BLOCK B12D, SIC CODE.
    Enter the standard industrial classification (SIC) code for the 
acquisition (as opposed to the SIC of the manufacturer or dealer). Use 
the SIC code in effect at the time of award. These codes are in the OMB 
Standard Industrial Classification Manual. If more than one code applies 
to the contracting action, enter the one that best identifies the 
product or service representing the largest dollar value.
    (v) BLOCK B12E, NAME/DESCRIPTION. Enter the name or brief 
description of the commodity or service. If the description is 
classified, enter only the work ``Classified.'' Do not, however, use 
``Classified'' when a code name (e.g., Minuteman, Polaris, Trident, 
Pershing, etc.) or an identifying program number (e.g., WS-107A) can be 
used.

    1. There is created the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals 
which is hereby designated as the authorized representative of the 
Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the 
Navy and the Secretary of the Air Force, in hearing, considering and 
determining appeals by contractors from decisions of contracting

disputed questions. These appeals may be taken (a) pursuant to the 
Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. Sec. 601, et seq.), (b) 
pursuant to the provisions of contracts requiring the decision by the 
Secretary of Defense or by a Secretary of a Military Department or their 
duly authorized representative or board, or (c) pursuant to the 
provisions of any directive whereby the Secretary of Defense or the 
Secretary of a Military Department has granted a right of appeal not 
contained in the contract on any matter consistent with the contract 
appeals procedure. The Board may determine contract disputes for other 
departments and agencies by agreement. The Board shall operate under 
general policies established or approved by the Under Secretary of 
Defense (Research and Engineering).
    2. Membership of the Board shall consist of attorneys at law who 
have been qualified in the manner prescribed by the Contract Disputes

Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) and the Assistant 
Secretaries of the Military Departments responsible for procurement. The 
chairman and vice-chairmen shall serve in that capacity for a two-year 
term unless sooner removed or reappointed for an additional term or

vice-chairmen will act for the chairman in his absence. In the absence 
of a vice-chairman, the chairman or acting chairman may designate a 
member of the Board to serve as a temporary vice-chairman.

Services Board of Contract Appeals to decide appeals on the record of 
the appeal to the best of their knowledge and ability in accordance with 
applicable contract provisions and in accordance with law and regulation 
pertinent thereto.
    4. The chairman of the Board shall be responsible for establishing 
appropriate divisions of the Board to provide for the most effective and 
expeditous handling of appeals. He shall be reponsible for assigning 
appeals to the divisions for decision without regard to the military 
department or other procuring agency which entered into the contract. A 
division may consist of one or more members of the Board. The chairman 
shall designate one member of each division as the division head. The 
division heads and the chairman and vice-chairmen shall constitute the 
senior deciding group of the Board. A majority of the members of a 
division or of the senior deciding group shall constitute a quorum for 
the transaction of the business of each, respectively. Decisions of the 
Board shall be by majority vote of the members of a division 
participating and the chairman and a vice-chairman, unless the chairman 
refers the appeal for decision by the senior deciding group. The 
decision of the Board in cases so referred to the senior deciding group 
shall be by majority vote of the participating members of that group. 
The chairman may refer an appeal of unusual difficulty, significant 
precedential importance, or serious dispute within the normal decision 
process for decision by the senior deciding group. An appeal involving 
$50,000 or less may be decided by a single member or fewer members of 
the Board than hereinbefore provided for cases of unlimited dollar 
amount, under accelerated or expedited procedures as provided in the 
Rules of the Board and the Contract Disputes Act of 1978.
    5. The Board shall have all powers necessary and incident to the 
proper performance of its duties. Subject to the approval of the Under 
Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) and the Assistant 
Secretaries of the Military Departments responsible for procurement, the 
Board shall adopt its own methods of procedure, and rules and 
regulations for its conduct and for the preparation and presentation of 
appeals and issuance of opinions. The Military Departments and other 
procuring agencies shall provide

[[Page 579]]

legal personnel to prepare and present the contentions of the 
departments or agencies in relation to appeals filed with the Board. It 
shall not be necessary for the Board, unless it otherwise desires, to 
communicate with more than one trial attorney in each of the departments 
or agencies concerning the preparation and presentation of appeals and 
the obtaining of all records deemed by the Board to be pertinent 
thereto.
    6. Any member of the Board or any examiner, designated by the 
chairman, shall be authorized to hold hearings, examine witnesses, and 
receive evidence and argument for consideration and determination of the 
appeal by the designated division. A member of the Board shall have 
authority to administer oaths and issue subpoenas as specified in 
section 11 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978. The chairman may 
request orders of the court in cases of contumacy or refusal to obey a 
subpoena in the manner prescribed in that section.
    7. The chairman shall be responsible for the internal organization 
of the Board and for its administration. He shall provide within 
approved ceilings for the staffing of the Board with non-member 
personnel, including hearing examiners, as may be required for the 
performance of the functions of the Board. The chairman shall appoint a 
recorder of the Board. Such personnel shall be responsible to and shall 
function under the direction, supervision and control of the chairman.
    8. The Board will be serviced by the Department of the Army for 
administrative support for its operations as required. Administrative 
support will include budgeting, funding, fiscal control, manpower 
control and utilization, personnel administration, security 
administration, supplies, and other administrative services. The 
Departments of the Army, Navy, Air Force and the Office of the Secretary 
of Defense will participate in financing the Board's operations on an 
equal basis and to the extent determined by the Assistant Secretary of 
Defense (Comptroller). The cost of processing appeals for departments 
and agencies other than those in the Department of Defense will be 
reimbursed.
    9. The chairman of the Board will furnish the Secretary of Defense 
and to the Secretaries of the Military Departments by October 31 of each 
year a report containing an account of the Board's transactions and 
proceedings for the preceding fiscal year. Within 30 days following the 
close of a calendar quarter, the chairman shall forward a report of the 
Board's proceedings for the quarter to the Under Secretary of Defense 
(Research and Engineering), the Assistant Secretaries of the Military 
Departments responsible for procurement, and to the Director of the 
Defense Logistics Agency. Such reports shall disclose the number of 
appeals received, cases heard, opinions rendered, current reserve of 
pending matters, and such other information as may be required.
    10. The Board shall have a seal bearing the following inscription: 
``Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals.'' This seal shall be affixed 
to all authentications of copies of records and to such other 
instruments as the Board may determine.
    11. This revised charter is effective April 21, 1980.

                                 Preface

                 I. Jurisdiction for Considering Appeals

    The Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (referred to herein as 
the Board) shall consider and determine appeals from decisions of 
contracting officers pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 Pub. 
L. 95-563, 41 U.S.C. 601-613) relating to contracts made by (i) the 
Departments of Defense, Army, Navy and Air Force or (ii) any other 
executive agency when such agency or the Administrator for Federal 
Procurement Policy has designated the Board to decide the appeal.

               II. Location and Organization of the Board

    (a) The Board's address is Skyline Six, 5109 Leesburg Pike, 7th 
Floor, Falls Church, VA 22041, telephone (202) 756-8500 (receptionist), 
756-8502 (recorder).
    (b) The Board consists of a chairman, two or more vice chairmen, and 
other members, all of whom are attorneys at law duly licensed by a 
state, commonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia. Board 
members are designated Administrative Judges.
    (c) There are a number of divisions of the Armed Services Board of 
Contract Appeals, established by the Chairman of the Board in such 
manner as to provide for the most effective and expeditious handling of 
appeals. The Chairman and a Vice Chairman of the Board act as members of 
each division. Appeals are assigned to the divisions for decision 
without regard to the military department or other procuring agency 
which entered into the contract involved. Hearing may be held by a 
designated member (Administrative Judge), or by a duly authorized 
examiner. Except for

[[Page 580]]

appeals processed under the expedited or accelerated procedure, the 
decision of a majority of a division constitutes the decision of the 
Board, unless the chairman refers the appeal to the Board's Senior 
Deciding Group (consisting of the chairman, vice chairmen and all 
division heads), in which event a decision of a majority of that group 
constitutes the decision of the Board. Appeals referred to the Senior 
Deciding Group are those of unusual difficulty, significant precedential 
importance, or serious dispute within the normal division decision 
process. For decisions of appeals processed under the expedited or 
accelerated procedure, see rules 12.2(c) and 12.3(b).

                         Preliminary Procedures

    1. Appeals, How Taken. (a) Notice of an appeal shall be in writing 
and mailed or otherwise furnished to the Board within 90 days from the 
date of receipt of a contracting officer's decision. A copy thereof 
shall be furnished to the contracting officer from whose decision the 
appeal is taken.
    (b) Where the contractor has submitted a claim of $50,000 or less to 
the contracting officer and has requested a written decision within 60 
days from receipt of the request, and the contracting officer has not 
done so, the contractor may file a notice of appeal as provided in 
subparagraph (a) above, citing the failure of the contracting officer to 
issue a decision.
    (c) Where the contractor has submitted a properly certified claim 
over $50,000 to the contracting officer or has requested a decision by 
the contracting officer which presently involves no monetary amount 
pursuant to the Disputes clause, and the contracting officer has failed 
to issue a decision within a reasonable time, taking into account such 
factors as the size and complexity of the claim, the contractor may file 
a notice of appeal as provided in subparagraph (a) above, citing the 
failure of the contracting officer to issue a decision.
    (d) Upon docketing of appeals filed pursuant to (b) or (c) hereof, 
the Board may, at its option, stay further proceedings pending issuance 
of a final decision by the contracting officer within such period of 
time as is determined by the Board.
    (e) In lieu of filing a notice of appeal under (b) or (c) hereof, 
the contractor may request the Board to direct the contracting officer 
to issue a decision in a specified period of time, as determined by the 
Board, in the event of undue delay on the part of the contracting 
officer.
    2. Notice of Appeal, Contents of. A notice of appeal should indicate 
that an appeal is being taken and should identify the contract (by 
number), the department and/or agency involved in the dispute, the 
decision from which the appeal is taken, and the amount in dispute, if 
known. The notice of appeal should be signed personally by the appellant 
(the contractor taking the appeal), or by the appellant's duly 
authorized representative or attorney. The complaint referred to in rule 
6 may be filed with the notice of appeal, or the appellant may designate 
the notice of appeal as a complaint, if it otherwise fulfills the 
requirements of a complaint.
    3. Docketing of Appeals. When a notice of appeal in any form has 
been received by the Board, it shall be docketed promptly. Notice in 
writing shall be given to the appellant with a copy of these rules, and 
to the contracting officer.
    4. Preparation, Content, Organization, Forwarding, and Status of 
Appeal File-- (a) Duties of Contracting Officer-- Within 30 days of 
receipt of an appeal, or notice that an appeal has been filed, the 
contracting officer shall assemble and transmit to the Board an appeal 
file consisting of all documents pertinent to the appeal, including:
    (1) The decision from which the appeal is taken;
    (2) The contract, including pertinent specifications, amendments, 
plans and drawings;
    (3) All correspondence between the parties relevant to the appeal, 
including the letter or letters of claim in response to which the 
decision was issued;
    (4) Transcripts of any testimony taken during the course of 
proceedings, and affidavits or statements of any witnesses on the matter 
in dispute made prior to the filing of the notice of appeal with the 
Board; and
    (5) Any additional information considered relevant to the appeal.
    Within the same time above specified the contracting officer shall 
furnish the appellant a copy of each document he transmits to the Board, 
except those in subparagraph (a)(2) above. As to the latter, a list 
furnished appellant indicating specific contractual documents 
transmitted will suffice.
    (b) Duties of the Appellant-- Within 30 days after receipt of a copy 
of the appeal file assembled by the contracting officer, the appellant 
shall transmit to the Board any documents not contained therein which he 
considers relevant to the appeal, and furnish two copies of such 
documents to the government trial attorney.
    (c) Organization of Appeal File-- Documents in the appeal file may 
be originals or legible facsimiles or authenticated copies, and shall be 
arranged in chronological order where practicable, numbered 
sequentially, tabbed, and indexed to identify the contents of the file.
    (d) Lengthy Documents-- Upon request by either party, the Board may 
waive the requirement to furnish to the other party copies of bulky, 
lengthy, or out-of-size documents in the appeal file when inclusion 
would be burdensome. At the time a party files with the Board a document 
as to which

[[Page 581]]

such a waiver has been granted he shall notify the other party that the 
document or a copy is available for inspection at the offices of the 
Board or of the party filing same.
    (e) Status of Documents in Appeal File-- Documents contained in the 
appeal file are considered, without further action by the parties, as 
part of the record upon which the Board will render its decision. 
However, a party may object, for reasons stated, to consideration of a 
particular document or documents reasonably in advance of hearing or, if 
there is no hearing, of settling the record. If such objection is made, 
the Board shall remove the document or documents from the appeal file 
and permit the party offering the document to move its admission as 
evidence in accordance with rules 13 and 20.
    (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the filing of the rule 4 (a) and 
(b) documents may be dispensed with by the Board either upon request of 
the appellant in his notice of appeal or thereafter upon stipulation of 
the parties.
    5. Motions. (a) Any motion addressed to the jurisdiction of the 
Board shall be promptly filed. Hearing on the motion shall be afforded 
on application of either party. However, the Board may defer its 
decision on the motion pending hearing on both the merits and the 
motion. The Board shall have the right at any time and on its own 
initiative to raise the issue of its jurisdiction to proceed with a 
particular case, and shall do so by an appropriate order, affording the 
parties an opportunity to be heard thereon.
    (b) The Board may entertain and rule upon other appropriate motions.
    6. Pleadings--(a) Appellant-- Within 30 days after receipt of notice 
of docketing of the appeal, the appellant shall file with the Board an 
original and two copies of a complaint setting forth simple, concise and 
direct statements of each of its claims. Appellant shall also set forth 
the basis, with appropriate reference to contract provisions, of each 
claim and the dollar amount claimed, to the extent known. This pleading 
shall fulfill the generally recognized requirements of a complaint, 
although no particular form is required. Upon receipt of the complaint, 
the Board shall serve a copy of it upon the Government. Should the 
complaint not be received within 30 days, appellant's claim and appeal 
may, if in the opinion of the Board the issues before the Board are 
sufficiently defined, be deemed to set forth its complaint and the 
Government shall be so notified.
    (b) Government-- Within 30 days from receipt of the complaint, or 
the aforesaid notice from the Board, the Government shall prepare and 
file with the Board an original and two copies of an answer thereto. The 
answer shall set forth simple, concise and direct statements of 
Government's defenses to each claim asserted by appellant, including any 
affirmative defenses available. Upon receipt of the answer, the Board 
shall serve a copy upon appellant. Should the answer not be received 
within 30 days, the Board may, in its discretion, enter a general denial 
on behalf of the Government, and the appellant shall be so notified.
    (c) A party who intends to raise an issue concerning the law of a 
foreign country shall give notice in his pleadings or other reasonable 
written notice. The Board, in determining foreign law, may consider any 
relevant material or source, including testimony, whether or not 
submitted by a party or admissible under Rules 11, 13 or 20. The 
determination of foreign law shall be treated as a ruling on a question 
of law.
    7. Amendments of Pleadings or Record. The Board upon its own 
initiative or upon application by a party may order a party to make a 
more definite statement of the complaint or answer, or to reply to an 
answer. The Board may, in its discretion, and within the proper scope of 
the appeal, permit either party to amend its pleading upon conditions 
fair to both parties. When issues within the proper scope of the appeal, 
but not raised by the pleadings, are tried by express or implied consent 
of the parties, or by permission of the Board, they shall be treated in 
all respects as if they had been raised therein. In such instances, 
motions to amend the pleadings to conform to the proof may be entered, 
but are not required. If evidence is objected to at a hearing on the 
ground that it is not within the issues raised by the pleadings, it may 
be admitted within the proper scope of the appeal, provided, however, 
that the objecting party may be granted a continuance if necessary to 
enable it to meet such evidence.
    8. Hearing Election. After filing of the Government's answer or 
notice from the Board that it has entered a general denial on behalf of 
the Government, each party shall advise whether it desires a hearing as 
prescribed in Rules 17 through 25, or whether it elects to submit its 
case on the record without a hearing, as prescribed in Rule 11.
    9. Prehearing Briefs. Based on an examination of the pleadings, and 
its determination of whether the arguments and authorities addressed to 
the issues are adequately set forth therein, the Board may, in its 
discretion, require the parties to submit prehearing briefs in any case 
in which a hearing has been elected pursuant to Rule 8. If the Board 
does not require prehearing briefs either party may, in its discretion 
and upon appropriate and sufficient notice to the other party, furnish a 
prehearing brief to the Board. In any case where a prehearing brief is 
submitted, it shall be furnished so as to be received by the Board at 
least 15 days prior to the date set for hearing, and a copy shall 
simultaneously be furnished to the other party as previously arranged.

[[Page 582]]

    10. Prehearing or Presubmission Conference. (a) Whether the case is 
to be submitted pursuant to Rule 11, or heard pursuant to Rules 17 
through 25, the Board may upon its own initiative, or upon the 
application of either party, arrange a telephone conference or call upon 
the parties to appear before an administrative judge or examiner of the 
Board for a conference to consider:
    (1) Simplification, clarification, or severing of the issues;
    (2) The possibility of obtaining stipulations, admissions, 
agreements and rulings on admissibility of docments, understandings on 
matters already of record, or similar agreements that will avoid 
unnecessary proof;
    (3) Agreements and rulings to facilitate discovery;
    (4) Limitation of the number of expert witnesses, or avoidance of 
similar cumulative evidence;
    (5) The possibility of agreement disposing of any or all of the 
issues in dispute; and
    (6) Such other matters as may aid in the disposition of the appeal.
    (b) The administrative judge or examiner of the Board shall make 
such rulings and orders as may be appropriate to aid in the disposition 
of the appeal. The results of pretrial conferences, including any 
rulings and orders, shall be reduced to writing by the administrative 
judge or examiner and this writing shall thereater constitute a part of 
the record.
    11. Submission Without a Hearing. Either party may elect to waive a 
hearing and to submit its case upon the record before the Board, as 
settled pursuant to Rule 13. Submission of a case without hearing does 
not relieve the parties from the necessity of proving the facts 
supporting their allegations or defenses. Affidavits, depositions, 
admissions, answers to interrogatories, and stipulations may be employed 
to supplement other documentary evidence in the Board record. The Board 
may permit such submissions to be supplemented by oral argument 
(transcribed if requested), and by briefs arranged in accordance with 
Rule 23.
    12. Optional SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) and ACCELERATED Procedures. 
These procedures are available solely at the election of the appellant.
    12.1  Elections to Utilize SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) and ACCELERATED 
Procedures. (a) In appeals where the amount in dispute is $10,000 or 
less, the appellant may elect to have the appeal processed under a SMALL 
CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure requiring decision of the appeal, whenever 
possible, within 120 days after the Board receives written notice of the 
appellant's election to utilize this procedure. The details of this 
procedure appear in section 12.2 of this Rule. An appellant may elect 
the ACCELERATED procedure rather than the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) 
procedure for any appeal eligible for the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) 
procedure.
    (b) In appeals where the amount in dispute is $50,000 or less, the 
appellant may elect to have the appeal processed under an ACCELERATED 
procedure requiring decision of the appeal, whenever possible, within 
180 days after the Board receives written notice of the appellant's 
election to utilize this procedure. The details of this procedure appear 
in section 12.3 of this Rule.
    (c) The appellant's election of either the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) 
procedure or the ACCELERATED procedure may be made by written notice 
within 60 days after receipt of notice of docketing, unless such period 
is extended by the Board for good cause. The election may not be 
withdrawn except with permission of the Board and for good cause.
    12.2  The Small Claims (Expedited) Procedure. (a) In cases 
proceeding under the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure, the following 
time periods shall apply:
    (1) Within 10 days from the Government's first receipt from either 
the appellant or the Board of a copy of the appellant's notice of 
election of the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure, the Government shall 
send the Board a copy of the contract, the contracting officer's final 
decision, and the appellant's claim letter or letters, if any; remaining 
documents required under Rule 4 shall be submitted in accordance with 
times specified in that rule unless the Board otherwise directs.
    (2) Within 15 days after the Board has acknowledged receipt of 
appellant's notice of election, the assigned administrative judge shall 
take the following actions, if feasible, in an informal meeting or a 
telephone conference with both parties: (i) Identify and simplify the 
issues; (ii) establish a simplified procedure appropriate to the 
particular appeal involved; (iii) determine whether either party wants a 
hearing, and if so, fix a time and place therefor; (iv) require the 
Government to furnish all the additional documents relevant to the 
appeal; and (v) establish an expedited schedule for resolution of the 
appeal.
    (b) Pleadings, discovery, and other prehearing activity will be 
allowed only as consistent with the requirement to conduct the hearing 
on the date scheduled, or if no hearing is scheduled, to close the 
record on a date that will allow decisions within the 120-day limit. The 
Board, in its discretion, may impose shortened time periods for any 
actions prescribed or allowed under these rules, as necessary to enable 
the Board to decide the appeal within the 120-day limit, allowing 
whatever time, up to 30 days, that the Board considers necessary for the 
preparation of the decision after closing the record and the filing of 
briefs, if any.

[[Page 583]]

    (c) Written decision by the Board in cases processed under the SMALL 
CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure will be short and contain only summary 
findings of fact and conclusions. Decisions will be rendered for the 
Board by a single administrative judge. If there has been a hearing, the 
administrative judge presiding at the hearing may, in the judge's 
discretion, at the conclusion of the hearing and after entertaining such 
oral arguments as deemed appropriate, render on the record oral summary 
findings of fact, conclusions, and a decision of the appeal. Whenever 
such an oral decision is rendered, the Board will subsequently furnish 
the parties a typed copy of such oral decision for record and payment 
purposes and to establish the starting date for the period for filing a 
motion for reconsideration under rule 29.
    (d) A decision against the Government or the contractor shall have 
no value as precedent, and in the absence of fraud shall be final and 
conclusive and may not be appealed or set aside.
    12.3  The Accelerated Procedure. (a) In cases proceeding under the 
Accelerated procedure, the parties are encouraged, to the extent 
possible consistent with adequate presentation of their factual and 
legal positions, to waive pleadings, discovery, and briefs. The Board, 
in its discretion, may shorten time periods prescribed or allowed 
elsewhere in these rules, including rule 4, as necessary to enable the 
Board to decide the appeal within 180 days after the Board has received 
the appellant's notice of election of the ACCELERATED procedure, and may 
reserve 30 days for preparation of the decision.
    (b) Written decision by the Board in cases processed under the 
ACCELERATED procedure will normally be short and contain only summary 
findings of fact and conclusions. Decisions will be rendered for the 
Board by a single administrative judge with the concurrence of a vice 
chairman, or by a majority among these two and the chairman in case of 
disagreement. Alternatively, in cases where the amount in dispute is 
$10,000 or less as to which the ACCELERATED procedure has been elected 
and in which there has been a hearing, the single administrative judge 
presiding at the hearing may, with the concurrence of both parties, at 
the conclusion of the hearing and after entertaining such oral arguments 
as deemed appropriate, render on the record oral summary findings of 
fact, conclusions, and a decision of the appeal. Whenever such an oral 
decision is rendered, the Board will subsequently furnish the parties a 
typed copy of such oral decision for record and payment purposes, and to 
establish the starting date for the period of filing a motion for 
reconsideration under Rule 29.
    12.4  Motions for Reconsideration in Rule 12 Cases. Motions for 
Reconsideration of cases decided under either the SMALL CLAIMS 
(EXPEDITED) procedure or the ACCELERATED procedure need not be decided 
within the original 120-day or 180-day limit, but all such motions shall 
be processed and decided rapidly so as to fulfill the intent of this 
Rule.
    13.  Settling the Record. (a) The record upon which the Board's 
decision will be rendered consists of the documents furnished under 
Rules 4 and 12, to the extent admitted in evidence, and the following 
items, if any: pleadings, prehearing conference memoranda or orders, 
prehearing briefs, depositions or interrogatories received in evidence, 
admissions, stipulations, transcripts of conferences and hearings, 
hearing exhibits, post-hearing briefs, and documents which the Board has 
specifically designated be made a part of the record. The record will, 
at all reasonable times, be available for inspection by the parties at 
the office of the Board.
    (b) Except as the Board may otherwise order in its discretion, no 
proof shall be received in evidence after completion of an oral hearing 
or, in cases submitted on the record, after notification by the Board 
that the case is ready for decision.
    (c) The weight to be attached to any evidence of record will rest 
within the sound discretion of the Board. The Board may in any case 
require either party, with appropriate notice to the other party, to 
submit additional evidence on any matter relevant to the appeal.
    14. Discovery--Depositions--(a) General Policy and Protective 
Orders-- The parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary discovery 
procedures. In connection with any deposition or other discovery 
procedure, the Board may make any order required to protect a party or 
person from annoyance, embarrassment, or undue burden or expense. Those 
orders may include limitations on the scope, method, time and place for 
discovery, and provisions for protecting the secrecy of confidential 
information or documents.
    (b) When Depositions Permitted--After an appeal has been docketed 
and complaint filed, the parties may mutually agree to, or the Board 
may, upon application of either party, order the taking of testimony of 
any person by deposition upon oral examination or written 
interrogatories before any officer authorized to administer oaths at the 
place of examination, for use as evidence or for purpose of discovery. 
The application for order shall specify whether the purpose of the 
deposition is discovery or for use as evidence.
    (c) Orders on Depositions--The time, place, and manner of taking 
depositions shall be as mutually agreed by the parties, or failing such 
agreement, governed by order of the Board.
    (d) Use as Evidence--No testimony taken by depositions shall be 
considered as part of the evidence in the hearing of an appeal until

[[Page 584]]

such testimony is offered and received in evidence at such hearing. It 
will not ordinarily be received in evidence if the deponent is present 
and can testify at the hearing. In such instances, however, the 
deposition may be used to contradict or impeach the testimony of the 
deponent given at the hearing. In cases submitted on the record, the 
Board may, in its discretion, receive depositions to supplement the 
record.
    (e) Expenses--Each party shall bear its own expenses associated with 
the taking of any deposition.
    (f) Subpoenas--Where appropriate, a party may request the issuance 
of a subpoena under the provisions of Rule 21.
    15. Interrogatories to Parties, Admission of Facts, and Production 
and Inspection of Documents. After an appeal has been docketed and 
complaint filed with the Board, a party may serve on the other party: 
(a) Written interrogatories to be answered separately in writing, signed 
under oath and answered or objected to within 45 days after service; (b) 
a request for the admission of specified facts and/or the authenticity 
of any documents, to be answered or objected to within 45 days after 
service; the factual statements and the authenticity of the documents to 
be deemed admitted upon failure of a party to respond to the request; 
and (c) a request for the production, inspection and copying of any 
documents or objects not privileged, which reasonably may lead to the 
discovery of admissible evidence, to be answered or objected to within 
45 days after service. The Board may allow a shorter or longer time. Any 
discovery engaged in under this Rule shall be subject to the provisions 
of Rule 14(a) with respect to general policy and protective orders, and 
of Rule 35 with respect to sanctions.
    16. Service of Papers Other Than Subpoenas. Papers shall be served 
personally or by mail, addressed to the party upon whom service is to be 
made. Copies of complaints, answers and briefs shall be filed directly 
with the Board. The party filing any other paper with the Board shall 
send a copy thereof to the opposing party, noting on the paper filed 
with the Board that a copy has been so furnished. Subpoenas shall be 
served as provided in Rule 21.

                                Hearings

    17. Where and When Held. Hearings will be held at such places 
determined by the Board to best serve the interests of the parties and 
the Board. Hearings will be scheduled at the discretion of the Board 
with due consideration to the regular order of appeals, Rule 12 
requirements, and other pertinent factors. On request or motion by 
either party and for good cause, the Board may, in its discretion, 
adjust the date of a hearing.
    18. Notice of Hearings. The parties shall be given at least 15 days 
notice of the time and place set for hearings. In scheduling hearings, 
the Board will consider the desires of the parties and the requirement 
for just and inexpensive determination of appeals without unnecessary 
delay. Notices of hearings shall be promptly acknowledged by the 
parties.
    19. Unexcused Absence of a Party. The unexcused absence of a party 
at the time and place set for hearing will not be occasion for delay. In 
the event of such absence, the hearing will proceed and the case will be 
regarded as submitted by the absent party as provided in Rule 11.
    20. Hearings: Nature, Examination of Witnesses--(a) Nature of 
Hearings--Hearings shall be as informal as may be reasonable and 
appropriate under the circumstances. Appellant and the Government may 
offer such evidence as they deem appropriate and as would be admissible 
under the Federal Rules of Evidence or in the sound discretion of the 
presiding administrative judge or examiner. Stipulations of fact agreed 
upon by the parties may be regarded and used as evidence at the hearing. 
The parties may stipulate the testimony that would be given by a witness 
if the witness were present. The Board may require evidence in addition 
to that offered by the parties.
    (b) Examination of Witnesses--Witnesses before the Board will be 
examined orally under oath or affirmation, unless the presiding 
administrative judge or examiner shall otherwise order. If the testimony 
of a witness is not given under oath, the Board may advise the witness 
that his statements may be subject to the provisions of title 18, United 
States Code, sections 287 and 1001, and any other provision of law 
imposing penalties for knowingly making false representations in 
connection with claims against the United States or in any matter within 
the jurisdiction of any department or agency thereof.
    21. Subpoenas--(a) General-- Upon written request of either party 
filed with the recorder, or on his own initiative, the administrative 
judge to whom a case is assigned or who is otherwise designated by the 
chairman may issue a subpoena requiring:
    (i) Testimony at a deposition--the deposing of a witness in the city 
or county where he resides or is employed or transacts his business in 
person, or at another location convenient for him that is specifically 
determined by the Board;
    (ii) Testimony at a hearing--the attendance of a witness for the 
purpose of taking testimony at a hearing; and
    (iii) Production of books and papers--in addition to (i) or (ii), 
the production by the witness at the deposition or hearing of books and 
papers designated in the subpoena.
    (b) Voluntary Cooperation--Each party is expected (i) to cooperate 
and make available witnesses and evidence under its control as

[[Page 585]]

requested by the other party, without issuance of a subpoena, and (ii) 
to secure voluntary attendance of desired third-party witnesses and 
production of desired third-party books, papers, documents, or tangible 
things whenever possible.
    (c) Requests for Subpoenas--(1) A request for subpoena shall 
normally be filed at least:
    (i) 15 days before a scheduled deposition where the attendance of a 
witness at a deposition is sought; or
    (ii) 30 days before a scheduled hearing where the attendance of a 
witness at a hearing is sought.
    In its discretion the Board may honor requests for subpoenas not 
made within these time limitations.
    (2) A request for a subpoena shall state the reasonable scope and 
general relevance to the case of the testimony and of any books and 
papers sought.
    (d) Requests to Quash or Modify-- Upon written request by the person 
subpoenaed or by a party, made within 10 days after service but in any 
event not later than the time specified in the subpoena for compliance, 
the Board may (i) quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable and 
oppressive or for other good cause shown, or (ii) require the person in 
whose behalf the subpoena was issued to advance the reasonable cost of 
producing subpoenaed books and papers. Where circumstances require, the 
Board may act upon such a request at any time after a copy has been 
served upon the opposing party.
    (e) Form; Issuance--(1) Every subpoena shall state the name of the 
Board and the title of the appeal, and shall command each person to whom 
it is directed to attend and give testimony, and if appropriate, to 
produce specified books and papers at a time and place therein 
specified. In issuing a subpoena to a requesting party, the 
administrative judge shall sign the subpoena and may, in his discretion, 
enter the name of the witness and otherwise leave it blank. The party to 
whom the subpoena is issued shall complete the subpoena before service.
    (2) Where the witness is located in a foreign country, a letter 
rogatory or subpoena may be issued and served under the circumstances 
and in the manner provided in 28 U.S.C. 1781-1784.
    (f) Service--(1) The party requesting issuance of a subpoena shall 
arrange for service.
    (2) A subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a deposition 
or hearing may be served at any place. A subpoena may be served by a 
United States marshal or deputy marshal, or by any other person who is 
not a party and not less than 18 years of age. Service of a subpoena 
upon a person named therein shall be made by personally delivering a 
copy to that person and tendering the fees for one day's attendance and 
the mileage provided by 28 U.S.C. 1821 or other applicable law; however, 
where the subpoena is issued on behalf of the Government, money payments 
need not be tendered in advance of attendance.
    (3) The party at whose instance a subpoena is issued shall be 
responsible for the payment of fees and mileage of the witness and of 
the officer who serves the subpoena. The failure to make payment of such 
charges on demand may be deemed by the Board as a sufficient ground for 
striking the testimony of the witness and the books or papers the 
witness has produced.
    (g) Contumacy or Refusal to Obey a Subpoena-- In case of contumacy 
or refusal to obey a subpoena by a person who resides, is found, or 
transacts business within the jurisdiction of a United States District 
Court, the Board will apply to the Court through the Attorney General of 
the United States for an order requiring the person to appear before the 
Board or a member thereof to give testimony or produce evidence or both. 
Any failure of any such person to obey the order of the Court may be 
punished by the Court as a contempt thereof.
    22. Copies of Papers. When books, records, papers, or documents have 
been received in evidence, a true copy thereof or of such part thereof 
as may be material or relevant may be substituted therefor, during the 
hearing or at the conclusion thereof.
    23. Post-Hearing Briefs. Post-hearing briefs may be submitted upon 
such terms as may be directed by the presiding administrative judge or 
examiner at the conclusion of the hearing.
    24. Transcript of Proceedings. Testimony and argument at hearings 
shall be reported verbatim, unless the Board otherwise orders. Waiver of 
transcript may be especially suitable for hearings under Rule 12.2. 
Transcripts of the proceedings shall be supplied to the parties at such 
rates as may be established by contract between the Board and the 
reporter, provided that ordinary copy of transcript shall be supplied to 
the appellant at an amount no greater than the cost of duplication.
    25. Withdrawal of Exhibits. After a decision has become final the 
Board may, upon request and after notice to the other party, in its 
discretion permit the withdrawal of original exhibits, or any part 
thereof, by the party entitled thereto. The substitition of true copies 
of exhibits or any part thereof may be required by the Board in its 
discretion as a condition of granting permission for such withdrawal.

                             Representation

    26. The Appellant. An individual appellant may appear before the 
Board in person, a corporation by one of its officers; and a partnership 
or joint venture by one of its members; or any of these by an attorney 
at law duly licensed in any state, commonwealth, territory, the District 
of Columbia, or in a

[[Page 586]]

foreign country. An attorney representing an appellant shall file a 
written notice of appearance with the Board.
    27. The Government. Government counsel may, in accordance with their 
authority, represent the interest of the Government before the Board. 
They shall file notices of appearance with the Board, and notice thereof 
will be given appellant or appellant's attorney in the form specified by 
the Board from time to time.

                                Decisions

    28. Decisions. (a) Decisions of the Board will be made in writing 
and authenticated copies of the decision will be forwarded 
simultaneously to both parties. The rules of the Board and all final 
orders and decisions (except those required for good cause to be held 
confidential and not cited as precedents) shall be open for public 
inspection at the offices of the Board. Decisions of the Board will be 
made solely upon the record, as described in Rule 13.
    (b) Any monetary award to a contractor by the Board shall be 
promptly paid in accordance with the procedures provided by section 1302 
of the Act of July 27, 1956 (70 Stat. 694, as amended; 31 U.S.C. 724a). 
To assure prompt payment the Recorder will forward a waiver form to each 
party with the decision. If the parties do not contemplate an appeal or 
motion for reconsideration, they will execute waivers which so state, 
and return them to the Recorder. The Recorder will forward the waivers 
and a certified copy of the award decision to the General Accounting 
Office for certification for payment.

                       Motion for Reconsideration

    29. Motion for Reconsideration. A motion for reconsideration may be 
filed by either party. It shall set forth specifically the grounds 
relied upon to sustain the motion. The motion shall be filed within 30 
days from the date of the receipt of a copy of the decision of the Board 
by the party filing the motion.

              Suspensions, Dismissals and Defaults: Remands

    30. Suspensions; Dismissal Without Prejudice. The Board may suspend 
the proceedings by agreement of counsel for settlement discussions, or 
for good cause shown. In certain cases, appeals docketed before the 
Board are required to be placed in a suspense status and the Board is 
unable to proceed with disposition thereof for reasons not within the 
control of the Board. Where the suspension has continued, or may 
continue, for an inordinate length of time, the Board may, in its 
discretion, dismiss such appeals from its docket without prejudice to 
their restoration when the cause of suspension has been removed. Unless 
either party or the Board acts within three years to reinstate any 
appeal dismissed without prejudice, the dismissal shall be deemed with 
prejudice.
    31. Dismissal or Default for Failure to Prosecute or Defend. 
Whenever a record discloses the failure of either party to file 
documents required by these rules, respond to notices or correspondence 
from the Board, comply with orders of the Board, or otherwise indicates 
an intention not to continue the prosecution or defense of an appeal, 
the Board may, in the case of a default by the appellant, issue an order 
to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed or, in the case of 
a default by the Government, issue an order to show cause why the Board 
should not act thereon pursuant to Rule 35. If good cause is not shown, 
the Board may take appropriate action.
    32. Remand from Court. Whenever any court remands a case to the 
Board for further proceedings, each of the parties shall, within 20 days 
of such remand, submit a report to the Board recommending procedures to 
be followed so as to comply with the court's order. The Board shall 
consider the reports and enter special orders governing the handling of 
the remanded case. To the extent the court's directive and time 
limitations permit, such orders shall conform to these rules.

                    Time, Computation and Extensions

    33. Time, Computation and Extensions. (a) Where possible, procedural 
actions should be taken in less time than the maximum time allowed. 
Where appropriate and justified, however, extensions of time will be 
granted. All requests for extensions of time shall be in writing.
    (b) In computing any period of time, the day of the event from which 
the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included, but 
the last day of the period shall be included unless it is a Saturday, 
Sunday, or a legal holiday, in which event the period shall run to the 
end of the next business day.

                         Ex Parte Communications

    34. Ex parte Communications. No member of the Board or the Board's 
staff shall entertain, nor shall any person directly or indirectly 
involved in an appeal, submit to the Board or the Board's staff, off the 
record, any evidence, explanation, analysis, or advice, whether written 
or oral, regarding any matter at issue in an appeal. This provision does 
not apply to consultation among Board members or to ex parte 
communications concerning the Board's administrative functions or 
procedures.

                                Sanctions

    35. Sanctions. If any party fails or refuses to obey an order issued 
by the Board, the Board may then make such order as it considers

[[Page 587]]

necessary to the just and expeditious conduct of the appeal.

                    Effective Date and Applicability

    36. Effective Date. These rules shall apply (i) mandatorily, to all 
appeals relating to contracts entered into on or after 1 March 1979, and 
(ii) at the contractor's election, to appeals relating to earlier 
contracts, with respect to claims pending before the contracting officer 
on 1 March 1979 or initiated thereafter.
    Pursuant to the Charter of the Armed Services Board of Contract 
Appeals, the attached rules are hereby approved for use and application 
to appeals to the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals under the 
Contract Disputes Act of 1978.

                              D-100  Scope.

    (a) This appendix provides policy and procedures for breaking out 
components of end items for future acquisitions so that the Government 
can purchase the components directly from the manufacturer or supplier 
and furnish them to the end item manufacturer as Government-furnished 
material.
    (b) This appendix does not apply to--
    (1) The initial decisions on Government-furnished equipment/
contractor-furnished equipment that are made at the inception of an 
acquisition program; or
    (2) Breakout of parts for replenishment (see Appendix E).

                           D-101  Definition.

    Component, as used in this appendix, includes subsystems, 
assemblies, subassemblies, and other major elements of an end item; it 
does not include elements of relatively small annual acquisition value.

                             D-102  Policy.

    DoD policy is to breakout components of weapons systems or other 
major end items under certain circumstances.
    (a) When it is anticipated that a prime contract will be awarded 
without adequate price competition, and the prime contractor is expected 
to acquire any component without adequate price competition, breakout 
that component if--
    (1) Substantial net cost savings probably will be achieved; and
    (2) Breakout action will not jeopardize the quality, reliability, 
performance, or timely delivery of the end item.
    (b) Even when either or both the prime contract and the component 
will be acquired with adequate price competition, consider breakout of 
the component if substantial net cost savings will result from--
    (1) Greater quantity acquisitions; or
    (2) Such factors as improved logistics support (through reduction in 
varieties of spare parts) and economies in operations and training 
(through standardization of design).
    (c) Breakout normally is not justified for a component that is not 
expected to exceed $1 million for the current year's requirement.

                         D-103  Responsibility.

    (a) Agencies are responsible for ensuring that--
    (1) Breakout reviews are performed on components meeting the 
criteria in D-102(a) and (b);
    (2) Components susceptible to breakout are earmarked for 
consideration in future acquisitions;
    (3) Components earmarked for breakout are considered during 
requirements determination and appropriate decisions are made; and
    (4) Components are broken out when required.
    (b) The program manager or other official responsible for the 
material program concerned is responsible for breakout selection, 
review, and decision.
    (c) The contracting officer or buyer and other specialists (e.g., 
small business specialist, engineering, production, logistics, and 
maintenance) support the program manager in implementing the breakout 
program.

                           D-104  Procedures.

    (a) A breakout review and decision includes--

[[Page 598]]

    (1) An assessment of the potential risks to the end item from 
possibilities such as delayed delivery and reduced reliability of the 
component;
    (2) A calculation of estimated net cost savings (i.e., estimated 
acquisition savings less any offsetting costs); and
    (3) An analysis of the technical, operational, logistics, and 
administrative factors involved.
    (b) The decision must be supported by adequate explanatory 
information, including an assessment by the end item contractor when 
feasible.
    (c) The following questions should be used in the decision process--
    (1) Is the end item contractor likely to do further design or 
engineering effort on the component?
    (2) Is a suitable data package available with rights to use it for 
Government acquisition? (Note that breakout may be warranted even though 
competitive acquisition is not possible.)
    (3) Can any quality control and reliability problems of the 
component be resolved without requiring effort by the end item 
contractor?
    (4) Will the component require further technical support (e.g., 
development of specifications, testing requirements, or quality 
assurance requirements)? If so, does the Government have the resources 
(manpower, technical competence, facilities, etc.) to provide such 
support? Or, can the support be obtained from the end item contractor 
(even though the component is broken out) or other source?
    (5) Will breakout impair logistics support (e.g., by jeopardizing 
standardization of components)?
    (6) Will breakout unduly fragment administration, management, or 
performance of the end item contract (e.g., by complicating production 
scheduling or preventing identification of responsibility for end item 
failure caused by a defective component)?
    (7) Can breakout be accomplished without jeopardizing delivery 
requirements of the end item?
    (8) If a decision is made to breakout a component, can advance 
acquisition funds be made available to provide the new source any 
necessary additional lead time?
    (9) Is there a source other than the present manufacturer capable of 
supplying the component?
    (10) Has the component been (or is it going to be) acquired directly 
by the Government as a support item in the supply system or as 
Government-furnished equipment in other end items?
    (11) Will the financial risks and other responsibilities assumed by 
the Government after breakout be acceptable?
    (12) Will breakout result in substantial net cost savings? Develop 
estimates of probable savings in cost considering all offsetting costs 
such as increases in the cost of requirements determination and control, 
contracting, contract administration, data package purchase, material 
inspection, qualification or preproduction testing, ground support and 
test equipment, transportation, security, storage, distribution, and 
technical support.
    (d) If answers to the questions reveal conditions unfavorable to 
breakout, the program manager should explore whether the unfavorable 
conditions can be eliminated. For example, where adequate technical 
support is not available from Government resources, consider contracting 
for the necessary services from the end item contractor or other 
qualified source.

                             D-105  Records.

    (a) The contracting activity shall maintain records on components 
reviewed for breakout. Records should evidence whether the components--
    (1) Have no potential for breakout;
    (2) Have been earmarked as potential breakout candidates;
    (3) Have been, or will be, broken out.
    (b) The program manager or other designated official must sign the 
records.
    (c) Records must reflect the facts and conditions of the case, 
including any assessment by the contractor, and the basis for the 
decision. The records must contain the assessments, calculations, and 
analyses discussed in D-104, including the trade-off analysis between 
savings and increased risk to the Government because of responsibility 
for Government-furnished equipment.

                             Part 1--General

E-100  Scope.
    This appendix established the DoD Spare Parts Breakout Program and 
provides uniform policies and procedures for management and conduct of 
the program within and between the departments and agencies.
E-101  Applicability.
    (a) This appendix applies to--
    (1) Any centrally managed replenishment or provisioned part 
(hereinafter referred to as ``part'') for military systems and 
equipment; and
    (2) All DoD personnel involved with design control, acquisition, and 
management of such parts including, but not limited to, project/program/
system managers, technical personnel, contracting officers, legal 
counsel, inventory managers, inspectors, and small business specialists 
and technical advisors.
    (b) This appendix does not apply to--
    (1) Component breakout (see Appendix D);
    (2) Foreign military sale peculiar items;
    (3) Insurance items (e.g., one-time buy);
    (4) Obsolete items;
    (5) Phase out items (e.g., life of type buy);
    (6) Items with annual buy values below the thresholds developed by 
DoD components or field activities;
    (7) Parts being acquired under other specifically defined initial 
support programs; or
    (8) Parts acquired through local purchase.
E-102  General.
    (a) Significant resources are dedicated to the acquisition and 
management of parts for military systems and equipment. The ability to 
competitively buy spares must be considered early in a weapon system 
acquisition. Initially, repairable or consumable parts are identified 
and acquired through a provisioning process; repairable or consumable 
parts acquired thereafter are for replenishment.
    (b) The objective of the DoD Spare Parts Breakout Program is to 
reduce costs through

[[Page 600]]

the use of competitive procurement methods, or the purchase of parts 
directly from the actual manufacturer rather than the prime contractor, 
while maintaining the integrity of the systems and equipment in which 
the parts are to be used. The program is based on the application of 
sound management and engineering judgement in--
    (1) Determining the feasibility of acquiring parts by competitive 
procedures or direct purchase from actual manufacturers; and
    (2) Overcoming or removing constraints to breakout identified 
through the screening process (technical review) described in E-302.
    (c) This Appendix sets forth procedures to screen and code parts in 
order to provide contracting officers summary information regarding 
technical data and sources of supply to meet the Government's minimum 
requirements. This information assists the contracting officer in 
selecting the method of contracting, identifying sources of supply, and 
making other decisions in the preaward and award phases, with 
consideration for established parameters of system and equipment 
integrity, readiness, and the opportunities to competitively acquire 
parts (see FAR/DFARS Part 6). The identification of sources for parts, 
for example, requires knowledge of manufacturing sources, additional 
operations performed after manufacture of parts possessing safety or 
other critical characteristics, and the availability of technical data.
    (d) The result of the screening process (technical review is 
indicated by an acquisition method code (AMC) and an acquisition method 
suffix code (AMSC). This program provides procedures for both the 
initial assignment of an AMC and an AMSC to a part, and for the 
recurring review of these codes (see E-202 and E-203(b)(1)).
E-103  Definitions.
E-103.1  Acquisition method code (AMC).
    A single digit numeric code, assigned by a DoD activity, to describe 
to the contracting officer and other Government personnel the results of 
a technical review of a part and its suitability for breakout.

furnish specific information regarding the engineering, manufacturing, 
and technical aspects of that part.
E-103.12  Design control activity.
    A contractor or Government activity having responsibility for the 
design of a given part, and for the preparation and currency of

communications and electronic systems, ground support, and test 
equipment. As used in this appendix, except when distinction is 
necessary, the term ``part'' includes subassemblies, components, and 
subsystems as defined by the current version of MIL-STD-280.
E-103.27  Reverse engineering.
    A process by which parts are examined and analyzed to determine how 
they were manufactured, for the purpose of developing a complete 
technical data package. The normal, expected result of reverse

    The Government review that must be completed before contract award.
E-103.31  Source control drawing.
    See the current version of DoD-STD-100, paragraph 201.4.3.

[[Page 602]]

E-103.32  Technical data.
    Specifications, plans, drawings, standards, purchase descriptions, 
and such other data to describe the Government's requirements for 
acquisition.
E-104  General policies.
    (a) The identification, selection, and screening of parts for 
breakout shall be made as early as possible to determine the technical 
and economic considerations of the opportunities for breakout to 
competition or direct purchase. Full and open competition is the 
preferred result of breakout screening.
    (b) A part shall be made a candidate for breakout screening based on 
its cost effectiveness for breakout. Resources should be assigned and 
priority given to those parts with the greatest expected return given 
their annual buy value, life cycle buy value, and likelihood of 
successful breakout, given technical characteristics such as design and 
performance stability. Consideration of all such factors is necessary to 
ensure the maximum return on investment in a given breakout program. 
Occasionally, an item will not meet strict economic considerations for 
breakout, but action may be required due to other considerations to 
avoid overpricing situations. Accordingly, there is no minimum DoD 
threshold for breakout screening actions. DoD components and field 
activities will develop annual buy thresholds for breakout screening 
which are consistent with economic considerations and resources. Every 
effort should be made to complete the full screening of parts that are 
expected to be subsequently replenished as they enter the inventory.
    (c) Breakout improvement efforts shall continue through the life 
cycle of a part to improve its breakout status (see E-203) or until such 
time as the part is coded 1G, 2G, 1K, 2K, 1M, 2M, 1N, 2N, 1T, 2T, 1Z, or 
2Z.
    (d) No firm shall be denied the opportunity to demonstrate its 
ability to furnish a part which meets the Government's needs, without 
regard to a part's annual buy value, where a restrictive AMC/AMSC is 
assigned (see FAR 9.202). A firm must clearly demonstrate, normally at 
its own expense, that it can satisfy the Government's requirements. The 
Government shall make a vigorous effort to expedite its evaluation of 
such demonstration and to furnish a decision to the demonstrating firm 
within a reasonable period of time. If a resolution cannot be made 
within 60 days, the offeror must be advised of the status of the request 
and be provided with a good faith estimate of the date the evaluation 
will be completed. Every reasonable effort shall be made to complete the 
review before a subsequent acquisition is made. Also, restrictive codes 
and low annual buy value do not preclude consideration of a surplus 
dealer or other nonmanufacturing source when the part offered was 
manufactured by an approved source (see FAR 10.010). A potential surplus 
dealer or other nonmanufacturing source must provide the Government with 
all the necessary evidence which proves the proposed part meets the 
Government's requirements.
    (e) The experience and knowledge accrued by contractors in the 
development, design, manufacture and test of equipment may enhance the 
breakout decision making process. DoD activities may obtain technical 
information from contractors when it is considered requisite to an 
informed coding decision. The procedure for contracting for this 
information is provided in Part 4 of this appendix. Contractor's 
technical information will be designated by CTICs. Only DoD activities 
shall assign AMCs and AMSCs.
    (f) DoD activities with breakout screening responsibilities shall 
develop, document, and advertise programs which promote the development 
of qualified sources for parts that are currently being purchased sole 
source. These programs should provide fair and reasonable technical 
assistance (engineering or other technical data, parts on bailment, 
etc.) to contractors who prove they have potential for becoming a 
qualified second source for an item. These programs should also provide 
specially tailored incentives to successful firms so as to stimulate 
their investment in becoming qualified, e.g., Government furnished 
equipment (GFE) or Government furnished material (GFM) for reverse 
engineering and technical data package review and assistance.
    (g) Departments and agencies shall identify the engineering support 
activity, design control activity, actual manufacturer, and prime 
contractor for each part such that the information is readily available 
to breakout and acquisition personnel.
E-105  Responsibilities.
    (a) The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Production and Logistics) 
has authority for direction and management of the DoD Spare Parts 
Breakout Program, including the establishment and maintenance of 
implementing regulations.
    (b) Departments and agencies shall perform audits to ensure that 
their respective activities comply with the provisions of this program.
    (c) Commanders of DoD activities with breakout screening 
responsibility shall--
    (1) Implement a breakout program consistent with the requirements of 
this appendix.
    (2) Assist in the identification and acquisition of necessary data 
rights and technical data, and the review of restrictive legends on 
technical data, during system/equipment development and production to 
allow, when feasible, breakout of parts.
    (3) Designate a program manager to serve as the central focal point, 
communicate breakout policy, ensure cost effectiveness of

[[Page 603]]

screening actions and breakout program, provide assistance in 
implementing breakout screening, monitor ongoing breakout efforts and 
achievements, and provide surveillance over implementation of this 
appendix. The program manager shall report only to the Commander, or 
deputy, of the activity with breakout screening responsibility.
    (4) Ensure that actions to remove impediments to breakout are 
continued so long as it is cost effective, or until no further breakout 
improvements can be made.
    (5) Invite the activity's small business specialist and the resident 
small business administration's procurement center representative (PCR), 
if any, to participate in all acquisition method coding conferences at 
Government and contractor locations.
    (6) Ensure timely engineering and technical support to other 
breakout activities regardless of location.
    (i) In the case of parts where contracting or inventory management 
responsibility has been transferred, support shall include--
    (A) Assignment of an AMC/AMSC prior to the transfer;
    (B) Assignment of an AMC/AMSC when requested by the receiving 
activity to parts transferred without such codes. The requesting 
activity may recommend an AMC/AMSC; and
    (C) Full support of the receiving activities' breakout effort by 
providing timely engineering support in revising existing AMC/AMSCs.
    (ii) In all cases, support shall include, but not be limited to, 
furnishing all necessary technical data and other information (such as 
code suspense date and procurement history) to permit acquisition in 
accordance with the assigned AMC/AMSC (see E-105(d)(6)).
    (7) Ensure that appropriate surveillance is given to first time 
breakout parts.
    (d) Breakout program managers shall be responsible for--
    (1) Initiating the breakout process during the early phases of 
development and continue the process during the life of the part;
    (2) Considering the need for contractor technical information codes 
(CTICs) and, when needed, initiating a contract data requirement;
    (3) Identifying, selecting, and screening in accordance with Part 3 
of this appendix;
    (4) Assigning an AMC/AMSC, using all available data, including 
CTICs;
    (5) Responding promptly to a request for evaluation of additional 
sources or a review of assigned codes. An evaluation not completed prior 
to an immediate buy shall be promptly completed for future buys; and
    (6) Documenting all assignments and changes, to include rationale 
for assigning the chosen code, in a permanent file for each part. As a 
minimum, the file should identify the engineering support activity, 
cognizant design control activity, actual manufacturer, prime 
contractor, known sources of supply, and any other information needed to 
support AMC/AMSC assignments.
    (e) Contracting officers responsible for the acquisition of 
replenishment parts shall--
    (1) Consider the AMC/AMSC when developing the method of contracting, 
the list of sources to be solicited, the type of contract, etc.; and
    (2) Provide information which is inconsistent with the assigned AMC/
AMSC (e.g., availability of technical data or possible sources) to the 
activity responsible for code assignment with a request for timely 
evaluation of the additional information. An urgent immediate buy need 
not be delayed if an evaluation of the additional information cannot be 
completed in time to meet the required delivery date.

                         Part 2--Breakout Coding

E-200  Scope.
    This part provides parts breakout codes and prescribes 
responsibilities for their assignment and management.
E-201  Coding.
    Three types of codes are used in the breakout program.
E-201.1  Acquisition method codes.
    The following codes shall be assigned by DoD activities to describe 
the results of the spare parts breakout screening:
    (a) AMC 0. The part was not assigned AMC 1 through 5 when it entered 
the inventory, nor has it ever completed screening. Use of this code is 
sometimes necessary but discouraged. Maximum effort to determine the 
applicability of an alternate AMC is the objective. This code will never 
be used to recode a part that already has AMC 1 through 5 assigned, and 
shall never be assigned as a result of breakout screening. Maximum 
effort to determine the applicability of AMC 1 through 5 is the 
objective.
    (b) AMC 1. Suitable for competitive acquisition for the second or 
subsequent time.
    (c) AMC 2. Suitable for competitive acquisition for the first time.
    (d) AMC 3. Acquire, for the second or subsequent time, directly from 
the actual manufacturer.
    (e) AMC 4. Acquire, for the first time, directly from the actual 
manufacturer.
    (f) AMC 5. Acquire directly from a sole source contractor which is 
not the actual manufacturer.
E-201.2  Acquisition method suffix codes.
    The following codes shall be assigned by DoD activities to further 
describe the acquisition method code. Valid combinations of AMCs/AMSCs 
are indicated in paragraphs (a)

[[Page 604]]

through (z) of this subsection and summarized in Exhibit I.
    (a) AMSC A. The Government's right to use data in its possession is 
questionable. This code is only applicable to parts under immediate buy 
requirements and for as long thereafter as rights to data are still 
under review for resolution and appropriate coding. This code is 
assigned only at the conclusion of limited screening, and it remains 
assigned until the full screening process resolves the Government's 
rights to use data and results in assignment of a different AMSC. If one 
source is available, AMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at least two sources 
exist, or if the data is adequate for an alternate source to qualify in 
accordance with the design control activity's procedures, AMCs 1 or 2 
are valid.
    (b) AMSC B. This part must be acquired from a manufacturing 
source(s) specified on a source control or selected item drawing as 
defined by the current version of DoD-STD-100. Suitable technical data, 
Government data rights, or manufacturing knowledge are not available to 
permit acquisition from other sources, nor qualification testing of 
another part, nor use of a second source part in the intended 
application. Although, by DoD-STD-100 definition, altered and selected 
items shall have an adequate technical data package, data review 
discloses that required data or data rights are not in Government 
possession and cannot be economically obtained. If one source is 
available, AMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at least two sources exist, 
AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
    (c) AMSC C. This part requires engineering source approval by the 
design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. 
Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing 
knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part 
from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, 
manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically 
available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to 
maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in 
accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by 
the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification 
procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity 
having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. If one 
source is approved, AMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at least two sources 
are approved or if data is adequate for an alternate source to qualify 
in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, AMCs 1 or 2 
are valid.
    (d) AMSC D. The data needed to acquire this part competitively is 
not physically available, it cannot be obtained economically, nor is it 
possible to draft adequate specifications or any other adequate, 
economical description of the material for a competitive solicitation. 
AMSC 3, 4, or 5 are valid.
    (e) AMSC E. (Reserved).
    (f) AMSC F. (Reserved).
    (g) AMSC G. The Government has rights to the technical data, the 
data package is complete, and there are no technical data, engineering, 
tooling or manufacturing restrictions. (This is the only AMSC that 
implies that parts are candidates for full and open competition. Other 
AMSCs such as K, M, N, Q, and S may imply limited competition when two 
or more independent sources exist yet the technical data package is 
inadequate for full and open competition.) AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
    (h) AMSC H. The Government physically does not have in its 
possession sufficient, accurate, or legible data to purchase this part 
from other than the current source(s). This code is applicable only to 
parts under immediate buy requirements and only for as long thereafter 
as the deficiency is under review for resolution and appropriate 
recoding. This code is only assigned at the conclusion of limited 
screening, and it remains assigned until the full screening process 
resolves physical data questions and results in assignment of a 
different AMSC. If one source is available, AMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. 
If at least two sources exist, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
    (i) AMSC I. (Not authorized.)
    (j) AMSC J. (Reserved.)
    (k) AMSC K. This part must be produced from class 1 castings and 
similar type forgings as approved (controlled) by procedures contained 
in the current version of MIL-STD-2175. If one source has such castings 
and cannot provide them to other sources, AMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If 
at least two sources have such castings or they can be provided to other 
sources AMCs 1 or 2 or valid.
    (l) AMSC L. The annual buy value of this part falls below the 
screening threshold established by DoD components and field activities. 
However, this part has been screened for additional known sources, 
resulting in either confirmation that the initial source exists or that 
other sources may supply the part. No additional screening was performed 
to identify the competitive or noncompetitive conditions that would 
result in assignment of a different AMSC. This code shall not be used 
when screening parts entering the inventory. This code shall be used 
only to replace AMSC O for parts under the established screening 
threshold. If one source is available, AMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at 
least two sources exist, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
    (m) AMSC M. Manufacture of this part requires use of master or 
coordinated tooling. If only one set of tooling exists and cannot be 
made available to another source for manufacture of this part, AMCs 3, 
4, or 5 are valid. When the availability of existent or

[[Page 605]]

refurbishable tooling is available to two or more sources, then AMCs 1 
or 2 are valid.
    (n) AMSC N. Manufacture of this part requires special test and/or 
inspection facilities to determine and maintain ultra-precision quality 
for its function or system integrity. Substantiation and inspection of 
the precision or quality cannot be accomplished without such specialized 
test or inspection facilities. If the test cannot be made available for 
the competitive manufacture of the part, the required test or inspection 
knowledge cannot be documented for reliable replication, or the required 
physical test or inspection facilities and processes cannot be 
economically documented in a TDP, valid AMCs are 3, 4, or 5. If the 
facilities or tests can be made available to two or more competitive 
sources, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
    (o) AMSC O. The part was not assigned an AMSC when it entered the 
inventory, nor has it ever completed screening. Use of this code in 
conjunction with AMC 0 is sometimes necessary but discouraged. Maximum 
effort to determine the applicability of an alternate AMSC is the 
objective. Only AMC O is valid.
    (p) AMSC P. The rights to use the data needed to purchase this part 
from additional source(s) are not owned by the Government and cannot be 
purchased, developed, or otherwise obtained. It is uneconomical to 
reverse engineer this part. This code is used in situations where the 
Government has the data but does not own the rights to the data. If only 
one source has the rights or data to manufacture this item, AMCs 3, 4, 
or 5 are valid. If two or more sources have the rights or data to 
manufacture this item, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
    (q) AMSC Q. The Government does not have adequate data, lacks rights 
to data, or both needed to purchase this part from additional sources. 
The Government has been unable to economically buy the data or rights to 
the data, although the part has been undergoing full screening for 12 or 
more months. Breakout to competition has not been achieved, but current, 
continuing actions to obtain necessary rights to data or adequate, 
reprocurement technical data indicate breakout to competition is 
expected to be achieved. This part may be a candidate for reverse 
engineering or other techniques to obtain technical data. All AMSC Q 
items are required to be reviewed within the timeframes cited in E-
203(b). If one source is available, AMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at 
least two sources exist, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
    (r) AMSC R. The Government does not own the data or the rights to 
the data needed to purchase this part from additional sources. It has 
been determined to be uneconomical to buy the data or rights to the 
data. It is uneconomical to reverse engineer the part. This code is used 
when the Government did not initially purchase the data and/or rights. 
If only one source has the rights or data to manufacture this item, AMCs 
3, 4, or 5 are valid. If two or more sources have the rights or data to 
manufacture this item, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
    (s) AMSC S. Acquisition of this item is restricted to Government 
approved source(s) because the production of this item involves 
unclassified but militarily sensitive technology (see FAR 6.3). If one 
source is approved, AMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at least two sources 
are approved, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
    (t) AMSC T. Acquisition of this part is controlled by qualified 
products list (QPL) procedures. Competition for this part is limited to 
sources which are listed on or are qualified for listing on the QPL at 
the time of award (see FAR Part 9 and DFARS Part 209). AMCs 1 or 2 are 
valid.
    (u) AMSC U. The cost to the Government to breakout this part and 
acquire it competitively has been determined to exceed the projected 
savings over the life span of the part. If one source is available, AMCs 
3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at least two sources exist, AMCs 1 or 2 are 
valid.
    (v) AMSC V. This part has been designated a high reliability part 
under a formal reliability program. Probability of failure would be 
unacceptable from the standpoint of safety of personnel and/or 
equipment. The cognizant engineering activity has determined that data 
to define and control reliability limits cannot be obtained nor is it 
possible to draft adequate specifications for this purpose. If one 
source is available, AMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at least two sources 
are available, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
    (w) AMSC W. (Reserved.)
    (x) AMSC X. (Not authorized.)
    (y) AMSC Y. The design of this part is unstable. Engineering, 
manufacturing, or performance characteristics indicate that the required 
design objectives have not been achieved. Major changes are contemplated 
because the part has a low process yield or has demonstrated marginal 
performance during tests or service use. These changes will render the 
present part obsolete and unusable in its present configuration. Limited 
acquisition from the present source is anticipated pending configuration 
changes. If one source is available, AMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at 
least two sources exist, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
    (z) AMSC Z. This part is a commercial/nondevelopmental/off-the-shelf 
item. Commercial item descriptions, commercial vendor catalog or price 
lists or commercial manuals assigned a technical manual number apply. If 
one source is available, AMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at least two 
sources are available, AMCs 1 or 2 are valid.

E-201.3  Contractor technical information codes.
    The following two digit alpha codes shall be used by contractors, 
when contractor's assistance is requested. These codes are assigned in 
accordance with the current version of MIL-STD-789 and shall be 
considered during the initial assignment of an AMC/AMSC. For spare parts 
breakout, requirements for contractor assistance through CTIC submission 
shall be accomplished as stated in Part 4 of this appendix. Each CTIC 
submitted by a contractor must be accompanied by supporting 
documentation which justifies the proposed code. These codes and 
supporting documentation, transmitted by DD Form 1418, Contractor 
Technical Information Record, and DD Form 1418-1, Technical Data 
Identification Checklist, are useful not only for code assignment during 
acquisition coding conferences, but also for personnel conducting both 
full and limited screening of breakout candidates. Personnel conducting 
full and limited screening of breakout candidates should use the 
supporting documentation provided with CTICs as a source of information. 
However, they should not allow this information to substitute for 
careful analysis and further investigation of the possibilities of 
acquiring a part through competition or by direct purchase. The 
definitions for CTICs are--
    (a) CTIC CB. Source(s) are specified on source control, altered 
item, or selected item drawings/documents. (The contractor shall furnish 
a list of the sources with this code.)
    (b) CTIC CC. Requires engineering source approval by the design 
control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. An 
alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control 
activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government 
engineering activity.
    (c) CTIC CG. There are no technical restrictions to competition.
    (d) CTIC CK. Produced from class 1 castings (see the current version 
of MIL-STD-2175) and similar type forgings. The process of developing 
and proving the acceptability of high-integrity castings and forgings 
requires repetitive performance by a controlled source. Each casting or 
forging must be produced along identical lines to those which resulted 
in initial acceptability of the part. (The contractor shall furnish a 
list of known sources for obtaining castings/forgings with this code.)
    (e) CTIC CM. Master or coordinated tooling is required to produce 
this part. This tooling is not owned by the Government or, where owned, 
cannot be made available to other sources. (The contractor shall furnish 
a list of the firms possessing the master or coordinated tooling with 
this code.)
    (f) CTIC CN. Requires special test and/or inspection facilities to 
determine and maintain ultra-precision quality for function or system 
integrity. Substantiation and inspection of the precision or quality 
cannot be accomplished without such specialized test or inspection 
facilities. Other sources in industry do not possess, nor would it be 
economically feasible for them to acquire facilities. (The contractor 
shall furnish a list of the required facilities and their locations with 
this code.)
    (g) CTIC CP. The rights to use the data needed to purchase this part 
from additional sources are not owned by the Government and cannot be 
purchased.
    (h) CTIC CV. A high reliability part under a formal reliability 
program. Probability of failure would be unacceptable from the 
standpoint of safety of personnel and/or equipment. The cognizant 
engineering activity has determined that data to define and control 
reliability limits cannot be obtained nor is it possible to draft 
adequate specifications for this purpose. Continued control by the 
existing source is necessary to ensure acceptable reliability. (The 
contractor shall identify the existing source with this code.)
    (i) CTIC CY. The design of this part is unstable. Engineering, 
manufacturing, or performance characteristics indicate that the required 
design objectives have not been achieved. Major changes are contemplated 
because the part has a low process yield or has demonstrated marginal 
performance during tests or service use. These changes will render the 
present part obsolete and unusable in its present configuration. Limited 
acquisition from the present source is anticipated pending configuration 
changes. (The contractor shall identify the existing source with this 
code.)
E-202  Assignment of codes.
    The purpose of AMC/AMSC assignments is to provide the best possible 
technical assessment of how a part can be acquired. The technical 
assessment should not be based on issues such as: are the known sources 
actual manufacturers, or are there two actual manufacturers in 
existence; but rather on factors such as the availability of adequate 
technical data, the Government's rights to use the data, technical 
restrictions placed on the hardware (criticality, reliability, special 
testing, master tooling, source approval, etc.) and the cost to breakout 
vice projected savings. In cases where there is additional technical 
information which affects the way a part can be acquired, it should be 
made available to the contracting officer, with the AMC/AMSC. Concerning 
the assignment of AMCs and AMSCs, it is DoD policy that--
    (a) The assignment of AMC/AMSCs to parts is the responsibility of 
the DoD component introducing the equipment or system for which the 
parts are needed in the inventory. Subsequent screening is the 
responsibility of the DoD component assigned technical responsibility.

[[Page 607]]

    (b) When two or more AMSCs apply, the most technically restrictive 
code will be assigned.
    (c) Restricted combinations of AMC/AMSCs are reflected in the AMSC 
definitions. The Defense Logistics Service Center will reject invalid 
code combinations, as shown in Exhibit I, submitted for entry into the 
Federal catalog program (see E-204.2).
    (d) One-time acquisition of a part by a method other than indicated 
by the code does not require a change to the AMC (e.g., when only one of 
a number of sources can meet a short delivery date, or when only one 
manufacturing source is known but acceptable surplus parts are available 
from other sources).
    (e) After the first acquisition under AMC 2 or 4, the AMC shall be 
recoded 1 or 3 respectively.
    (f) Both full and limited screening will result in the assignment or 
reassignment of an AMC/AMSC. This assignment shall be based on the best 
technical judgment of breakout personnel and on information gathered 
during the screening process.
    (g) A part need not be coded as noncompetitive based on an initial 
market survey which only uncovers one interested source. If the 
Government has sufficient technical data in its possession to enable 
other sources to manufacture an acceptable part, and there are no 
technical restrictions on the part which would preclude other sources 
from manufacturing it, the part should be coded competitive.
E-203  Improving part status.
    (a) General. An effective breakout program requires that all 
reasonable actions be taken to improve the acquisition status of parts. 
The potential for improvement of the acquisition status will vary with 
individual circumstances. On one end of the spectrum are those parts 
with acquisition method suffix codes of a temporary nature requiring 
vigorous follow-through improvement action (e.g., AMSCs A and H); on the 
other end are those parts with codes suggesting a relative degree of 
permanence (e.g., AMSCP). A code assigned to a part should never be 
considered fixed with respect to either technical circumstance or time; 
today's technical constraint may be overcome by tomorrow's technology 
and a contractor's rights to data, so zealously protected today, often 
become less important with time. The application of breakout improvement 
effort must always consider individual circumstances and overall 
benefits expected to be obtained.
    (b) Code suspense dates. Every part whose breakout status can be 
improved shall be suspensed for rescreening as appropriate. In general, 
the following codes cannot be improved: 1G, 2G, 1K, 2K, 1M, 2M, 1N, 2N, 
1T, 2T, 1Z, or 2Z. The period between suspenses is a period for which an 
assigned AMC/AMSC is considered active, and routine rescreening of parts 
with ``valid'' codes is not required. Suspense dates may vary with the 
circumstance surrounding each part. A code reached as a result of 
limited screening (E-304) shall not be assigned a suspense date 
exceeding 12 months; a code reached as a result of full screening (E-
303) shall not be assigned a suspense date exceeding three years. In 
exceptional cases, where circumstances indicate that no change can be 
expected in a code over an extended period, a suspense date not 
exceeding five years may be assigned in accordance with controls 
established by the breakout activity. Items with a 1G or 2G code do not 
require a suspense date.
E-204  Communication of codes.
E-204.1  Communication media.
    Use the Federal catalog program formats, set forth in DoD Manual 
4100.39-M, Defense Integrated Data System (DIDS) Procedural Manual, 
communication media and operating instructions as augmented by this 
appendix to disseminate AMCs and AMSCs.
E-204.2  Responsibilities.
    (a) The Defense Logistics Service Center (DLSC) shall--
    (1) Receive and disseminate AMCs and AMSCs for each national stock 
number (NSN) to all appropriate Government activities in consonance with 
scheduled Federal catalog program computer cycles;
    (2) Make the AMCs and AMSCs a part of the data bank of NSN item 
intelligence;
    (3) Perpetuate the codes in all subsequent Federal catalog program 
transactions; e.g., entry of new NSNs and Federal supply code (FSC) 
changes; and
    (4) Reject invalid code combinations submitted for entry into the 
Federal catalog program.
    (b) DoD activities responsible for the assignment of AMCs and AMSCs 
shall--
    (1) Transmit assigned codes for each NSN through normal cataloging 
channels to DLSC under existing Federal catalog program procedures; and
    (2) Notify DLSC by normal Federal catalog program maintenance 
procedures when a change in coding is made.

        Part 3--Identification, selection, and screening of parts

E-300  General.
    This part sets forth procedures for the identification, selection, 
and screening of parts.
E-301  Identification and selection procedures.
E-301.1  Parts entering the inventory.
    The breakout process should begin at the earliest possible stage of 
weapon systems acquisition. Generally, a provisioned part will

[[Page 608]]

require subsequent replenishment. Provisioning or similar lists of new 
parts are, therefore, the appropriate bases for selecting parts for 
screening. This is not to imply that breakout must be done on all items 
as part of the provisioning process. Priorities shall be applied to 
those parts offering the greatest opportunity for breakout and potential 
savings. The major factors in making this determination are--
    (a) The unit price;
    (b) The projected quantity to be purchased over the part's life 
cycle; and
    (c) The potential for screening to result in a part being 
successfully broken out, e.g., item stability, cost, and completeness of 
technical data, etc.
E-301.2  Annual buy forecasts.
    Annually, lists shall be prepared that identify all parts projected 
for purchase during the subsequent 12-month period. Priority should be 
given to those parts with the greatest expected return given their 
annual buy value, life cycle buy value, and likelihood of successful 
breakout, given technical characteristics such as design and performance 
stability and the availability of technical data. Parts with an expired 
suspense date or a suspense date which will expire during the forecast 
period (see E-203(b)), need only be subjected to the necessary steps of 
the full screening procedure (see E-303). Parts with a valid code that 
will not expire during the forecast period need not be screened. Parts 
coded 0O shall be selected for full screening.
E-301.3  Immediate buy requirements.
    An immediate buy requirement will be identified by the user or the 
item manager in consonance with department/agency regulations. When an 
immediate buy requirement meeting the screening criteria (see E-104(b)) 
is generated for a part not assigned a current AMC/AMSC, the part shall 
be promptly screened in accordance with either the full or limited 
screening procedures (see E-303 and E-304).
E-301.4  Suspect AMC/AMSC.
    Whenever an AMC/AMSC is suspected of being inaccurate by anyone, 
including the contracting officer, a rescreening shall be conducted for 
that part. Suspect codes include codes composed of invalid combinations 
of AMCs and AMSCs, those which do not truly reflect how a part is 
actually being acquired, and those suspected of being more restrictive 
than necessary for the next buy.
E-302  Screening.
    (a) Screening procedures include consideration and recording of the 
relevant facts pertaining to breakout decisions. The objective of 
screening is to improve the acquisition status by determining the 
potential for competition, or purchase from an actual manufacturer. 
Consideration of any reasonable approach to establishing competition 
should be an integral part of the breakout process.
    (b) Screening procedures may vary depending on circumstances related 
to the parts. No set rules will provide complete guidance for making 
acquisition method decisions under all conditions encountered in actual 
practice. An informed coding decision can be made without following the 
procedures step by step in every case.
    (c) Activities involved in screening are encouraged to develop 
supplemental procedures which prove effective in meeting this 
regulation's objectives. These procedures should be tailored to the 
particular activity's operating environment and the characteristics of 
the parts for which it is responsible. Nevertheless, care should be 
taken in all cases to assure that--
    (1) Responsible judgment is applied to all elements involved in the 
review of a part;
    (2) The necessary supporting facts are produced, considered, and 
recorded in the breakout screening file. The breakout screening file 
contains technical data and other documents concerning screening of the 
part;
    (3) All cost effective alternatives are considered for establishing 
competition, or purchase from an actual manufacturer (see E-105(d)(6)); 
and
    (4) When possible, the sequence of the review allows for 
accomplishing several screening steps concurrently.
    (d) Contractor participation in the decision making process extends 
only to providing technical information. This technical information is 
provided by supporting documentation (DD Forms 1418, Contractor 
Technical Information Record, and DD Form 1418-1, Technical Data 
Identification Checklist) which includes the CTIC assignment. Government 
personnel shall substantiate the breakout decision by reference to the 
CTIC and by careful review of the supporting documentation. However, the 
CTIC provides guidance only, and it should be used as one of the inputs 
to arrive at an acceptable AMC and AMSC coding.
    (e) Contractor's technical information furnished in accordance with 
MIL-STD-789 may indicate areas requiring additional research by the 
Government before screening can be completed. Seldom will industry's 
contribution to the screening process enable the Government to assign an 
AMC or AMSC without additional review.
    (f) During the screening process, it may be appropriate to 
communicate with industry, particularly potential manufacturers of a 
part, to determine the feasibility of establishing a competitive source 
and to estimate the costs and technical risks involved.
    (g) Coding conferences with industry shall be documented.

[[Page 609]]

    (h) Screening may disclose a part is not suitable for competitive 
acquisition, but it may be possible to breakout the part for direct 
purchase from the actual manufacturer or to establish a second source. 
Parts particularly suited to direct purchase are those where neither the 
design control activity nor the prime contractor contribute additional 
value or whose data belong to the actual manufacturer and will not be 
acquired by the Government, and where that manufacturer exercises total 
responsibility for the part (design and quality control, testing, etc.), 
and where additional operations performed by the prime contractor can be 
performed by the actual manufacturer or by the Government.
    (i) For each part that is screened, a file shall be established to 
document and justify the decisions and results of all screening effort 
(see E-105(d)(6)).
    (j) Full and limited screening procedures are two elements of 
breakout programs. Other spare parts initiatives to enhance breakout are 
reverse engineering, bailment, data rights challenges, and publication 
of intended buy lists. Integration of other initiatives within the 
screening processes developed at each activity is encouraged.
E-303  Full screening procedures.
    (a) Full screening procedures should be developed so that the 
potential is fully evaluated for establishing competition or purchase 
from an actual manufacturer. Also, full screening procedures should 
facilitate accurate and consistent acquisition method code assignment. 
It is expected that each activity will develop its own operational 
screening procedures. A general model, full screening decision process 
is provided below to support the development of activity level 
procedures and to provide guidance regarding the general scope of these 
procedures. The full screening procedures involve 65 steps in the 
decision process, and are divided into the following phases--
    (1) Data collection;
    (2) Data evaluation;
    (3) Data completion;
    (4) Technical evaluation;
    (5) Economic evaluation; and
    (6) Supply feedback.
    (b) The six phases describe different functions that must be 
achieved during screening. The nature of the screening process does not 
permit clear distinction of one phase from another. Further, the order 
of performance of these phases may not correspond to the order listed 
here. In fact, the phases will often overlap and may be performed 
simultaneously. Their purpose is to identify the different functions 
comprising the screening process.
    (c) A summary flow chart of the decision steps is provided as 
Exhibit II to assist in understanding the logical order of the full 
screening steps for various conditions. Use of the flow chart in 
connection with the text that follows is essential to fully understand 
the order of the steps in the process.
E-303.1  Data collection phase (step 1).
    (a) Assemble all available data and establish a file for each part. 
Collect identification data, relevant data obtained from industry, 
contracting and technical history data and current status of the part, 
including--
    (1) Normal identification required for cataloging and 
standardization review;
    (2) All known sources;
    (3) Historical contracting information, including the more recent 
awards, date of awards, and unit price(s) for the quantities prescribed;
    (4) Identification of the actual manufacturer(s), the latest unit 
price and the quantity on which the price is based. (When the actual 
manufacturer is not the design control activity, the design control 
activity may be consulted to ensure the latest version of the item is 
being procured from the actual manufacturer);
    (5) Identification of the activity, Government or industry, having 
design control over the part and, if industry, the cognizant Government 
engineering activity;
    (6) The expected life in the military supply system;
    (7) Record of any prior review for breakout, with results or 
findings; and
    (8) Annual demand.
    (b) In the case of complex items requiring large numbers of 
drawings, collection of a reasonable technical data sample is sufficient 
for the initial technical data evaluation phase (steps 2-14).
E-303.2  Data evaluation phase (steps 2-14).
    (a) Data evaluation is crucial to the whole review procedure. It 
involves determination of the adequacy of the technical data package and 
the Government's rights to use the data for acquisition purposes.
    (b) The data evaluation process may be divided into two stages--
    (1) A brief but intensive analysis of available data and documents 
regarding both technical matters and data rights, leading to a decision 
whether to proceed with screening; and
    (2) If the decision is to proceed with screening, further work is 
necessary to produce an adequate technical data package, such as 
research of contract provisions, engineering work on data and drawings, 
and requests to contractors for additional data.
    (c) The steps in this phase are--(1) Step 2. Are full Government 
rights established by the available data package? Evidence for an 
affirmative answer would include the identification of Government 
drawings, incorporation by reference of Government specifications or 
process descriptions in the public

[[Page 610]]

domain, or reference to contract provisions giving the Government rights 
to data. If the answer is negative, proceed to step 3; if positive, 
proceed to step 6.
    (2) Step 3. Are the contractor's limitations of the Government's 
rights to data established by the available data package?
    (i) The questions in step 2 and 3 are not exclusive. The 
incorporation in a drawing of contract provisions reserving rights to 
the manufacturer, either in the whole design or in certain manufacturing 
processes, would establish a clear affirmative answer to step 3 where 
there is substantiating Government documentation. Parts not in this 
group shall be retained for further processing (see step 20). Data 
rights that cannot be substantiated shall be challenged (see DFARS Part 
227, validation procedures).
    (ii) In the case of clear contractor ownership of rights, proceed 
with steps 4 and 5.
    (3) Step 4. Are there bases for competitive acquisition without 
using data subject to limitations on use? This question requires 
consideration, for example, of the possibility of using performance 
specifications or substitution of military or commercial specifications 
or bulletins for limited elements of the manufacturing process. The use 
of sample copies is another possibility.
    (4) Step 5. Can the Government buy the necessary rights to data? 
This is a preliminary question to the full analysis (in steps 20 and 21 
below) and is designed primarily to eliminate from further consideration 
those items which incorporate established data restrictions and for 
which there are no other bases for competitive acquisition nor is 
purchase of rights possible or feasible.
    (5) Steps 6 and 7. Is the present technical data package adequate 
for competitive acquisition of a reliable part?
    (6) Steps 8 and 9. Specify omissions. The question in steps 6 and 7 
requires a critical engineering evaluation and should deal first with 
the physical completeness of the date--are any essential dimensions, 
tolerances, processes, finishes, material specifications, or other vital 
elements of data lacking from the package? If so, these omissions should 
be specified. A second element deals with adequacy of the existing 
package to produce a part of the required performance, compatibility, 
quality, and reliability. This will, of course, be related to the 
completeness of data. In some cases, qualified engineering judgment may 
decide that in spite of apparently complete data, the high performance 
or other critical characteristics of the item require retention of the 
present source. If such decision is made, the file shall include 
documentation in the form of specific information, such as difficulties 
experienced by the present manufacturer in producing a satisfactory item 
or the existence of unique production skills in the present source.
    (7) Steps 10 and 11. Can the data be developed to make up a reliable 
technical data package? This implies a survey of the specified omissions 
with careful consideration to determine the resources available to 
supply each missing element. Such resources will vary from simple 
referencing of standard engineering publications to more complex 
development of drawings with the alternatives of either obtaining such 
drawings or developing performance specifications. In some cases, 
certain elements of data are missing because they have been properly 
restricted. If, however, there has been no advance substantiation of the 
right to restrict, the part should be further researched. If the answer 
to this question is negative, proceed to step 12; if positive, proceed 
to step 13 or 14.
    (8) Step 12. If the answer to the question in steps 10 and 11 is no, 
which condition is the prime element in this decision, the lack of data 
or the unreliability of the data? Specific documentation is needed to 
support this decision.
    (9) Steps 13 and 14. Estimate the time required to complete the data 
package. In those cases where the data package is found inadequate and 
specific additions need to be developed, an estimate of the time 
required for completion must be made in order to determine if breakout 
of the part is feasible during this review cycle and to estimate at what 
point in the remaining life of the part the data package could be 
available.
E-303.3  Data completion phase (steps 15-21).
    (a) The data completion phase involves acquiring or developing the 
missing elements of information to reach a determination on both 
adequacy of the technical data package and the restriction of rights to 
data. It may involve various functional responsibilities, such as 
examination of past contracts, queries directed to industry or to other 
Government agencies, inspection of the part, reverse or other 
engineering work to develop drawings and write specifications, 
arrangements with the present source for licensing or technical 
assistance to new manufacturers, and negotiations for purchase of rights 
to data. Additional research and information requests should be 
expeditiously initiated on those parts where there is a reasonable 
expectation of breakout. Because this phase is time-consuming, it should 
take place concurrently with other phases of the review.
    (b) At the beginning of the data completion phase, the part falls 
into one of the following four steps--
    (1) Step 15. The data package is complete and adequate and the 
Government has sufficient rights for acquisition purposes. Such parts 
require no further data analysis. Proceed to step 22.
    (2) Step 16. The Government has rights to existing data. The data 
package is incomplete but there is a reasonable expectation

[[Page 611]]

that the missing elements can be supplied. Proceed to step 19.
    (3) Step 17. The data package is complete, but suitable Government 
rights to the data have not been established. Proceed to step 20.
    (4) Step 18. Neither rights nor completeness of data is adequately 
established; therefore, the part requires further research. Proceed to 
step 20.
    (c) Step 19. Obtain or develop the necessary data for a suitable 
data package. Reverse engineering to develop acquisition data may be 
used if there is a clear indication that the costs of reverse 
engineering will be less than the savings anticipated from competitive 
acquisition. If there is a choice between reverse engineering and the 
purchase of data (step 21), the decision shall be made on the basis of 
relative costs, quality, time, and other pertinent factors.
    (d) Step 20. Establish the Government's and contractor's rights to 
the data. Where drawings and data cannot be identified to a contract, 
the following guidelines should be applied--
    (1) Where drawings and data bear legends which warn of copyright or 
patent rights, the effect of such legends shall be resolved according to 
law and policy; however, the existence of patent or copyright 
restrictions does not per se preclude securing competition with respect 
to the parts described (see FAR Subpart 27.3/DFARS Subpart 227.3).
    (2) If the technical data bears legends which limit the Government's 
right to use the data for breakout and it is determined that reasonable 
grounds exist to question the current validity of the restrictive 
markings, the contracting officer will be notified to initiate the 
validation procedures at DFARS Subpart 227.4.
    (3) Where drawings and data are unmarked and, therefore, free of 
limitation on their use, they shall be considered available for use in 
acquisition, unless the acquiring office has clear evidence to the 
contrary (see DFARS Subpart 227.4).
    (4) The decision process in situations described in paragraphs (d) 
(1), (2), and (3) of this subsection requires the exercise of sound 
discretion and judgment and embraces legal considerations. In no case 
shall a decision be made without review and approval of that decision by 
legal counsel.
    (5) If the validation procedures in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
subsection establish the Government's right to use the data for 
breakout, the Government shall attempt to obtain competition pursuant to 
the decisions resulting from concurrent technical and economic 
evaluation.
    (e) Step 21. If restrictions on the use of data are established, 
determine whether the Government can buy rights to the required data. 
Use the procedure in DFARS Subpart 227.4.
E-303.4  Technical evaluation phase (steps 22-37).
    (a) Introduction. (1) The purposes of technical evaluation are to 
determine the development status, design stability, high performance, 
and/or critical characteristics such as safety of personnel and 
equipment; the reliability and effective operation of the system and 
equipment in which the parts are to be used; and to exercise technical 
judgment as to the feasibility of breaking out the parts. No simple and 
universal rules apply to each determination. The application of 
experience and responsible judgment is required. Technical 
considerations arise in several elements of the decision process, e.g., 
in determining adequacy of the data package (steps 6-14).
    (2) Certain manufacturing conditions may reduce the field of 
potential sources. However, these conditions do not justify the 
restriction of competition by the assignment of restrictive AMCs for the 
following reasons--
    (i) Parts produced from class 1 castings and similar type forgings. 
The process of developing and providing the acceptability of high-
integrity castings and forgings requires repetitive performance by a 
controlled source for each casting or forging along identical lines to 
those which result in initial acceptability of the item. The particular 
manufacturer's process becomes the controlling factor with regard to the 
acceptability of any such item. However, other firms can produce class 1 
castings and similar type forgings and provide the necessary inspection, 
or the part may be acquired from other sources which use castings or 
forgings from approved (controlled) source(s).
    (ii) Parts produced from master or coordinated tooling, e.g., 
numerically controlled tapes. Such parts have features (contoured 
surfaces, hole locations, etc.) delineated according to unique master 
tooling or tapes and are manufactured to minimum/maximum limits and must 
be replaceable without additional tailoring or fitting. These parts 
cannot be manufactured or configured by a secondary pattern or jigs 
independent of the master tooling and cannot be manufactured to 
requisite tolerances of fit by use of commercial precision machinery. In 
this context, jigs and fixtures used only for ease of production are not 
considered master tooling. However, master tooling may be reproduced.
    (iii) Parts requiring special test and/or inspection facilities to 
determine and maintain ultra-precision quality for the function or 
system integrity. Substantiation and inspection of the precision or 
quality cannot be accomplished without specialized test or inspection 
facilities. Testing is often done by the actual manufacturer under 
actual operating use. However, such special test inspection facilities 
may be available at other firms.

    (b) Design procedures (steps 22-31). (1) Step 22. Will a design 
change occur during anticipated lead time? If affirmative, proceed to 
step 23; if negative, proceed to step 24.
    (2) Step 23. Specify the design change and assign an appropriate 
code.
    (3) Step 24. Is a satisfactory part now being produced? Concurrently 
with the research and completion of data, a technical determination is 
required as to the developmental status of the part. With the frequent 
telescoping of the development/production cycle as well as constant 
product improvement throughout the active life of equipment, parts are 
frequently subject to design changes. The present source, if a prime 
contractor, is usually committed to incorporate the latest changes in 
any deliveries under a production order. In considering the part for 
breakout, an assessment must be made of the stability of design, so that 
in buying from a new source the Government will not be purchasing an 
obsolete or incompatible part. The question of obsolescence or 
noncompatibility is to some extent under Government control. Screening 
for breakout on parts that are anticipated to undergo design change 
should be deferred until design stability is attained.
    (4) Step 25. Can a satisfactory part be produced by a new source? 
Determine whether technical reasons prohibit seeking a new source. The 
fact that the present source has not yet been able to produce a 
satisfactory part (step 24) does not preclude another source from being 
successful. If the answer to step 24 or 25 is affirmative, proceed 
simultaneously to steps 27 and 38. If the answer to step 25 is negative, 
proceed to step 26.
    (5) Step 26. If the present source is producing an unsatisfactory 
part, but technical reasons prohibit seeking a new source, specify the 
reasons.
    (6) Step 27. Does the part require prior qualification or other 
approval testing? If the answer is positive, proceed to step 28; if 
negative, proceed to step 32.
    (8) Step 28. Specify the requirement.
    (9) Step 29. Estimate the time required to qualify a new source.
    (10) Step 30. Is there currently a qualified source?
    (11) Step 31. Who is responsible for qualifications of the 
subcontractor, present prime contractor, the Government, or an 
independent testing agency?
    (i) If a qualified source is currently in existence, the review 
should consider who will be responsible for qualification in the event 
of competitive acquisition. If qualification testing is such that it can 
be performed by the selected source under a preproduction or first 
article clause in the contract, the costs of initial approval should be 
reflected in the offers received. If the part requires initial 
qualification tests by some other agency such as the present prime 
contractor, the Government, an independent testing agent outside the 
Government, or by technical facilities within the departments, out-of-
pocket costs may be incurred if the part is competed. An estimate of 
qualification costs should then be made and recorded in such cases.
    (ii) Where facilities within the Government are not adequate for 
testing or qualification, or outside agencies such as the equipment 
contractor cannot or will not do the job, the economics of qualification 
may be unreasonable, and a narrative statement of these facts should 
replace the cost estimate. Whenever possible, such as in the case of 
engine qualification tests, economy of combined qualification tests 
should be considered.
    (c) Quality assurance procedures (steps 32-33). Quality control and 
inspection is a primary consideration when making a decision to 
breakout. Where the prime contractor performs quality assurance 
functions beyond those of the part manufacturer or other sources, the 
Government may--
    (1) Develop the same quality control and inspection capability in 
the manufacturer's plant;
    (2) Assume the responsibility for quality; or
    (3) Undertake to obtain the quality assurance services from another 
source, possibly the prime contractor.
    (4) Step 32. Who is now responsible for quality control and 
inspection of the part?
    (5) Step 33. Can a new source be assigned responsibility for quality 
control? Is the level of the quality assurance requirements specified in 
the system contract necessary for the screened part? The minimum quality 
assurance procedures for each part shall be confirmed.
    (i) A new source shall be considered if--
    (A) Any essential responsibility (e.g., burn-in, reliability, 
maintainability) retained by the prime contractor for the part and its 
relationship to the end item can be eliminated, shifted to the new 
source, or assumed by the Government;
    (B) The prime contractor will provide the needed quality assurance 
services;
    (C) The Government can obtain competent, impartial services to 
perform quality assurance responsibility; or
    (D) The new source can maintain an adequate quality assurance 
program, inspection system, or inspection appropriate for the part.
    (ii) If the prime contractor has responsibility for quality that a 
new source cannot assume or obtain, or that the Government cannot 
undertake or eliminate, consideration of the new source is precluded.
    (d) Tooling procedures (steps 34-37). (1) Step 34. Is tooling or 
other special equipment required?
    (2) Step 35. Specify the type of tooling.

[[Page 613]]

    (3) Step 36. Estimate additional acquisition leadtime for setup and 
for tooling.
    (4) Step 37. Does the Government possess this tooling? If tooling or 
special equipment is required for production of the part, the types and 
quantities should be specified. Investigation can then be made as to 
whether the Government possesses such tooling and can make it available 
to a new source. A requirement for special tooling is not necessarily a 
deterrent to competitive solicitation for parts. The Government may find 
it desirable to purchase the needed tooling and furnish it to the new 
source. In this case, the costs can be determined with reasonable 
accuracy. However, if new sources can provide the tooling or special 
equipment, this will be reflected in competitive prices and should not 
normally require further analysis.
E-303.5  Economic evaluation phase (steps 38-56).
    (a) Economic evaluation concerns identification and estimation of 
breakout savings and direct cost offsets to breakout. The economic 
evaluation phase is composed of the three segments detailed in 
paragraphs (b) through (d) of this subsection.
    (b) Development of savings data (steps 38-40). (1) Step 38. Estimate 
remaining program life cycle buy value.
    (2) Step 39. Apply either a savings factor of 25 percent or one 
determined under local conditions and experience.
    (3) Step 40. Multiply the remaining program life cycle buy value by 
the savings factor to obtain the expected future savings, if the part is 
coded for breakout.
    (c) Computation of breakout costs (steps 41-47). Several groups of 
costs must be collected, summarized and compared to estimated savings to 
properly determine the economics of breakout. These costs include--
    (1) Direct costs (steps 41-45). Direct costs of breakout normally 
include all expenditures which are direct and wholly identifiable to a 
specific, successful breakout action, and which are not reflected in the 
part unit price. Examples of direct costs include Government tooling or 
special test equipment, qualification testing, quality control expenses, 
and industry participation costs (such as completion of the Contractor 
Technical Information Data Record) if borne by the Government.
    (i) Step 41. Estimate the cost to the Government for tooling or 
special equipment.
    (ii) Step 42. Estimate the cost, if any, to the Government for 
qualifying the new source.
    (iii) Step 43. Estimate the cost, if any, to the Government for 
assuring quality control, or the cost of contracting for quality 
control.
    (iv) Step 44. Estimate the cost to the Government for purchasing 
rights to data.
    (v) Step 45. Add estimated total direct costs to the Government to 
breakout the item.
    (2) Performance specification costs (steps 46-47). (i) Step 46. Is 
the breakout candidate constructed to a performance specification?
    (ii) Step 47. If the answer is yes in step 46, add performance 
specification breakout cost estimate elements to the result of step 45. 
The addition of an unknown number of nonstocked parts which must be 
stocked by the supply system for repairs is a significant element of 
cost associated with the decision to compete a performance specification 
assembly. (The same situation does not arise with respect to a design 
specification assembly since virtually all spare parts used to repair 
such an assembly are essentially identical to parts already in the 
assembly.) The cost of introducing these nonstocked parts into the 
system includes--
    (A) Additional catalog costs. The number of nonstocked parts 
forecasted to be in the competed assembly, multiplied by the variable 
cost of cataloging per line item.
    (B) Additional bin opening costs.
    The number of nonstocked parts forecasted to be in the competed 
assembly, multiplied by the variable cost of a bin opening at each of 
the locations where the part is to be stocked.
    (C) Additional management costs. The number of nonstocked parts 
forecasted to be in the competed assembly, multiplied by the variable 
cost of management per line item.
    (D) Additional technical data costs. The cost of a new set of 
technical data for the competed assembly, including the variable 
expenses of its production, reproduction, and distribution.
    (E) Additional repair tools and test equipment costs. The costs of 
additional special tools and test equipment not otherwise required by 
the existing assembly.
    (F) Additional logistics support costs. The costs associated with 
the new item such as spare and repair parts, technical manuals, and 
training.
    (d) Comparison of savings and costs (steps 48-56). Compare estimated 
breakout costs to forecasted breakout savings. If costs exceed estimated 
savings, it will be uneconomical to compete the part. Performance 
specification parts should be analyzed to ensure that pertinent breakout 
costs have been considered and, if it is not economical to breakout the 
part, whether an appropriate detailed design data package reduces costs 
sufficiently to make breakout economical.
    (1) Step 48. Compare total costs of breakout (step 47) to estimated 
savings (step 40).
    (2) Step 49. Are costs of breakout greater or less than estimated 
savings? If greater, proceed to step 50; if yes, proceed to step 51.
    (3) Step 50. Is the breakout candidate constructed to a performance 
specification? If

[[Page 614]]

no, proceed to step 54; if yes, proceed to step 57.
    (4) Step 51. Is it appropriate to obtain a detailed design data 
package? If yes, proceed to step 52; if no, proceed to step 54. The 
decision to change a performance specification part to a detailed design 
part obviously requires a critical engineering examination of the part 
itself, as well as a review of the impact such a change might have on 
the operational effectiveness of the system in which the equipment is to 
be employed. Acquisition of a performance specification part by a 
subsequently acquired design specification subjects the Government to 
the additional hazard of losing the money paid for the development of 
the design specification, should the design be altered during the 
contracting leadtime period. Accordingly, the engineering evaluation 
should closely review design stability over the anticipated contracting 
leadtime in order to avoid acquiring an obsolete or nonstandard part if 
the decision is made to compete it.
    (5) Step 52. Add the estimated cost of obtaining a detailed design 
data package to the results of step 45.
    (6) Step 53. If the results of step 52 are less than the estimated 
savings, initiate action to obtain a detailed design data package. 
Proceed to step 54 to code the part for a period until it can be 
rescreened using the design specification package. The code determined 
in this screening shall be assigned a suspense date commensurate with 
the leadtime required to obtain the detailed design data package (see E-
203(b)).
    (7) Step 54. Is the part manufactured by the prime contractor? If 
yes, code the part AMC 3; if no, proceed to step 55.
    (8) Step 55. Can the part be acquired directly from the actual 
manufacturer? If no, proceed to step 56; if yes, code the part AMC 3 or 
4, as applicable.
    (9) Step 56. Specify the reasons for inability to obtain the part 
from the actual manufacturer. Code the part AMC 5.
E-303.6  Supply feedback phase (steps 57-65).
    (a) The supply feedback phase of the analysis is the final screening 
phase for breakout parts. This phase in completed for all AMC 2 parts to 
determine if sufficient time is available to breakout on the immediate 
buy and to communicate this information to the inventory manager 
responsible for the requirement. First, all additional time factors 
required to breakout the part are added. Total time is subtracted from 
the immediate and future buy date and the result compared to the current 
date. (Note: Not all time factors listed apply to each part screened.) 
If the result is the same or earlier than the required contract date, 
the part is coded competitive and action is begun to qualify additional 
sources as necessary. If the result is later than the required contract 
date, action to compete the immediate buy quantity should be initiated 
if the inventory manager can find some means of accepting later 
delivery. If this is impossible, the appropriate records should be 
annotated for competitive acquisition of the next replenishment buy 
quantity. If late delivery is acceptable, the inventory manager should 
compute requirements for the part and initiate an appropriate purchase 
requisition.
    (b) Procedures. (1) Step 57. Add all additional time factors 
required to breakout the part (steps 13, 14, 29, and 36).
    (2) Step 58. Add the results of step 57 to the date of this review.
    (3) Step 59. Compare the result of step 58 to the date that the 
contract or order must be placed.
    (4) Step 60. Is the result of step 59 earlier than, later than, or 
the same as the contract or order date? (If earlier or the same, proceed 
to step 61; if later, proceed to step 63.)
    (5) Step 61. Can supply accept late delivery? If yes, proceed to 
step 62; if no, proceed to step 63.
    (6) Step 62. Notify the inventory manager to compute requirements 
and initiate a purchase requisition. Proceed to step 64.
    (7) Step 63. Code the part AMC 2. Insufficient time to compete on 
this buy.
    (8) Step 64. Code the part AMC 2.
    (9) Step 65. Begin actions to qualify new sources, if required and 
possible.
E-304  Limited screening procedures.
    (a) Limited screening procedures are only appropriate when the full 
screening process cannot be completed for a part in sufficient time to 
support an immediate buy requirement. If limited screening does not 
result in a competitive AMC and the part is characterized by a high buy 
value and high buy quantity in the annual buy forecast, full screening 
procedures shall be immediately initiated.
    (b) Limited screening procedures cover only the essential points of 
data and technical evaluations more completely described in full 
screening procedures (see E-303). Extensive legal review of rights or 
technical review of data is not required; nor is backup information on 
type and extent of qualification testing, quality control procedures and 
master tooling required. A summary flow chart of the limited screening 
decision steps is provided at Exhibit III.
    (c) The limited screening decision steps are followed sequentially 
if the answer to the question in each step is affirmative. If any step 
is answered in the negative, proceed directly to step 10.
    (1) Step 1. Assemble all available data and establish a file for 
each part. Collect identification data, relevant data obtained from 
industry, contracting and technical history

[[Page 615]]

data and current status of the part (see E-303.1).
    (2) Step 2. Do the available documents establish Government rights 
to use the data for acquisition purposes? If the Government's rights to 
use data in its possession is questionable, resolution of the rights 
must continue beyond award of the immediate buy.
    (3) Step 3. Is the data package sufficient, accurate, and legible? 
If the Government does not have in its possession sufficient, accurate, 
or legible data, action shall be promptly initiated to resolve the 
deficiency for the next buy.
    (4) Step 4. Is the design of the part stable over the anticipated 
acquisition leadtime?
    (5) Step 5. Is a satisfactory part now being produced?
    (6) Step 6. Can the part be acquired from a new source without prior 
qualification testing or other approval testing?
    (7) Step 7. Can the Government or a new source be responsible for 
quality assurance?
    (8) Step 8. Can the part be manufactured without master or 
coordinated tooling or other special equipment; if no, is there more 
than one source which has the tooling or special equipment?
    (9) Step 9. Assign AMC 2. Proceed to step 11.
    (10) Step 10. Assign AMC 3, 4, or 5, as appropriate.
    (11) Step 11. Establish the date of the next review (see E-104(c) 
and E-203(b)).

                     Part 4--Contractor's Assistance

E-400  General.
    (a) Contractor's assistance in screening shall be requested on 
provisioned and replenishment parts after consideration of the benefit 
expected from the contractor's technical information and the cost to the 
Government of obtaining such assistance.
    (b) Contractor's assistance shall not be requested for parts covered 
by Government/industry specifications, commercially available parts or 
parts for which data is already available.
    (c) Arrangements entered into with contractor to obtain technical 
information shall provide that--
    (1) Contractors will exert their best effort to make impartial 
technical evaluations using applicable technical data and the experience 
of competent personnel; and
    (2) No costs to the Government will be incurred for duplicate 
screening of parts.
E-401  Contractor's technical evaluation procedures.
    (a) Contractor's technical evaluation for the screening process 
shall be required contractually by incorporating MIL-STD-789, which 
delineates the contractor's responsibilities and procedures and 
prescribes use of the contractor DD Form 1418, Technical Information 
Record, and the DD Form 1418-1, Technical Data Identification Checklist, 
a copy of each document listed on DD Form 1418-1, and other substantive 
data that was used in developing the contractor's recommendations.
    (b) When MIL-STD-789 is incorporated in a contract, the DD Form 
1423, Contract Data Requirements List, shall specify the requirement for 
the submission of DD Form 1418, Technical Information Record, and DD 
Form 1418-1, Technical Data Identification Checklist, in accordance with 
MIL-STD-789.

                        Part 5--Reporting System

E-500  General.
    This part prescribes reports regarding the breakout program which 
cannot be obtained from other sources. These reports are used to 
evaluate the effectiveness of breakout programs, establish a baseline 
for all spare part acquisitions, and identify trends in spare parts 
acquisition.
E-501  Reports.
    (a) Spare Parts Breakout Screening Report (RCS DD P&L(Q&SA)714A). 
This is a cumulative semi-annual report reflecting the accomplishments 
of the breakout program. The report describes the results of full and 
limited screening for provisioning and replenishment parts by number of 
different NSNs for each AMC. Departments and agencies shall also 
maintain actual cost data attributable to the Spare Parts Breakout 
Program which shall be forwarded on this report semi-annually.
    (b) Spare Parts Acquisition Report (RCS DD P&L(Q&SA) 714B). This is 
a cumulative semi-annual report for all purchases made of spare parts 
during the current fiscal year. This report describes the number and 
extended dollar value of different NSNs purchased for each AMC. 
Departments and agencies shall also maintain actual savings (or cost 
avoidance) data attributable to the Spare Parts Breakout Program which 
shall be forwarded on this report semi-annually. Because of extraneous 
factors such as contracting leadtimes and changes in spare parts 
requirements, this report will not always reflect the acquisition of the 
parts screened during a reporting period (contained on the Spare Parts 
Breakout Screening Report). Also, it will not show in all instances how 
the part was actually acquired. This report is intended to be an 
indication of the success of the breakout program, and designed to show 
trends in the coding and data available to buyers in the acquisition 
package.
E-502  Reporting procedures.
    (a) Departments and agencies shall maintain and forward semi-annual 
reports. The second semi-annual report in a fiscal year

[[Page 616]]

shall reflect cumulative totals for the current fiscal year using the 
formats in Exhibits IV and V.
    (b) The reports will be due no later than 45 days after the end of 
each period designated.
    (c) Submissions will be made to the Assistant Secretary of Defense 
(Production and Logistics), ATTN: Deputy Assistant Secretary for 
Logistics.
E-503  Reporting instructions.
    (a) Spare parts breakout screening report. Using the format in 
Exhibit IV, provide the following--
    (1) Enter reporting activity name, fiscal year, and period ending.
    (2) For each AMC/AMSC listed, enter the number of different NSNs for 
which screening was completed during the period. Show zeros where 
applicable. This should be done for both full and limited screening.
    (3) Report the total costs of the breakout program incurred for the 
period. Although this will be primarily labor costs, it should also 
include appropriate prorated costs of ADP services, office overhead, 
data retrieval service costs, etc. (see E-303.5).
    (b) Spare parts acquisition report. Using the format in Exhibit V, 
provide the following--
    (1) Enter reporting activity name, fiscal year, and period ending.
    (2) For each AMC/AMSC listed, enter the number of different NSNs 
purchased during the current fiscal year and their extended dollar 
value.
    (3) Report the actual breakout program savings or cost avoidances as 
measured by completed acquisition (not anticipated acquisitions). Price 
differentials should be measured on each acquisition where a breakout 
action has taken place. They should equal the difference between the 
previous contract unit price and the current contract unit price, times 
the number of units purchased.

                          Part 1--Introduction

F-101  General.
    This appendix contains procedures and instructions for the use, 
preparation, and distribution of the material inspection and receiving 
report (MIRR) (DD Form 250 series) and commercial shipping/packing lists 
used to document Government contract quality assurance.
F-102  Applicability.
    (a) The provisions of this appendix apply to supplies or services 
acquired by DoD when the clause at 252.246-7000, Material Inspection and 
Receiving Report, is included in the contract. If the contract contains 
the clause at FAR 52.213-1, Fast Payment Procedure, the contractor may 
elect not to prepare a DD Form 250.
    (b) When DoD provides quality assurance or acceptance services for 
non-DoD activities, prepare a MIRR using the instructions in this 
appendix, unless otherwise specified in the contract.
F-103  Use.
    (a) The DD Form 250 is a multipurpose report used--(1) To provide 
evidence of Government contract quality assurance at origin or 
destination;
    (2) To provide evidence of acceptance at origin or destination;
    (3) For packing lists;
    (4) For receiving;
    (5) For shipping;
    (6) As a contractor invoice; and
    (7) As commercial invoice support.
    (b) Do not use the DD Form 250 for shipments--(1) By subcontractors, 
unless the subcontractor is shipping directly to the Government; or
    (2) Of contract inventory.
    (c) The contractor prepares the MIRR, except for entries that an 
authorized Government representative is required to complete.
    (d) Use the DD Form 250-1--(1) For bulk movements of petroleum 
products by tanker or barge to cover--
    (i) Origin or destination acceptance of cargo; or
    (ii) Shipment or receipt of Government owned products.
    (2) To send quality data to the point of acceptance in the case of 
origin inspection on FOB destination deliveries or preinspection at 
product source. Annotate the forms with the words ``INSPECTED FOR 
QUALITY ONLY.''
F-104  Application.
    (a) DD Form 250. (1) Use the DD Form 250 for delivery of contract 
line, subline, exhibit line, or exhibit subline items. Do not use the DD 
Form 250 for those exhibit line or exhibit subline items on a DD Form 
1423, Contract Data Requirements List, that indicate no DD Form 250 is 
required.
    (2) If the shipped to, marked for, shipped from, mode of shipment, 
contract quality assurance and acceptance data are the same for more 
than one shipment made on the same day under the same contract, 
contractors may prepare one MIRR to cover all such shipments.
    (3) If the volume of the shipment precludes the use of a single car, 
truck, or other vehicle, prepare a separate MIRR for the contents of 
each vehicle.
    (4) When a shipment is consigned to an Air Force activity and the 
shipment includes items of more than one federal supply class (FSC) or 
material management code (MMC), prepare a separate DD Form 250 for items 
of each of the FSCs or MMCs in the shipment. However, the cognizant 
Government representative may authorize a single DD Form 250, listing 
each of the FSCs or MMCs included in the shipment on a separate 
continuation sheet. The MMC appears as a suffix to the national stock 
number applicable to the item.
    (5) Consolidation of Petroleum Shipments on a Single MIRR--(i) 
Continental United States. Contractors may consolidate multiple car or 
truck load shipments of petroleum

[[Page 621]]

made on the same day, to the same destination, against the same contract 
line item, on one MIRR. To permit verification of motor deliveries, 
assign each load a load number which can be identified to the shipment 
number in Block 2 of the DD Form 250. Include a shipping document 
(commercial or government) with each individual load showing as a 
minimum--
    (A) The shipper;
    (B) Shipping point;
    (C) Consignee;
    (D) Contract and line item number;
    (E) Product identification;
    (F) Gross gallons (bulk only);
    (G) Loading temperature (bulk only);
    (H) American Petroleum Institute gravity (bulk only);
    (I) Identification of carrier's equipment;
    (J) Serial number of all seals applied; and
    (K) Signature of supplier's representative.
    When acceptance is at destination, the receiving activity retains 
the shipping document(s) to verify the entries on the consignee copy of 
the DD Form 250 forwarded by the contractor (reference F-401, Table 1) 
before signing Block 21B.
    (ii) Overseas. The same criteria as for continental U.S. applies, 
except the consolidation period may be extended, if acceptable to the 
receiving activity, shipping activity, Government finance office, and 
the authorized Government representative having cognizance at the 
contractor's facility. In addition, the contractor may include more than 
one contract line item in each DD Form 250 if the shipped to, marked 
for, shipped from, mode of shipment, contract quality assurance, and 
acceptance data are the same for all line items.
    (6) Consolidation of Coal Shipments on a Single MIRR. Contractors 
may consolidate multiple railcar or truck shipments of coal made on the 
same day, to the same destination, against the same contract line items, 
on one MIRR. To permit verification of truck deliveries, assign each 
load a load number which can be identified to the shipment number in 
Block 2 of the DD Form 250 and the analytical test report. Include a 
commercial shipping document with each individual truck load showing as 
a minimum--
    (i) The shipper;
    (ii) The name or names;
    (iii) Location and shipping point of the mine or mines from which 
the coal originates;
    (iv) The contract number;
    (v) The exact size of the coal shipped; and
    (vi) A certified weighmaster's certification of weight for the 
truckload.
    Include a waybill with each rail shipment showing the identical 
information. To permit verification of rail deliveries, identify each 
railcar number comprising the shipment to the shipment number in Block 2 
of the DD Form 250 and the analytical test report. When acceptance is at 
destination, the receiving activity must retain the shipping document(s) 
to verify the entries on the consignee copy of the DD Form 250.
    (b) DD Form 250-1. (1) Use a separate form for each tanker or barge 
cargo loaded.
    (2) The contractor may report more than one barge in the same tow on 
a single form if on the same contract and consigned to the same 
destination.
    (3) When liftings involve more than one contract, prepare separate 
forms to cover the portion of cargo loaded on each contract.
    (4) Prepare a separate form for each product or grade of product 
loaded.
    (5) Use a separate document for each tanker or barge cargo and each 
grade of product discharged.
    (6) For discharge, the contractor may report more than one barge in 
the same tow on a single form if from the same loading source.
F-105  Forms.
    (a) Contractors may get MIRR forms from the contract administration 
office at no cost.
    (b) Contractors may print forms provided that the format and 
dimensions (DD Forms 250 and 250c: 8 1/2 inches x 11 inches, DD Form 
250-1: 8 1/2 inches x 14 inches) are identical to the MIRR forms printed 
by the Government and that the forms are cast to provide for 78 
characters per printed image horizontally and 62 lines vertically border 
to border for the DD Form 250, and 61 lines vertically border to border 
for the DD Form 250c.

    The contractor may prepare one MIRR when the identical line item(s) 
of a contract are to be shipped to more than one consignee, with the 
same or varying quantities, and the shipment requires origin acceptance. 
Prepare the MIRR using the procedures in this appendix with the 
following changes--
    (a) Blocks 2, 4, 13, and, if applicable, 14--Enter ``See Attached 
Distribution List.''
    (b) Block 15--The contractor may group item numbers for identical

errors or omissions, it is necessary to correct the MIRR after 
distribution has been made. Use data identical to that of the original 
MIRR. Do not correct MIRRs for Blocks 19 and 20 entries. Make the 
corrections as follows--
    (a) Circle the error and place the corrected information in the same 
block; if space is limited, enter the corrected information in Block 16 
referencing the error page and block. Enter omissions in Block 16 
referencing omission page and block. For example--

    Authority; 41 U.S.C. 421 and 48 CFR chapter 1.
H-100  Scope.
    This appendix provides uniform debarment and suspension procedures 
to be followed by all debarring and suspending officials.
H-101  Notification.
    Contractors will be notified of the proposed debarment or suspension 
in accordance with FAR 9.406-3 or 9.407-3. A copy of the record which 
formed the basis for the decision by the debarring and suspending 
official will be made available to the contractor. If there is a reason 
to withhold from the contractor any portion of the record, the 
contractor will be informed of what is withheld and the reasons for such 
withholding.
H-102  Nature of proceeding.
    There are two distinct proceedings which may be involved in the 
suspension or debarment process. The first is the presentation of 
matters in opposition to the suspension or proposed debarment by the 
contractor.
    The second is fact-finding which occurs only in cases in which the 
contractor's presentation of matters in opposition raises a genuine 
dispute over one or more material facts. In a suspension action based 
upon an indictment or in a proposed debarment action based upon a 
conviction or civil judgment, there will be no fact-filling proceeding 
concerning the matters alleged in the indictment, or the facts 
underlying the convictions or civil judgment. However, to the extent 
that the proposed action stems from the contractor's affiliation with an 
individual or firm indicted or convicted, or the subject of a civil 
judgment, fact-finding is permitted if a genuine dispute of fact is 
raised as to the question of affiliation as defined in FAR 9.403.
H-103  Presentation of matters in opposition.
    (a) In accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) and 9.407-3(c), matters in 
opposition may be presented in person, in writing, or through a 
representative. Matters in opposition may be presented through any 
combination of the foregoing methods, but if a contractor desires to 
present matters in person or through a representative, any written 
material should be delivered at least 5 working days in advance of the 
presentation. Usually, all matters in opposition are presented in a 
single proceeding. A contractor who becomes aware of a pending 
indictment or allegations of wrongdoing that the contractor believes may 
lead to suspension or debarment action may contact the debarring and 
suspending official or designee to provide information as to the 
contractor's present responsibility.
    (b) An in-person presentation is an informal meeting, nonadversarial 
in nature. The debarring and suspending official and/or other agency 
representatives may ask questions of the contractor or its 
representative making the presentation. The contractor may select the 
individuals who will attend the meeting on the contractor's behalf; 
individual respondents or principals of a business firm respondent may 
attend and speak for themselves.
    (c) In accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) and 9.407-3(c), the contractor 
may submit matters in opposition within 30 days from receipt of the 
notice of suspension or proposed debarment.
    (d) The opportunity to present matters in opposition to debarment 
includes the opportunity to present matters concerning the duration of 
the debarment.
H-104  Fact-finding.
    (a) The debarring and suspending official will determine whether the 
contractor's presentation has raised a genuine dispute of material 
fact(s). If the debarring and suspending official has decided against 
debarment or continued suspension, or the provisions of FAR 9.4 preclude 
fact-finding, no fact-finding will be conducted. If the debarring and 
suspending official has determined a genuine dispute of material fact(s) 
exists, a designated fact-finder will conduct the fact-

[[Page 673]]

finding proceeding. The proceeding before the fact-finder will be 
limited to a finding of the facts in dispute as determined by the 
debarring and suspending official.
    (b) The designated fact-finder will establish the date for a fact-
finding proceeding, normally to be held within 45 working days of the 
contractor's presentation of matters in opposition. An official record 
will be made of the fact-finding proceeding.
    (c) The Government's representative and the contractor will have an 
opportunity to present evidence relevant to the facts at issues. The 
contractor may appear in person or through a representative in the fact-
finding proceeding.
    (d) Neither the Federal Rules of Evidence nor the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure govern fact-finding. Hearsay evidence may be presented 
and will be given appropriate weight by the fact-finder.
    (e) Witnesses may testify in person. Witnesses will be reminded of 
the official nature of the proceeding and that any false testimony given 
is subject to criminal prosecution. Witnesses are subject to cross-
examination.
H-105  Timing requirements.
    All timing requirements set forth in these procedures may be 
extended by the debarring and suspending official for good cause.
H-106  Subsequent to fact-finding.
    (a) Written findings of fact will be prepared by the fact-finder as 
mandated by FAR 9.406-3(d)(2)(i) and 9.407-3(d)(2)(i).
    (b) The fact-finder will determine the disputed fact(s) by a 
preponderance of the evidence. A copy of the findings of fact will be 
provided to the debarring and suspending official, the Government's 
representative, and the contractor.
    (c) The debarring and suspending official will determine whether to 
continue the suspension or to debar the contractor based upon the entire 
administrative record, including the findings of fact.
    (d) Prompt written notice of the debarring and suspending official's 
decision will be sent to the contractor and any affiliates involved, in 
compliance with FAR 9.406-3(e) and 9.407-3(d)(4).

    Authority; 41 U.S.C. 421 and 48 CFR chapter 1.
I-100  Purpose.
    (a) Appendix I to 48 CFR chapter 2 implements the Pilot Mentor-
Protege Program (hereinafter referred to as the ``Program'') established 
under section 831 of Pub. L. 101-510, The National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 1991, as amended. The purpose of the Program is to--
    (1) Provide incentives to major DoD contractors, performing under at 
least one active approved subcontracting plan negotiated with DoD or 
other Federal agencies, to assist small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs) 
in enhancing their capabilities to satisfy DoD and other contract and 
subcontract requirements;
    (2) Increase the overall participation of SDBs as subcontractors and 
suppliers and DoD contracts, other Federal agency contracts and 
commercial contracts and;
    (3) Foster the establishment of long term business relationships 
between SDBs and such contractors.
    (b) Under the Program, eligible companies approved as mentor firms 
will enter into mentor-protege agreements with eligible SDBs as protege 
firms to provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance the 
capabilities of SDBs to perform as subcontractors and suppliers. 
According to the law, the DoD may provide the mentor firm with either 
cost reimbursement, credit against SDB subcontracting goals established 
under contracts with DoD or other Federal agencies, or a combination of 
credit and reimbursement.
    (c) DoD will measure the overall success of the Program by the 
extent to which the Program results in--
    (1) An increase in the dollar value of subcontracts awarded to SDBs 
by mentor firms under DoD contracts;
    (2) An increase in the dollar value of contract and subcontract 
awards to protege firms (under DoD contracts, contracts awarded by other 
Federal agencies and under

[[Page 674]]

commercial contracts) since the date of their entry into the Program;
    (3) An increase in the number and dollar value of subcontracts 
awarded to a protege firm (or former protege firm) by its mentor firm 
(or former mentor firm);
    (4) An improvement in the participation of SDBs in DoD, other 
Federal agencies, and commercial contracting opportunities that can be 
attributed to the development of SDBs as protege firms under the 
Program;
    (5) An increase in subcontracting with SDB concerns in industry 
categories where SDBs have not traditionally participated within the 
mentor firm's vendor base;
    (6) The involvement of emerging SDBs in the Program;
    (7) An expanded relationship between mentor firms and protege firms 
to include non-DoD programs; and
    (8) The development of protege firms that are competitive as 
subcontractors and suppliers to DoD or in other Federal agencies or 
commercial markets.
    (d) This policy sets forth the procedures for participation in the 
Program applicable to companies that are interested in receiving--
    (1) A separate contract, cooperative agreement, or other agreement 
entered into between DoD and the mentor firm--company is interested in 
reimbursement through a separate contract, cooperative agreement or 
other agreement with DoD or, a combination of reimbursement through such 
agreement with DoD and credit against SDB subcontract goals for any 
unreimbursed costs incurred under the Program.
    (2) Program Manager funded reimbursement--company has identified a 
DoD program manager willing to fund the Program and the company is 
interested in reimbursement for technical assistance costs to a protege 
firm(s) through a separately priced cost reimbursement contract line 
item added to a DoD contract, with credit against SDB subcontracting 
goals for any unreimbursed costs.
    (3) Indirect reimbursement and credit--company is interested in 
receiving reimbursement for indirect costs incurred under the Program as 
well as credit against SDB subcontract goals for these indirect costs.
    (4) Credit only--company is interested in receiving credit only 
against SDB subcontracting goals for costs incurred under the Program.
I-101  Definitions.
I-101.1  Emerging SDB concern.
    A small disadvantaged business whose size is no greater than 50 
percent of the numerical size standard applicable to the standard 
industrial code for the supplies or services which the protege firm 
provides or would provide to the mentor firm.
I-101.2  Historically black college or university.
    An institution determined by the Secretary of Education to meet the 
requirements of 34 CFR 608.2. The term also means any nonprofit research 
institution that was an integral part of such a college or university 
before November 14, 1986.
I-101.3  Minority institution of higher education.
    An institution meeting the requirements of Section 1046(3) of the 
Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1135d-5(3). The term also 
includes Hispanic-serving institutions as defined in Section 316(b)(1) 
of such Act (20 U.S.C. 1059c(b)(1)).
I-102  General Procedures.
    (a) At any time between October 1, 1991, and September 30, 1998, 
companies interested in becoming mentor firms that want to take credit 
only for costs incurred for providing developmental assistance to one or 
more protege firms, or receive credit and reimbursement of indirect 
costs incurred under the Program, must apply to the DoD for 
participation in the Program pursuant to the application process set 
forth at I-106(a).
    (b) At any time between October 1, 1991, and September 30, 1998, 
companies interested in becoming mentor firms that are able to identify 
funding from a DoD contract program manager(s) to provide developmental 
assistance to one or more protege firms must apply to the DoD for 
participation in the Program, pursuant to the application process set 
forth at I-106(d).
    (c) Once funding is made available by DoD, companies that are 
interested in becoming mentor firms that want to receive reimbursement 
only or a combination of reimbursement and credit for providing 
developmental assistance to one or more protege firms by either a 
separate contract, cooperative agreement or other agreement awarded for 
that purpose, will be solicited for participation in the Program through 
a program solicitation. The Program solicitation will be issued by DoD 
and will contain, among other things, the statement of work and the 
evaluation factors upon which award will be based. Companies seeking 
reimbursement only, or a combination of reimbursement and credit, must 
respond to the solicitation and will be evaluated on the quality of the 
proposed developmental assistance program for each protege, in 
accordance with the evaluation factors contained in the solicitation. 
Awards will be made by DoD to approved mentor firms, to provide the 
proposed developmental assistance to one or more identified protege 
firms.
I-103  Program duration.
    Activities under the Program may only occur during the following 
periods:

    (3) Such costs are included in indirect expense pools.
    (c) From October 1, 1991, until September 30, 1999, mentor firms may 
receive credit toward the attainment of such firm's goals for 
subcontract awards to SDBs for unreimbursed costs incurred in providing 
developmental assistance to its protege firms, only if such costs are 
incurred pursuant to an approved mentor-protege agreement.
I-104  Eligibility requirements for a protege firm.
    (a) An entity may qualify as a protege firm if it is--
    (1) An SDB concern as defined by section 8(d)(3)(C) of the Small

    (3) A qualified organization employing the severely disabled as 
defined in Pub. L. 102-172, section 8064A.
    (b) A protege firm may self-certify to a mentor firm that it meets 
the eligibility requirements in paragraphs I-104(a)(1), (2), or (3). 
Mentor firms may rely in good faith on a written representation that the 
entity meets the requirements of paragraphs I-104(a) (1), (2), or (3).
    (c) A protege firm may have only one active mentor-protege 
agreement.
I-105  Selection of protege firms.
    (a) Mentor firms will be solely responsible for selecting protege 
firms. Mentor firms are encouraged to identify and select protege firms 
that are defined as emerging SDB concerns.
    (b) The selection of protege firms by mentor firms may not be 
protested, except as in I-105(c).
    (c) In the event of a protest regarding the size or disadvantaged 
status of an entity selected to be a protege firm as defined in either 
paragraph I-104(a)(1) or (2), the mentor firm shall refer the protest to 
the Small Business Administration (SBA) to resolve in accordance with 13 
CFR part 121 (with respect to size) or 13 CFR part 124 (with respect to 
disadvantaged status).
    (d) For purposes of the Small Business Act, no determination of 
affiliation or control (either direct or indirect) may be found between 
a protege firm and its mentor firm on the basis that the mentor firm has 
agreed to furnish (or has furnished) to its protege firm pursuant to a 
mentor-protege agreement any form of developmental assistance described 
in paragraph I-107(f).
    (e) If at any time pursuant to paragraph I-105(c), the protege firm 
is determined by the SBA not to be a small disadvantaged business 
concern, assistance furnished such business concern by the mentor firm 
after the date of the determination, may not be considered assistance 
furnished under the program.
I-106  Approval process for companies to participate in the Program as 
mentor firms.
    (a) On or after October 1, 1991, a company that is interested in 
becoming a mentor firm that is seeking credit only against SDB

reimbursement of developmental assistance costs via inclusion of program 
costs in indirect expense pools and credit for such costs, must submit a 
request to the DoD, DUSD(I&CP)SADBU to be approved as a mentor firm

made to all SDB firms under DoD contracts and other Federal agency 
contracts during the two preceding fiscal years (show DoD separately). 
If presently required to submit a SF 295, provide copies of the two 
preceding years end reports.
    (9) The number and total dollar amount of subcontract awards made to 
the identified protege firm(s) during the two preceding fiscal years (if

protege firm will negotiate a mentor-protege agreement. The letter of 
intent must be signed by both parties and contain the following

    (iv) A preliminary assessment of the developmental needs of the 
protege firm and the proposed developmental assistance the mentor firm 
envisions providing the protege firm to address those needs and enhance 
the protege firm's ability to perform successfully under contracts or 
subcontracts with DoD, other federal agencies and commercial contracts.
    (v) An estimate of the dollar amount and type of subcontracts that 
will be awarded by the mentor firm to the protege firm, and the period 
of time over which they will be awarded.

termination.
    (iv) The decision of the mentor firm regarding termination for 
cause, conforming with the requirements of this section, shall be final 
and is not reviewable by DoD.
    (8) Additional terms and conditions as may be agreed upon by both 
parties.
    (c) Mentor firms shall send a copy of any termination notices to the 
DoD, DUSD(I&CP)SADBU, and where funding is made available through a DoD 
program manager, also provide a copy to the program manager and to the 
appropriate PCO of ACO.
    (d) Termination of a mentor-protege agreement shall not impair the 
obligations of the mentor firm to perform pursuant to its contractual 
obligations under Government contracts and subcontracts. Termination of

Provision of progress payments by a mentor firm to a protege firm at a 
rate other than the customary rate for small disadvantaged businesses

be administered by the mentor firm in accordance with FAR subpart 32.4.
    (5) Loans.
    (6) Investment(s) in the protege firm in exchange for an ownership 
interest in the protege firm, not to exceed 10 percent of the total

    (g) A mentor firm may not require an SDB concern to enter into a

I-108  Reimbursement procedures.
    (a) A mentor firm may be reimbursed only for the cost of 
developmental assistance incurred by the mentor firm and provided to a 
protege firm under I-107(f) (1) and (7), and pursuant to an approved 
mentor-protege agreement. Reimbursement shall be made only through 
either a separate contract, cooperative agreement, or other agreement 
entered into between the DoD and the mentor firm awarded for the purpose 
of providing developmental assistance to one or more protege firms; a 
separately priced contract line item in a DoD contract; or inclusion of 
program costs in indirect expense pools. No other means for the 
reimbursement of the costs of developmental assistance provided under I-
107(f) (1) and (7) are authorized under the Program.
    (b) Costs reimbursed via inclusion in indirect expense pools may be 
reimbursed only to the extent that they are otherwise reasonable, 
allocable, and allowable.
    (c) Assistance provided in the form of progress payments in excess 
of the customary progress payment rate for SDBs, shall be reimbursed 
only if implemented in accordance with FAR 32.504(c).
    (d) Assistance provided in the form of advance payments shall be 
reimbursed only if they have been provided to a protege firm under 
subcontract terms and conditions similar to FAR 52.232-12. Reimbursement 
of any advance payments shall be made pursuant to the inclusion of DFARS 
252.232-7008, Reimbursement of Advance Payments--DoD Pilot Mentor-
Protege Program, in appropriate contracts. In requesting reimbursement, 
the mentor firm agrees that the risk of any financial loss due to the 
failure or inability of a protege firm to repay any unliquidated advance 
payments shall be the sole responsibility of the mentor firm.
    (e) No other forms of developmental assistance are authorized for 
reimbursement under the Program.
I-109  Credit for unreimbursed developmental assistance costs.
    (a) Developmental assistance costs incurred by a mentor firm for 
providing assistance to a protege firm pursuant to an approved mentor 
protege agreement, which have not been reimbursed through either a 
separate contract, cooperative agreement, or other agreement entered 
into between DoD and the mentor firm, or through a separately priced 
contract line item added to a DoD contract, may be credited as if it 
were a subcontract award for determining the performance of such mentor 
firm in attaining an SDB subcontracting goal(s) established under any 
contract containing a subcontracting plan pursuant to FAR 52.219-9.
    (b) For crediting purposes only, costs that have been reimbursed via 
inclusion in indirect expense pools may also be credited as subcontract 
awards for determining the performance of such mentor firm in attaining 
an SDB subcontracting goal(s) established

[[Page 679]]

under any contract containing a subcontracting plan pursuant to FAR 
52.219-9. However, costs that have not been reimbursed because they are 
not reasonable, allocable, or allowable under I-108(b), shall not be 
recognized for crediting purposes.
    (c) Other costs that are not eligible for reimbursement pursuant to 
I-108(a) may be recognized for credit only if requested, identified, and 
incorporated in an approved mentor-protege agreement. Such costs are not 
eligible for reimbursement.
    (d) The amount of credit a mentor firm may receive for any such 
unreimbursed developmental assistance costs shall be equal to--
    (1) Four times the total amount of such costs attributable to 
assistance provided by small business development centers (SBDC), 
historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), minority 
institutions (MI), and procurement technical assistance centers (PTAC).
    (2) Three times the total amount of such costs attributable to 
assistance furnished by the mentor's employees.
    (3) Two times the total amount of other such costs incurred by the 
mentor in carrying out the developmental assistance program.
    (e) A mentor firm may receive credit toward the attainment of an SDB 
subcontracting goal(s) for each subcontract awarded for a product or a 
service by the mentor firm to an entity that qualifies as a protege firm 
pursuant to I-104(a). With respect to a former SDB protege (firm(s), a 
mentor may take credit for awards to such concern(s) that, except for 
its size would be a small business concern owned and controlled by 
socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, but only if--
    (1) The size of such business concern is not more than two times the 
appropriate size standard;
    (2) The business concern formerly had a mentor-protege agreement 
with such mentor firm that was not terminated for cause; and
    (3) The credit is taken not later than October 1, 1999.
    (f) Amounts credited toward the SDB goal(s) for unreimbursed costs 
under the Program shall be separately identified from the amounts 
credited toward the goal resulting from the award of actual subcontracts 
to protege firms. The combination of the two shall equal the mentor 
firm's overall accomplishment toward the SDB goal(s).
    (g) Adjustments may be made to the amount of credit claimed under 
paragraphs I-109(a) and (b) if the DoD Director of Small and 
Disadvantaged Business Utilization determines that--
    (1) A mentor firm's performance in the attainment of its SDB 
subcontracting goals through actual subcontract awards declined from the 
prior fiscal year without justifiable cause.
    (2) Imposition of such a limitation on credit appears to be 
warranted to prevent abuse of this incentive for mentor firm's 
participation in the Program.
    (h) The mentor firm shall be afforded the opportunity to explain the 
decline in SDB participation before imposition of any such limitation on 
credit. In making the final decision to impose a limitation on credit, 
the DoD Director shall consider--
    (1) The mentor firm's overall SDB participation rates (in terms of 
percentages of subcontract awards and dollars awarded) as compared to 
the participation rates existing during the two fiscal years prior to 
the firm's admission to the Program;
    (2) The mentor firm's aggregate prime contract awards during the 
prior two fiscal years and the total amount of subcontract awards under 
such contracts; and
    (3) Such other information the mentor firm may wish to submit.
    (i) The decision of the Director regarding the imposition of a 
limitation on credit shall be final.
    (j) Any prospective limitation on credit imposed by the Director 
shall be expressed as a percentage of otherwise eligible credit and 
shall apply beginning on a specific date in the future and continue 
until a date certain during the current fiscal year.
    (k) Any retroactive limitation on credit imposed by the Director 
shall reflect the actual costs incurred for developmental assistance 
(not exceeding the maximum amount reimbursed).
    (l) For purposes of calculating any incentives to be paid to a 
mentor firm for exceeding an SDB subcontracting goal pursuant to 
252.219-7009, incentives shall be paid only if an SDB subcontracting 
goal has been exceeded as a result of actual subcontract awards to SDBs 
(excluding credit under paragraphs I-109 (a), (b) and (c)).
    (m) Developmental assistance costs that are incurred pursuant to an 
approved mentor-protege agreement, and have been charged to, but not 
reimbursed through a separate contract, cooperative agreement, or other 
agreement entered into between the DoD and the mentor firm, or through a 
separately priced contract line item added to a DoD contract, shall not 
be otherwise reimbursed, either as a direct or indirect cost, under any 
other DoD contract, irrespective of whether the costs have been 
recognized for credit against SDB subcontracting goals.
    (n) Developmental assistance provided under an approved mentor-
protege agreement is distinct from, and shall not duplicate, any effort 
that is the normal and expected product of the award and administration 
of the mentor firm's subcontract. Costs associated with the latter shall 
be accumulated and charged in accordance with the

[[Page 680]]

contractor's approved accounting practices; they are not considered 
developmental assistance costs eligible for either credit or 
reimbursement under the Program.
I-110  Advance agreements on the treatment of developmental assistance 
costs.
    Pursuant to FAR 31.109, approved mentor firms seeking reimbursement, 
credit, or a combination thereof, are strongly encouraged to enter into 
an advance agreement with the contracting officer responsible for 
determining final indirect cost rates under FAR 42.705. The purpose of 
the advance agreement is to establish the accounting treatment of the 
costs of the development assistance pursuant to the mentor-protege 
agreement prior to the incurring of any costs by the mentor firm. An 
advance agreement is an attempt by both the Government and the mentor 
firm to avoid possible subsequent dispute based on questions related to 
reasonableness, allocability, or allowability of the costs of 
developmental assistance under the Program. Absent an advance agreement, 
mentor firms are advised to establish the accounting treatment of such 
costs and address the need for any changes to their cost accounting 
practices that may result from the implementation of a mentor-protege 
agreement, prior to incurring any costs, and irrespective of whether 
costs will be reimbursed, credited or a combination thereof.
I-111  Reporting requirements and program reviews.
    (a) Mentor firms shall report on the progress made under active 
mentor-protege agreements semiannually by attaching to their SF 295--
    (1) A statement which includes--
    (i) The number of active mentor-protege agreements in effect; and
    (ii) The progress in achieving the developmental assistance 
objectives under each mentor-protege agreement, including whether the 
objectives of the Program set forth in I-100(c) were met, any problem 
areas encountered, and any other appropriate information.
    (2) A copy of the SF 294 for each contract where developmental 
assistance was credited, with a statement in Block 18 identifying--
    (i) The amount of dollars credited to the SDB subcontract goal as a 
result of developmental assistance provided to protege firms under the 
Program;
    (ii) An explanation as to the relationship between the developmental 
assistance provided the protege firm(s) under the Program and the 
activities under the contract covered by the SF 294(s); and
    (iii) The number and dollar value of subcontracts awarded to the 
protege firm(s), broken out per protege.
    (b) For commercial companies and companies participating in the DoD 
``Test Program for Negotiation of Comprehensive Small Business 
Subcontracting Plans,'' indicate in Block 16 of the SF 295--
    (1) The total dollars credited to the SDB goal as a result of 
developmental assistance provided to a protege firm(s) under the 
Program.
    (2) The total dollar amount of subcontracts awarded to the protege 
firm(s) broken our per protege.
    (c) The DUSD(I&CP)SADBU will conduct periodic performance reviews of 
the progress and accomplishments realized under approved mentor-protege 
agreements.
