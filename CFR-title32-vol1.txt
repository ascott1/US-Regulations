                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2005), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Sec.
2.1 Purpose.
2.2 Statutory relief for participating programs.
2.3 Regulatory relief for participating programs.
2.4 Designation of participating programs.
2.5 Criteria for designation of participating programs.

    Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2340 note.

    Source: 62 FR 17549, Apr. 10, 1997, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 2.1  Purpose.

    Section 809 of Public Law 101-510, ``National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 1991,'' as amended by section 811 of Public Law 102-
484, ``National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993'' and 
Public Law 103-160, ``National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
1994,'' authorizes the Secretary of Defense to conduct the Defense 
Acquisition Pilot Program. In accordance with section 809 of Public Law 
101-510, the Secretary may designate defense acquisition programs for 
participation in the Defense Acquisition Pilot Program.
    (a) The purpose of the pilot programs is to determine the potential 
for increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the acquisition 
process. Pilot programs shall be conducted in accordance with the 
standard commercial, industrial practices. As used in this policy, the 
term ``standard commercial, industrial practice'' refers to any 
acquisition management practice, process, or procedure that is used by 
commercial companies to produce and sell goods and services in the 
commercial marketplace. This definition purposely implies a broad range 
of potential activities to adopt commercial practices, including 
regulatory and statutory streamlining, to eliminate unique Government 
requirements and practices such as government-unique contracting 
policies and practices, government-unique specifications and standards, 
and reliance on cost determination rather than price analysis.
    (b) Standard commercial, industrial practices include, but are not 
limited to:
    (1) Innovative contracting policies and practices;
    (2) Performance and commercial specifications and standards;
    (3) Innovative budget policies;
    (4) Establishing fair and reasonable prices without cost data;
    (5) Maintenance of long-term relationships with quality suppliers;
    (6) Acquisition of commercial and non-developmental items (including 
components); and
    (7) Other best commercial practices.


<R05>
Sec. 2.2  Statutory relief for participating programs.

    (a) Within the limitations prescribed, the applicability of any 
provision of law or any regulation prescribed to implement a statutory 
requirement may be waived for all programs participating in the Defense 
Acquisition Pilot Program, or separately for each participating program, 
if that waiver or limit is specifically authorized to be waived or 
limited in a law authorizing appropriations for a program designated by 
statute as a participant in the Defense Acquisition Pilot Program.
    (b) Only those laws that prescribe procedures for the procurement of 
supplies or services; a preference or requirement for acquisition from 
any source or class of sources; any requirement related to contractor 
performance; any cost allowability, cost accounting, or auditing 
requirements; or any requirement for the management of, testing to be 
performed under, evaluation of, or reporting on a defense acquisition 
program may be waived.
    (c) The requirements in section 809 of Public Law 101-510, as 
amended by section 811 of Public Law 102-484, the requirements in any 
law enacted on or after the enactment of Public Law 101-510 (except to 
the extent that a waiver or limitation is specifically authorized for 
such a defense acquisition program by statute), and any provision of law 
that ensures the financial integrity of

[[Page 12]]

the conduct of a Federal Government program or that relates to the 
authority of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense may not 
be considered for waiver.


<R05>
Sec. 2.3  Regulatory relief for participating programs.

    (a) A program participating in the Defense Acquisition Pilot Program 
will not be subject to any regulation, policy, directive, or 
administrative rule or guideline relating to the acquisition activities 
of the Department of Defense other than the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) \1\, the Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) \2\, or those 
regulatory requirements added by the Under Secretary of Defense for 
Acquisition and Technology, the Head of the Component, or the DoD 
Component Acquisition Executive.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Copies of this Department of Defense publication may be obtained 
from the Government Printing Office, Superintendent of Documents, 
Washington, DC 20402.
    \2\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 2.3(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Provisions of the FAR and/or DFARS that do not implement 
statutory requirements may be waived by the Under Secretary of Defense 
for Acquisition and Technology using appropriate administrative 
procedures. Provisions of the FAR and DFARS that implement statutory 
requirements may be waived or limited in accordance with the procedures 
for statutory relief previously mentioned.
    (c) Regulatory relief includes relief from use of government-unique 
specifications and standards. Since a major objective of the Defense 
Acquisition Pilot Program is to promote standard, commercial industrial 
practices, functional performance and commercial specifications and 
standards will be used to the maximum extent practical. Federal or 
military specifications and standards may be used only when no practical 
alternative exists that meet the user's needs. Defense acquisition 
officials (other than the Program Manager or Commodity Manager) may only 
require the use of military specifications and standards with advance 
approval from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and 
Technology, the Head of the DoD Component, or the DoD Component 
Acquisition Executive.


<R05>
Sec. 2.4  Designation of participating programs.

    (a) Pilot programs may be nominated by a DoD Component Head or 
Component Acquisition Executive for participation in the Defense 
Acquisition Pilot Program. The Under Secretary of Defense for 
Acquisition and Technology shall determine which specific programs will 
participate in the pilot program and will transmit to the Congressional 
defense committees a written notification of each defense acquisition 
program proposed for participation in the pilot program. Programs 
proposed for participation must be specifically designated as 
participants in the Defense Acquisition Pilot Program in a law 
authorizing appropriations for such programs and provisions of law to be 
waived must be specifically authorized for waiver.
    (b) Once included in the Defense Acquisition Pilot Program, decision 
and approval authority for the participating program shall be delegated 
to the lowest level allowed in the acquisition regulations consistent 
with the total cost of the program (e.g., under DoD Directive 5000.1, 
\3\ an acquisition program that is a major defense acquisition program 
would be delegated to the appropriate Component Acquisition Executive as 
an acquisition category IC program)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Copies may be obtained, at cost, from the National Technical 
Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) At the time of nomination approval, the Under Secretary of 
Defense for Acquisition and Technology will establish measures to judge 
the success of a specific program, and will also establish a means of 
reporting progress towards the measures.


<R05>
Sec. 2.5  Criteria for designation of participating programs.

    (a) Candidate programs must have an approved requirement, full 
program funding assured prior to designation, and low risk. Nomination 
of a candidate program to participate in the Defense Acquisition Pilot 
Program should occur as early in the program's life-cycle as possible. 
Developmental programs will only be considered on an exception basis.

[[Page 13]]

    (b) Programs in which commercial or non-developmental items can 
satisfy the military requirement are preferred as candidate programs. A 
nominated program will address which standard commercial, industrial 
practices will be used in the pilot program and how those practices will 
be applied.
    (c) Nomination of candidate programs must be accompanied by a list 
of waivers being requested to Statutes, FAR, DFARS, DoD Directives \4\ 
and Instructions,\5\ and where applicable, DoD Component regulations. 
Waivers being requested must be accompanied by rationale and 
justification for the waiver. The justification must include:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See footnote 3 to Sec. 2.4(b).
    \5\ See footnote 3 to Sec. 2.4(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) The provision of law proposed to be waived or limited.
    (2) The effects of the provision of law on the acquisition, 
including specific examples.
    (3) The actions taken to ensure that the waiver or limitation will 
not reduce the efficiency, integrity, and effectiveness of the 
acquisition process used for the defense acquisition program; and
    (4) A discussion of the efficiencies or savings, if any, that will 
result from the waiver or limitation.
    (d) No nominated program shall be accepted until the Under Secretary 
of Defense has determined that the candidate program is properly 
planned.

<R05>
Sec. 3.1  Purpose.

    This part consolidates rules that implement section 845 of the 
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, Public Law 103-
160, 107 Stat. 1547, as amended, and have a significant impact on the 
public. Section 845 authorizes the Secretary of a Military Department, 
the Director of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and any other 
official designated by the Secretary of Defense, to enter into 
transactions other than contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements in 
certain situations for prototype projects that are directly relevant to 
weapons or weapon systems proposed to be acquired or developed by the 
Department of Defense.

[67 FR 54956, Aug. 27, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 3.2  Background.

    ``Other transactions'' is the term commonly used to refer to the 10 
U.S.C. 2371 authority to enter into transactions other than contracts, 
grants or cooperative agreements. ``Other transactions'' are generally 
not subject to the Federal laws and regulations limited in applicability 
to contracts, grants or cooperative agreements. As such, they are not 
required to comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and its 
supplements (48 CFR).

[67 FR 54956, Aug. 27, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 3.3  Applicability.

    This part applies to the Secretary of a Military Department, the 
Directors of the Defense Agencies, and any other official designated by 
the Secretary of Defense to enter into transactions other than 
contracts, grants or cooperative agreements for prototype projects that 
are directly relevant to weapons or weapon systems proposed to be 
acquired or developed by the Department of Defense, under authority of 
10 U.S.C. 2371. Such transactions are commonly referred to as ``other 
transaction'' agreements and are hereafter referred to as agreements.

[68 FR 27457, May 20, 2003, as amended at 69 FR 16482, Mar. 30, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 3.5  Appropriate use.

    (a) At least one nontraditional Defense contractor is participating 
to a significant extent in the prototype project; or
    (b) No nontraditional Defense contractor is participating to a 
significant extent in the prototype project, but at least one of the

[67 FR 54956, Aug. 27, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 3.6  Limitations on cost-sharing.

subawardee participating in the performance of the OT agreement may not 
include costs that were incurred before the date on which the OT 
agreement becomes effective. Costs that were incurred for a prototype 
project by the business units of an awardee or subawardee after the 
beginning of negotiations, but prior to the date the OT agreement 
becomes effective, may be counted as non-Federal amounts if and to the 
extent that the Agreements Officer determines in writing that:
    (1) The awardee or subawardee incurred the costs in anticipation of 
entering into the OT agreement; and
    (2) It was appropriate for the awardee or subawardee to incur the 
costs before the OT agreement became effective in order to ensure the 
successful implementation of the OT agreement.
    (b) As a matter of policy, these limitations on cost-sharing apply 
any time cost-sharing may be recognized when using OT authority for 
prototype projects.

[67 FR 54956, Aug. 27, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 3.7  Comptroller General access.

    (a) A clause must be included in solicitations and agreements for 
prototype projects awarded under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371, that 
provide for total government payments in excess of $5,000,000 to allow 
Comptroller General access to records that directly pertain to such 
agreements.
    (b) The clause referenced in paragraph (a) of this section will not 
apply with respect to a party or entity, or subordinate element of a 
party or entity, that has not entered into any other contract, grant, 
cooperative agreement or ``other transaction'' agreement that provides 
for audit access by a government entity in the year prior to the date of 
the agreement. The clause must be included in all agreements described 
in paragraph (a) of this section in order to fully implement the law by 
covering those participating entities and their subordinate elements 
which have entered into prior agreements providing for Government audit 
access, and are therefore not exempt. The presence of the clause in an 
agreement will not operate to require Comptroller General access to 
records from any party or participating entity, or subordinate element 
of a party or participating entity, or subordinate element of a party or 
participating entity, which is otherwise exempt under the terms of the 
clause and the law.
    (c)(1) The right provided to the Comptroller General in a clause of 
an agreement under paragraph (a) of this part, is limited as provided by 
subparagraph (c)(2) of this part in the case of a party to the 
agreement, an entity that participates in the performance of the 
agreement, or a subordinate element of

[[Page 16]]

that party or entity, if the only cooperative agreements or ``other 
transactions'' that the party, entity, or subordinate element entered 
into with government entities in the year prior to the date of that 
agreement are cooperative agreements or transactions that were entered 
into under 10 U.S.C. 2371 or Section 845 of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Pub. L. 103-160; 10 U.S.C. 2371 
note).
    (c)(2) The only records of a party, other entity, or subordinate 
element referred to in subparagraph (c)(1) of this part that the 
Comptroller General may examine in the exercise of the right referred to 
in that subparagraph, are records of the same type as the records that 
the government has had the right to examine under the audit access 
clauses of the previous cooperative agreements or transactions referred 
to in such subparagraph that were entered into by that particular party, 
entity, or subordinate element.
    (d) The head of the contracting activity (HCA) that is carrying out 
the agreement may waive the applicability of the Comptroller General 
access requirement if the HCA determines it would not be in the public 
interest to apply the requirement to the agreement. The waiver will be 
effective with respect to the agreement only if the HCA transmits a 
notification of the waiver to the Committees on Armed Services of the 
Senate and the House of Representatives, the Comptroller General, and 
the Director, Defense Procurement before entering into the agreement. 
The notification must include the rationale for the determination.
    (e) The HCA must notify the Director, Defense Procurement of 
situations where there is evidence that the Comptroller General Access 
requirement caused companies to refuse to participate or otherwise 
restricted the Department's access to companies that typically do not do 
business with the Department.
    (f) In no case will the requirement to examine records under the 
clause referenced in paragraph (a) of this section apply to an agreement 
where more than three years have passed after final payment is made by 
the government under such an agreement.
    (g) The clause referenced in paragraph (a) of this section, must 
provide for the following:
    (1) The Comptroller General of the United States, in the discretion 
of the Comptroller General, shall have access to and the right to 
examine records of any party to the agreement or any entity that 
participates in the performance of this agreement that directly pertain 
to, and involve transactions relating to, the agreement.
    (2) Excepted from the Comptroller General access requirement is any 
party to this agreement or any entity that participates in the 
performance of the agreement, or any subordinate element of such party 
or entity, that, in the year prior to the date of the agreement, has not 
entered into any other contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or 
``other transaction'' agreement that provides for audit access to its 
records by a government entity.
    (3)(A) The right provided to the Comptroller General is limited as 
provided in subparagraph (B) in the case of a party to the agreement, 
any entity that participates in the performance of the agreement, or a 
subordinate element of that party or entity if the only cooperative 
agreements or ``other transactions'' that the party, entity, or 
subordinate element entered into with government entities in the year 
prior to the date of that agreement are cooperative agreements or 
transactions that were entered into under 10 U.S.C. 2371 or Section 845 
of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Pub. L. 
103-160; 10 U.S.C. 2371 note).
    (B) The only records of a party, other entity, or subordinate 
element referred to in subparagraph (A) that the Comptroller General may 
examine in the exercise of the right referred to in that subparagraph 
are records of the same type as the records that the government has had 
the right to examine under the audit access clauses of the previous 
agreements or transactions referred to in such subparagraph that were 
entered into by that particular party, entity, or subordinate element.
    (4) This clause shall not be construed to require any party or 
entity, or any

[[Page 17]]

subordinate element of such party or entity, that participates in the 
performance of the agreement, to create or maintain any record that is 
not otherwise maintained in the ordinary course of business or pursuant 
to a provision of law.
    (5) The Comptroller General shall have access to the records 
described in this clause until three years after the date the final 
payment is made by the United States under this agreement.
    (6) The recipient of the agreement shall flow down this provision to 
any entity that participates in the performance of the agreement.

Sec. 3.8  DoD access to records policy.

    (a) Applicability. This section provides policy concerning DoD 
access to awardee and subawardee records on OT agreements for prototype 
projects. This access is separate and distinct from Comptroller General 
access.
    (1) Fixed-price type OT agreements. (i) General--DoD access to 
records is not generally required for fixed-price type OT agreements. In 
order for an agreement to be considered a fixed-price type OT agreement, 
it must adequately specify the effort to be accomplished for a fixed 
amount and provide for defined payable milestones, with no provision for 
financial or cost reporting that would be a basis for making adjustment 
in either the work scope or price of the effort.
    (ii) Termination considerations. The need to provide for DoD access 
to records in the case of termination of a fixed-price type OT can be 
avoided by limiting potential termination settlements to an amount 
specified in the original agreement or to payment for the last completed 
milestone. However, if a fixed-price agreement provides that potential 
termination settlement amounts may be based on amounts generated from 
cost or financial records and the agreement exceeds the specified 
threshold, the OT should provide that DoD will have access to records in 
the event of termination.
    (2) Cost-type OT agreements. (i) Single Audit Act--In accordance 
with the requirements of Public Law 98-502, as amended by Public Law 
104-156, 110 STAT. 1396-1404, when a business unit that will perform the 
OT agreement, or a subawardee, meets the criteria for an audit pursuant 
to the Single Audit Act, the DoD must have sufficient access to the 
entity's records to assure compliance with the provisions of the Act.
    (ii) Traditional Defense contractors. The DoD shall have access to 
records on cost-type OT agreements with traditional Defense contractors 
that provide for total Government payments in excess of $5,000,000. The 
content of the access to records clause shall be in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of this section. The value establishing the threshold is 
the total value of the agreement including all options.
    (iii) Nontraditional Defense contractors. The DoD should have access 
to records on cost-type OT agreements with nontraditional Defense 
contractors that provide for total Government payments in excess of 
$5,000,000. The content of the access to records clause should be in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The value establishing 
the threshold is the total value of the agreement including all options.
    (iv) DoD access below threshold. The Agreements Officer has the 
discretion to determine whether to include DoD access to records when 
the OT does not meet any of the requirements in (a)(2)(i) through 
(a)(2)(iii) of this section. The content of that access to records 
clause should be tailored to meet the particular circumstances of the 
agreement.
    (v) Examples of cost-type OT agreements. (A) An agreement that 
requires at least one-third cost share pursuant to statute.
    (B) An agreement that includes payable milestones, but provides for 
adjustment of the milestone amounts based on actual costs or reports 
generated from the awardee's financial or cost records.
    (C) An agreement that is for a fixed-Government amount, but the 
agreement provides for submittal of financial or cost records/reports to 
determine whether additional effort can be accomplished for the fixed 
amount.
    (3) Subawardees. When a DoD access to records provision is included 
in the OT agreement, the awardee shall use the criteria established in 
paragraphs

[[Page 18]]

(a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(iii) of this section to determine whether DoD 
access to records clauses should be included in subawards.
    (b) Exceptions. (1) Nontraditional Defense contractors--(i) The 
Agreements Officers may deviate, in part or in whole, from the 
application of this access to records policy for a nontraditional 
Defense contractor when application of the policy would adversely impact 
the government's ability to incorporate commercial technology or execute 
the prototype project.
    (ii) The Agreements Officer will document:
    (A) What aspect of the audit policy was not applied;
    (B) Why it was problematic;
    (C) What means will be used to protect the Government's interest; 
and
    (D) Why the benefits of deviating from the policy outweigh the 
potential risks.
    (iii) This determination will be reviewed by the approving official 
as part of the pre-award approval of the agreement and submitted to the 
agency POC within 10 days of award.
    (iv) The agency POC will forward all such documentation received in 
any given fiscal year, to the Director, Defense Procurement by 15 
October of each year.
    (2) Traditional Defense contractor. (i) Any departure from this 
policy for other than nontraditional Defense contractors must be 
approved by the Head of the Contracting Activity prior to award and set 
forth the exceptional circumstances justifying deviation.
    (ii) Additionally, the justification will document:
    (A) What aspect of the policy was not applied;
    (B) Why it was problematic;
    (C) What means will be used to protect the Government's interest; 
and
    (D) Why the benefits of deviating from the policy outweigh the 
potential risks.
    (iii) The HCA will forward documentation associated with such 
waivers in any given fiscal year, to the Director, Defense Procurement 
by 15 October of each year.
    (3) DoD access below the threshold. When the Agreements Officer 
determines that access to records is appropriate for an agreement below 
the $5,000,000 threshold, the content, length and extent of access may 
be mutually agreed to by the parties, without documenting reasons for 
departing from the policy of this section.
    (4) Flow down provisions. The awardee shall submit justification for 
any exception to the DoD access to records policy to the Agreements 
Officer for subawardees. The Agreements Officer will review and obtain 
appropriate approval, as set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of 
this section.
    (c) Content of DoD access to records clause. When a DoD access to 
records clause is included as part of the OT agreement, address the 
following areas during the negotiation of the clause:
    (1) Frequency of audits. Audits will be performed when the 
Agreements Officer determines it is necessary to verify statutory cost 
share or to verify amounts generated from financial or cost records that 
will be used as the basis for payment or adjustment of payment.
    (2) Means of accomplishing audits. (i) Business units subject to the 
Single Audit Act--When the awardee or subawardee is a state government, 
local government, or nonprofit organization whose Federal cost 
reimbursement contracts and financial assistance agreements are subject 
to the Single Audit Act (Public Law 98-502, as amended by Public Law 
104-156, 110 STAT. 1396-1404), the clause must apply the provisions of 
that Act for purposes of performing audits of the awardee or subawardee 
under the agreement.
    (ii) Business units not subject to the Single Audit Act currently 
performing on procurement contracts. The clause must provide that DCAA 
will perform any necessary audits if, at the time of agreement award, 
the awardee or subawardee is not subject to the Single Audit Act and is 
performing a procurement contract that is subject to the Cost Principles 
Applicable to Commercial Organizations (48 CFR part 31.2) and/or the 
Cost Accounting Standards (48 CFR part 99).
    (iii) Other business units. DCAA or a qualified IPA may perform any 
necessary audit of a business unit of the awardee or subawardee if, at 
the time of agreement award, the business unit

[[Page 19]]

does not meet the criteria in (c)(2)(i) or (c)(2)(ii) of this section. 
The clause must provide for the use of a qualified IPA if such a 
business unit will not accept the agreement if the Government has access 
to the business unit's records. The Agreements Officer will include a 
statement in the file that the business unit is not performing on a 
procurement contract subject to the Cost Principles or Cost Accounting 
Standards at the time of agreement award, and will not accept the 
agreement if the government has access to the business unit's records. 
The Agreements Officer will also prepare a report (Part III to the 
annual report submission) for the Director, Defense Procurement that 
identifies, for each business unit that is permitted to use an IPA: the 
business unit's name, address and the expected value of its award. When 
the clause provides for use of an IPA to perform any necessary audits, 
the clause must state that:
    (A) The IPA will perform the audit in accordance with Generally 
Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS). Electronic copies of the 
standards may be accessed at www.gao.gov. Printed copies may be 
purchased from the U.S. Government Printing Office (for ordering 
information, call (202) 512-1800 or access the Internet Site at 
www.gpo.gov).
    (B) The Agreements Officers' authorized representative has the right 
to examine the IPA's audit report and working papers for 3 years after 
final payment or three years after issuance of the audit report, 
whichever is later, unless notified otherwise by the Agreements Officer.
    (C) The IPA will send copies of the audit report to the Agreements 
Officer and the Assistant Inspector General (Audit Policy and Oversight) 
[AIG(APO)], 400 Army Navy Drive, Suite 737, Arlington, VA 22202.
    (D) The IPA will report instances of suspected fraud directly to the 
DoDIG.
    (E) The Government has the right to require corrective action by the 
awardee or subawardee if the Agreements Officer determines (subject to 
appeal under the disputes clause of the agreement) that the audit has 
not been performed or has not been performed in accordance with GAGAS. 
The Agreements Officer should take action promptly once the Agreements 
Officer determines that the audit is not being accomplished in a timely 
manner or the audit is not performed in accordance with GAGAS but 
generally no later than twelve (12) months of the date requested by the 
Agreements Officer. The awardee or subawardee may take corrective action 
by having the IPA correct any deficiencies identified by the Agreements 
Officer, having another IPA perform the audit, or electing to have the 
Government perform the audit. If corrective action is not taken, the 
Agreements Officer has the right to take one or more of the following 
actions:
    (1) Withhold or disallow a specified percentage of costs until the 
audit is completed satisfactorily. The agreement should include a 
specified percentage that is sufficient to enhance performance of 
corrective action while also not being unfairly punitive.
    (2) Suspend performance until the audit is completed satisfactorily; 
and/or
    (3) Terminate the agreement if the agreements officer determines 
that imposition of either (c)(2)(iii)(E)(1) or (c)(2)(iii)(e)(2) of this 
section is not practical.
    (F) If it is found that the awardee or subawardee was performing a 
procurement contract subject to Cost Principles Applicable to Commercial 
Organizations (48 CFR part 31.2) and/or Cost Accounting Standards (48 
CFR part 99) at the time of agreement award, the Agreements Officer, or 
an authorized representative, has the right to audit records of the 
awardee or subawardee to verify the actual costs or reporting 
information used as the basis for payment or to verify statutorily 
required cost share under the agreement, and the IPA is to be paid by 
the awardee or subawardee. The cost of an audit performed in accordance 
with this policy is reimbursable based on the business unit's 
established accounting practices and subject to any limitations in the 
agreement.
    (3) Scope of audit. The Agreements Officer should coordinate with 
the auditor regarding the nature of any audit envisioned.

[[Page 20]]

    (4) Length and extent of access. (i) Clauses that do not provide for 
use of an IPA--The clause must provide for the Agreements Officer's 
authorized representative to have access to directly pertinent records 
of those business units of the awardee or subawardee's performing effort 
under the OT agreement, when needed to verify the actual costs or 
reporting used as the basis for payment or to verify statutorily 
required cost share under the agreement.
    (ii) Clauses that provide for use of an IPA to perform the audits. 
The clause must:
    (A) Provide the Agreements Officer's authorized representative 
access to the IPA's audit reports and working papers to ensure that the 
IPA has performed the audit in accordance with GAGAS.
    (B) State that the Government will make copies of contractor records 
contained in the IPA's work papers if needed to demonstrate that the 
audit was not performed in accordance with GAGAS.
    (C) State that the Government has no direct access to any awardee or 
subawardee records unless it is found that the awardee or subawardee was 
performing a procurement contract subject to Cost Principles (48 CFR 
part 31) and/or Cost Accounting Standards (48 CFR part 99) at the time 
of agreement award.
    (iii) Business Units subject to the Single Audit Act. The clause 
must provide access to the extent authorized by the Single Audit Act.
    (iv) Record Retention/Period of Access. The clause must require that 
the awardee and subawardee retain, and provide access to, the records 
referred to in (c)(4)(i) and (c)(4)(ii) of this section for three years 
after final payment, unless notified of a shorter or longer period by 
the Agreements Officer.
    (5) Awardee flow down responsibilities. Agreements must require 
awardees to include the necessary provisions in subawards that meet the 
conditions set forth in this DoD access to records policy.
    (d) DoDIG and GAO access. In accordance with statute, if an 
agreement gives the Agreements Officer or another DoD component official 
access to a business unit's records, the DoDIG or GAO are granted the 
same access to those records.

Sec. 3.9  Follow-on production contracts.

    (a) Authority. A competitively awarded OT agreement for a prototype 
project that satisfies the condition set forth in law that requires non-
Federal parties to the OT agreement to provide at least one-third of the 
costs of the prototype project may provide for the award of a follow-on 
production contract to the awardee of the OT prototype agreement for a 
specific number of units at specific target prices, without further 
competition.
    (b) Conditions. The Agreements Officer must do the following in the 
award of the prototype project:
    (1) Ensure non-Federal parties to the OT prototype agreement offer 
at least one-third of the costs of the prototype project pursuant to 
subsection (d)(1)(B)(i), 10 U.S.C. 2371 note.
    (2) Use competition to select parties for participation in the OT 
prototype agreement and evaluate the proposed quantity and target prices 
for the follow-on production units as part of that competition.
    (3) Determine the production quantity that may be procured without 
further competition, by balancing of the level of the investment made in 
the project by the non-Federal parties with the interest of the Federal 
Government in having competition among sources in the acquisition of the 
product or products prototyped under the project.
    (4) Specify the production quantity and target prices in the OT 
prototype agreement and stipualte in the agreement that the Contracting 
Officer for the follow-on contract may award a production contract 
without further competition if the awardee successfully completes the 
prototype project and agrees to production quantities and prices that do 
not exceed those specified in the OT prototype agreement (see part 
206.001 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement).
    (c) Limitation. As a matter of policy, establishing target prices 
for production units should only be considered when the risk of the 
prototype project permits realistic production pricing

[[Page 21]]

without placing undue risks on the awardee.
    (d) Documentation. (1) The Agreements Officer will need to provide 
information to the Contracting Officer from the agreement and award file 
that the conditions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section have been 
satisfied.
    (2) The information shall contain, at a minimum:
    (i) The competitive procedures used;
    (ii) How the production quantities and target prices were evaluated 
in the competition;
    (iii) The percentage of cost-share; and
    (iv) The production quantities and target prices set forth in the OT 
agreement.
    (3) The Project Manager will provide evidence of successful 
completion of the prototype project to the Contracting Officer.

Sec. 9.1  Purpose.

    This part implements policy, assigns responsibilities, and 
prescribes procedures under the United States Constitution, Article II, 
section 2 and Military Order of November 13, 2001, ``Detention, 
Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against 
Terrorism'' (3 CFR, 2001 comp., p. 918, 66 FR 57833), for trials before 
military commissions of individuals subject to the President's Military 
Order. These procedures shall be implemented and construed so as to 
ensure that any such individual receives a full and fair trial before a 
military commission, as required by the President's Military Order. 
Unless otherwise directed by the Secretary of Defense, and except for 
supplemental procedures established pursuant to the President's Military 
Order or this part, the procedures prescribed herein and no others shall 
govern such trials.


<R05>
Sec. 9.2  Establishment of Military Commissions.

    In accordance with the President's Military Order, the Secretary of 
Defense or a designee (``Appointing Authority'') may issue orders from 
time to time appointing one or more military commissions to try 
individuals subject to the President's Military Order and appointing any 
other personnel necessary to facilitate such trials.


<R05>
Sec. 9.3  Jurisdiction.

    (a) Over persons. A military commission appointed under this part 
(``Commission'') shall have jurisdiction over only an individual or 
individuals (``the Accused''):
    (1) Subject to the President's Military Order; and
    (2) Alleged to have committed an offense in a charge that has been 
referred to the Commission by the Appointing Authority.
    (b) Over offenses. Commissions established hereunder shall have 
jurisdiction over violations of the laws of war and all other offenses 
triable by military commission.
    (c) Maintaining integrity of commission proceedings. The Commission 
may exercise jurisdiction over participants in its proceedings as 
necessary to preserve the integrity and order of the proceedings.


<R05>
Sec. 9.4  Commission personnel.

    (a) Members--(1) Appointment. The Appointing Authority shall appoint 
the members and the alternate member or members of each Commission. The 
alternate member or members shall attend all sessions of the Commission, 
but the absence of an alternate member shall not preclude the Commission 
from conducting proceedings. In case of incapacity, resignation, or 
removal of any member, an alternate member shall take the place of that 
member. Any vacancy among the members or alternate members occurring 
after a trial has begun may be filled by the Appointing Authority, but 
the substance of all prior proceedings and evidence taken in that case 
shall be made known to that new member or alternate member before the 
trial proceeds.
    (2) Number of members. Each Commission shall consist of at least 
three but

[[Page 23]]

no more than seven members, the number being determined by the 
Appointing Authority. For each such Commission, there shall also be one 
or two alternate members, the number being determined by the Appointing 
Authority.
    (3) Qualifications. Each member and alternate member shall be a 
commissioned officer of the United States armed forces (``Military 
Officer''), including without limitation reserve personnel on active 
duty, National Guard personnel on active duty in Federal service, and 
retired personnel recalled to active duty. The Appointing Authority 
shall appoint members and alternate members determined to be competent 
to perform the duties involved. The Appointing Authority may remove 
members and alternate members for good cause.
    (4) Presiding Officer. From among the members of each Commission, 
the Appointing Authority shall designate a Presiding Officer to preside 
over the proceedings of that Commission. The Presiding Officer shall be 
a Military Officer who is a judge advocate of any United States armed 
force.
    (5) Duties of the Presiding Officer. (i) The Presiding Officer shall 
admit or exclude evidence at trial in accordance with section 6(d) of 
this part. The Presiding Officer shall have authority to close 
proceedings or portions of proceedings in accordance with Sec. 9.6(b)(3) 
of this part and for any other reason necessary for the conduct of a 
full and fair trial.
    (ii) The Presiding Officer shall ensure that the discipline, 
dignity, and decorum of the proceedings are maintained, shall exercise 
control over the proceedings to ensure proper implementation of the 
President's Military Order and this part, and shall have authority to 
act upon any contempt or breach of Commission rules and procedures. Any 
attorney authorized to appear before a Commission who is thereafter 
found not to satisfy the requirements for eligibility or who fails to 
comply with laws, rules, regulations, or other orders applicable to the 
Commission proceedings or any other individual who violates such laws, 
rules, regulations, or orders may be disciplined as the Presiding 
Officer deems appropriate, including but not limited to revocation of 
eligibility to appear before that Commission. The Appointing Authority 
may further revoke that attorney's or any other person's eligibility to 
appear before any other Commission convened under this part.
    (iii) The Presiding Officer shall ensure the expeditious conduct of 
the trial. In no circumstance shall accommodation of counsel be allowed 
to delay proceedings unreasonably.
    (iv) The Presiding Officer shall certify all interlocutory 
questions, the disposition of which would effect a termination of 
proceedings with respect to a charge, for decision by the Appointing 
Authority. The Presiding Officer may certify other interlocutory 
questions to the Appointing Authority as the Presiding Officer deems 
appropriate.
    (b) Prosecution--(1) Office of the Chief Prosecutor. The Chief 
Prosecutor shall be a judge advocate of any United States armed force,

Military Order, and shall ensure proper management of personnel and 
resources.
    (2) Prosecutors and Assistant Prosecutors. (i) Consistent with any 
supplementary regulations or instructions issued under Sec. 9.7(a), the 
Chief Prosecutor shall detail a Prosecutor and, as appropriate, one or 
more Assistant Prosecutors to prepare charges and conduct the 
prosecution for each case before a Commission (``Prosecution''). 
Prosecutors and Assistant Prosecutors shall be:
    (A) Military Officers who are judge advocates of any United States 
armed force, or
    (B) Special trial counsel of the Department of Justice who may be

process.
    (c) Defense--(1) Office of the Chief Defense Counsel. The Chief 
Defense Counsel shall be a judge advocate of any

[[Page 24]]

United States armed force, shall supervise the overall defense efforts 
under the President's Military Order, shall ensure proper management of 
personnel and resources, shall preclude conflicts of interest, and shall 
facilitate proper representation of all Accused.
    (2) Detailed Defense Counsel. Consistent with any supplementary 
regulations or instructions issued under Sec. 9.7(a), the Chief Defense 
Counsel shall detail one or more Military Officers who are judge 
advocates of any United States armed force to conduct the defense for 
each case before a Commission (``Detailed Defense Counsel''). The duties

Officer who is a judge advocate of any United States armed force to 
replace the Accused's Detailed Defense Counsel, provided that Military 
Officer has been determined to be available in accordance with any 
applicable supplementary regulations or instructions issued under Sec. 
9.7(a). After such selection of a new Detailed Defense Counsel, the 
original Detailed Defense Counsel will be relieved of all duties with 
respect to that case. If requested by the Accused, however, the 
Appointing Authority may allow the original Detailed Defense Counsel to 
continue to assist in representation of the Accused as another Detailed 
Defense Counsel.
    (B) The Accused may also retain the services of a civilian attorney 
of the Accused's own choosing and at no expense to the United States 
Government (``Civilian Defense Counsel''), provided that attorney:
    (1) Is a United States citizen;
    (2) Is admitted to the practice of law in a State, district, 
territory, or possession of the United States, or before a Federal 
court;
    (3) Has not been the subject of any sanction or disciplinary action 
by any court, bar, or other competent governmental authority for 
relevant misconduct;
    (4) Has been determined to be eligible for access to information 
classified at the level SECRET or higher under the authority of and in 
accordance with the procedures prescribed in DoD 5200.2-R \1\; and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Available from www.ditc.mil/whs/directives.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (5) Has signed a written agreement to comply with all applicable 
regulations or instructions for counsel, including any rules of court 
for conduct during the course of proceedings. Civilian attorneys may be 
pre-qualified as members of the pool of available attorneys if, at the 
time of application, they meet the relevant criteria, or they may be 
qualified on an ad hoc basis after being requested by an Accused. 
Representation by Civilian Defense Counsel will not relieve Detailed 
Defense Counsel of the duties specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section. The qualification of a Civilian Defense Counsel does not 
guarantee that person's presence at closed Commission proceedings or 
that person's access to any information protected under Sec. 9.6(d)(5).
    (4) Continuity of representation. The Accused must be represented at 
all relevant times by Detailed Defense Counsel. Detailed Defense Counsel 
and Civilian Defense Counsel shall be herein referred to collectively as 
``Defense Counsel.'' The Accused and Defense Counsel shall be herein 
referred to collectively as ``the Defense.''
    (d) Other Personnel. Other personnel, such as court reporters, 
interpreters, security personnel, bailiffs, and clerks may be detailed 
or employed by the Appointing Authority, as necessary.

Sec. 9.5  Procedures accorded the accused.

    The following procedures shall apply with respect to the Accused:
    (a) The Prosecution shall furnish to the Accused, sufficiently in 
advance of trial to prepare a defense, a copy of the charges in English 
and, if appropriate, in another language that the Accused understands.
    (b) The Accused shall be presumed innocent until proven guilty.
    (c) A Commission member shall vote for a finding of Guilty as to an 
offense if and only if that member is convinced

[[Page 25]]

beyond a reasonable doubt, based on the evidence admitted at trial, that 
the Accused is guilty of the offense.
    (d) At least one Detailed Defense Counsel shall be made available to 
the Accused sufficiently in advance of trial to prepare a defense and 
until any findings and sentence become final in accordance with Sec. 
9.6(h)(2).
    (e) The Prosecution shall provide the Defense with access to 
evidence the Prosecution intends to introduce at trial and with access 
to evidence known to the Prosecution that tends to exculpate the 
Accused. Such access shall be consistent with Sec. 9.6(d)(5) and 
subject to Sec. 9.9.
    (f) The Accused shall not be required to testify during trial. A 
Commission shall draw no adverse inference from an Accused's decision 
not to testify. This subsection shall not preclude admission of evidence 
of prior statements or conduct of the Accused.
    (g) If the Accused so elects, the Accused may testify at trial on 
the Accused's own behalf and shall then be subject to cross-examination.
    (h) The Accused may obtain witnesses and documents for the Accused's 
defense, to the extent necessary and reasonably available as determined 
by the Presiding Officer. Such access shall be consistent with the 
requirements of Sec. 9.6(d)(5) and subject to Sec. 9.9. The Appointing 
Authority shall order that such investigative or other resources be made 
available to the Defense as the Appointing Authority deems necessary for 
a full and fair trial.
    (i) The Accused may have Defense Counsel present evidence at trial 
in the Accused's defense and cross-examine each witness presented by the 
Prosecution who appears before the Commission.
    (j) The Prosecution shall ensure that the substance of the charges, 
the proceedings, and any documentary evidence are provided in English 
and, if appropriate, in another language that the Accused understands. 
The Appointing Authority may appoint one or more interpreters to assist 
the Defense, as necessary.
    (k) The Accused may be present at every stage of the trial before 
the Commission, consistent with Sec. 9.6(b)(3), unless the Accused 
engages in disruptive conduct that justifies exclusion by the Presiding 
Officer. Detailed Defense Counsel may not be excluded from any trial 
proceeding or portion thereof.
    (l) Except by order of the Commission for good cause shown, the 
Prosecution shall provide the Defense with access before sentencing 
proceedings to evidence the Prosecution intends to present in such 
proceedings. Such access shall be consistent with Sec. 9.6(d)(5) of 
this part and subject to Sec. 9.9.
    (m) The Accused may make a statement during sentencing proceedings.
    (n) The Accused may have Defense Counsel submit evidence to the 
Commission during sentencing proceedings.
    (o) The Accused shall be afforded a trial open to the public (except 
proceedings closed by the Presiding Officer), consistent with Sec. 
9.6(b).
    (p) The Accused shall not again be tried by any Commission for a 
charge once a Commission's finding on that charge becomes final in 
accordance with Sec. 9.6(h)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 9.6  Conduct of the trial.

    (a) Pretrial procedures--(1) Preparation of the Charges. The 
Prosecution shall prepare charges for approval by the Appointing 
Authority, as provided in Sec. 9.4(b)(2)(i).
    (2) Referral to the Commission. The Appointing Authority may approve 
and refer for trial any charge against an individual or individuals 
within the jurisdiction of a Commission in accordance with Sec. 9.3(a) 
and alleging an offense within the jurisdiction of a Commission in 
accordance with Sec. 9.3(b).
    (3) Notification of the accused. The Prosecution shall provide 
copies of the charges approved by the Appointing Authority to the 
Accused and Defense Counsel. The Prosecution also shall submit the 
charges approved by the Appointing Authority to the Presiding Officer of 
the Commission to which they were referred.
    (4) Plea Agreements. The Accused, through Defense Counsel, and the 
Prosecution may submit for approval to the Appointing Authority a plea 
agreement mandating a sentence limitation or any other provision in 
exchange for an agreement to plead guilty, or any other consideration. 
Any agreement to plead

[[Page 26]]

guilty must include a written stipulation of fact, signed by the 
Accused, that confirms the guilt of the Accused and the voluntary and 
informed nature of the plea of guilty. If the Appointing Authority 
approves the plea agreement, the Commission will, after determining the 
voluntary and informed nature of the plea agreement, admit the plea 
agreement and stipulation into evidence and be bound to adjudge findings 
and a sentence pursuant to that plea agreement.
    (5) Issuance and service of process; obtaining evidence. (i) The 
Commission shall have power to:
    (A) Summon witnesses to attend trial and testify;
    (B) Administer oaths or affirmations to witnesses and other persons 
and to question witnesses;
    (C) Require the production of documents and other evidentiary 
material; and
    (D) Designate special commissioners to take evidence.
    (ii) The Presiding Officer shall exercise these powers on behalf of 
the Commission at the Presiding Officer's own initiative, or at the 
request of the Prosecution or the Defense, as necessary to ensure a full 
and fair trial in accordance with the President's Military Order and 
this part. The Commission shall issue its process in the name of the 
Department of Defense over the signature of the Presiding Officer. Such 
process shall be served as directed by the Presiding Officer in a manner 
calculated to give reasonable notice to persons required to take action 
in accordance with that process.
    (b) Duties of the Commission during trial. The Commission shall:
    (1) Provide a full and fair trial.
    (2) Proceed impartially and expeditiously, strictly confining the 
proceedings to a full and fair trial of the charges, excluding 
irrelevant evidence, and preventing any unnecessary interference or 
delay.
    (3) Hold open proceedings except where otherwise decided by the 
Appointing Authority or the Presiding Officer in accordance with the 
President's Military Order and this part. Grounds for closure include 
the protection of information classified or classifiable under Executive 
Order 12958; information protected by law or rule from unauthorized 
disclosure; the physical safety of participants in Commission 
proceedings, including prospective witnesses; intelligence and law 
enforcement sources, methods, or activities; and other national security 
interests. The Presiding Officer may decide to close all or part of a 
proceeding on the Presiding Officer's own initiative or based upon a 
presentation, including an ex parte, in camera presentation by either 
the Prosecution or the Defense. A decision to close a proceeding or 
portion thereof may include a decision to exclude the Accused, Civilian 
Defense Counsel, or any other person, but Detailed Defense Counsel may 
not be excluded from any trial proceeding or portion thereof. Except 
with the prior authorization of the Presiding Officer and subject to 
section 9 of this part, Defense Counsel may not disclose any information 
presented during a closed session to individuals excluded from such 
proceeding or part thereof. Open proceedings may include, at the 
discretion of the Appointing Authority, attendance by the public and 
accredited press, and public release of transcripts at the appropriate 
time. Proceedings should be open to the maximum extent practicable. 
Photography, video, or audio broadcasting, or recording of or at 
Commission proceedings shall be prohibited, except photography, video, 
and audio recording by the Commission pursuant to the direction of the 
Presiding Officer as necessary for preservation of the record of trial.
    (4) Hold each session at such time and place as may be directed by 
the Appointing Authority. Members of the Commission may meet in closed 
conference at any time.
    (5) As soon as practicable at the conclusion of a trial, transmit an 
authenticated copy of the record of trial to the Appointing Authority.
    (c) Oaths. (1) Members of a Commission, all Prosecutors, all Defense 
Counsel, all court reporters, all security personnel, and all 
interpreters shall take an oath to perform their duties faithfully.
    (2) Each witness appearing before a Commission shall be examined 
under oath, as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.

[[Page 27]]

    (3) An oath includes an affirmation. Any formulation that appeals to 
the conscience of the person to whom the oath is administered and that 
binds that person to speak the truth, or, in the case of one other than 
a witness, properly to perform certain duties, is sufficient.
    (d) Evidence--(1) Admissibility. Evidence shall be admitted if, in 
the opinion of the Presiding Officer (or instead, if any other member of 
the Commission so requests at the time the Presiding Officer renders 
that opinion, the opinion of the Commission rendered at that time by a 
majority of the Commission), the evidence would have probative value to 
a reasonable person.
    (2) Witnesses--(i) Production of witnesses. The Prosecution or the 
Defense may request that the Commission hear the testimony of any 
person, and such testimony shall be received if found to be admissible 
and not cumulative. The Commission may also summon and hear witnesses on 
its own initiative. The Commission may permit the testimony of witnesses 
by telephone, audiovisual means, or other means; however, the Commission 
shall consider the ability to test the veracity of that testimony in 
evaluating the weight to be given to the testimony of the witness.
    (ii) Testimony. Testimony of witnesses shall be given under oath or 
affirmation. The Commission may still hear a witness who refuses to 
swear an oath or make a solemn undertaking; however, the Commission 
shall consider the refusal to swear an oath or give an affirmation in 
evaluating the weight to be given to the testimony of the witness.
    (iii) Examination of witnesses. A witness who testifies before the 
Commission is subject to both direct examination and cross-examination. 
The Presiding Officer shall maintain order in the proceedings and shall 
not permit badgering of witnesses or questions that are not material to 
the issues before the Commission. Members of the Commission may question 
witnesses at any time.
    (iv) Protection of witnesses. The Presiding Officer shall consider 
the safety of witnesses and others, as well as the safeguarding of 
Protected Information as defined in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section, 
in determining the appropriate methods of receiving testimony and 
evidence. The Presiding Officer may hear any presentation by the 
Prosecution or the Defense, including an ex parte, in camera 
presentation, regarding the safety of potential witnesses before 
determining the ways in which witnesses and evidence will be protected. 
The Presiding Officer may authorize any methods appropriate for the 
protection of witnesses and evidence. Such methods may include, but are 
not limited to: testimony by telephone, audiovisual means, or other 
electronic means; closure of the proceedings; introduction of prepared 
declassified summaries of evidence; and the use of pseudonyms.
    (3) Other evidence. Subject to the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section concerning admissibility, the Commission may consider 
any other evidence including, but not limited to, testimony from prior 
trials and proceedings, sworn or unsworn written statements, physical 
evidence, or scientific or other reports.
    (4) Notice. The Commission may, after affording the Prosecution and 
the Defense an opportunity to be heard, take conclusive notice of facts 
that are not subject to reasonable dispute either because they are 
generally known or are capable of determination by resort to sources 
that cannot reasonably be contested.
    (5) Protection of Information--(i) Protective Order. The Presiding 
Officer may issue protective orders as necessary to carry out the 
Military Order and this part, including to safeguard ``Protected 
Information,'' which includes:
    (A) Information classified or classifiable pursuant to Executive 
Order 12958;
    (B) Information protected by law or rule from unauthorized 
disclosure;
    (C) Information the disclosure of which may endanger the physical 
safety of participants in Commission proceedings, including prospective 
witnesses;
    (D) Information concerning intelligence and law enforcement sources, 
methods, or activities; or
    (E) Information concerning other national security interests. As 
soon as practicable, counsel for either side will

[[Page 28]]

notify the Presiding Officer of any intent to offer evidence involving 
Protected Information.
    (ii) Limited disclosure. The Presiding Officer, upon motion of the 
Prosecution or sua sponte, shall, as necessary to protect the interests 
of the United States and consistent with Sec. 9.9, direct:
    (A) The deletion of specified items of Protected Information from 
documents to be made available to the Accused, Detailed Defense Counsel, 
or Civilian Defense Counsel;
    (B) The substitution of a portion or summary of the information for 
such Protected Information; or
    (C) The substitution of a statement of the relevant facts that the 
Protected Information would tend to prove. The Prosecution's motion and 
any materials submitted in support thereof or in response thereto shall, 
upon request of the Prosecution, be considered by the Presiding Officer 
ex parte, in camera, but no Protected Information shall be admitted into 
evidence for consideration by the Commission if not presented to 
Detailed Defense Counsel.
    (iii) Closure of proceedings. The Presiding Officer may direct the 
closure of proceedings in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section.
    (iv) Protected information as part of the record of trial. All 
exhibits admitted as evidence but containing Protected Information shall 
be sealed and annexed to the record of trial. Additionally, any 
Protected Information not admitted as evidence but reviewed in camera 
and subsequently withheld from the Defense over Defense objection shall, 
with the associated motions and responses and any materials submitted in 
support thereof, be sealed and annexed to the record of trial as 
additional exhibits. Such sealed material shall be made available to 
reviewing authorities in closed proceedings.
    (e) Proceedings during trial. The proceedings at each trial will be 
conducted substantially as follows, unless modified by the Presiding 
Officer to suit the particular circumstances:
    (1) Each charge will be read, or its substance communicated, in the 
presence of the Accused and the Commission.
    (2) The Presiding Officer shall ask each Accused whether the Accused 
pleads ``Guilty'' or ``Not Guilty.'' Should the Accused refuse to enter 
a plea, the Presiding Officer shall enter a plea of ``Not Guilty'' on 
the Accused's behalf. If the plea to an offense is ``Guilty,'' the 
Presiding Officer shall enter a finding of Guilty on that offense after 
conducting sufficient inquiry to form an opinion that the plea is 
voluntary and informed. Any plea of Guilty that is not determined to be 
voluntary and informed shall be changed to a plea of Not Guilty. Plea 
proceedings shall then continue as to the remaining charges. If a plea 
of ``Guilty'' is made on all charges, the Commission shall proceed to 
sentencing proceedings; if not, the Commission shall proceed to trial as 
to the charges for which a ``Not Guilty'' plea has been entered.
    (3) The Prosecution shall make its opening statement.
    (4) The witnesses and other evidence for the Prosecution shall be 
heard or received.
    (5) The Defense may make an opening statement after the 
Prosecution's opening statement or prior to presenting its case.
    (6) The witnesses and other evidence for the Defense shall be heard 
or received.
    (7) Thereafter, the Prosecution and the Defense may introduce 
evidence in rebuttal and surrebuttal.
    (8) The Prosecution shall present argument to the Commission. 
Defense Counsel shall be permitted to present argument in response, and 
then the Prosecution may reply in rebuttal.
    (9) After the members of the Commission deliberate and vote on 
findings in closed conference, the Presiding Officer shall announce the 
Commission's findings in the presence of the Commission, the 
Prosecution, the Accused, and Defense Counsel. The individual votes of 
the members of the Commission shall not be disclosed.
    (10) In the event a finding of Guilty is entered for an offense, the 
Prosecution and the Defense may present information to aid the 
Commission in determining an appropriate sentence. The Accused may 
testify and shall be subject to cross-examination regarding any such 
testimony.

[[Page 29]]

    (11) The Prosecution and, thereafter, the Defense shall present 
argument to the Commission regarding sentencing.
    (12) After the members of the Commission deliberate and vote on a 
sentence in closed conference, the Presiding Officer shall announce the 
Commission's sentence in the presence of the Commission, the 
Prosecution, the Accused, and Defense Counsel. The individual votes of 
the members of the Commission shall not be disclosed.
    (f) Voting. Members of the Commission shall deliberate and vote in 
closed conference. A Commission member shall vote for a finding of 
Guilty as to an offense if and only if that member is convinced beyond a 
reasonable doubt, based on the evidence admitted at trial, that the 
Accused is guilty of the offense. An affirmative vote of two-thirds of 
the members is required for a finding of Guilty. When appropriate, the 
Commission may adjust a charged offense by exceptions and substitutions 
of language that do not substantially change the nature of the offense 
or increase its seriousness, or it may vote to convict of a lesser-
included offense. An affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members is 
required to determine a sentence, except that a sentence of death 
requires a unanimous, affirmative vote of all of the members. Votes on 
findings and sentences shall be taken by secret, written ballot.
    (g) Sentence. Upon conviction of an Accused, the Commission shall 
impose a sentence that is appropriate to the offense or offenses for 
which there was a finding of Guilty, which sentence may include death, 
imprisonment for life or for any lesser term, payment of a fine or 
restitution, or such other lawful punishment or condition of punishment 
as the Commission shall determine to be proper. Only a Commission of 
seven members may sentence an Accused to death. A Commission may 
(subject to rights of third parties) order confiscation of any property 
of a convicted Accused, deprive that Accused of any stolen property, or 
order the delivery of such property to the United States for 
disposition.
    (h) Post-trial procedures--(1) Record of Trial. Each Commission 
shall make a verbatim transcript of its proceedings, apart from all 
Commission deliberations, and preserve all evidence admitted in the 
trial (including any sentencing proceedings) of each case brought before 
it, which shall constitute the record of trial. The court reporter shall 
prepare the official record of trial and submit it to the Presiding 
Officer for authentication upon completion. The Presiding Officer shall 
transmit the authenticated record of trial to the Appointing Authority. 
If the Secretary of Defense is serving as the Appointing Authority, the 
record shall be transmitted to the Review Panel constituted under 
paragraph (h)(4) of this section.
    (2) Finality of findings and sentence. A Commission finding as to a 
charge and any sentence of a Commission becomes final when the President 
or, if designated by the President, the Secretary of Defense makes a 
final decision thereon pursuant to section 4(c)(8) of the President's 
Military Order and in accordance with paragraph (h)(6) of this section. 
An authenticated finding of Not Guilty as to a charge shall not be 
changed to a finding of Guilty. Any sentence made final by action of the 
President or the Secretary of Defense shall be carried out promptly. 
Adjudged confinement shall begin immediately following the trial.
    (3) Review by the Appointing Authority. If the Secretary of Defense 
is not the Appointing Authority, the Appointing Authority shall promptly 
perform an administrative review of the record of trial. If satisfied 
that the proceedings of the Commission were administratively complete, 
the Appointing Authority shall transmit the record of trial to the 
Review Panel constituted under paragraph (h)(4) of this section. If not 
so satisfied, the Appointing Authority shall return the case for any 
necessary supplementary proceedings.
    (4) Review Panel. The Secretary of Defense shall designate a Review 
Panel consisting of three Military Officers, which may include civilians 
commissioned pursuant to section 603 of title 10, United States Code. At 
least one member of each Review Panel shall have experience as a judge. 
The Review Panel shall review the record of trial and, in its 
discretion, any written submissions from the Prosecution and the Defense 
and shall deliberate in closed

[[Page 30]]

conference. The Review Panel shall disregard any variance from 
procedures specified in this part or elsewhere that would not materially 
have affected the outcome of the trial before the Commission. Within 
thirty days after receipt of the record of trial, the Review Panel shall 
either:
    (i) Forward the case to the Secretary of Defense with a 
recommendation as to disposition, or
    (ii) Return the case to the Appointing Authority for further 
proceedings, provided that a majority of the Review Panel has formed a 
definite and firm conviction that a material error of law occurred.
    (5) Review by the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of Defense 
shall review the record of trial and the recommendation of the Review 
Panel and either return the case for further proceedings or, unless 
making the final decision pursuant to a Presidential designation under 
section 4(c)(8) of the President's Military Order, forward it to the 
President with a recommendation as to disposition.
    (6) Final decision. After review by the Secretary of Defense, the 
record of trial and all recommendations will be forwarded to the 
President for review and final decision (unless the President has 
designated the Secretary of Defense to perform this function). If the 
President has so designated the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary may 
approve or disapprove findings or change a finding of Guilty to a 
finding of Guilty to a lesser-included offense, or mitigate, commute, 
defer, or suspend the sentence imposed or any portion thereof. If the 
Secretary of Defense is authorized to render the final decision, the 
review of the Secretary of Defense under paragraph (h)(5) of this 
section shall constitute the final decision.


<R05>

    (a) Supplementary regulations and instructions. The Appointing 
Authority shall, subject to approval of the General Counsel of the 
Department of Defense if the Appointing Authority is not the Secretary 
of Defense, publish such further regulations consistent with the

and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism,'' may be 
subject to appropriate action by the Appointing Authority, the General 
Counsel of the

[[Page 32]]

Department of Defense, or the Presiding Officer of a military 
commission. Such action may include permanently barring an individual 
from participating in any military commission proceeding convened 
pursuant to 32 CFR part 9, and Military Order of November 13, 2001, 
``Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War 
Against Terrorism,'' punitive measures imposed under 10 U.S.C. 898, and 
any other lawful sanction.


<R05>
Sec. 10.5  Construction.

    Military Commission Instructions shall be construed in a manner 
consistent with 32 CFR part 9, and Military Order of November 13, 2001, 
``Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War 
Against Terrorism.'' Nothing in these Military Commission Instructions 
applies with respect to the trial of crimes by military commissions 
convened under other authority. In the event of an inconsistency, the 
provisions of 32 CFR part 9, and Military Order of November 13, 2001, 
``Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War 
Against Terrorism,'' shall govern as provided in Section 7(B) of 
Military Order of November 13, 2001, ``Detention, Treatment, and Trial 
of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism.'' Pronouns 
referring to the male gender shall be construed as applying to both male 
and female.


<R05>
Sec. 10.6  Non-creation of right.

    Neither this part nor any Military Commission Instruction issued 
hereafter, is intended to and does not create any right, benefit, 
privilege, substantive or procedural, enforceable by any party, against 
the United States, its departments, agencies, or other entities, its 
officers or employees, or any other person. Alleged noncompliance with 
an Instruction does not, of itself, constitute error, give rise to 
judicial review, or establish a right to relief for the Accused or any 
other person.


<R05>
Sec. 10.7  Reservation of authority.

    Neither this part nor any Military Commission Instruction issued 
hereafter shall be construed to limit, impair, or otherwise affect any 
authority granted by the Constitution or laws of the United States or

<R05>
Sec. 11.1  Purpose.

    This part provides guidance with respect to crimes that may be tried 
by military commissions established pursuant to 32 CFR part 9, and 
Military Order of November 13, 2001, ``Detention, Treatment, and Trial 
of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism,'' (3 CFR, 2001 
comp., p. 918, 66 FR 57833) and enumerates the elements of those crimes.


<R05>
Sec. 11.2  Authority.

    This part is issued pursuant to 32 CFR 9.7(a) and in accordance with 
Military Order of November 13, 2001, ``Detention, Treatment, and Trial 
of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism,'' (66 FR 57833) 
and 10 U.S.C. 113(d), 140(b), and 821. The provisions of 32 CFR part 10 
are applicable to this part.


<R05>
Sec. 11.3  General.

    (a) Background. The following crimes and elements thereof are 
intended for use by military commissions established pursuant to 32 CFR 
part 9, and Military Order of November 13, 2001, ``Detention, Treatment, 
and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism,'' the 
jurisdiction of which extends to offenses or offenders that by statute 
or the law of armed

[[Page 33]]

conflict may be tried by military commission as limited by Military 
Order of November 13, 2001, ``Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain 
Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism.'' No offense is cognizable in 
a trial by military commission if that offense did not exist prior to 
the conduct in question. These crimes and elements derive from the law 
of armed conflict, a body of law that is sometimes referred to as the 
law of war. They constitute violations of the law of armed conflict or 
offenses that, consistent with that body of law, are triable by military 
commission. Because this document is declarative of existing law, it 
does not preclude trial for crimes that occurred prior to its effective 
date.
    (b) Effect of other laws. No conclusion regarding the applicability 
or persuasive authority of other bodies of law should be drawn solely 
from the presence, absence, or similarity of particular language in this 
part as compared to other articulations of law.
    (c) Non-exclusivity. This part does not contain a comprehensive list 
of crimes triable by military commission. It is intended to be 
illustrative of applicable principles of the common law of war but not 
to provide an exclusive enumeration of the punishable acts recognized as 
such by that law. The absence of a particular offense from the corpus of 
those enumerated herein does not preclude trial for that offense.


<R05>
Sec. 11.4  Applicable principles of law.

    (a) General intent. All actions taken by the Accused that are 
necessary for completion of a crime must be performed with general 
intent. This intent is not listed as a separate element. When the mens 
rea required for culpability to attach involves an intent that a 
particular consequence occur, or some other specific intent, an intent 
element is included. The necessary relationship between such intent 
element and the conduct constituting the actus reus is not articulated 
for each set of elements, but is presumed; a nexus between the two is 
necessary.
    (b) The element of wrongfulness and defenses. Conduct must be 
wrongful to constitute one of the offenses enumerated herein or any 
other offense triable by military commission. Conduct is wrongful if it 
is done without justification or excuse cognizable under applicable law. 
The element of wrongfulness (or the absence of lawful justification or 
excuse), which may be required under the customary law of armed 
conflict, is not repeated in the elements of crimes in Sec. 11.6. 
Conduct satisfying the elements found herein shall be inferred to be 
wrongful in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Similarly, this 
part does not enunciate defenses that may apply for specific offenses, 
though an Accused is entitled to raise any defense available under the 
law of armed conflict. Defenses potentially available to an Accused 
under the law of armed conflict, such as self-defense, mistake of fact, 
and duress, may be applicable to certain offenses subject to trial by 
military commission. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, 
defenses in individual cases shall be presumed not to apply. The burden 
of going forward with evidence of lawful justification or excuse or any 
applicable defense shall be upon the Accused. With respect to the issue 
of combatant immunity raised by the specific enumeration of an element 
requiring the absence thereof, the prosecution must affirmatively prove 
that element regardless of whether the issue is raised by the defense. 
Once an applicable defense or an issue of lawful justification or lawful 
excuse is fairly raised by the evidence presented, except for the 
defense of lack of mental responsibility, the burden is on the 
prosecution to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the conduct was 
wrongful or that the defense does not apply. With respect to the defense 
of lack of mental responsibility, the Accused has the burden of proving 
by clear and convincing evidence that, as a result of a severe mental 
disease or defect, the Accused was unable to appreciate the nature and 
quality of the wrongfulness of the Accused's acts. As provided in 32 CFR 
9.5(c), the prosecution bears the burden of establishing the Accused's 
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in all cases tried by a military 
commission. Each element of an offense enumerated herein must be proven 
beyond a reasonable doubt.

[[Page 34]]

    (c) Statute of limitations. Violations of the laws of war listed 
herein are not subject to any statute of limitations.


<R05>
Sec. 11.5  Definitions.

    (a) Combatant immunity. Under the law of armed conflict, only a 
lawful combatant enjoys ``combatant immunity'' or ``belligerent 
privilege'' for the lawful conduct of hostilities during armed conflict.
    (b) Enemy. ``Enemy'' includes any entity with which the United 
States or allied forces may be engaged in armed conflict, or which is 
preparing to attack the United States. It is not limited to foreign 
nations, or foreign military organizations or members thereof. ``Enemy'' 
specifically includes any organization of terrorists with international 
reach.
    (c) In the context of and was associated with armed conflict. 
Elements containing this language require a nexus between the conduct 
and armed hostilities. Such nexus could involve, but is not limited to, 
time, location, or purpose of the conduct in relation to the armed 
hostilities. The existence of such factors, however, may not satisfy the 
necessary nexus (e.g., murder committed between members of the same 
armed force for reasons of personal gain unrelated to the conflict, even 
if temporally and geographically associated with armed conflict, is not 
``in the context of'' the armed conflict). The focus of this element is 
not the nature or characterization of the conflict, but the nexus to it. 
This element does not require a declaration of war, ongoing mutual 
hostilities, or confrontation involving a regular national armed force. 
A single hostile act or attempted act may provide sufficient basis for 
the nexus so long as its magnitude or severity rises to the level of an 
``armed attack'' or an ``act of war,'' or the number, power, stated 
intent or organization of the force with which the actor is associated 
is such that the act or attempted act is tantamount to an attack by an 
armed force. Similarly, conduct undertaken or organized with knowledge 
or intent that it initiate or contribute to such hostile act or 
hostilities would satisfy the nexus requirement.
    (d) Military Objective. ``Military objectives'' are those potential 
targets during an armed conflict which, by their nature, location, 
purpose, or use, effectively contribute to the opposing force's war-
fighting or war-sustaining capability and whose total or partial 
destruction, capture, or neutralization would constitute a military 
advantage to the attacker under the circumstances at the time of the 
attack.
    (e) Object of the attack. ``Object of the attack'' refers to the 
person, place, or thing intentionally targeted. In this regard, the term 
includes neither collateral damage nor incidental injury or death.
    (f) Protected property. ``Protected property'' refers to property 
specifically protected by the law of armed conflict such as buildings 
dedicated to religion, education, art, science or charitable purposes, 
historic monuments, hospitals, or places where the sick and wounded are 
collected, provided they are not being used for military purposes or are 
not otherwise military objectives. Such property would include objects 
properly identified by one of the distinctive emblems of the Geneva 
Conventions but does not include all civilian property.
    (g) Protected under the law of war. The person or object in question 
is expressly ``protected'' under one or more of the Geneva Conventions 
of 1949 or, to the extent applicable, customary international law. The 
term does not refer to all who enjoy some form of protection as a 
consequence of compliance with international law, but those who are 
expressly designated as such by the applicable law of armed conflict. 
For example, persons who either are hors de combat or medical or 
religious personnel taking no active part in hostilities are expressly 
protected, but other civilians may not be.
    (h) Should have known. The facts and circumstances were such that a 
reasonable person in the Accused's position would have had the relevant 
knowledge or awareness.


<R05>
Sec. 11.6  Crimes and elements.

    (a) Substantive offenses--war crimes. The following enumerated 
offenses, if applicable, should be charged in separate counts. Elements 
are drafted to

[[Page 35]]

reflect conduct of the perpetrator. Each element need not be 
specifically charged.
    (1) Willful killing of protected persons--(i) Elements. (A) The 
accused killed one or more persons;
    (B) The accused intended to kill such person or persons;
    (C) Such person or persons were protected under the law of war;
    (D) The accused knew or should have known of the factual 
circumstances that established that protected status; and
    (E) The killing took place in the context of and was associated with 
armed conflict.
    (ii) Comments. The intent required for this offense precludes its 
applicability with regard to collateral damage or injury incident to a 
lawful attack.
    (2) Attacking civilians.--(i) Elements. (A) The accused engaged in 
an attack;
    (B) The object of the attack was a civilian population as such or 
individual civilians not taking direct or active part in hostilities;
    (C) The accused intended the civilian population as such or 
individual civilians not taking direct or active part in hostilities to 
be an object of the attack; and
    (D) The attack took place in the context of and was associated with 
armed conflict.
    (ii) Comments. The intent required for this offense precludes its 
applicability with regard to collateral damage or injury incident to a 
lawful attack.
    (3) Attacking civilian objects.--(i) Elements. (A) The accused 
engaged in an attack;
    (B) The object of the attack was civilian property, that is, 
property that was not a military objective;
    (C) The accused intended such property to be an object of the 
attack;
    (D) The accused knew or should have known that such property was not 
a military objective; and
    (E) The attack took place in the context of and was associated with 
armed conflict.
    (ii) Comments. The intent required for this offense precludes its 
applicability with regard to collateral damage or injury incident to a 
lawful attack.
    (4) Attacking Protected Property--(i) Elements. (A) The accused 
engaged in an attack;
    (B) The object of the attack was protected property;
    (C) The accused intended such property to be an object of the 
attack;
    (D) The accused knew or should have known of the factual 
circumstances that established that protected status; and
    (E) The attack took place in the context of and was associated with 
armed conflict.
    (ii) Comments. The intent required for this offense precludes its 
applicability with regard to collateral damage or injury incident to a 
lawful attack.
    (5) Pillaging--(i) Elements. (A) The accused appropriated or seized 
certain property;
    (B) The accused intended to appropriate or seize such property for 
private or personal use;
    (C) The appropriation or seizure was without the consent of the 
owner of the property or other person with authority to permit such 
appropriation or seizure; and
    (D) The appropriation or seizure took place in the context of and 
was associated with armed conflict.
    (ii) Comments. As indicated by the use of the term ``private or 
personal use,'' legitimate captures or appropriations, or seizures 
justified by military necessity, cannot constitute the crime of 
pillaging.
    (6) Denying quarter--(i) Elements. (A) The accused declared, 
ordered, or otherwise indicated that there shall be no survivors or 
surrender accepted;
    (B) The accused thereby intended to threaten an adversary or to 
conduct hostilities such that there would be no survivors or surrender 
accepted;
    (C) It was foreseeable that circumstances would be such that a 
practicable and reasonable ability to accept surrender would exist;
    (D) The accused was in a position of effective command or control 
over the subordinate forces to which the declaration or order was 
directed; and
    (E) The conduct took place in the context of and was associated with 
armed conflict.
    (ii) Comments. Paragraph (a)(6)(i)(C) of this section precludes this 
offense

[[Page 36]]

from being interpreted as limiting the application of lawful means or 
methods of warfare against enemy combatants. For example, a remotely 
delivered attack cannot give rise to this offense.
    (7) Taking Hostages--(i) Elements. (A) The accused seized, detained, 
or otherwise held hostage one or more persons;
    (B) The accused threatened to kill, injure, or continue to detain 
such person or persons;
    (C) The accused intended to compel a State, an international 
organization, a natural or legal person, or a group of persons to act or 
refrain from acting as an explicit or implicit condition for the safety 
or release of such person or persons; and
    (D) The conduct took place in the context of and was associated with 
armed conflict.
    (ii) Comments. Consistent with Sec. 11.4(b), this offense cannot be 
committed by lawfully detaining enemy combatants or other individuals as 
authorized by the law of armed conflict.
    (8) Employing poison or analogous weapons--(i) Elements. (A) The 
accused employed a substance or a weapon that releases a substance as a 
result of its employment;
    (B) The substance was such that exposure thereto causes death or 
serious damage to health in the ordinary course of events, through its 
asphyxiating, poisonous, or bacteriological properties;
    (C) The accused employed the substance or weapon with the intent of 
utilizing such asphyxiating, poisonous, or bacteriological properties as 
a method of warfare;
    (D) The accused knew or should have known of the nature of the 
substance or weapon; and
    (E) The conduct took place in the context of and was associated with 
armed conflict.
    (ii) Comments. (A) The ``death or serious damage to health'' 
required by paragraph (a)(8)(i)(B) of this section must be a direct 
result of the substance's effect or effects on the human body (e.g., 
asphyxiation caused by the depletion of atmospheric oxygen secondary to 
a chemical or other reaction would not give rise to this offense).
    (B) The clause ``serious damage to health'' does not include 
temporary incapacitation or sensory irritation.
    (C) The use of the ``substance or weapon'' at issue must be 
proscribed under the law of armed conflict. It may include chemical or 
biological agents.
    (D) The specific intent element for this offense precludes liability 
for mere knowledge of potential collateral consequences (e.g., mere 
knowledge of a secondary asphyxiating or toxic effect would be 
insufficient to complete the offense).
    (9) Using protected persons as shields--(i) Elements. (A) The 
accused positioned, or took advantage of the location of, one or more 
civilians or persons protected under the law of war;
    (B) The accused intended to use the civilian or protected nature of 
the person or persons to shield a military objective from attack or to 
shield, favor, or impede military operations; and
    (C) The conduct took place in the context of and was associated with 
armed conflict.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (10) Using protected property as shields--(i) Elements. (A) The 
accused positioned, or took advantage of the location of, civilian 
property or property protected under the law of war;
    (B) The accused intended to shield a military objective from attack 
or to shield, favor, or impede military operations; and
    (C) The conduct took place in the context of and was associated with 
armed conflict.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (11) Torture--(i) Elements. (A) The accused inflicted severe 
physical or mental pain or suffering upon one or more persons;
    (B) The accused intended to inflict such severe physical or mental 
pain or suffering;
    (C) Such person or persons were in the custody or under the control 
of the accused; and
    (D) The conduct took place in the context of and was associated with 
armed conflict.
    (ii) Comments. (A) Consistent with Sec. 11.4(b), this offense does 
not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in, or 
incidental to, lawfully imposed punishments. This offense does

[[Page 37]]

not include the incidental infliction of pain or suffering associated 
with the legitimate conduct of hostilities.
    (B) Severe ``mental pain or suffering'' is the prolonged mental harm 
caused by or resulting from:
    (1) The intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe 
physical pain or suffering;
    (2) The administration or application, or threatened administration 
or application, of mind-altering substances or other procedures 
calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality;
    (3) The threat of imminent death; or
    (4) The threat that another person will imminently be subjected to 
death, severe physical pain or suffering, or the administration or 
application of mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated 
to disrupt profoundly the senses or personality.
    (C) ``Prolonged mental harm'' is a harm of some sustained duration, 
though not necessarily permanent in nature, such as a clinically 
identifiable mental disorder.
    (D) Paragraph (a)(11)(i)(C) of this section does not require a 
particular formal relationship between the accused and the victim. 
Rather, it precludes prosecution for pain or suffering consequent to a 
lawful military attack.
    (12) Causing serious injury--(i) Elements. (A) The accused caused 
serious injury to the body or health of one or more persons;
    (B) The accused intended to inflict such serious injury;
    (C) Such person or persons were in the custody or under the control 
of the accused; and
    (D) The conduct took place in the context of and was associated with

mutilation;
    (C) The conduct caused death or seriously damaged or endangered the

the person or persons concerned nor carried out in the interest of such 
person or persons;
    (E) Such person or persons were in the custody or control of the 
accused; and
    (F) The conduct took place in the context of and was associated with 
armed conflict.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (14) Use of treachery or perfidy--(i) Elements. (A) The accused

    (C) The accused killed, injured, or captured one or more persons;
    (D) The accused made use of that confidence or belief in killing, 
injuring, or capturing such person or persons; and
    (E) The conduct took place in the context of and was associated with 
armed conflict.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (15) Improper use of flag of truce--(i) Elements. (A) The accused 
used a flag of truce;
    (B) The accused made such use in order to feign an intention to 
negotiate, surrender, or otherwise to suspend hostilities when there was 
no such intention on the part of the accused; and
    (C) The conduct took place in the context of and was associated with 
armed conflict.

    (16) Improper use of protective emblems--(i) Elements. (A) The 
accused used a protective emblem recognized by the law of armed 
conflict;
    (B) The accused undertook such use for combatant purposes in a 
manner prohibited by the law of armed conflict;

[[Page 38]]

    (C) The accused knew or should have known of the prohibited nature 
of such use; and
    (D) The conduct took place in the context of and was associated with 
armed conflict.
    (ii) Comments. ``Combatant purposes,'' as used in paragraph 
(a)(16)(i)(B) of this section, means purposes directly related to 
hostilities and does not include medical, religious, or similar 
activities.
    (17) Degrading treatment of a dead body.--(i) Elements. (A) The 
accused degraded or otherwise violated the dignity of the body of a dead 
person;
    (B) The accused intended to degrade or otherwise violate the dignity 
of such body;
    (C) The severity of the degradation or other violation was of such 
degree as to be generally recognized as an outrage upon personal 
dignity; and
    (D) The conduct took place in the context of and was associated with 
armed conflict.
    (ii) Comments. Paragraph (a)(17)(i)(B) of this section precludes 
prosecution for actions justified by military necessity.
    (18) Rape--(i) Elements. (A) The accused invaded the body of a 
person by conduct resulting in penetration, however slight, of any part 
of the body of the victim or of the accused with a sexual organ, or of 
the anal or genital opening of the victim with any object or any other 
part of the body;
    (B) The invasion was committed by force, threat of force or 
coercion, or was committed against a person incapable of giving consent; 
and
    (C) The conduct took place in the context of and was associated with 
armed conflict.
    (ii) Comments. (A) Paragraph (a)(18)(i)(B) of this section 
recognizes that consensual conduct does not give rise to this offense.
    (B) It is understood that a person may be incapable of giving 
consent if affected by natural, induced, or age-related incapacity.
    (C) The concept of ``invasion'' is linked to the inherent 
wrongfulness requirement for all offenses. In this case, for example, a 
legitimate body cavity search could not give rise to this offense.
    (D) The concept of ``invasion'' is gender neutral.
    (b) Substantive offenses--other offenses triable by military 
commission. The following enumerated offenses, if applicable, should be 
charged in separate counts. Elements are drafted to reflect conduct of 
the perpetrator. Each element need not be specifically charged.
    (1) Hijacking or hazarding a vessel or aircraft--(i) Elements. (A) 
The accused seized, exercised control over, or endangered the safe 
navigation of a vessel or aircraft;
    (B) The accused intended to so seize, exercise control over, or 
endanger such vessel or aircraft; and
    (C) The conduct took place in the context of and was associated with 
armed conflict.
    (ii) Comments. A seizure, exercise of control, or endangerment 
required by military necessity, or against a lawful military objective 
undertaken by military forces of a State in the exercise of their 
official duties, would not satisfy the wrongfulness requirement for this 
crime.
    (2) Terrorism--(i) Elements. (A) The accused killed or inflicted 
bodily harm on one or more persons or destroyed property;
    (B) The accused:
    (1) Intended to kill or inflict bodily harm on one or more persons; 
or
    (2) Intentionally engaged in an act that is inherently dangerous to 
another and evinces a wanton disregard of human life;
    (C) The killing, harm or destruction was intended to intimidate or 
coerce a civilian population, or to influence the policy of a government 
by intimidation or coercion; and
    (D) The killing, harm or destruction took place in the context of 
and was associated with armed conflict.
    (ii) Comments. (A) Paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section includes 
the concept of causing death or bodily harm, even if indirectly.
    (B) The requirement that the conduct be wrongful for this crime 
necessitates that the conduct establishing this offense not constitute 
an attack against a lawful military objective undertaken by military 
forces of a State in the exercise of their official duties.

[[Page 39]]

    (3) Murder by an unprivileged belligerent--(i) Elements. (A) The 
accused killed one or more persons;
    (B) The accused:
    (1) Intended to kill or inflict great bodily harm on such person or 
persons; or
    (2) Intentionally engaged in an act that is inherently dangerous to 
another and evinces a wanton disregard of human life;
    (C) The accused did not enjoy combatant immunity; and
    (D) The killing took place in the context of and was associated with 
armed conflict.
    (ii) Comments. (A) The term ``kill'' includes intentionally causing 
death, whether directly or indirectly.
    (B) Unlike the crimes of willful killing or attacking civilians, in 
which the victim's status is a prerequisite to criminality, for this 
offense the victim's status is immaterial. Even an attack on a soldier 
would be a crime if the attacker did not enjoy ``belligerent privilege'' 
or ``combatant immunity.''
    (4) Destruction of property by an unprivileged belligerent--(i) 
Elements. (A) The accused destroyed property;
    (B) The property belonged to another person, and the destruction was 
without that person's consent;
    (C) The accused intended to destroy such property;
    (D) The accused did not enjoy combatant immunity; and
    (E) The destruction took place in the context of and was associated 
with armed conflict.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (5) Aiding the enemy--(i) Elements. (A) The accused aided the enemy;
    (B) The accused intended to aid the enemy; and
    (C) The conduct took place in the context of and was associated with 
armed conflict.
    (ii) Comments. (A) Means of accomplishing paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A) of 
this section include, but are not limited to: providing arms, 
ammunition, supplies, money, other items or services to the enemy; 
harboring or protecting the enemy; or giving intelligence or other 
information to the enemy.
    (B) The requirement that conduct be wrongful for this crime 
necessitates that the accused act without proper authority. For example, 
furnishing enemy combatants detained during hostilities with subsistence 
or quarters in accordance with applicable orders or policy is not aiding 
the enemy.
    (C) The requirement that conduct be wrongful for this crime may 
necessitate that, in the case of a lawful belligerent, the accused owe 
allegiance or some duty to the United States of America or to an ally or 
coalition partner. For example, citizenship, resident alien status, or a 
contractual relationship in or with the United States or an ally or 
coalition partner is sufficient to satisfy this requirement so long as 
the relationship existed at a time relevant to the offense alleged.
    (6) Spying--(i) Elements. (A) The accused collected or attempted to 
collect certain information;
    (B) The accused intended to convey such information to the enemy;
    (C) The accused, in collecting or attempting to collect the 
information, was lurking or acting clandestinely, while acting under 
false pretenses; and
    (D) The conduct took place in the context of and was associated with 
armed conflict.
    (ii) Comments. (A) Members of a military organization not wearing a 
disguise and others who carry out their missions openly are not spies, 
if, though they may have resorted to concealment, they have not acted 
under false pretenses.
    (B) Related to the requirement that conduct be wrongful or without 
justification or excuse in this case is the fact that, consistent with 
the law of war, a lawful combatant who, after rejoining the armed force 
to which that combatant belongs, is subsequently captured, can not be 
punished for previous acts of espionage. His successful rejoining of his 
armed force constitutes a defense.
    (7) Perjury or false testimony--(i) Elements.
    (A) The accused testified at a military commission, in proceedings 
ancillary to a military commission, or provided information in a writing 
executed under an oath to tell the truth or a declaration acknowledging 
the applicability of penalties of perjury in connection with such 
proceedings;

[[Page 40]]

    (B) Such testimony or information was material;
    (C) Such testimony or information was false; and
    (D) The accused knew such testimony or information to be false.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (8) Obstruction of justice related to military commissions--(i) 
Elements. (A) The accused did an act;
    (B) The accused intended to influence, impede, or otherwise obstruct 
the due administration of justice; and
    (C) The accused did such act in the case of a certain person against 
whom the accused had reason to believe:
    (1) There were or would be proceedings before a military commission; 
or
    (2) There was an ongoing investigation of offenses triable by 
military commission.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (c) Other forms of liability and related offenses. A person is 
criminally liable as a principal for a completed substantive offense if 
that person commits the offense (perpetrator), aids or abets the 
commission of the offense, solicits commission of the offense, or is 
otherwise responsible due to command responsibility. Such a person would 
be charged as a principal even if another individual more directly 
perpetrated the offense. In proving culpability, however, the below 
listed definitions and elements are applicable. Additionally, if a 
substantive offense was completed, a person may be criminally liable for 
the separate offense of accessory after the fact. If the substantive 
offense was not completed, a person may be criminally liable of the 
lesser-included offense of attempt or the separate offense of 
solicitation. Finally, regardless of whether the substantive offense was 
completed, a person may be criminally liable of the separate offense of 
conspiracy in addition to the substantive offense. Each element need not 
be specifically charged.
    (1) Aiding or abetting--(i) Elements. (A) The accused committed an 
act that aided or abetted another person or entity in the commission of 
a substantive offense triable by military commission;
    (B) Such other person or entity committed or attempted to commit the 
substantive offense; and
    (C) The accused intended to or knew that the act would aid or abet 
such other person or entity in the commission of the substantive offense 
or an associated criminal purpose or enterprise.
    (ii) Comments. (A) The term ``aided or abetted'' in paragraph 
(c)(1)(i)(A) of this section includes: assisting, encouraging, advising, 
instigating, counseling, ordering, or procuring another to commit a 
substantive offense; assisting, encouraging, advising, counseling, or 
ordering another in the commission of a substantive offense; and in any 
other way facilitating the commission of a substantive offense.
    (B) In some circumstances, inaction may render one liable as an 
aider or abettor. If a person has a legal duty to prevent or thwart the 
commission of a substantive offense, but does not do so, that person may 
be considered to have aided or abetted the commission of the offense if 
such noninterference is intended to and does operate as an aid or 
encouragement to the actual perpetrator.
    (C) An accused charged with aiding or abetting should be charged 
with the related substantive offense as a principal.
    (2) Solicitation--(i) Elements. (A) The accused solicited, ordered, 
induced, or advised a certain person or persons to commit one or more 
substantive offenses triable by military commission; and
    (B) The accused intended that the offense actually be committed.
    (ii) Comments. (A) The offense is complete when a solicitation is 
made or advice is given with the specific wrongful intent to induce a 
person or persons to commit any offense triable by military commission. 
It is not necessary that the person or persons solicited, ordered, 
induced, advised, or assisted agree to or act upon the solicitation or 
advice. If the offense solicited is actually committed, however, the 
accused is liable under the law of armed conflict for the substantive 
offense. An accused should not be convicted of both solicitation and the 
substantive offense solicited if criminal liability for the substantive 
offense is based upon the solicitation.

[[Page 41]]

    (B) Solicitation may be by means other than speech or writing. Any 
act or conduct that reasonably may be construed as a serious request, 
order, inducement, advice, or offer of assistance to commit any offense 
triable by military commission may constitute solicitation. It is not 
necessary that the accused act alone in the solicitation, order, 
inducement, advising, or assistance. The accused may act through other 
persons in committing this offense.
    (C) An accused charged with solicitation of a completed substantive 
offense should be charged for the substantive offense as a principal. An 
accused charged with solicitation of an uncompleted offense should be 
charged for the separate offense of solicitation. Solicitation is not a 
lesser-included offense of the related substantive offense.
    (3) Command/superior responsibility--perpetrating--(i) Elements. (A) 
The accused had command and control, or effective authority and control, 
over one or more subordinates;
    (B) One or more of the accused's subordinates committed, attempted 
to commit, conspired to commit, solicited to commit, or aided or abetted 
the commission of one or more substantive offenses triable by military 
commission;
    (C) The accused either knew or should have known that the 
subordinate or subordinates were committing, attempting to commit, 
conspiring to commit, soliciting, or aiding or abetting such offense or 
offenses; and
    (D) The accused failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures 
within his power to prevent or repress the commission of the offense or 
offenses.
    (ii) Comments.
    (A) The phrase ``effective authority and control'' in paragraph 
(c)(3)(i)(A) of this section includes the concept of relative authority 
over the subject matter or activities associated with the perpetrator's 
conduct. This may be relevant to a civilian superior who should not be 
held responsible for the behavior of subordinates involved in activities 
that have no relationship to such superior's sphere of authority. 
Subject matter authority need not be demonstrated for command 
responsibility as it applies to a military commander.
    (B) A commander or other military or civilian superior, not in 
command, charged with failing adequately to prevent or repress a 
substantive offense triable by military commission should be charged for 
the related substantive offense as a principal.
    (4) Command/superior responsibility--misprision--(i) Elements. (A) 
The accused had command and control, or effective authority and control, 
over one or more subordinates;
    (B) One or more of the accused's subordinates had committed, 
attempted to commit, conspired to commit, solicited to commit, or aided 
or abetted the commission of one or more substantive offenses triable by 
military commission;
    (C) The accused knew or should have known that the subordinate or 
subordinates had committed, attempted to commit, conspired to commit, 
solicited, or aided or abetted such offense or offenses; and
    (D) The accused failed to submit the matter to competent authorities 
for investigation or prosecution as appropriate.
    (ii) Comments.
    (A) The phrase, ``effective authority and control'' in paragraph 
(c)(4)(i)(A) of this section includes the concept of relative authority 
over the subject matter or activities associated with the perpetrator's 
conduct. This may be relevant to a civilian superior who cannot be held 
responsible under this offense for the behavior of subordinates involved 
in activities that have nothing to do with such superior's sphere of 
authority.
    (B) A commander or superior charged with failing to take appropriate 
punitive or investigative action subsequent to the perpetration of a 
substantive offense triable by military commission should not be charged 
for the substantive offense as a principal. Such commander or superior 
should be charged for the separate offense of failing to submit the 
matter for investigation and/or prosecution as detailed in these 
elements. This offense is not a lesser-included offense of the related 
substantive offense.

[[Page 42]]

    (5) Accessory after the fact--(i) Elements. (A) The accused 
received, comforted, or assisted a certain person;
    (B) Such person had committed an offense triable by military 
commission;
    (C) The accused knew that such person had committed such offense or 
believed such person had committed a similar or closely related offense; 
and
    (D) The accused intended to hinder or prevent the apprehension, 
trial, or punishment of such person.
    (ii) Comments. Accessory after the fact should be charged separately 
from the related substantive offense. It is not a lesser-included 
offense of the related substantive offense.
    (6) Conspiracy--(i) Elements. (A) The accused entered into an 
agreement with one or more persons to commit one or more substantive 
offenses triable by military commission or otherwise joined an 
enterprise of persons who shared a common criminal purpose that 
involved, at least in part, the commission or intended commission of one 
or more substantive offenses triable by military commission;
    (B) The accused knew the unlawful purpose of the agreement or the 
common criminal purpose of the enterprise and joined in it willfully, 
that is, with the intent to further the unlawful purpose; and
    (C) One of the conspirators or enterprise members, during the 
existence of the agreement or enterprise, knowingly committed an overt 
act in order to accomplish some objective or purpose of the agreement or 
enterprise.
    (ii) Comments. (A) Two or more persons are required in order to have 
a conspiracy. Knowledge of the identity of co-conspirators and their 
particular connection with the agreement or enterprise need not be 
established. A person may be guilty of conspiracy although incapable of 
committing the intended offense. The joining of another conspirator 
after the conspiracy has been established does not create a new 
conspiracy or affect the status of the other conspirators. The agreement 
or common criminal purpose in a conspiracy need not be in any particular 
form or manifested in any formal words.
    (B) The agreement or enterprise must, at least in part, involve the 
commission or intended commission of one or more substantive offenses 
triable by military commission. A single conspiracy may embrace multiple 
criminal objectives. The agreement need not include knowledge that any 
relevant offense is in fact ``triable by military commission.''
    (C) The overt act must be done by one or more of the conspirators, 
but not necessarily the accused, and it must be done to effectuate the 
object of the conspiracy or in furtherance of the common criminal 
purpose. The accused need not have entered the agreement or criminal 
enterprise at the time of the overt act.
    (D) The overt act need not be in itself criminal, but it must 
advance the purpose of the conspiracy. It is not essential that any 
substantive offense be committed.
    (E) Each conspirator is liable for all offenses committed pursuant 
to or in furtherance of the conspiracy by any of the co-conspirators, 
after such conspirator has joined the conspiracy and while the 
conspiracy continues and such conspirator remains a party to it.
    (F) A party to the conspiracy who withdraws from or abandons the 
agreement or enterprise before the commission of an overt act by any 
conspirator is not guilty of conspiracy. An effective withdrawal or 
abandonment must consist of affirmative conduct that is wholly 
inconsistent with adherence to the unlawful agreement or common criminal 
purpose and that shows that the party has severed all connection with 
the conspiracy. A conspirator who effectively withdraws from or abandons 
the conspiracy after the performance of an overt act by one of the 
conspirators remains guilty of conspiracy and of any offenses committed 
pursuant to the conspiracy up to the time of the withdrawal or 
abandonment. The withdrawal of a conspirator from the conspiracy does 
not affect the status of the remaining members.
    (G) That the object of the conspiracy was impossible to effect is 
not a defense to this offense.
    (H) Conspiracy to commit an offense is a separate and distinct 
offense from any offense committed pursuant to or in furtherance of the 
conspiracy, and

[[Page 43]]

both the conspiracy and any related offense may be charged, tried, and 
punished separately. Conspiracy should be charged separately from the 
related substantive offense. It is not a lesser-included offense of the 
substantive offense.
    (7) Attempt--(i) Elements. (A) The accused committed an act;
    (B) The accused intended to commit one or more substantive offenses 
triable by military commission;
    (C) The act amounted to more than mere preparation; and
    (D) The act apparently tended to effect the commission of the 
intended offense.
    (ii) Comments. (A) To constitute an attempt there must be a specific 
intent to commit the offense accompanied by an act that tends to 
accomplish the unlawful purpose. This intent need not involve knowledge 
that the offense is in fact ``triable by military commission.''
    (B) Preparation consists of devising or arranging means or measures 
apparently necessary for the commission of the offense. The act need not 
be the last act essential to the consummation of the offense. The 
combination of specific intent to commit an offense, plus the commission 
of an act apparently tending to further its accomplishment, constitutes 
the offense of attempt. Failure to complete the offense, whatever the 
cause, is not a defense.
    (C) A person who purposely engages in conduct that would constitute 
the offense if the attendant circumstances were as that person believed 
them to be is guilty of an attempt.
    (D) It is a defense to an attempt offense that the person 
voluntarily and completely abandoned the intended offense, solely 
because of the person's own sense that it was wrong, prior to the 
completion of the substantive offense. The voluntary abandonment defense 
is not allowed if the abandonment results, in whole or in part, from 
other reasons, for example, the person feared detection or apprehension, 
decided to await a better opportunity for success, was unable to 
complete the crime, or encountered unanticipated difficulties or 
unexpected resistance.
    (E) Attempt is a lesser-included offense of any substantive offense 
triable by military commission and need not be charged separately. An 
accused may be charged with attempt without being charged with the 
substantive offense.

by the Accused to represent himself.
    (3) Detailed Defense Counsel shall have primary responsibility to 
prevent conflicts of interest related to the handling of the cases to 
which detailed.
    (4) Detailed Defense Counsel shall fulfill all responsibilities 
detailed in 32 CFR part 9, and Military Order of November 13, 2001,

Against Terrorism,'' those set forth in this part, and those assigned by 
the Chief Defense Counsel.

qualified Civilian Defense Counsel for compliance with all rules,

Military Order of November 13, 2001, ``Detention, Treatment, and Trial 
of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism,'' and 10 U.S.C. 
113(d) and 140(b). The provisions of 32 CFR part 10 are applicable to 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 14.3  Policies and procedures.

    (a) Application procedures. (1) Civilian attorneys may be 
prequalified as members of the pool of attorneys eligible to represent 
Accused before military commissions at no expense to the United States 
if, at the time of application, they meet the eligibility criteria set 
forth in 32 CFR 9.4(c)(3)(ii) as further detailed in this part, or they 
may be qualified on an ad hoc basis after being requested by an Accused. 
In both cases, qualification results in membership in the pool of 
available Civilian Defense Counsel.
    (2) An attorney seeking qualification as a member of the pool of 
available Civilian Defense Counsel shall submit an application, by 
letter, to: Office of the General Counsel, Department of Defense, (Attn: 
Chief Defense Counsel, Office of Military Commissions), 1600 Defense 
Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-1600. Applications will be comprised of 
the letter requesting qualification for membership, together with the 
following documents that demonstrate satisfaction of the criteria set 
forth in 32 CFR 9.4(c)(3)(ii):
    (i) Civilian Defense Counsel shall be United States citizens (32 CFR 
9.4(c)(3)(ii)(A)). Applicants will provide proof of citizenship (e.g., 
certified true copy of passport, birth certificate, or certificate of 
naturalization).
    (ii) Civilian Defense Counsel shall be admitted to the practice of 
law in a State, district, territory or possession of the United States, 
or before a Federal court (32 CFR 9.4(c)(3)(ii)(B)). Applicants will 
submit an official certificate showing that the applicant is an active 
member in good standing with the bar of a qualifying jurisdiction. The 
certificate must be dated within three months of the date of the Chief 
Defense Counsel's receipt of the application.
    (iii) Civilian Defense Counsel shall not have been the subject of 
any sanction or disciplinary action by any court, bar, or other 
competent governmental authority for relevant misconduct (32 CFR 
9.4(c)(2)(iii)).
    (A) An applicant shall submit a statement detailing all sanctions or 
disciplinary actions, pending or final, to which he has been subject, 
whether by a court, bar or other competent governmental authority, for 
misconduct of any kind. The statement shall identify the jurisdiction or 
authority that imposed the sanction or disciplinary action, together 
with any explanation deemed appropriate by the applicant. Additionally, 
the statement shall identify and explain any formal challenge to the 
attorney's fitness to practice law, regardless of the outcome of any 
subsequent proceedings. In the event that no sanction, disciplinary 
action or challenge has been imposed on or made against an applicant, 
the statement shall so state. Further, the applicant's statement shall 
identify each jurisdiction in which he has been admitted or to which he 
has applied to practice law, regardless of whether the applicant 
maintains a current active license in that jurisdiction, together with 
any dates of admission to or rejection by each such jurisdiction and, if 
no longer active, the date of and basis for inactivation. The 
information shall be submitted either in the form of a sworn notarized 
statement or as a declaration under penalty of perjury of the laws of 
the United States. The sworn statement or declaration must be executed 
and dated within three months of the date of the Chief Defense Counsel's 
receipt of the application.
    (B) Further, applicants shall submit a properly executed 
Authorization for Release of Information (Appendix A to this part), 
authorizing the Chief Defense Counsel or his designee to obtain 
information relevant to qualification of the applicant as a member of 
the Civilian Defense Counsel pool from each jurisdiction in which the 
applicant has been admitted or to which he has applied to practice law.
    (iv) Civilian Defense Counsel shall be determined to be eligible for 
access to information classified at the level SECRET or higher under the 
authority of

[[Page 50]]

and in accordance with the procedures described in Department of Defense 
Regulation, DoD 5200.2-R, ``Personnel Security Program.'' \1\ (32 CFR 
9.4(c)(2)(iv)
    (A) Civilian Defense Counsel applicants who possess a valid current 
security clearance of SECRET or higher shall provide, in writing, the 
date of their background investigation, the date such clearance was 
granted, the level of the clearance, and the adjudicating authority.
    (B) Civilian Defense Counsel applicants who do not possess a valid 
current security clearance of SECRET or higher shall state in writing 
their willingness to submit to a background investigation in accordance 
with DoD 5200.2-R and to pay any actual costs associated with the 
processing of the same. The security clearance application, 
investigation, and adjudication process will not be initiated until the 
applicant has submitted an application that otherwise fully complies 
with this part and the Chief Defense Counsel has determined that the 
applicant would otherwise be qualified for membership in the Civilian 
Defense Counsel pool. Favorable adjudication of the applicant's 
personnel security investigation must be completed before an applicant 
will be qualified for membership in the pool of Civilian Defense 
Counsel. The Chief Defense Counsel may, at his discretion, withhold 
qualification and wait to initiate the security clearance process until 
such time as the Civilian Defense Counsel's services are likely to be 
sought.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Available at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (v) Civilian Defense Counsel shall have signed a written agreement 
to comply with all applicable regulations or instructions for counsel, 
including any rules of court for conduct during the course of 
proceedings (32 CFR 9.4(c)(2)(v)). This requirement shall be satisfied 
by the execution of the Affidavit And Agreement By Civilian Defense 
Counsel at Appendix B to this part. The Affidavit And Agreement By 
Civilian Defense Counsel shall be executed and agreed to without change, 
(i.e., no omissions, additions or substitutions). Proper execution shall 
require the notarized signature of the applicant. The Affidavit And 
Agreement By Civilian Defense Counsel shall be dated within three months 
of the date of the Chief Defense Counsel's receipt of the application.
    (3) Applications mailed in a franked U.S. Government envelope or 
received through U.S. Government distribution will not be considered. 
Telefaxed or electronic mail application materials will not be accepted. 
Failure to provide all of the requisite information and documentation 
may result in rejection of the application. A false statement in any 
part of the application may preclude qualification and/or render the 
applicant liable for disciplinary or criminal sanction, including under 
18 U.S.C. 1001.
    (b) Application review. (1) The Chief Defense Counsel or his 
designee shall review all Civilian Defense Counsel pool applications for 
compliance with 32 CFR part 9 and Military Order of November 13, 2001, 
``Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War 
Against Terrorism,'' and with this part.
    (2) The Chief Defense Counsel shall consider all applicants for 
qualification as members of the Civilian Defense Counsel pool without 
regard to race, religion, color, sex, age, national origin, or other 
non-disqualifying physical or mental disability.
    (3) The Chief Defense Counsel may reject any Civilian Defense 
Counsel application that is incomplete or otherwise fails to comply with 
32 CFR part 9 and Military Order of November 13, 2001, ``Detention, 
Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against 
Terrorism,'' or with this part.
    (4) Subject to review by the General Counsel of the Department of 
Defense, the Chief Defense Counsel shall determine the number of 
qualified attorneys that shall constitute the pool of available Civilian 
Defense Counsel. Similarly, subject to review by the General Counsel of 
the Department of Defense, the Chief Defense Counsel shall determine the 
qualification of applicants for membership in such pool. This shall 
include determinations as to whether any sanction, disciplinary action, 
or

[[Page 51]]

challenge is related to relevant misconduct that would disqualify the 
Civilian Defense Counsel applicant.
    (5) The Chief Defense Counsel's determination as to each applicant's 
qualification for membership in the pool of qualified Civilian Defense 
Counsel shall be deemed effective as of the date of the Chief Defense 
Counsel's written notification publishing such determination to the 
applicant. Subsequent to this notification, the retention of qualified 
Civilian Defense Counsel is effected upon written entry of appearance, 
communicated to the military commission through the Chief Defense 
Counsel.
    (6) The Chief Defense Counsel may reconsider his determination as to 
an individual's qualification as a member of the Civilian Defense 
Counsel pool on the basis of subsequently discovered information 
indicating material nondisclosure or misrepresentation in the 
application, or material violation of obligations of the Civilian 
Defense Counsel, or other good cause, or the matter may be referred to 
the Appointing Authority or the General Counsel of the Department of 
Defense, who may revoke or suspend the qualification of any member of 
the Civilian Defense Counsel pool.

                        United States of America

                Authorization for Release of Information

(Carefully read this authorization to release information about you, 
then sign and date it in ink.)

    I authorize the Chief Defense Counsel, Office of Military 
Commissions, Department of Defense, his designee or other duly 
authorized representative of the Department of Defense who may be 
charged with assessing or determining my qualification for membership in 
the pool of Civilian Defense Counsel available to represent Accused

any sanction or disciplinary action to which I have been subject for 
misconduct of any kind; and any formal challenge to my fitness to 
practice law, regardless of the outcome of subsequent proceedings.
    I authorize custodians of such records or information and other 
sources of information pertaining to me to release such at the request 
of the officials named above, regardless of any previous agreement to 
the contrary.
    I understand that for certain custodians or sources of information a 
separate specific release may be required and that I may be contacted 
for the purposes of executing such at a later date.
    I understand that the records or information released by custodians 
and other sources of information are for official use by the Department 
of Defense, only for the purposes provided herein, and that they may be

           Affidavit and Agreement by Civilian Defense Counsel

    Pursuant to Section 4(C)(3)(b) of Department of Defense Military 
Commission Order No. 1, ``Procedures for Trials by Military Commissions 
of Certain Non-United States Citizens in the War Against Terrorism,'' 
dated March 21, 2002 (``MCO No. 1''), Military Commission Instructions 
No. 4, ``Responsibilities of the Chief Defense Counsel, Detailed Defense

accordance with the President's Military Order of November 13, 2001, 
``Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War 
Against Terrorism,'' 66 FR 57833 (Nov. 16, 2001) (``President's Military 
Order''), I [Name of Civilian Attorney], make this Affidavit and 
Agreement for the purposes of applying for qualification as a member of 
the pool of Civilian Defense Counsel available to represent Accused 
before military commissions and serving in that capacity.

[[Page 52]]

    I. Oaths or Affirmations. I swear or affirm that the following 
information is true to the best of my knowledge and belief:
    A. I have read and understand the President's Military Order, MCO 
No. 1, MCI No. 4, MCI No. 5, and all other Military Commission Orders 
and Instructions concerning the rules, regulations and instructions 
applicable to trial by military commissions. I will read all future 
Orders and Instructions applicable to trials by military commissions.
    B. I am aware that my qualification as a Civilian Defense Counsel 
does not guarantee my presence at closed military commission proceedings 
or guarantee my access to any information protected under Section 
6(D)(5) or Section 9 of MCO No. 1.
    II. Agreements. I hereby agree to comply with all applicable 
regulations and instructions for counsel, including any rules of court 
for conduct during the course of proceedings, and specifically agree, 
without limitation, to the following:
    A. I will notify the Chief Defense Counsel and, as applicable, the 
relevant Presiding Officer immediately if, after the execution of this 
Affidavit and Agreement but prior to the conclusion of proceedings 
(defined as the review and final decision of the President or, if 
designated, the Secretary of Defense), if there is any change in any of 
the information provided in my application, including this Affidavit and 
Agreement, for qualification as member of the Civilian Defense Counsel 
pool. I understand that such notification shall be in writing and shall 
set forth the substantive nature of the changed information.
    B. I will be well-prepared and will conduct the defense zealously, 
representing the Accused throughout the military commission process, 
from the inception of my representation through the completion of any 
post trial proceedings as detailed in Section 6(H) of MCO No. 1. I will 
ensure that these proceedings are my primary duty. I will not seek to 
delay or to continue the proceedings for reasons relating to matters 
that arise in the course of my law practice or other professional or 
personal activities that are not related to military commission 
proceedings.
    C. The Defense Team shall consist entirely of myself, Detailed 
Defense Counsel, and other personnel provided by the Chief Defense 
Counsel, the Presiding Officer, or the Appointing Authority. I will make 
no claim against the U.S. Government for any fees or costs associated 
with my conduct of the defense or related activities or efforts.
    D. Recognizing that my representation does not relieve Detailed 
Defense Counsel of duties specified in Section 4(C)(2) of MCO No. 1, I 
will work cooperatively with such counsel to ensure coordination of 
efforts and to ensure such counsel is capable of conducting the defense 
independently if necessary.
    E. During the pendency of the proceedings, unless I obtain approval 
in advance from the Presiding Officer to do otherwise, I will comply 
with the following restrictions on my travel and communications:
    1. I will not travel or transmit documents from the site of the 
proceedings without the approval of the Appointing Authority or the 
Presiding Officer. The Defense Team and I will otherwise perform all of 
our work relating to the proceedings, including any electronic or other 
research, at the site of the proceedings (except that this shall not 
apply during post-trial proceedings detailed in Section 6(H) of MCO No. 
1).
    2. I will not discuss or otherwise communicate or share documents or 
information about the case with anyone except persons who have been 
designated as members of the Defense Team in accordance with this 
Affidavit and Agreement and other applicable rules, regulations and 
instructions.
    F. At no time, to include any period subsequent to the conclusion of 
the proceedings, will I make any public or private statements regarding 
any closed sessions of the proceedings or any classified information or 
material, or document or material constituting protected information 
under MCO No. 1.
    G. I understand and agree to comply with all rules, regulations and 
instructions governing the handling of classified information and 
material. Furthermore, no document or material constituting protected 
information under MCO No. 1, regardless of its classification level, may 
leave the site of the proceedings.
    H. I understand that there may be reasonable restrictions on the 
time and duration of contact I may have with my client, as imposed by 
the Appointing Authority, the Presiding Officer, detention authorities, 
or regulation.
    I. I understand that my communications with my client, even if 
traditionally covered by the attorney-client privilege, may be subject 
to monitoring or review by government officials, using any available 
means, for security and intelligence purposes. I understand that any 
such monitoring will only take place in limited circumstances when 
approved by proper authority, and that any evidence or information 
derived from such communications will not be used in proceedings against 
the Accused who made or received the relevant communication. I further 
understand that communications are not protected if they would 
facilitate criminal acts or a conspiracy to commit criminal acts, or if 
those communications are not related to the seeking or providing of 
legal advice.
    J. I agree that I shall reveal to the Chief Defense Counsel and any 
other appropriate authorities, information relating to the 
representation of my client to the extent that I reasonably believe 
necessary to prevent the

[[Page 53]]

commission of a future criminal act that I believe is likely to result 
in death or substantial bodily harm, or significant impairment of 
national security.
    K. I understand and agree that nothing in this Affidavit and 
Agreement creates any substantive, procedural, or other rights for me as 
counsel or for my client(s).

<R05>
Sec. 16.1  Purpose.

    This part promulgates policy, assigns responsibilities, and 
prescribes procedures for matters related to sentencing of persons with 
regard to whom a finding of guilty is entered for an offense referred 
for trial by a military commission appointed pursuant to 32 CFR part 9 
and Military Order of November 13, 2001, ``Detention, Treatment, and 
Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism'' (3 CFR 2001 
Comp., p. 918, 66 FR 57833).


<R05>
Sec. 16.2  Authority.

    This part is issued pursuant to 32 CFR 9.7(a) and in accordance with 
Military Order of November 13, 2001, ``Detention, Treatment, and Trial 
of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism,'' and 10 U.S.C. 
113(d) and 140(b). The provisions of 32 CFR part 10 are applicable to 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 16.3  Available sentences.

    (a) General. 32 CFR part 9 permits a military commission wide 
latitude in sentencing. Any lawful punishment or condition of punishment 
is authorized, including death, so long as the prerequisites detailed in 
32 CFR part 9 are met. Detention associated with an individual's status 
as an enemy combatant shall not be considered to fulfill any term of 
imprisonment imposed by a military commission. The sentence 
determination should be made while bearing in mind that there are 
several principal reasons for a sentence given to those who violate the 
law. Such reasons include: punishment of the wrongdoer; protection of 
society from the wrongdoer; deterrence of the wrongdoer and those who 
know of his crimes and sentence from committing the same or similar 
offenses; and rehabilitation of the wrongdoer. In determining an 
appropriate sentence, the weight to be accorded any or all of these 
reasons rests solely within the discretion of commission members. All 
sentences should, however, be grounded in a recognition that military 
commissions are a function of the President's war-fighting role as 
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States and of the 
broad deterrent impact associated with a sentence's effect on adherence 
to the laws and customs of war in general.
    (b) Conditions of imprisonment. Decisions regarding the location 
designated for any imprisonment, the conditions under which a sentence 
to imprisonment is served, or the privileges accorded one during any 
period of imprisonment should generally not be made by the commission. 
Those decisions and actions, however, may be appropriate subjects for 
recommendation to the person making a final decision on the sentence in 
accordance with of 32 CFR 9.6(h).
    (c) Prospective recommendations for sentence modification. A 
sentence imposed by military commission may be accompanied by a 
recommendation to suspend, remit, commute or otherwise modify the 
adjudged sentence in concert with one or more conditions upon

[[Page 55]]

which the suspension, remission, commutation, or other modification is 
contingent (usually relating to the performance, behavior or conduct of 
the Accused). Unless otherwise directed, a decision or action in 
accordance with such a recommendation will be effected by direction or 
delegation to the Appointing Authority by the official making a final 
decision on the sentence in accordance with of 32 CFR 9.6(h).


<R05>
Sec. 16.4  Sentencing procedures.

    (a) General. 32 CFR part 9 permits the military commission 
substantial discretion regarding the conduct of sentencing proceedings. 
Sentencing proceedings should normally proceed expeditiously. In the 
discretion of the Presiding Officer, as limited by the Appointing 
Authority, reasonable delay between the announcement of findings and the 
commencement of sentencing proceedings may be authorized to facilitate 
the conduct of proceedings in accordance with of 32 CFR 9.6(b).
    (b) Information relevant to sentencing. 32 CFR 9.6(e)(10) permits 
the Prosecution and Defense to present information to aid the military 
commission in determining an appropriate sentence. Such information may 
include a recommendation of an appropriate sentence, information 
regarding sentence ranges for analogous offenses (e.g., the sentencing 
range under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines that could be applicable 
to the Accused for the most analogous federal offenses), and other 
relevant information. Regardless of any presentation by the Prosecution 
or Defense, the military commission shall consider any evidence admitted 
for consideration prior to findings regarding guilt. The Presiding 
Officer may limit or require the presentation of certain information 
consistent with 32 CFR part 9 and Military Order of November 13, 2001, 
``Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War 
Against Terrorism'.
    (c) Cases involving plea agreements. In accordance with 32 CFR 
9.6(a)(4), after determining the voluntary and informed nature of a plea 
agreement approved by the Appointing Authority, the military commission 
is bound to adjudge findings and a sentence pursuant to that plea 
agreement. Accordingly, the Presiding Officer may exercise the authority 
granted in of 32 CFR 9.6(e) to curtail or preclude the presentation of 
information and argument relative to the military commission's 
determination of an appropriate sentence.
    (d) Special duties. In cases involving plea agreements or 
recommendations for certain conditions of imprisonment or prospective 
sentence modification, the Prosecution and Defense shall provide 
whatever post-trial information or recommendation as is relevant to any 
subsequent decision regarding such condition or suspension, remission, 
commutation, or other modification recommendation associated with the 
sentence.

prescribes procedures for the conduct of trials by a military commission 
appointed pursuant to 32 CFR part 9 and Military Order of November 13,

this part.


<R05>
Sec. 17.3  Commission personnel.

    (a) Appointment and removal of Commission members. (1) In accordance 
with

[[Page 56]]

32 CFR part 9, the Appointing Authority shall appoint at least three but 
no more than seven members and one or two alternate members. The 
Appointing Authority may remove members and alternate members for good 
cause. In the event a member (or alternate member) is removed for good 
cause, the Appointing Authority may replace the member, direct that an 
alternate member serve in the place of the original member, direct that 
proceedings simply continue without the member, or convene a new 
commission. In the absence of guidance from the Appointing Authority 
regarding replacement, the Presiding Officer shall select an alternate 
member to replace the member in question.
    (2) The Presiding Officer shall determine if it is necessary to 
conduct or permit questioning of members (including the Presiding 
Officer) on issues of whether there is good cause for their removal. The 
Presiding Officer may permit questioning in any manner he deems 
appropriate. Consistent with 32 CFR part 9, any such questioning shall 
be narrowly focused on issues pertaining to whether good cause may exist 
for the removal of any member.
    (3) From time to time, it may be appropriate for a Presiding Officer 
to forward to the Appointing Authority information and, if appropriate, 
a recommendation relevant to the question of whether a member (including 
the Presiding Officer) should be removed for good cause. While awaiting 
the Appointing Authority's decision on such matter, the Presiding 
Officer may elect either to hold proceedings in abeyance or to continue. 
The Presiding Officer may issue any appropriate instructions to the 
member whose continued service is in question. A military commission 
shall not engage in deliberations on findings or sentence prior to the 
Appointing Authority's decision in any case in which the Presiding 
Officer has recommended a member's removal.
    (b) Military commission security officer. The Appointing Authority 
may detail a Security Officer to advise a military commission on matters 
related to classified and protected information. In addition to any 
other duties assigned by the Appointing Authority, the Security Officer 
shall ensure that all classified or protected evidence and information 
is appropriately safeguarded at all times and that only personnel with 
the appropriate clearances and authorizations are present when 
classified or protected materials are presented before military 
commissions.
    (c) Other military commission personnel. The Appointing Authority 
may detail court reporters, interpreters, security personnel, bailiffs, 
clerks, and any other personnel to a military commission as deemed 
necessary. In the absence of a detailing by the Appointing Authority, 
the Chief Prosecutor shall be responsible to ensure the availability of 
necessary or appropriate personnel to facilitate the impartial and 
expeditious conduct of full and fair trials by military commission.


<R05>
Sec. 17.4  Interlocutory questions.

    (a) Certification of interlocutory questions. The Presiding Officer 
shall generally adjudicate all motions and questions that arise during 
the course of a trial by military commission. In accordance with 32 CFR 
9.4(a)(5)(iv), however, the Presiding Officer shall certify all 
interlocutory questions, the disposition of which would effect a 
termination of proceedings with respect to a charge, for decision by the 
Appointing Authority. In addition, the Presiding Officer may certify 
other interlocutory questions to the Appointing Authority as the 
Presiding Officer deems appropriate.
    (b) Submission of interlocutory questions. The Presiding Officer 
shall determine what, if any, documentary or other materials should be 
forwarded to the Appointing Authority in conjunction with an 
interlocutory question.
    (c) Effect of interlocutory question certification on proceedings. 
While decision by the Appointing Authority is pending on any certified 
interlocutory question, the Presiding Officer may elect either to hold 
proceedings in abeyance or to continue.


<R05>
Sec. 17.5  Implied duties of the presiding officer.

    The Presiding Officer shall ensure the execution of all ancillary 
functions necessary for the impartial and expeditious conduct of a full 
and fair trial by military commission in accordance

[[Page 57]]

with 32 CFR part 9. Such functions include, for example, scheduling the 
time and place of convening of a military commission, ensuring that an 
oath or affirmation is administered to witnesses and military commission 
personnel as appropriate, conducting appropriate in camera meetings to 
facilitate efficient trial proceedings, and providing necessary 
instructions to other commission members. The Presiding Officer shall 
rule on appropriate motions or, at his discretion consistent with 32 CFR 
part 9, may submit them to the commission for decision or to the 
Appointing Authority as a certified interlocutory question.


<R05>
Sec. 17.6  Disclosures.

    (a) General. Unless directed otherwise by the Presiding Officer upon 
a showing of good cause or for some other reason, counsel for the 
Prosecution and the Defense shall provide to opposing counsel, at least 
one week prior to the scheduled convening of a military commission, 
copies of all information intended for presentation as evidence at 
trial, copies of all motions the party intends to raise before the 
military commission, and names and contact information of all witnesses 
a party intends to call. Motions shall also be provided to the Presiding 
Officer at the time they are provided to opposing counsel. Unless 
directed otherwise by the Presiding Officer, written responses to any 
motions will be provided to opposing counsel and the Presiding Officer 
no later than three days prior to the scheduled convening of a military 
commission.
    (b) Notifications by the prosecution. The Prosecution shall provide 
the Defense with access to evidence known to the Prosecution that tends 
to exculpate the Accused as soon as practicable, and in no instance 
later than one week prior to the scheduled convening of a military 
commission.
    (c) Notifications by the defense. The Defense shall give notice to 
the Prosecution of any intent to raise an affirmative defense to any 
charge at least one week prior to the scheduled convening of a military 
commission.
    (d) Evidence related to mental responsibility. If the Defense 
indicates an intent to raise a defense of lack of mental responsibility 
or introduce expert testimony regarding an Accused's mental condition, 
the prosecution may require that the Accused submit to a mental 
examination by a military psychologist or psychiatrist, and both parties 
shall have access to the results of that examination.

                         Subpart A_Introduction


<R05>
Sec. 21.100  What are the purposes of this part?

    This part of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations:
    (a) Provides general information about the Defense Grant and 
Agreement Regulatory System (DGARS).
    (b) Sets forth general policies and procedures related to DoD 
Components' overall management of functions related to assistance and 
certain other nonprocurement instruments subject to the DGARS (see Sec.

<R04>
         Subpart B_Defense Grant and Agreement Regulatory System


<R05>
Sec. 21.200  What is the Defense Grant and Agreement Regulatory System 
(DGARS)?

    The Defense Grant and Agreement Regulatory System (DGARS) is the 
system of regulatory policies and procedures for the award and 
administration of DoD Components' assistance and other nonprocurement 
awards. DoD Directive 3210.6\1\ established the DGARS.

Services Internet site http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives. Paper copies 
may be obtained, at cost, from the National Technical Information 
Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 21.205  What types of instruments are covered by the DGARS?

    The Defense Grant and Agreement Regulatory System (DGARS) applies to 
the following types of funding instruments awarded by DoD Components:
    (a) All grants, cooperative agreements, and technology investment 
agreements.
    (b) Other nonprocurement instruments, as needed to implement 
statutes, Executive orders, or other Federal Governmentwide rules that 
apply to those other nonprocurement instruments, as well as to grants 
and cooperative agreements.


<R05>
Sec. 21.210  What are the purposes of the DGARS?

    The purposes of the DGARS are to provide uniform policies and 
procedures for DoD Components' awards, in order to meet DoD needs for:
    (a) Efficient program execution, effective program oversight, and 
proper stewardship of Federal funds.
    (b) Compliance with relevant statutes; Executive orders; and 
applicable guidance, such as Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
circulars.
    (c) Collection from DoD Components, retention, and dissemination of 
management and fiscal data related to awards.


<R05>
Sec. 21.215  Who is responsible for the DGARS?

    The Director of Defense Research and Engineering, or his or her 
designee, develops and implements DGARS policies and procedures. He or 
she does so by issuing and maintaining the DoD publications that 
comprise the DGARS.


<R05>
Sec. 21.220  What publications are in the DGARS?

    A DoD publication (DoD 3210.6-R \2\) entitled ``The DoD Grant and 
Agreement Regulations'' is the principal element of the DGARS. The 
Director of Defense Research and Engineering also may publish DGARS 
policies and procedures in DoD instructions and other DoD publications, 
as appropriate.

            Subpart C_The DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 21.300  What instruments are subject to the DoD Grant and Agreement 
Regulations (DoDGARs)?

    (a) The types of instruments that are subject to the DoDGARs vary 
from one

[[Page 63]]

portion of the DoDGARs to another. The types of instruments include 
grants, cooperative agreements, and technology investment agreements. 
Some portions of the DoDGARs apply to other types of assistance or 
nonprocurement instruments. The term ``awards,'' as defined in subpart D 
of this part, is used in this part to refer collectively to all of the 
types of instruments that are subject to one or more portions of the 
DoDGARs.
    (b) Note that each portion of the DoDGARs identifies the types of 
instruments to which it applies. However, grants officers and agreements 
officers must exercise caution when determining the applicability of 
some Governmentwide rules that are included within the DoDGARs, because 
a term may be defined differently in a Governmentwide rule than it is 
defined elsewhere in the DoDGARs. One example is part 33 of the DoDGARs 
(32 CFR part 33), which contains administrative requirements for awards 
to State and local governments. That DoDGARs part is the DoD's 
codification of the Governmentwide rule implementing OMB Circular A-
102.\3\ Part 33 states that it applies to grants, but defines the term 
``grant'' to include cooperative agreements and other forms of financial 
assistance.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) For convenience, the table in Appendix A to this part provides 
an overview of the applicability of the various portions of the DoDGARs.


<R05>
Sec. 21.305  What is the purpose of the DoDGARs?

    The DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations provide uniform policies and 
procedures for the award and administration of DoD Components' awards. 
The DoDGARs are the primary DoD regulations for achieving the DGARS 
purposes described in Sec. 21.210.


<R05>
Sec. 21.310  Who ensures DoD Component compliance with the DoDGARs?

    The Head of each DoD Component that makes or administers awards, or 
his or her designee, is responsible for ensuring compliance with the 
DoDGARs within that DoD Component.


<R05>
Sec. 21.315  May DoD Components issue supplemental policies and 
procedures to implement the DoDGARs?

    Yes, Heads of DoD Components or their designees may issue 
regulations, procedures, or instructions to implement the DGARS or 
supplement the DoDGARs to satisfy needs that are specific to the DoD 
Component, as long as the regulations, procedures, or instructions do 
not impose additional costs or administrative burdens on recipients or 
potential recipients.


<R05>
Sec. 21.320  Are there areas in which DoD Components must establish 
policies and procedures to implement the DoDGARs?

    Yes, Heads of DoD Components or their designees must establish 
policies and procedures in areas where uniform policies and procedures 
throughout the DoD Component are required, such as for:
    (a) Requesting class deviations from the DoDGARs (see Sec. Sec. 
21.335(b) and 21.340(a)) or exemptions from the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 
6301 through 6308, that govern the appropriate use of contracts, grants, 
and cooperative agreements (see 32 CFR 22.220).
    (b) Designating one or more Grant Appeal Authorities to resolve 
claims, disputes, and appeals (see 32 CFR 22.815).
    (c) Reporting data on assistance awards and programs, as required by 
31 U.S.C. chapter 61 (see subpart E of this part).
    (d) Prescribing requirements for use and disposition of real 
property acquired under awards, if the DoD Component makes any awards to 
institutions of higher education or to other nonprofit organizations 
under which real property is acquired in whole or in part with Federal 
funds (see 32 CFR 32.32).


<R05>
Sec. 21.325  Do acquisition regulations also apply to DoD grants and 
agreements?

    Unless the DoDGARs specify that they apply, policies and procedures 
in the following acquisition regulations that apply to procurement 
contracts do

[[Page 64]]

not apply to grants, cooperative agreements, technology investment 
agreements, or to other assistance or nonprocurement awards:
    (a) The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)(48 CFR parts 1-53).
    (b) The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS)(48 
CFR parts 201-270).
    (c) DoD Component supplements to the FAR and DFARS.


<R05>
Sec. 21.330  How are the DoDGARs published and maintained?

    (a) The DoD publishes the DoDGARs in chapter I, subchapter C, Title 
32 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and in a separate internal 
DoD document (DoD 3210.6-R). The DoD document is divided into parts, 
subparts, and sections, to parallel the CFR publication. Cross-
references within the DoDGARs are stated as CFR citations (e.g., a 
reference to Sec. 21.215 in part 21 would be to 32 CFR 21.215).
    (b) The DoD publishes updates to the DoDGARs in the Federal 
Register. When finalized, the DoD also posts the updates to the internal 
DoD document on the World Wide Web at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/
directives.
    (c) A standing working group recommends revisions to the DoDGARs to 
the Director of Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&E). The DDR&E, 
Director of Defense Procurement, and each Military Department must be 
represented on the working group. Other DoD Components that make or 
administer awards may also nominate representatives. The working group 
meets when necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 21.335  Who can authorize deviations from the DoDGARs?

    (a) The Head of the DoD Component or his or her designee may 
authorize individual deviations from the DoDGARs, which are deviations 
that affect only one award, if the deviations are not prohibited by 
statute, executive order or regulation.
    (b) The Director of Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&E) or his 
or her designee must approve in advance any class deviation that affects 
more than one award. Note that OMB concurrence also is required for 
class deviations from two parts of the DoDGARs, 32 CFR parts 32 and 33, 
in accordance with 32 CFR 32.4 and 33.6, respectively.


<R05>
Sec. 21.340  What are the procedures for requesting and documenting 
deviations?

    (a) DoD Components must submit copies of justifications and agency 
approvals for individual deviations and written requests for class 
deviations to: Deputy Director of Defense Research and Engineering, 
ATTN: Basic Research, 3080 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-3080.
    (b) Grants officers and agreements officers must maintain copies of 
requests and approvals for individual and class deviations in award 
files.


<R04>
Subpart D_Authorities and Responsibilities for Making and Administering 
                            Assistance Awards


<R05>
Sec. 21.400  To what instruments does this subpart apply?

    This subpart applies to grants, cooperative agreements, and 
technology investment agreements, which are legal instruments used to 
reflect assistance relationships between the United States Government 
and recipients.


<R05>
Sec. 21.405  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart describes the sources and flow of authority to make or 
administer assistance awards, and assigns the broad responsibilities 
associated with DoD Components' use of those instruments.


<R05>
Sec. 21.410  Must a DoD Component have statutory authority to make an 
assistance award?

    Yes, the use of an assistance instrument to carry out a program 
requires authorizing legislation. That is unlike the use of a 
procurement contract, for which Federal agencies have inherent, 
Constitutional authority.


<R05>
Sec. 21.415  Must the statutory authority specifically mention the use 
of grants or other assistance instruments?

    No, the statutory authority described in Sec. 21.410 need not 
specifically say that

[[Page 65]]

the purpose of the program is assistance or mention the use of any type 
of assistance instrument. However, the intent of the statute must 
support a judgment that the use of an assistance instrument is 
appropriate. For example, a DoD Component may judge that the principal 
purpose of a program for which it has authorizing legislation is 
assistance, rather than acquisition. The DoD Component would properly 
use an assistance instrument to carry out that program, in accordance 
with 31 U.S.C. chapter 63.


<R05>
Sec. 21.420  Under what types of statutory authorities do DoD Components 
award assistance instruments?

    DoD Components may use assistance instruments under a number of 
statutory authorities that fall into three categories:
    (a) Authorities that statutes provide to the Secretary of Defense. 
These authorities generally are delegated by the Secretary of Defense to 
Heads of DoD Components, usually through DoD directives, instructions, 
or policy memoranda that are not part of the Defense Grant and Agreement 
Regulatory System. Examples of statutory authorities in this category 
are:
    (1) Authority under 10 U.S.C. 2391 to award grants or cooperative 
agreements to help State and local governments alleviate serious 
economic impacts of defense program changes (e.g., base openings and 
closings, contract changes, and personnel reductions and increases).
    (2) Authority under 10 U.S.C. 2413 to enter into cooperative 
agreements with entities that furnish procurement technical assistance 
to businesses.
    (b) Authorities that statutes may provide directly to Heads of DoD 
Components. When a statute authorizes the Head of a DoD Component to use 
a funding instrument to carry out a program with a principal purpose of 
assistance, use of that authority requires no delegation by the 
Secretary of Defense. For example, 10 U.S.C. 2358 authorizes the 
Secretaries of the Military Departments, in addition to the Secretary of 
Defense, to perform research and development projects through grants and 
cooperative agreements. Similarly, 10 U.S.C. 2371 provides authority for 
the Secretaries of the Military Departments and Secretary of Defense to 
carry out basic, applied, or advanced research projects using assistance 
instruments other than grants and cooperative agreements. A Military 
Department's use of the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2358 or 10 U.S.C. 2371 
therefore requires no delegation by the Secretary of Defense.
    (c) Authorities that arise indirectly as the result of statute. For 
example, authority to use an assistance instrument may result from:
    (1) A federal statute authorizing a program that is consistent with 
an assistance relationship (i.e., the support or stimulation of a public 
purpose, rather than the acquisition of a good or service for the direct 
benefit of the Department of Defense). In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 
chapter 63, such a program would appropriately be carried out through 
the use of grants or cooperative agreements. Depending upon the nature 
of the program (e.g., research) and whether the program statute includes 
authority for any specific types of instruments, there also may be 
authority to use other assistance instruments.
    (2) Exemptions requested by the Department of Defense and granted by 
the Office of Management and Budget under 31 U.S.C. 6307, as described 
in 32 CFR 22.220.


<R05>
Sec. 21.425  How does a DoD Component's authority flow to awarding and 
administering activities?

    The Head of a DoD Component, or his or her designee, may delegate to 
the heads of contracting activities (HCAs) within the Component, that 
Component's authority to make and administer awards, to appoint grants 
officers and agreements officers (see Sec. Sec. 21.435 through 21.450), 
and to broadly manage the DoD Component's functions related to 
assistance instruments. The HCA is the same official (or officials) 
designated as the head of the contracting activity for procurement 
contracts, as defined at 48 CFR 2.101. The intent is that overall 
management responsibilities for a DoD Component's functions related to 
nonprocurement instruments be assigned only to officials that

[[Page 66]]

have similar responsibilities for procurement contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 21.430  What are the responsibilities of the head of the awarding 
or administering activity?

    When designated by the Head of the DoD Component or his or her 
designee (see 32 CFR 21.425), the head of the awarding or administering 
activity (i.e., the HCA) is responsible for the awards made by or 
assigned to that activity. He or she must supervise and establish 
internal policies and procedures for that activity's awards.


<R05>
Sec. 21.435  Must DoD Components formally select and appoint grants 
officers and agreements officers?

    Yes, each DoD Component that awards grants or enters into 
cooperative agreements must have a formal process (see Sec. 21.425) for 
selecting and appointing grants officers and for terminating their 
appointments. Similarly, each DoD Component that awards or administers 
technology investment agreements must have a process for selecting and 
appointing agreements officers and for terminating their appointments.


<R05>
Sec. 21.440  What are the standards for selecting and appointing grants 
officers and agreements officers?

    In selecting grants officers and agreements officers, DoD Components 
must use the following minimum standards:
    (a) In selecting a grants officer, the appointing official must 
judge whether the candidate has the necessary experience, training, 
education, business acumen, judgment, and knowledge of assistance 
instruments and contracts to function effectively as a grants officer. 
The appointing official also must take those attributes of the candidate 
into account when deciding the complexity and dollar value of the grants 
and cooperative agreements to be assigned.
    (b) In selecting an agreements officer, the appointing official must 
consider all of the same factors as in paragraph (a) of this section. In 
addition, the appointing official must consider the candidate's ability 
to function in the less structured environment of technology investment 
agreements, where the rules provide more latitude and the individual 
must have a greater capacity for exercising judgment. Agreements 
officers therefore should be individuals who have demonstrated expertise 
in executing complex assistance and acquisition instruments.


<R05>
Sec. 21.445  What are the requirements for a grants officer's or 
agreements officer's statement of appointment?

    A statement of a grants officer's or agreements officer's 
appointment:
    (a) Must be in writing.
    (b) Must clearly state the limits of the individual's authority, 
other than limits contained in applicable laws or regulations. 
Information on those limits of a grants officer's or agreements 
officer's authority must be readily available to the public and agency 
personnel.
    (c) May, if the individual is a contracting officer, be incorporated 
into his or her statement of appointment as a contracting officer (i.e., 
there does not need to be a separate written statement of appointment 
for assistance instruments).


<R05>
Sec. 21.450  What are the requirements for a termination of a grants 
officer's or agreements officer's appointment?

    A termination of a grants officer's or agreements officer's 
authority:
    (a) Must be in writing, unless the written statement of appointment 
provides for automatic termination.
    (b) May not be retroactive.
    (c) May be integrated into a written termination of the individual's 
appointment as a contracting officer, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 21.455  Who can sign, administer, or terminate assistance 
instruments?

    Only grants officers are authorized to sign, administer, or 
terminate grants or cooperative agreements (other than technology 
investment agreements) on behalf of the Department of Defense. 
Similarly, only agreements officers may sign, administer, or terminate 
technology investment agreements.


<R05>
Sec. 21.460  What is the extent of grants officers' and agreements 
officers' authority?

    Grants officers and agreements officers may bind the Government only 
to the extent of the authority delegated

[[Page 67]]

to them in their written statements of appointment (see Sec. 21.445).


<R05>
Sec. 21.465  What are grants officers' and agreements officers' 
responsibilities?

    Grants officers and agreements officers should be allowed wide 
latitude to exercise judgment in performing their responsibilities, 
which are to ensure that:
    (a) Individual awards are used effectively in the execution of DoD 
programs, and are made and administered in accordance with applicable 
laws, Executive orders, regulations, and DoD policies.
    (b) Sufficient funds are available for obligation.
    (c) Recipients of awards receive impartial, fair, and equitable 
treatment.


<R04>
 Subpart E_Information Reporting on Awards Subject to 31 U.S.C. Chapter 
                                   61


<R05>
Sec. 21.500  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for compiling and 
reporting data related to DoD awards and programs that are subject to 
information reporting requirements of 31 U.S.C. chapter 61. That chapter 
of the U.S. Code requires the Office of Management and Budget to 
maintain a Governmentwide information system to collect data on Federal 
agencies' domestic assistance awards and programs.


<R05>
Sec. 21.505  What is the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA)?

    The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) is a 
Governmentwide compilation of information about domestic assistance 
programs. It covers all domestic assistance programs and activities, 
regardless of the number of awards made under the program, the total 
dollar value of assistance provided, or the duration. In addition to 
programs using grants and agreements, covered programs include those 
providing assistance in other forms, such as payments in lieu of taxes 
or indirect assistance resulting from Federal operations.


<R05>
Sec. 21.510  Why does the DoD report information to the CFDA?

    The Federal Program Information Act (31 U.S.C. 6101 through 6106), 
as implemented through OMB Circular A-89,\4\ requires the Department of 
Defense and other Federal agencies to provide certain information about 
their domestic assistance programs to the OMB and the General Services 
Administration (GSA). The GSA makes this information available to the 
public by publishing it in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance 
(CFDA) and maintaining the Federal Assistance Programs Retrieval System, 
a computerized data base of the information.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See footnote 3 to Sec. 21.300(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 21.515  Who reports the information for the CFDA?

    (a) Each DoD Component that provides domestic financial assistance 
must:
    (1) Report to the Director of Information, Operations and Reports, 
Washington Headquarters Services (DIOR, WHS) all new programs and 
changes as they occur or as the DoD Component submits its annual updates 
to existing CFDA information.
    (2) Identify to the DIOR, WHS a point-of-contact who will be 
responsible for reporting the program information and for responding to 
inquiries related to it.
    (b) The DIOR, WHS is the Department of Defense's single office for 
collecting, compiling and reporting such program information to the OMB 
and GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 21.520  What are the purposes of the Defense Assistance Awards 
Data System (DAADS)?

    Data from the Defense Assistance Awards Data System (DAADS) are used 
to provide:
    (a) DoD inputs to meet statutory requirements for Federal 
Governmentwide reporting of data related to obligations of funds by 
assistance instrument.
    (b) A basis for meeting Governmentwide requirements to report to the

[[Page 68]]

Federal Assistance Awards Data System (FAADS) maintained by the 
Department of Commerce and for preparing other recurring and special 
reports to the President, the Congress, the General Accounting Office, 
and the public.
    (c) Information to support policy formulation and implementation and 
to meet management oversight requirements related to the use of awards.


<R05>
Sec. 21.525  Who issues policy guidance for the DAADS?

    The Deputy Director, Defense Research and Engineering (DDDR&E), or 
his or her designee, issues necessary policy guidance for the Defense 
Assistance Awards Data System.


<R05>
Sec. 21.530  Who operates the DAADS?

    The Director of Information Operations and Reports, Washington 
Headquarters Services (DIOR, WHS), consistent with guidance issued by 
the DDDR&E:
    (a) Processes DAADS information on a quarterly basis and prepares 
recurring and special reports using such information.
    (b) Prepares, updates, and disseminates instructions for reporting 
information to the DAADS. The instructions are to specify procedures, 
formats, and editing processes to be used by DoD Components, including 
record layout, submission deadlines, media, methods of submission, and 
error correction schedules.


<R05>
Sec. 21.535  Do DoD Components have central points for collecting DAADS 
data?

    Each DoD Component must have a central point for collecting DAADS 
information from contracting activities within that DoD Component. The 
central points are as follows:
    (a) For the Army: As directed by the U.S. Army Contracting Support 
Agency.
    (b) For the Navy: As directed by the Office of Naval Research.
    (c) For the Air Force: As directed by the Office of the Secretary of 
the Air Force, Acquisition Contracting Policy and Implementation 
Division (SAF/AQCP).
    (d) For the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Defense Agencies, 
and DoD Field Activities: Each Defense Agency must identify a central 
point for collecting and reporting DAADS information to the DIOR, WHS, 
at the address given in Sec. 21.555(a). DIOR, WHS serves as the central 
point for offices and activities within the Office of the Secretary of 
Defense and for DoD Field Activities.


<R05>
Sec. 21.540  What are the duties of the DoD Components' central points 
for the DAADS?

    The office that serves, in accordance with Sec. 21.535, as the 
central point for collecting DAADS information from contracting 
activities within each DoD Component must:
    (a) Establish internal procedures to ensure reporting by contracting 
activities that make awards subject to 31 U.S.C. chapter 61.
    (b) Collect information required by DD Form 2566,\5\ ``DoD 
Assistance Award Action Report,'' from those contracting activities, and 
report it to DIOR, WHS, in accordance with Sec. Sec. 21.545 through 
21.555.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Department of Defense forms are available at Internet site 
http://www.dior.whs.mil/ICDHOME/FORMTAB.HTM.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Submit to the DIOR, WHS, any recommended changes to the DAADS.


<R05>
Sec. 21.545  Must DoD Components report every obligation to the DAADS?

    Yes, DoD Components' central points must collect and report the data 
required by the DD Form 2566 for each individual action that involves 
the obligation or deobligation of Federal funds for an award that is 
subject to 31 U.S.C. chapter 61.


<R05>
Sec. 21.550  Must DoD Components relate reported actions to listings 
in the CFDA?

    Yes, DoD Components' central points must report each action as an 
obligation or deobligation under a specific programmatic listing in the 
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA, see Sec. 21.505). The 
programmatic listing to be shown is the one that provided the funds 
being obligated or deobligated. For example, if a grants officer or 
agreements officer in one

[[Page 69]]

DoD Component obligates appropriations of a second DoD Component's 
programmatic listing, the grants officer or agreements officer must show 
the CFDA programmatic listing of the second DoD Component on the DD Form 
2566.


<R05>
Sec. 21.555  When and how must DoD Components report to the DAADS?

    DoD Components' central points must report:
    (a) On a quarterly basis to DIOR, WHS. For the first three quarters 
of the Federal fiscal year, the data are due by close-of-business (COB) 
on the 15th day after the end of the quarter (i.e., first-quarter data 
are due by COB on January 15th, second-quarter data by COB April 15th, 
and third-quarter data by COB July 15th). Fourth-quarter data are due by 
COB October 25th, the 25th day after the end of the quarter. If any due

<R05>
Sec. 21.560  Must DoD Components assign numbers uniformly to awards?

    Yes, DoD Components must assign identifying numbers to all awards 
subject to this subpart, including grants, cooperative agreements, and 
technology investment agreements. The uniform numbering system parallels 
the procurement instrument identification (PII) numbering system 
specified in 48 CFR 204.70 (in the ``Defense Federal Acquisition 
Regulation Supplement''), as follows:
    (a) The first six alphanumeric characters of the assigned number 
must be identical to those specified by 48 CFR 204.7003(a)(1) to 
identify the DoD Component and contracting activity.
    (b) The seventh and eighth positions must be the last two digits of 
the fiscal year in which the number is assigned to the grant, 
cooperative agreement, or other nonprocurement instrument.
    (c) The 9th position must be a number:
    (1) ``1'' for grants.
    (2) ``2'' for cooperative agreements, including technology 
investment agreements that are cooperative agreements (see Appendix B to 
32 CFR part 37).
    (3) ``3'' for other nonprocurement instruments, including technology 
investment agreements that are not cooperative agreements.
    (d) The 10th through 13th positions must be the serial number of the 
instrument. DoD Components and contracting activities need not follow 
any specific pattern in assigning these numbers and may create multiple 
series of letters and numbers to meet internal needs for distinguishing 
between various sets of awards.

<R04>
                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 22.100  Purpose, relation to other parts, and organization.

    (a) This part outlines grants officers' and DoD Components' 
responsibilities related to the award and administration of grants and 
cooperative agreements.
    (b) In doing so, it also supplements other parts of the DoD Grant 
and Agreement Regulations (DoDGARs) that are either Governmentwide rules 
or DoD implementation of Governmentwide guidance in Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) Circulars. Those other parts of the DoDGARs, which are 
referenced as appropriate in this part, are:
    (1) Governmentwide rules on debarment, suspension and drug-free 
workplace requirements, in 32 CFR part 25.
    (2) The Governmentwide rule on lobbying restrictions, in 32 CFR part 
28.
    (3) Administrative requirements for grants and agreements awarded to 
specific types of recipients:
    (i) For State and local governmental organizations, in the 
Governmentwide rule at 32 CFR part 33.
    (ii) For institutions of higher education and other nonprofit 
organizations, at 32 CFR part 32.

[[Page 73]]

    (iii) For for-profit organizations, at 32 CFR part 34.
    (c) The organization of this part parallels the award and 
administration process, from pre-award through post-award matters. It 
therefore is organized in the same manner as the parts of the DoDGARs 
(32 CFR parts 32, 33, and 34) that prescribe administrative requirements 
for specific types of recipients.


<R05>
Sec. 22.105  Definitions.

    Other than the terms defined in this section, terms used in this 
part are defined in 32 CFR part 21, subpart F.
    Administrative offset. An action whereby money payable by the United 
States Government to, or held by the Government for, a recipient is 
withheld to satisfy a delinquent debt the recipient owes the Government.
    Advanced research. Advanced technology development that creates new 
technology or demonstrates the viability of applying existing technology 
to new products and processes in a general way. Advanced research is 
most closely analogous to precompetitive technology development in the 
commercial sector (i.e., early phases of research and development on 
which commercial competitors are willing to collaborate, because the 
work is not so coupled to specific products and processes that the 
results of the work must be proprietary). It does not include 
development of military systems and hardware where specific requirements 
have been defined. It is typically funded in Advanced Technology 
Development (Budget Activity 3 and Research Category 6.3A) programs 
within Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E).
    Applied research. Efforts that attempt to determine and exploit the 
potential of scientific discoveries or improvements in technology such 
as new materials, devices, methods and processes. It typically is funded 
in Applied Research (Budget Activity 2 and Research Category 6.2) 
programs within Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E). 
Applied research normally follows basic research but may not be fully 
distinguishable from the related basic research. The term does not 
include efforts whose principal aim is the design, development, or 
testing of specific products, systems or processes to be considered for 
sale or acquisition; these efforts are within the definition of 
``development.''
    Basic research. Efforts directed toward increasing knowledge and 
understanding in science and engineering, rather than the practical 
application of that knowledge and understanding. It typically is funded 
within Basic Research (Budget Activity 1 and Research Category 6.1) 
programs within Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E). For 
the purposes of this part, basic research includes:
    (1) Research-related, science and engineering education, including 
graduate fellowships and research traineeships.
    (2) Research instrumentation and other activities designed to 
enhance the infrastructure for science and engineering research.
    Claim. A written demand or written assertion by one of the parties 
to a grant or cooperative agreement seeking as a matter of right, the 
payment of money in a sum certain, the adjustment or interpretation of 
award terms, or other relief arising under or relating to a grant or 
cooperative agreement. A routine request for payment that is not in 
dispute when submitted is not a claim. The submission may be converted 
to a claim by written notice to the grants officer if it is disputed 
either as to liability or amount, or is not acted upon in a reasonable 
time.
    Debt. Any amount of money or any property owed to a Federal Agency 
by any person, organization, or entity except another United States 
Federal Agency. Debts include any amounts due from insured or guaranteed 
loans, fees, leases, rents, royalties, services, sales of real or 
personal property, or overpayments, penalties, damages, interest, fines 
and forfeitures, and all other claims and similar sources. Amounts due a 
nonappropriated fund instrumentality are not debts owed the United 
States, for the purposes of this subchapter.
    Delinquent debt. A debt:
    (1) That the debtor fails to pay by the date specified in the 
initial written notice from the agency owed the debt,

[[Page 74]]

normally within 30 calendar days, unless the debtor makes satisfactory 
payment arrangements with the agency by that date; and
    (2) With respect to which the debtor has elected not to exercise any 
available appeals or has exhausted all agency appeal processes.
    Development. The systematic use of scientific and technical 
knowledge in the design, development, testing, or evaluation of 
potential new products, processes, or services to meet specific 
performance requirements or objectives. It includes the functions of 
design engineering, prototyping, and engineering testing.
    Electronic commerce. The conduct of business through the use of 
automation and electronic media, in lieu of paper transactions, direct 
personal contact, telephone, or other means. For grants and cooperative 
agreements, electronic commerce can include the use of electronic data 
interchange, electronic mail, electronic bulletin board systems, and 
electronic funds transfer for: program announcements or solicitations; 
applications or proposals; award documents; recipients' requests for 
payment; payment authorizations; and payments.
    Electronic data interchange. The exchange of standardized 
information communicated electronically between business partners, 
typically between computers. It is DoD policy that DoD Component EDI 
applications conform to the American National Standards Institute 
(ANSI), Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X-12 standard.\1\

Data Interchange Standards Association, 1800 Diagonal Road, Suite 355, 
Alexandria, VA 22314-2852; Attention: Manager Maintenance and 
Publications.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Electronic funds transfer. A system that provides the authority to 
debit or credit accounts in financial institutions by electronic means 
rather than source documents (e.g., paper checks). Processing typically 
occurs through the Federal Reserve System and/or the Automated Clearing 
House (ACH) computer network. It is DoD policy that DoD Component EFT 
transmissions conform to the American National Standards Institute 
(ANSI), Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X-12 standard.
    Historically Black colleges and universities. Institutions of higher 
education determined by the Secretary of Education to meet the 
requirements of 34 CFR 608.2. Each DoD Component's contracting 
activities and grants officers may obtain a list of historically Black 
colleges and universities from that DoD Component's Small and 
Disadvantaged Business Utilization office.
    Institution of higher education. An educational institution that 
meets the criteria in section 1201(a) of the Higher Education Act of 
1965 (20 U.S.C. 1141(a)). Note, however, that institution of higher 
education has a different meaning in Sec. 22.520, as given at Sec. 
22.520(b)(2).
    Minority institutions. Institutions of higher education that meet 
the criteria for minority institutions specified in 10 U.S.C. 2323. Each 
DoD Component's contracting activities and grants officers may obtain 
copies of a current list of institutions that qualify as minority 
institutions under 10 U.S.C. 2323 from that DoD Component's Small and 
Disadvantaged Business Utilization office (the list of minority 
institutions changes periodically, based on Department of Education data 
on institutions' enrollments of minority students).
    Research. Basic, applied, and advanced research, as defined in this 
section.
    Subaward. An award of financial assistance in the form of money, or 
property in lieu of money, made under a DoD grant or cooperative 
agreement by a recipient to an eligible subrecipient. The term includes 
financial assistance for substantive program performance by the 
subrecipient of a portion of the program for which the DoD grant or 
cooperative agreement was made. It does not include the recipient's 
procurement of goods and services needed to carry out the program.

<R04>
             Subpart B_Selecting the Appropriate Instrument


<R05>
Sec. 22.200  Purpose.

    This subpart provides the bases for determining the appropriate type 
of instrument in a given situation.


<R05>
Sec. 22.205  Distinguishing assistance from procurement.

    Before using a grant or cooperative agreement, the grants officer 
shall make a positive judgment that an assistance instrument, rather 
than a procurement contract, is the appropriate instrument, based on the 
following:
    (a) Purpose. (1) The grants officer must judge that the principal 
purpose of the activity to be carried out under the instrument is to 
stimulate or support a public purpose (i.e., to provide assistance), 
rather than acquisition (i.e., to acquire goods and services for the 
direct benefit of the United States Government). If the principal 
purpose is acquisition, then the grants officer shall judge that a 
procurement contract is the appropriate instrument, in accordance with 
31 U.S.C. chapter 63 (``Using Procurement Contracts and Grant and 
Cooperative Agreements''). Assistance instruments shall not be used in 
such situations, except:
    (i) When a statute specifically provides otherwise; or
    (ii) When an exemption is granted, in accordance with Sec. 22.220.
    (2) For research and development, the appropriate use of grants and 
cooperative agreements therefore is almost exclusively limited to the 
performance of selected basic, applied, and advanced research projects. 
Development projects nearly always shall be performed by contract or 
other acquisition transaction because their principal purpose is the 
acquisition of specific deliverable items (e.g., prototypes or other 
hardware) for the benefit of the Department of Defense.
    (b) Fee or profit. Payment of fee or profit is consistent with an 
activity whose principal purpose is the acquisition of goods and 
services for the direct benefit or use of the United States Government, 
rather than an activity whose principal purpose is assistance. 
Therefore, the grants officer shall use a procurement contract, rather 
than an assistance instrument, in all cases where:
    (1) Fee or profit is to be paid to the recipient of the instrument; 
or
    (2) The instrument is to be used to carry out a program where fee or 
profit is necessary to achieving program objectives.


<R05>
Sec. 22.210  Authority for providing assistance.

    (a) Before a grant or cooperative agreement may be used, the grants 
officer must:
    (1) Identify the program statute, the statute that authorizes the 
DoD Component to carry out the activity the principal purpose of which 
is assistance (see 32 CFR 21.410 through 21.420.
    (2) Review the program statute to determine if it contains 
requirements that affect the:
    (i) Solicitation, selection, and award processes. For example, 
program statutes may authorize assistance to be provided only to certain 
types of recipients; may require that recipients meet certain other 
criteria to be eligible to receive assistance; or require that a 
specific process shall be used to review recipients' proposals.
    (ii) Terms and conditions of the award. For example, some program 
statutes require a specific level of cost sharing or matching.
    (b) The grants officer shall ensure that the award of DoD 
appropriations through a grant or cooperative agreement for a research 
project meets the standards of 10 U.S.C. 2358, DoD's broad authority to 
carry out research, even if the research project is authorized under a 
statutory authority other than 10 U.S.C. 2358. The standards of 10 
U.S.C. 2358 are that, in the opinion of the Head of the DoD Component or 
his or her designee, the projects must be:
    (1) Necessary to the responsibilities of the DoD Component.
    (2) Related to weapons systems and other military needs or of 
potential interest to the DoD Component.

[63 FR 12164, Mar. 12, 1998, as amended at 68 FR 47160, Aug. 7, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 22.215  Distinguishing grants and cooperative agreements.

    (a) Once a grants officer judges, in accordance with Sec. Sec. 
22.205 and 22.210,

[[Page 76]]

that either a grant or cooperative agreement is the appropriate 
instrument, the grants officer shall distinguish between the two 
instruments as follows:
    (1) Grants shall be used when the grants officer judges that 
substantial involvement is not expected between the Department of 
Defense and the recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated in 
the agreement.
    (2) Cooperative agreements shall be used when the grants officer 
judges that substantial involvement is expected. The grants officer 
should document the nature of the substantial involvement that led to 
selection of a cooperative agreement. Under no circumstances are 
cooperative agreements to be used solely to obtain the stricter controls 
typical of a contract.
    (b) In judging whether substantial involvement is expected, grants 
officers should recognize that ``substantial involvement'' is a 
relative, rather than an absolute, concept, and that it is primarily 
based on programmatic factors, rather than requirements for grant or 
cooperative agreement award or administration. For example, substantial 
involvement may include collaboration, participation, or intervention in 
the program or activity to be performed under the award.


<R05>
Sec. 22.220  Exemptions.

    Under 31 U.S.C. 6307, ``the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget may exempt an agency transaction or program'' from the 
requirements of 31 U.S.C. chapter 63. Grants officers shall request such 
exemptions only in exceptional circumstances. Each request shall specify 
for which individual transaction or program the exemption is sought; the 
reasons for requesting an exemption; the anticipated consequences if the 
exemption is not granted; and the implications for other agency 
transactions and programs if the exemption is granted. The procedures 
for requesting exemptions shall be:
    (a) In cases where 31 U.S.C. chapter 63 would require use of a 
contract and an exemption from that requirement is desired:
    (1) The grants officer shall submit a request for exemption, through 
appropriate channels established by his or her DoD Component (see 32 CFR 
21.320(a)), to the Director of Defense Procurement (DDP).
    (2) The DDP, after coordination with the Director of Defense 
Research and Engineering (DDR&E), shall transmit the request to OMB or 
notify the DoD Component that the request has been disapproved.
    (b) In other cases, the DoD Component shall submit a request for the 
exemption through appropriate channels to the DDR&E. The DDR&E shall 
transmit the request to OMB or notify the DoD Component that the request 
has been disapproved.
    (c) Where an exemption is granted, documentation of the approval 
shall be maintained in the award file.

[63 FR 12164, Mar. 12, 1998, as amended at 68 FR 47160, Aug. 7, 2003]


<R04>
                          Subpart C_Competition


<R05>
Sec. 22.300  Purpose.

    This subpart establishes DoD policy and implements statutes related 
to the use of competitive procedures in the award of grants and 
cooperative agreements.


<R05>
Sec. 22.305  General policy and requirement for competition.

    (a) It is DoD policy to maximize use of competition in the award of 
grants and cooperative agreements. This also conforms with:
    (1) 31 U.S.C. 6301(3), which encourages the use of competition in 
awarding all grants and cooperative agreements.
    (2) 10 U.S.C. 2374(a), which sets out Congressional policy that any 
new grant for research, development, test, or evaluation be awarded 
through merit-based selection procedures.
    (b) Grants officers shall use merit-based, competitive procedures 
(as defined by Sec. 22.315) to award grants and cooperative agreements:
    (1) In every case where required by statute (e.g., 10 U.S.C. 2361, 
as implemented in Sec. 22.310, for certain grants to institutions of 
higher education).
    (2) To the maximum extent practicable in all cases where not 
required by statute.

[[Page 77]]


<R05>
Sec. 22.310  Statutes concerning certain research, development, and 
facilities construction grants.

    (a) Definitions specific to this section. For the purposes of 
implementing the requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2374 in this section, the 
following terms are defined:
    (1) Follow-on grant. A grant that provides for continuation of 
research and development performed by a recipient under a preceding 
grant. Note that follow-on grants are distinct from incremental funding 
actions during the period of execution of a multi-year award.
    (2) New grant. A grant that is not a follow-on grant.
    (b) Statutory requirement to use competitive procedures. (1) A 
grants officer shall not award a grant by other than merit-based, 
competitive procedures (as defined by Sec. 22.315) to an institution of 
higher education for the performance of research and development or for 
the construction of research or other facilities, unless:
    (i) In the case of a new grant for research and development, there 
is a statute meeting the criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section;
    (ii) In the case of a follow-on grant for research and development, 
or of a grant for the construction of research or other facilities, 
there is a statute meeting the criteria in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section; and
    (iii) The Secretary of Defense submits to Congress a written notice 
of intent to make the grant. The grant may not be awarded until 180 
calendar days have elapsed after the date on which Congress received the 
notice of intent. Contracting activities must submit a draft notice of 
intent with supporting documentation through channels to the Deputy 
Director, Defense Research and Engineering.
    (2) Because subsequently enacted statutes may, by their terms, 
impose different requirements than set out in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, grants officers shall consult legal counsel on a case-by-case 
basis, when grants for the performance of research and development or 
for the construction of research or other facilities are to be awarded 
to institutions of higher education by other than merit-based 
competitive procedures.
    (c) Subsequent statutes. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2361 and 10 
U.S.C. 2374, a provision of law may not be construed as requiring the 
award of a grant through other than the merit-based, competitive 
procedures described in Sec. 22.315, unless:
    (1) Institutions of higher education--new grants for research and 
development. In the case of a new grant for research and development to 
an institution of higher education, such provision of law specifically:
    (i) Identifies the particular institution of higher education 
involved;
    (ii) States that such provision of law modifies or supersedes the 
provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2361 (a requirement that applies only if the 
statute authorizing or requiring award by other than competitive 
procedures was enacted after September 30, 1989); and
    (iii) States that the award to the institution of higher education 
involved is required by such provision of law to be made in 
contravention of the policy set forth in 10 U.S.C. 2374(a).
    (2) Institutions of higher education--follow-on grants for research 
and development and grants for the construction of any research or other 
facility. In the case of any such grant to an institution of higher 
education, such provision of law specifically:
    (i) Identifies the particular institution of higher education 
involved; and
    (ii) States that such provision of law modifies or supersedes the 
provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2361 (a requirement that applies only if the 
statute authorizing or requiring award by other than competitive 
procedures was enacted after September 30, 1989).
    (3) Other entities--new grants for research and development--(i) 
General. In the case of a new grant for research and development to an 
entity other than an institution of higher education, such provision of 
law specifically:
    (A) Identifies the particular entity involved;
    (B) States that the award to that entity is required by such 
provision of law to be made in contravention of the policy set forth in 
10 U.S.C. 2374(a).

[[Page 78]]

    (ii) Exception. The requirement of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this 
section does not apply to any grant that calls upon the National Academy 
of Sciences to:
    (A) Investigate, examine, or experiment upon any subject of science 
or art of significance to the Department of Defense or any Military 
Department; and
    (B) Report on such matters to the Congress or any agency of the 
Federal Government.


<R05>
Sec. 22.315  Merit-based, competitive procedures.

    Competitive procedures are methods that encourage participation in 
DoD programs by a broad base of the most highly qualified performers. 
These procedures are characterized by competition among as many eligible 
proposers as possible, with a published or widely disseminated notice. 
Competitive procedures include, as a minimum:
    (a) Notice to prospective proposers. The notice may be a notice of 
funding availability or Broad Agency Announcement published in the 
Federal Register or Commerce Business Daily, respectively, or a notice 
that is made available broadly by electronic means. Alternatively, it 
may take the form of a specific notice that is distributed to eligible 
proposers (a specific notice must be distributed to at least two 
eligible proposers to be considered as part of a competitive procedure). 
Notices must include, as a minimum, the following information:
    (1) Programmatic area(s) of interest, in which proposals or 
applications are sought.
    (2) Eligibility criteria for potential recipients (see subpart D of 
this part).
    (3) Criteria that will be used to select the applications or 
proposals that will be funded, and the method for conducting the 
evaluation.
    (4) The type(s) of funding instruments (e.g., grants, cooperative 
agreements, other assistance instruments, or procurement contracts) that 
are anticipated to be awarded pursuant to the announcement.
    (5) Instructions for preparation and submission of a proposal or 
application, including the time by which it must be submitted.
    (b) At least two eligible, prospective proposers.
    (c) Impartial review of the merits of applications or proposals 
received in response to the notice, using the evaluation method and 
selection criteria described in the notice. For research and development 
awards, in order to be considered as part of a competitive procedure, 
the two principal selection criteria, unless statute provides otherwise, 
must be the:
    (1) Technical merits of the proposed research and development; and
    (2) Potential relationship of the proposed research and development 
to Department of Defense missions.


<R05>
Sec. 22.320  Special competitions.

    Some programs may be competed for programmatic or policy reasons 
among specific classes of potential recipients. An example would be a 
program to enhance U.S. capabilities for academic research and research-
coupled graduate education in defense-critical, science and engineering 
disciplines, a program that would be competed specifically among 
institutions of higher education. All such special competitions shall be 
consistent with program representations in the President's budget 
submission to Congress and with subsequent Congressional authorizations 
and appropriations for the programs.


<R05>
Sec. 22.325  Historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and 
other minority institutions (MIs).

    Increasing the ability of HBCUs and MIs to participate in federally 
funded, university programs is an objective of Executive Order 12876 (3 
CFR, 1993 Comp., p. 671) and 10 U.S.C. 2323. Grants officers shall 
include appropriate provisions in Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) or 
other announcements for programs in which awards to institutions of 
higher education are anticipated, in order to promote participation of 
HBCUs and MIs in such programs. Also, whenever practicable, grants 
officers shall reserve appropriate programmatic areas for exclusive 
competition among HBCUs and MIs when preparing announcements for such 
programs.

<R04>
     Subpart D_Recipient Qualification Matters_General Policies and 
                               Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 22.400  Purpose.

    The purpose of this subpart is to specify policies and procedures 
for grants officers' determination of recipient qualifications prior to 
award.


<R05>
Sec. 22.405  Policy.

    (a) General. Grants officers normally shall award grants or 
cooperative agreements only to qualified recipients that meet the 
standards in Sec. 22.415. This practice conforms with the 
Governmentwide policy, stated at 32 CFR 25.115(a), to do business only 
with responsible persons.
    (b) Exception. In exceptional circumstances, grants officers may 
make awards to recipients that do not fully meet the standards in Sec. 
22.415 and include special award conditions that are appropriate to the 
particular situation, in accordance with 32 CFR 32.14, 33.12, or 34.4.


<R05>
Sec. 22.410  Grants officers' responsibilities.

    The grants officer is responsible for determining a recipient's 
qualification prior to award. The grants officer's signature on the 
award document shall signify his or her determination that either:
    (a) The potential recipient meets the standards in Sec. 22.415 and 
is qualified to receive the grant or cooperative agreement; or
    (b) An award is justified to a recipient that does not fully meet 
the standards, pursuant to Sec. 22.405(b). In such cases, grants 
officers shall document in the award file the rationale for making an 
award to a recipient that does not fully meet the standards.


<R05>
Sec. 22.415  Standards.

    To be qualified, a potential recipient must:
    (a) Have the management capability and adequate financial and 
technical resources, given those that would be made available through 
the grant or cooperative agreement, to execute the program of activities 
envisioned under the grant or cooperative agreement.
    (b) Have a satisfactory record of executing such programs or 
activities (if a prior recipient of an award).
    (c) Have a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics.
    (d) Be otherwise qualified and eligible to receive a grant or 
cooperative agreement under applicable laws and regulations (see Sec. 
22.420(c)).


<R05>
Sec. 22.420  Pre-award procedures.

    (a) The appropriate method to be used and amount of effort to be 
expended in deciding the qualification of a potential recipient will 
vary. In deciding on the method and level of effort, the grants officer 
should consider factors such as:
    (1) DoD's past experience with the recipient;
    (2) Whether the recipient has previously received cost-type 
contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements from the Federal 
Government; and
    (3) The amount of the prospective award and complexity of the 
project to be carried out under the award.
    (b) There is no DoD-wide requirement to obtain a pre-award credit 
report, audit, or any other specific piece of information. On a case-by-
case basis, the grants officer will decide whether there is a need to 
obtain any such information to assist in deciding whether the recipient 
meets the standards in Sec. 22.415 (a), (b), and (c).
    (1) Should the grants officer in a particular case decide that a 
pre-award credit report, audit, or survey is needed, he or she should 
consult first with the appropriate grants administration office 
(identified in Sec. 22.710), and decide whether pre-existing surveys or 
audits of the recipient, such as those of the recipient's internal 
control systems under OMB Circular A-133 \2\ will satisfy the need (see 
Sec. 22.715(a)(1)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Contact the Office of Management and Budget, EOP Publications, 
725 17th St. NW, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) If, after consulting with the grants administration office, the 
grants officer decides to obtain a credit report, audit, or other 
information, and

[[Page 80]]

the report or other information discloses that a potential recipient is 
delinquent on a debt to an agency of the United States Government, then:
    (i) The grants officer shall take such information into account when 
determining whether the potential recipient is qualified with respect to 
the grant or cooperative agreement; and
    (ii) If the grants officer decides to make the award to the 
recipient, unless there are compelling reasons to do otherwise, the 
grants officer shall delay the award of the grant or cooperative 
agreement until payment is made or satisfactory arrangements are made to 
repay the debt.
    (c) In deciding whether a recipient is otherwise qualified and 
eligible in accordance with the standard in Sec. 22.415(d), the grants 
officer shall ensure that the potential recipient:
    (1) Is not identified on the Governmentwide ``List of Parties 
Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs'' as being 
debarred, suspended, or otherwise ineligible to receive the award. The 
grants officer shall check the list of such parties for:
    (i) Potential recipients of prime awards, as described at 32 CFR 
25.505(d);
    (ii) A recipient's principals (e.g., officers, directors, or other 
key employees, as defined at 32 CFR 25.105); and
    (iii) Potential recipients of subawards, where DoD Component 
approval of such principals or lower-tier recipients is required under 
the terms of the award (see 32 CFR 25.505(e)).
    (2) Has provided all certifications and assurances required by 
Federal statute, Executive order, or codified regulation, unless they 
are to be addressed in award terms and conditions at the time of award 
(see Sec. 22.510).
    (3) Meets any eligibility criteria that may be specified in the 
statute authorizing the specific program under which the award is being 
made (see Sec. 22.210(a)(2)).
    (d) Grants officers shall obtain each recipient's Taxpayer 
Identification Number (TIN, which may be the Social Security Number for 
an individual and Employer Identification Number for a business or non-
profit entity) and notify the recipient that the TIN is being obtained 
for purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent amounts that 
may arise out of the recipient's relationship with the Government. 
Obtaining the TIN and so notifying the recipient is a statutory 
requirement of 31 U.S.C. 7701, as amended by the Debt Collection 
Improvement Act of 1996 (section 31001(i)(1), Pub. L. 104-134).


<R04>
                    Subpart E_National Policy Matters


<R05>
Sec. 22.505  Purpose.

    The purpose of this subpart is to supplement other regulations that 
implement national policy requirements, to the extent that it is 
necessary to provide additional guidance to DoD grants officers. The 
other regulations that implement national policy requirements include:
    (a) The other parts of the DoDGARs (32 CFR parts 32, 33, and 34) 
that implement the Governmentwide guidance in OMB Circulars A-102 \3\ 
and A-110 \4\ on administrative requirements for grants and cooperative 
agreements. Those parts address some national policy matters that appear 
in the OMB Circulars.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See footnote 2 to Sec. 22.420(b)(1).
    \4\ See footnote 2 to Sec. 22.420(b)(1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) DoD regulations other than the DoDGARs.
    (c) Other Federal agencies' regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 22.510  Certifications, representations, and assurances.

    (a) Certifications--(1) Policy. Certifications of compliance with 
national policy requirements are to be obtained from recipients only for 
those national policies where a statute, Executive order, or codified 
regulation specifically states that a certification is required. Other 
national policy requirements may be addressed by obtaining 
representations or assurances (see paragraph (b) of this section). 
Grants officers should utilize methods for obtaining certifications, in 
accordance with Executive Order 12866 (3 CFR, 1993 Comp., p. 638), that 
minimize administration and paperwork.
    (2) Procedures. (i) When necessary, grants officers may obtain 
individual, written certifications.

[[Page 81]]

    (ii) Whenever possible, and to the extent consistent with statute 
and codified regulation, grants officers should identify the 
certifications that are required for the particular type of recipient 
and program, and consolidate them into a single certification provision 
that cites them by reference.
    (A) Appendix A to this part lists the common certifications and 
cites their applicability. Because some certifications (e.g., the 
certification on lobbying in Appendix A to this part) are required by 
law to be submitted at the time of proposal, rather than at the time of 
award, Appendix A to this part includes language that may be used for 
incorporating common certifications by reference into a proposal.
    (B) If a grants officer elects to have proposers incorporate 
certifications by reference into their proposals, he or she must do so 
in one of the two following ways. When required by statute or codified 
regulation, the solicitation must include the full text of the 
certifications that proposers are to provide by reference. In other 
cases, the grants officer may include language in the solicitation that 
informs the proposers where the full text may be found (e.g., in 
documents or computer network sites that are readily available to the 
public) and offers to provide it to proposers upon request.
    (C) Grants officers may incorporate certifications by reference in 
award documents when doing so is consistent with statute and codified 
regulation. Note that a statute requires submission of the lobbying 
certification in Appendix A to this part at the time of proposal, and 
that 32 CFR 25.510(a) requires submission of certifications regarding 
debarment and suspension at the time of proposal. The provision that a 
grants officer would use to incorporate certifications in award 
documents, when consistent with statute and codified regulation, would 
be similar to the provision in Appendix A to this part, except that it 
would be modified to state that the recipient is providing the required 
certifications by signing the award document or by accepting funds under 
the award.
    (b) Representations and assurances. Many national policies, either 
in statute or in regulation, require recipients of grants and 
cooperative agreements to make representations or provide assurances 
(rather than certifications) that they are in compliance with the 
policies. As discussed in Sec. 22.610(b), Appendix B to this part 
suggests award terms and conditions that may be used to address several 
of the more commonly applicable national policy requirements. These 
terms and conditions may be used to obtain required assurances and 
representations, if the grants officer wishes to do so at the time of 
award, rather than through the use of the standard application form (SF-
424 \5\) or other means at the time of proposal.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ For copies of Standard Forms listed in this part, contact 
regional grants administration offices of the Office of Naval Research. 
Addresses for the offices are listed in the ``DoD Directory of Contract 
Administration Services Components,'' DLAH 4105.4, which can be obtained

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 22.515  Provisions of annual appropriations acts.

    An annual appropriations act can include general provisions stating 
national policy requirements that apply to the use of funds (e.g., 
obligation through a grant or cooperative agreement) appropriated by the 
act. Because these requirements are of limited duration (the period 
during which a given year's appropriations are available for 
obligation), and because they can vary from year to year and from one 
agency's appropriations act to another agency's, the grants officer must 
know the agency(ies) and fiscal year(s) of the appropriations being 
obligated by a given grant or cooperative agreement, and may need to 
consult legal counsel if he or she does not know the requirements 
applicable to those appropriations.


<R05>
Sec. 22.520  Military recruiting on campus.

    (a) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to implement section 558 
of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 (Pub. L. 
103-337), as it

[[Page 82]]

specifically affects grants and cooperative agreements (note that 
section 558 appears as a note to 10 U.S.C. 503). This section thereby 
supplements DoD's primary implementation of section 558, in 32 CFR part 
216, ``Military Recruiting and Reserve Officer Training Corps Program 
Access to Institutions of Higher Education.''
    (b) Definitions specific to this section. In this section:
    (1) Directory information has the following meaning, given in 
section 558(c) of Pub. L. 103-337. It means, with respect to a student, 
the student's name, address, telephone listing, date and place of birth, 
level of education, degrees received, and the most recent previous 
educational institution enrolled in by the student.
    (2) Institution of higher education has a different meaning in this 
section than it does in the rest of this part. The meaning of the term 
in other sections of this part is given at Sec. 22.105. In this 
section, ``institution of higher education'' (IHE) has the following 
meaning, given at 32 CFR 216.3. The term means a domestic college, 
university, or subelement thereof providing postsecondary school courses 
of study, including foreign campuses of such domestic institutions. The 
term includes junior colleges, community colleges, and institutions 
providing courses leading to undergraduate and post-graduate degrees. 
The term does not include entities that operate exclusively outside the 
United States, its territories, and possessions. A subelement of an IHE 
is a discrete (although not necessarily autonomous) organizational 
entity that may establish policy or practices affecting military 
recruiting and related actions (e.g., an undergraduate school, law 
school, medical school, or other graduate school).
    (c) Statutory requirement. No funds available to the Department of 
Defense may be provided by grant to any institution of higher education 
that either has a policy of denying or that effectively prevents the 
Secretary of Defense from obtaining, for military recruiting purposes, 
entry to campuses or access to students on campuses or access to 
directory information pertaining to students.
    (d) Policy--(1) Applicability to subordinate elements of 
institutions of higher education. 32 CFR part 216, DoD's primary 
implementation of section 558, establishes procedures by which the 
Department of Defense identifies institutions of higher education that 
have a policy or practice described in paragraph (c) of this section. In 
cases where those procedures lead to a determination that specific 
subordinate elements of an institution of higher education have such a 
policy or practice, rather than the institution as a whole, 32 CFR part 
216 provides that the prohibition on use of DoD funds applies only to 
those subordinate elements.
    (2) Applicability to cooperative agreements. As a matter of DoD 
policy, the restrictions of section 558, as implemented by 32 CFR part 
216, apply to cooperative agreements, as well as grants.
    (3) Deviations. Grants officers may not deviate from any provision 
of this section without obtaining the prior approval of the Director of 
Defense Research and Engineering. Requests for deviations shall be 
submitted, through appropriate channels, to: Director for Research, 
ODDR&E(R), 3080 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-3080.
    (e) Grants officers' responsibilities. A grants officer shall:
    (1) Not award any grant or cooperative agreement to an institution 
of higher education that has been identified pursuant to the procedures 
of 32 CFR part 216. Such institutions are identified on the 
Governmentwide ``List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and 
Nonprocurement Programs,'' as being ineligible to receive awards of DoD 
funds (note that 32 CFR 25.505(d) requires the grants officer to check 
the list prior to determining that a recipient is qualified to receive 
an award).
    (2) [Reserved]
    (3) Not consent to any subaward of DoD funds to such an 
organization, under a grant or cooperative agreement to any recipient, 
if such subaward requires the grants officer's consent.
    (4) Include the clause in paragraph (f) of this section in each 
grant or cooperative agreement with an institution of

[[Page 83]]

higher education. Note that this requirement does not flow down (i.e., 
recipients are not required to include the clause in subawards).
    (5) If an institution of higher education refuses to accept the 
clause in paragraph (f) of this section:
    (i) Determine that the institution is not qualified with respect to 
the award. The grants officer may award to an alternative recipient.
    (ii) Transmit the name of the institution, through appropriate 
channels, to the Director for Accession Policy, Office of the Assistant 
Secretary of Defense for Force Management Policy, OASD(FMP), 4000 
Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-4000. This will allow OASD(FMP) 
to decide whether to initiate an evaluation of the institution under 32 
CFR part 216, to determine whether it is an institution that has a 
policy or practice described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) Clause for award documents. The following clause is to be 
included in grants and cooperative agreements with institutions of 
higher education:

``As a condition for receipt of funds available to the Department of 
Defense (DoD) under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an 
institution of higher education (as defined in 32 CFR part 216) that has 
a policy of denying, and that it is not an institution of higher 
education that effectively prevents, the Secretary of Defense from 
obtaining for military recruiting purposes: (A) Entry to campuses or 
access to students on campuses; or (B) access to directory information 
pertaining to students. If the recipient is determined, using the 
procedures in 32 CFR part 216, to be such an institution of higher 
education during the period of performance of this agreement, and 
therefore to be in breach of this clause, the Government will cease all 
payments of DoD funds under this agreement and all other DoD grants and 
cooperative agreements to the recipient, and it may suspend or terminate 
such grants and agreements unilaterally for material failure to comply 
with the terms and conditions of award.''


<R05>
Sec. 22.525  Paperwork Reduction Act.

    Grants officers shall include appropriate award terms or conditions, 
if a recipient's activities under an award will be subject to the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3500, et seq.):
    (a) Generally, the Act only applies to Federal agencies--it requires 
agencies to obtain clearance from the Office of Management and Budget 
before collecting information using forms, schedules, questionnaires, or 
other methods calling either for answers to:
    (1) Identical questions from ten or more persons other than 
agencies, instrumentalities, or employees of the United States.
    (2) Questions from agencies, instrumentalities, or employees of the 
United States which are to be used for statistical compilations of 
general public interest.
    (b) The Act applies to similar collections of information by 
recipients of grants or cooperative agreements only when:
    (1) A recipient collects information at the specific request of the 
awarding Federal agency; or
    (2) The terms and conditions of the award require specific approval 
by the agency of the information collection or the collection 
procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 22.530  Metric system of measurement.

    (a) Statutory requirement. The Metric Conversion Act of 1975, as 
amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 
205) and implemented by Executive Order 12770 (3 CFR, 1991 Comp., p. 
343), states that:
    (1) The metric system is the preferred measurement system for U.S. 
trade and commerce.
    (2) The metric system of measurement will be used, to the extent 
economically feasible, in federal agencies' procurements, grants, and 
other business-related activities.
    (3) Metric implementation shall not be required to the extent that 
such use is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of 
markets to United States firms.
    (b) Responsibilities. DoD Components shall ensure that the metric 
system is used, to the maximum extent practicable, in measurement-
sensitive activities supported by programs that use grants and 
cooperative agreements, and in measurement-sensitive outputs of such 
programs.

<R05>
Sec. 22.600  Purpose.

    This subpart sets forth grants officers' responsibilities relating 
to the award document and other actions at the time of award.


<R05>
Sec. 22.605  Grants officers' responsibilities.

    At the time of award, the grants officer is responsible for ensuring 
that:
    (a) The award instrument contains the appropriate terms and 
conditions, in accordance with Sec. 22.610.
    (b) Information about the award is provided to the office 
responsible for preparing reports for the Defense Assistance Award Data 
System (DAADS), to ensure timely and accurate reporting of data required 
by 31 U.S.C. 6101-6106 (see 32 CFR part 21, subpart E).
    (c)(1) In addition to the copy of the award document provided to the 
recipient, a copy is forwarded to the office designated to administer 
the grant or cooperative agreement, and another copy is forwarded to the 
finance and accounting office designated to make the payments to the 
recipient.
    (2) For any award subject to the electronic funds transfer (EFT) 
requirement described in Sec. 22.810(b)(2), the grants officer shall 
include a prominent notification of that fact on the first page of the 
copies forwarded to the recipient, the administrative grants officer, 
and the finance and accounting office. On the first page of the copy 
forwarded to the recipient, the grants officer also shall include a 
prominent notification that the recipient, to be paid, must submit a 
Payment Information Form (Standard Form SF-3881\6\) to the responsible 
DoD payment office, if that payment office does not currently have the 
information (e.g., bank name and account number) needed to pay the 
recipient by EFT.

Sec. 22.610  Award instruments.

    (a) Each award document shall include terms and conditions that:
    (1) Address programmatic requirements (e.g., a statement of work or 
other appropriate terms or conditions that describe the specific goals 
and objectives of the project). The grants officer shall develop such 
terms and conditions in coordination with program officials.
    (2) Provide for the recipient's compliance with:
    (i) Pertinent Federal statutes or Executive orders that apply 
broadly to Federal or DoD assistance awards.
    (ii) Any program-specific requirements that are prescribed in the 
program statute (see Sec. 22.210(a)(2)), or appropriation-specific 
requirements that are stated in the pertinent Congressional 
appropriations (see Sec. 22.515).
    (iii) Pertinent portions of the DoDGARs or other Federal 
regulations, including those that implement the Federal statutes or 
Executive orders described in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this 
section.
    (3) Specify the grants officer's instructions for post-award 
administration, for any matter where the post-award administration 
provisions in 32 CFR part 32, 33, or 34 give the grants officer options 
for handling the matter. For example, under 32 CFR 32.24(b), the grants 
officers must choose among possible methods for the recipient's 
disposition of program income. It is essential that the grants officer 
identify the option selected in each case, to provide clear instructions 
to the recipient and the grants officer responsible for post-award 
administration of the grant or cooperative agreement.
    (b) To assist grants officers:
    (1) Appendix B to this part provides model clauses to implement 
certain Federal statutes, Executive orders, and regulations (see 
paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section) that frequently apply to DoD grants 
and cooperative agreements. Grants officers may incorporate the model 
clauses into award terms and conditions, as appropriate. It should be 
noted that Appendix B to this part is an aid, and not an exhaustive list 
of all requirements that apply in all cases. Depending on the 
circumstances of a given award, other statutes, Executive orders, or 
codified

[[Page 85]]

regulations also may apply (e.g., Appendix B to this part does not list 
program-specific requirements described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this 
section).
    (2) Appendix C to this part is a list of administrative requirements 
that apply to awards to different types of recipients. It also 
identifies post-award administration issues that the grants officer must 
address in the award terms and conditions.


<R04>
                     Subpart G_Field Administration


<R05>
Sec. 22.700  Purpose.

    This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for administering 
grants and cooperative agreements. It does so in conjunction with 32 CFR 
parts 32, 33, and 34, which prescribe administrative requirements for 
particular types of recipients.


<R05>
Sec. 22.705  Policy.

    (a) DoD policy is to have each recipient deal with a single office, 
to the maximum extent practicable, for post-award administration of its 
grants and cooperative agreements. This reduces burdens on recipients 
that can result when multiple DoD offices separately administer grants 
and cooperative agreements they award to a given recipient. It also 
minimizes unnecessary duplication of field administration services.
    (b) To further reduce burdens on recipients, the office responsible 
for performing field administration services for grants and cooperative 
agreements to a particular recipient shall be, to the maximum extent 
practicable, the same office that is assigned responsibility for 
performing field administration services for contracts awarded to that 
recipient.
    (c) Contracting activities and grants officers therefore shall use 
cross-servicing arrangements whenever practicable and, to the maximum 
extent possible, delegate responsibility for post-award administration 
to the cognizant grants administration offices identified in Sec. 
22.710.


<R05>
Sec. 22.710  Assignment of grants administration offices.

    In accordance with the policy stated in Sec. 22.705(b), the DoD 
offices (referred to in this part as ``grants administration offices'') 
that are assigned responsibility for performing field administration 
services for grants and cooperative agreements are (see the ``DoD 
Directory of Contract Administration Services Components,'' DLAH 
4105.4,\7\ for specific addresses of administration offices):
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ Copies may be obtained either from the Defense Logistics Agency, 
Publications Distribution Division (DASC-WDM), 8725 John J. Kingman Rd., 
Suite 0119, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-6220, or from the Defense Contract 
Management Command home page at http://www.dcmc.dcrb.dla.mil.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (a) Regional offices of the Office of Naval Research, for grants and 
cooperative agreements with:
    (1) Institutions of higher education and laboratories affiliated 
with such institutions, to the extent that such organizations are 
subject to the university cost principles in OMB Circular A-21.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ See footnote 2 to Sec. 22.420(b)(1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Nonprofit organizations that are subject to the cost principles 
in OMB Circular A-122,\9\ if their principal business with the 
Department of Defense is research and development.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ See footnote 2 to Sec. 22.420(b)(1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Field offices of the Defense Contract Management Command, for 
grants and cooperative agreements with all other entities, including:
    (1) For-profit organizations.
    (2) Nonprofit organizations identified in Attachment C of OMB 
Circular A-122 that are subject to for-profit cost principles in 48 CFR 
part 31.
    (3) Nonprofit organizations subject to the cost principles in OMB 
Circular A-122, if their principal business with the Department of 
Defense is other than research and development.
    (4) State and local governments.


<R05>
Sec. 22.715  Grants administration office functions.

    The primary responsibility of cognizant grants administration 
offices shall be to advise and assist grants officers and recipients 
prior to and after award, and to help ensure that recipients fulfill all 
requirements in law, regulation, and award terms and conditions. 
Specific functions include:

[[Page 86]]

    (a) Conducting reviews and coordinating reviews, audits, and audit 
requests. This includes:
    (1) Advising grants officers on the extent to which audits by 
independent auditors (i.e., public accountants or Federal auditors) have 
provided the information needed to carry out their responsibilities. If 
a recipient has had an independent audit in accordance with OMB Circular 
A-133, and the audit report disclosed no material weaknesses in the 
recipient's financial management and other management and control 
systems, additional preaward or closeout audits usually will not be 
needed (see Sec. Sec. 22.420(b) and 22.825(b)).
    (2) Performing pre-award surveys, when requested by a grants 
officer, after providing advice described in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section.
    (3) Reviewing recipients' systems and compliance with Federal 
requirements, in coordination with any reviews and compliance audits 
performed by independent auditors under OMB Circular A-133, or in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of the award. This includes:
    (i) Reviewing recipients' financial management, property management, 
and purchasing systems, to determine the adequacy of such systems.
    (ii) Determining that recipients have drug-free workplace programs, 
as required under 32 CFR part 25.
    (4) Notifying the Office of the Assistant Inspector General for 
Policy and Oversight (OAIG(P&O)), 400 Army-Navy Drive, Arlington, VA 
22202, if either of the following is not available within a reasonable 
period of time (e.g., six months) after the date on which a recipient of 
DoD grants and agreements was to have submitted its audit report under 
OMB Circular A-133 to the OAIG(P&O):
    (i) The recipient's audit report under OMB Circular A-133.
    (ii) The OAIG(P&O)'s desk review of the recipient's audit report, or 
a letter stating that the OAIG(P&O) has decided not to conduct a desk 
review.
    (b) Performing property administration services for Government-owned 
property, and for any property acquired by a recipient, with respect to 
which the recipient has further obligations to the Government.
    (c) Ensuring timely submission of required reports.
    (d) Executing administrative closeout procedures.
    (e) Establishing recipients' indirect cost rates, where the 
Department of Defense is the cognizant or oversight Federal agency with 
the responsibility for doing so.
    (f) Performing other administration functions (e.g., receiving 
recipients' payment requests and transmitting approved payment 
authorizations to payment offices) as delegated by applicable cross-
servicing agreements or letters of delegation.


<R04>
                   Subpart H_Post-Award Administration


<R05>
Sec. 22.800  Purpose and relation to other parts.

    This subpart sets forth grants officers' and DoD Components' 
responsibilities for post-award administration, by providing DoD-
specific requirements on payments; debt collection; claims, disputes and 
appeals; and closeout audits.


<R05>
Sec. 22.805  Post-award requirements in other parts.

    Grants officers responsible for post-award administration of grants 
and cooperative agreements shall administer such awards in accordance 
with the following parts of the DoDGARs, as supplemented by this 
subpart:
    (a) Awards to domestic recipients. Standard administrative 
requirements for grants and cooperative agreements with domestic 
recipients are specified in other parts of the DoDGARs, as follows:
    (1) For awards to domestic institutions of higher education and 
other nonprofit organizations, requirements are specified in 32 CFR part 
32, which is the DoD implementation of OMB Circular A-110.
    (2) For awards to State and local governments, requirements are 
specified in 32 CFR part 33, which is the DoD codification of the 
Governmentwide common rule to implement OMB Circular A-102.
    (3) For awards to domestic for-profit organizations, requirements 
are specified in 32 CFR part 34, which is modeled

[[Page 87]]

on the requirements in OMB Circular A-110.
    (b) Awards to foreign recipients. DoD Components shall use the 
administrative requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section, 
to the maximum extent practicable, for grants and cooperative agreements 
to foreign recipients.


<R05>
Sec. 22.810  Payments.

    (a) Purpose. This section prescribes policies and grants officers' 
post-award responsibilities, with respect to payments to recipients of 
grants and cooperative agreements.
    (b) Policy. (1) It is Governmentwide policy to minimize the time 
elapsing between any payment of funds to a recipient and the recipient's 
disbursement of the funds for program purposes (see 32 CFR 32.22(a) and 
33.21(b), and the implementation of the Cash Management Improvement Act 
at 31 CFR part 205).
    (2) It also is a Governmentwide requirement to use electronic funds 
transfer (EFT) in the payment of any grant for which an application or 
proposal was submitted or renewed on or after July 26, 1996, unless the 
recipient has obtained a waiver by submitting to the head of the 
pertinent Federal agency a certification that it has neither an account 
with a financial institution nor an authorized payment agent. This 
requirement is in 31 U.S.C. 3332, as amended by the Debt Collection 
Improvement Act of 1996 (section 31001(x)(1)(A), Pub. L. 104-134), and 
as implemented by Department of Treasury regulations at 31 CFR part 208. 
As a matter of DoD policy, this requirement applies to cooperative 
agreements, as well as grants. Within the Department of Defense, the 
Defense Finance and Accounting Service implements this EFT requirement, 
and grants officers have collateral responsibilities at the time of 
award, as described in Sec. 22.605(c), and in postaward administration, 
as described in Sec. 22.810(c)(3)(iv).
    (3) Expanding on these Governmentwide policies, DoD policy is for 
DoD Components to use electronic commerce, to the maximum extent 
practicable, in the portions of the payment process for grants and 
cooperative agreements for which grants officers are responsible. In 
cases where recipients submit each payment request to the grants 
officer, this includes using electronic methods to receive recipients' 
requests for payment and to transmit authorizations for payment to the 
DoD payment office. Using electronic methods will improve timeliness and 
accuracy of payments and reduce administrative burdens associated with 
paper-based payments.
    (c) Post-award responsibilities. In cases where the recipient 
submits each payment request to the grants officer, the administrative 
grants officer designated to handle payments for a grant or cooperative 
agreement is responsible for:
    (1) Handling the recipient's requests for payments in accordance 
with DoD implementation of Governmentwide guidance (see 32 CFR 32.22, 
33.21, or 34.12, as applicable).
    (2) Reviewing each payment request to ensure that:
    (i) The request complies with the award terms.
    (ii) Available funds are adequate to pay the request.
    (iii) The recipient will not have excess cash on hand, based on 
expenditure patterns.
    (3) Maintaining a close working relationship with the personnel in 
the finance and accounting office responsible for making the payments. A 
good working relationship is necessary, to ensure timely and accurate 
handling of financial transactions for grants and cooperative 
agreements. Administrative grants officers:
    (i) Should be generally familiar with policies and procedures for 
disbursing offices that are contained in Chapter 19 of Volume 10 of the 
DoD Financial Management Regulation (the FMR, DoD 7000.14-R\10\).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ Copies may be obtained, at cost, from the National Technical 
Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. 
Authorized users may also obtain copies from the Defense Technical 
Information Center, 8725 John J. Kingman Rd., Suite 0944, Fort Belvoir, 
VA 22060-6218.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Shall forward authorizations to the designated payment office 
expeditiously, so that payments may be made in accordance with the 
timely payment

[[Page 88]]

guidelines in Chapter 19 of Volume 10 of the FMR. Unless alternative 
arrangements are made with the payment office, authorizations should be 
forwarded to the payment office at least 3 working days before the end 
of the period specified in the FMR. The period specified in the FMR is:
    (A) No more than seven calendar days after receipt of the 
recipient's request by the administrative grants officer, whenever 
electronic commerce is used (i.e., EDI to request and authorize payments 
and electronic funds transfer (EFT) to make payments).
    (B) No more than thirty calendar days after receipt of the 
recipient's request by the administrative grants officer, when it is not 
possible to use electronic commerce and paper transactions are used.
    (C) No more than seven calendar days after each date specified, when 
payments are authorized in advance based on a predetermined payment 
schedule, provided that the payment schedule was received in the 
disbursing office at least 30 calendar days in advance of the date of 
the scheduled payment.
    (iii) Shall ensure that the recipients' Taxpayer Identification 
Number (TIN) is included with each payment authorization forwarded to 
the payment office. This is a statutory requirement of 31 U.S.C. 3325, 
as amended by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (section 
31001(y), Pub. L. 104-134).
    (iv) For each award that is required to be paid by EFT (see Sec. 
22.605(c) and (Sec. 22.810(b)(2)), shall prominently indicate that fact 
in the payment authorization.


<R05>
Sec. 22.815  Claims, disputes, and appeals.

    (a) Award terms. Grants officers shall include in grants and 
cooperative agreements a term or condition that incorporates the 
procedures of this section for:
    (1) Processing recipient claims and disputes.
    (2) Deciding appeals of grants officers' decisions.
    (b) Submission of claims--(1) Recipient claims. If a recipient 
wishes to submit a claim arising out of or relating to a grant or 
cooperative agreement, the grants officer shall inform the recipient 
that the claim must:
    (i) Be submitted in writing to the grants officer for decision;
    (ii) Specify the nature and basis for the relief requested; and
    (iii) Include all data that supports the claim.
    (2) DoD Component claims. Claims by a DoD Component shall be the 
subject of a written decision by a grants officer.
    (c) Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)--(1) Policy. DoD policy is 
to try to resolve all issues concerning grants and cooperative 
agreements by mutual agreement at the grants officer's level. DoD 
Components therefore are encouraged to use ADR procedures to the maximum 
extent practicable. ADR procedures are any voluntary means (e.g., mini-
trials or mediation) used to resolve issues in controversy without 
resorting to formal administrative appeals (see paragraph (e) of this 
section) or to litigation.
    (2) Procedures. (i) The ADR procedures or techniques to be used may 
either be agreed upon by the Government and the recipient in advance 
(e.g., when agreeing on the terms and conditions of the grant or 
cooperative agreement), or may be agreed upon at the time the parties 
determine to use ADR procedures.
    (ii) If a grants officer and a recipient are not able to resolve an 
issue through unassisted negotiations, the grants officer shall 
encourage the recipient to enter into ADR procedures. ADR procedures may 
be used prior to submission of a recipient's claim or at any time prior 
to the Grant Appeal Authority's decision on a recipient's appeal (see 
paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section).
    (d) Grants officer decisions. (1) Within 60 calendar days of receipt 
of a written claim, the grants officer shall either:
    (i) Prepare a written decision, which shall include the reasons for 
the decision; shall identify all relevant data on which the decision is 
based; shall identify the cognizant Grant Appeal Authority and give his 
or her mailing address; and shall be included in the award file; or
    (ii) Notify the recipient of a specific date when he or she will 
render a written decision, if more time is required to do so. The notice 
shall inform the recipient of the reason for delaying the decision 
(e.g., the complexity of the

[[Page 89]]

claim, a need for more time to complete ADR procedures, or a need for 
the recipient to provide additional information to support the claim).
    (2) The decision of the grants officer shall be final, unless the 
recipient decides to appeal. If a recipient decides to appeal a grants 
officer's decision, the grants officer shall encourage the recipient to 
enter into ADR procedures, as described in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (e) Formal administrative appeals--(1) Grant appeal authorities. 
Each DoD Component that awards grants or cooperative agreements shall 
establish one or more Grant Appeal Authorities to decide formal, 
administrative appeals in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section. Each Grant Appeal Authority shall be either:
    (i) An individual at a grade level in the Senior Executive Service, 
if civilian, or at the rank of Flag or General Officer, if military; or
    (ii) A board chaired by such an individual.
    (2) Right of appeal. A recipient has the right to appeal a grants 
officer's decision to the Grant Appeal Authority (but note that ADR 
procedures, as described in paragraph (c) of this section, are the 
preferred means for resolving any appeal).
    (3) Appeal procedures--(i) Notice of appeal. A recipient may appeal 
a decision of the grants officer within 90 calendar days of receiving 
that decision, by filing a written notice of appeal to the Grant Appeal 
Authority and to the grants officer. If a recipient elects to use an ADR 
procedure, the recipient is permitted an additional 60 calendar days to 
file the written notice of appeal to the Grant Appeal Authority and 
grants officer.
    (ii) Appeal file. Within 30 calendar days of receiving the notice of 
appeal, the grants officer shall forward to the Grant Appeal Authority 
and the recipient the appeal file, which shall include copies of all 
documents relevant to the appeal. The recipient may supplement the file 
with additional documents it deems relevant. Either the grants officer 
or the recipient may supplement the file with a memorandum in support of 
its position. The Grant Appeal Authority may request additional 
information from either the grants officer or the recipient.
    (iii) Decision. The appeal shall be decided solely on the basis of 
the written record, unless the Grant Appeal Authority decides to conduct 
fact-finding procedures or an oral hearing on the appeal. Any fact-
finding or hearing shall be conducted using procedures that the Grant 
Appeal Authority deems appropriate.
    (f) Representation. A recipient may be represented by counsel or any 
other designated representative in any claim, appeal, or ADR proceeding 
brought pursuant to this section, as long as the representative is not 
otherwise prohibited by law or regulation from appearing before the DoD 
Component concerned.
    (g) Non-exclusivity of remedies. Nothing in this section is intended 
to limit a recipient's right to any remedy under the law.


<R05>
Sec. 22.820  Debt collection.

    (a) Purpose. This section prescribes procedures for establishing 
debts owed by recipients of grants and cooperative agreements, and 
transferring them to payment offices for collection.
    (b) Resolution of indebtedness. The grants officer shall attempt to 
resolve by mutual agreement any claim of a recipient's indebtedness to 
the United States arising out of a grant or cooperative agreement (e.g., 
by a finding that a recipient was paid funds in excess of the amount to 
which the recipient was entitled under the terms and conditions of the 
award).
    (c) Grants officer's decision. In the absence of such mutual 
agreement, any claim of a recipient's indebtedness shall be the subject 
of a grants officer decision, in accordance with Sec. 22.815(b)(2). The 
grants officer shall prepare and transmit to the recipient a written 
notice that:
    (1) Describes the debt, including the amount, the name and address 
of the official who determined the debt (e.g., the grants officer under 
Sec. 22.815(d)), and a copy of that determination.
    (2) Informs the recipient that:
    (i) Within 30 calendar days of the grants officer's decision, the 
recipient shall either pay the amount owed to the grants officer (at the 
address that

[[Page 90]]

was provided pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section) or inform the 
grants officer of the recipient's intention to appeal the decision.
    (ii) If the recipient elects not to appeal, any amounts not paid 
within 30 calendar days of the grants officer's decision will be a 
delinquent debt.
    (iii) If the recipient elects to appeal the grants officer's 
decision the recipient has 90 calendar days, or 150 calendar days if ADR 
procedures are used, after receipt of the grants officer's decision to 
file the appeal, in accordance with Sec. 22.815(e)(3)(i).
    (iv) The debt will bear interest, and may include penalties and 
other administrative costs, in accordance with the debt collection 
provisions in Chapters 29, 31, and 32 of Volume 5 and Chapters 18 and 19 
of Volume 10 of the DoD Financial Management Regulation (DoD 7000.14-R). 
No interest will be charged if the recipient pays the amount owed within 
30 calendar days of the grants officer's decision. Interest will be 
charged for the entire period from the date the decision was mailed, if 
the recipient pays the amount owed after 30 calendar days.
    (d) Follow-up. Depending upon the response from the recipient, the 
grants officer shall proceed as follows:
    (1) If the recipient pays the amount owed within 30 calendar days to 
the grants officer, the grants officer shall forward the payment to the 
responsible payment office.
    (2) If within 30 calendar days the recipient elects to appeal the 
grants officer's decision, further action to collect the debt is 
deferred, pending the outcome of the appeal. If the final result of the 
appeal is a determination that the recipient owes a debt to the Federal 
Government, the grants officer shall send a demand letter to the 
recipient and transfer responsibility for further debt collection to a 
payment office, as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
    (3) If within 30 calendar days the recipient has neither paid the 
amount due nor provided notice of intent to file an appeal of the grants 
officer's decision, the grants officer shall send a demand letter to the 
recipient, with a copy to the payment office that will be responsible 
for collecting the delinquent debt. The payment office will be 
responsible for any further debt collection activity, including issuance 
of additional demand letters (see Chapter 19 of volume 10 of the DoD 
Financial Management Regulation, DoD 7000.14-R). The grants officer's 
demand letter shall:
    (i) Describe the debt, including the amount, the name and address of 
the official that determined the debt (e.g., the grants officer under 
Sec. 22.815(d)), and a copy of that determination.
    (ii) Notify the recipient that the debt is a delinquent debt that 
bears interest from the date of the grants officer's decision, and that 
penalties and other administrative costs may be assessed.
    (iii) Identify the payment office that is responsible for the 
collection of the debt, and notify the recipient that it may submit a 
proposal to that payment office to defer collection, if immediate 
payment is not practicable.
    (e) Administrative offset. In carrying out the responsibility for 
collecting delinquent debts, a disbursing officer may need to consult 
grants officers, to determine whether administrative offset against 
payments to a recipient owing a delinquent debt would interfere with 
execution of projects being carried out under grants or cooperative 
agreements. Disbursing officers may also ask grants officers whether it 
is feasible to convert payment methods under grants or cooperative 
agreements from advance payments to reimbursements, to facilitate use of 
administrative offset. Grants officers therefore should be familiar with 
guidelines for disbursing officers, in Chapter 19 of Volume 10 of the 
Financial Management Regulation (DoD 7000.14-R), concerning withholding 
and administrative offset to recover delinquent debts.


<R05>
Sec. 22.825  Closeout audits.

    (a) Purpose. This section establishes DoD policy for obtaining 
audits at closeout of individual grants and cooperative agreements. It 
thereby supplements the closeout procedures specified in:
    (1) 32 CFR 32.71 and 32.72, for awards to institutions of higher 
education and other nonprofit organizations.
    (2) 32 CFR 33.50 and 33.51, for awards to State and local 
governments.

[[Page 91]]

    (3) 32 CFR 34.61 and 34.62, for awards to for-profit entities.
    (b) Policy. Grants officers shall use their judgment on a case-by-
case basis, in deciding whether to obtain an audit prior to closing out 
a grant or cooperative agreement (i.e., there is no specific DoD 
requirement to obtain an audit prior to doing so). Factors to be 
considered include:
    (1) The amount of the award.
    (2) DoD's past experience with the recipient, including the presence 
or lack of findings of material deficiencies in recent:
    (i) Audits of individual awards; or
    (ii) Systems-wide financial audits and audits of the compliance of 
the recipient's systems with Federal requirements, under OMB Circular A-
133, where that Circular is applicable. (See Sec. 22.715(a)(1)).

------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 25.50  How is this part written?

    (a) This part uses a ``plain language'' format to make it easier for 
the general public and business community to use. The section headings 
and text, often in the form of questions and answers, must be read 
together.
    (b) Pronouns used within this part, such as ``I'' and ``you,'' 
change from subpart to subpart depending on the audience being 
addressed. The pronoun ``we'' always is the DOD Component.
    (c) The ``Covered Transactions'' diagram in the appendix to this 
part shows the levels or ``tiers'' at which the DOD Component enforces 
an exclusion under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 25.75  Do terms in this part have special meanings?

    This part uses terms throughout the text that have special meaning. 
Those terms are defined in Subpart I of this part. For example, three 
important terms are--
    (a) Exclusion or excluded, which refers only to discretionary 
actions taken by a suspending or debarring official under this part or 
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4);
    (b) Disqualification or disqualified, which refers to prohibitions 
under specific statutes, executive orders (other than Executive Order 
12549 and Executive Order 12689), or other authorities. 
Disqualifications frequently are not subject to the discretion of an 
agency official, may have a different scope than exclusions, or have 
special conditions that apply to the disqualification; and
    (c) Ineligibility or ineligible, which generally refers to a person 
who is either excluded or disqualified.


<R04>
                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 25.100  What does this part do?

    This part adopts a governmentwide system of debarment and suspension 
for DOD Component nonprocurement activities. It also provides for 
reciprocal exclusion of persons who have been excluded under the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation, and provides for the consolidated listing of all 
persons who are excluded, or disqualified by statute, executive order, 
or other legal authority. This part satisfies the requirements in 
section 3 of Executive Order 12549, ``Debarment and Suspension'' (3 CFR 
1986 Comp., p. 189), Executive Order 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension'' 
(3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31

[[Page 108]]

U.S.C. 6101 note (Section 2455, Public Law 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327).


<R05>
Sec. 25.105  Does this part apply to me?

    Portions of this part (see table at Sec. 25.25(b)) apply to you if 
you are a(n)--
    (a) Person who has been, is, or may reasonably be expected to be, a 
participant or principal in a covered transaction;
    (b) Respondent (a person against whom the DOD Component has 
initiated a debarment or suspension action);
    (c) DOD Component debarring or suspending official; or
    (d) DOD Component official who is authorized to enter into covered 
transactions with non-Federal parties.


<R05>
Sec. 25.110  What is the purpose of the nonprocurement debarment and 
suspension system?

    (a) To protect the public interest, the Federal Government ensures 
the integrity of Federal programs by conducting business only with 
responsible persons.
    (b) A Federal agency uses the nonprocurement debarment and 
suspension system to exclude from Federal programs persons who are not 
presently responsible.
    (c) An exclusion is a serious action that a Federal agency may take 
only to protect the public interest. A Federal agency may not exclude a 
person or commodity for the purposes of punishment.


<R05>
Sec. 25.115  How does an exclusion restrict a person's involvement in 
covered transactions?

    With the exceptions stated in Sec. Sec. 25.120, 25.315, and 25.420, 
a person who is excluded by the DOD Component or any other Federal 
agency may not:
    (a) Be a participant in a(n) DOD Component transaction that is a 
covered transaction under subpart B of this part;
    (b) Be a participant in a transaction of any other Federal agency 
that is a covered transaction under that agency's regulation for 
debarment and suspension; or
    (c) Act as a principal of a person participating in one of those 
covered transactions.


<R05>
Sec. 25.120  May we grant an exception to let an excluded person 
participate in a covered transaction?

    (a) The Head of the DOD Component or his or her designee may grant 
an exception permitting an excluded person to participate in a 
particular covered transaction. If the Head of the DOD Component or his 
or her designee grants an exception, the exception must be in writing 
and state the reason(s) for deviating from the governmentwide policy in 
Executive Order 12549.
    (b) An exception granted by one agency for an excluded person does 
not extend to the covered transactions of another agency.


<R05>
Sec. 25.125  Does an exclusion under the nonprocurement system affect a 
person's eligibility for Federal procurement contracts?

    If any Federal agency excludes a person under its nonprocurement 
common rule on or after August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also 
ineligible to participate in Federal procurement transactions under the 
FAR. Therefore, an exclusion under this part has reciprocal effect in 
Federal procurement transactions.


<R05>
Sec. 25.130  Does exclusion under the Federal procurement system affect a 
person's eligibility to participate in nonprocurement transactions?

    If any Federal agency excludes a person under the FAR on or after 
August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also ineligible to participate 
in nonprocurement covered transactions under this part. Therefore, an 
exclusion under the FAR has reciprocal effect in Federal nonprocurement 
transactions.


<R05>
Sec. 25.135  May the DOD Component exclude a person who is not currently 
participating in a nonprocurement transaction?

    Given a cause that justifies an exclusion under this part, we may 
exclude any person who has been involved, is currently involved, or may 
reasonably be expected to be involved in a covered transaction.

[[Page 109]]


<R05>
Sec. 25.140  How do I know if a person is excluded?

    Check the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) to determine whether a 
person is excluded. The General Services Administration (GSA) maintains 
the EPLS and makes it available, as detailed in subpart E of this part. 
When a Federal agency takes an action to exclude a person under the 
nonprocurement or procurement debarment and suspension system, the 
agency enters the information about the excluded person into the EPLS.


<R05>
Sec. 25.145  Does this part address persons who are disqualified, as well 
as those who are excluded from nonprocurement transactions?

    Except if provided for in Subpart J of this part, this part--
    (a) Addresses disqualified persons only to--
    (1) Provide for their inclusion in the EPLS; and
    (2) State responsibilities of Federal agencies and participants to 
check for disqualified persons before entering into covered 
transactions.
    (b) Does not specify the--
    (1) DOD Component transactions for which a disqualified person is 
ineligible. Those transactions vary on a case-by-case basis, because 
they depend on the language of the specific statute, Executive order, or 
regulation that caused the disqualification;
    (2) Entities to which the disqualification applies; or
    (3) Process that the agency uses to disqualify a person. Unlike 
exclusion, disqualification is frequently not a discretionary action 
that a Federal agency takes.


<R04>
                     Subpart B_Covered Transactions


<R05>
Sec. 25.200  What is a covered transaction?

    A covered transaction is a nonprocurement or procurement transaction 
that is subject to the prohibitions of this part. It may be a 
transaction at--
    (a) The primary tier, between a Federal agency and a person (see 
appendix to this part); or
    (b) A lower tier, between a participant in a covered transaction and 
another person.


<R05>
Sec. 25.205  Why is it important if a particular transaction is a 
covered transaction?

    The importance of a covered transaction depends upon who you are.
    (a) As a participant in the transaction, you have the 
responsibilities laid out in Subpart C of this part. Those include 
responsibilities to the person or Federal agency at the next higher tier 
from whom you received the transaction, if any. They also include 
responsibilities if you subsequently enter into other covered 
transactions with persons at the next lower tier.
    (b) As a Federal official who enters into a primary tier 
transaction, you have the responsibilities laid out in subpart D of this 
part.
    (c) As an excluded person, you may not be a participant or principal 
in the transaction unless--
    (1) The person who entered into the transaction with you allows you 
to continue your involvement in a transaction that predates your 
exclusion, as permitted under Sec. 25.310 or Sec. 25.415; or
    (2) A(n) DOD Component official obtains an exception from the Head 
of the DOD Component or his or her designee to allow you to be involved 
in the transaction, as permitted under Sec. 25.120.


<R05>
Sec. 25.210  Which nonprocurement transactions are covered transactions?

    All nonprocurement transactions, as defined in Sec. 25.970, are 
covered transactions unless listed in Sec. 25.215. (See appendix to 
this part.)


<R05>
Sec. 25.215  Which nonprocurement transactions are not covered 
transactions?

    The following types of nonprocurement transactions are not covered 
transactions:
    (a) A direct award to--
    (1) A foreign government or foreign governmental entity;
    (2) A public international organization;
    (3) An entity owned (in whole or in part) or controlled by a foreign 
government; or
    (4) Any other entity consisting wholly or partially of one or more 
foreign governments or foreign governmental entities.

[[Page 110]]

    (b) A benefit to an individual as a personal entitlement without 
regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received 
in an individual's business capacity are not excepted). For example, if 
a person receives social security benefits under the Supplemental 
Security Income provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1301 et 
seq., those benefits are not covered transactions and, therefore, are 
not affected if the person is excluded.
    (c) Federal employment.
    (d) A transaction that the DOD Component needs to respond to a 
national or agency-recognized emergency or disaster.
    (e) A permit, license, certificate, or similar instrument issued as 
a means to regulate public health, safety, or the environment, unless 
the DOD Component specifically designates it to be a covered 
transaction.
    (f) An incidental benefit that results from ordinary governmental 
operations.
    (g) Any other transaction if the application of an exclusion to the 
transaction is prohibited by law.


<R05>
Sec. 25.220  Are any procurement contracts included as covered 
transactions?

    (a) Covered transactions under this part--
    (1) Do not include any procurement contracts awarded directly by a 
Federal agency; but
    (2) Do include some procurement contracts awarded by non-Federal 
participants in nonprocurement covered transactions (see appendix to 
this part).
    (b) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered 
transaction if any of the following applies:
    (1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement 
transaction that is covered under Sec. 25.210, and the amount of the 
contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.
    (2) The contract requires the consent of a(n) DOD Component 
official. In that case, the contract, regardless of the amount, always 
is a covered transaction, and it does not matter who awarded it. For 
example, it could be a subcontract awarded by a contractor at a tier 
below a nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the appendix to this 
part.
    (3) The contract is for federally-required audit services.


<R05>
Sec. 25.225  How do I know if a transaction in which I may participate 
is a covered transaction?

    As a participant in a transaction, you will know that it is a 
covered transaction because the agency regulations governing the 
transaction, the appropriate agency official, or participant at the next 
higher tier who enters into the transaction with you, will tell you that 
you must comply with applicable portions of this part.

Sec. 25.300  What must I do before I enter into a covered transaction 
with another person at the next lower tier?

    When you enter into a covered transaction with another person at the 
next lower tier, you must verify that the person with whom you intend to 
do business is not excluded or disqualified. You do this by:
    (a) Checking the EPLS; or
    (b) Collecting a certification from that person if allowed by this 
rule; or
    (c) Adding a clause or condition to the covered transaction with 
that person.


<R05>
Sec. 25.305  May I enter into a covered transaction with an excluded 
or disqualified person?

    (a) You as a participant may not enter into a covered transaction 
with an excluded person, unless the DOD Component grants an exception 
under Sec. 25.120.
    (b) You may not enter into any transaction with a person who is 
disqualified from that transaction, unless you have obtained an 
exception under the disqualifying statute, Executive order, or

with whom I am already doing business in a covered transaction?

    (a) You as a participant may continue covered transactions with an 
excluded person if the transactions were in existence when the agency 
excluded the person. However, you are not required to continue the 
transactions, and you may consider termination. You should make a 
decision about whether to terminate and the type of termination action, 
if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper 
and appropriate.
    (b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-
cost time extensions) with any excluded person, unless the DOD Component 
grants an exception under Sec. 25.120.


<R05>
Sec. 25.315  May I use the services of an excluded person as a principal 
under a covered transaction?

    (a) You as a participant may continue to use the services of an 
excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction if you were 
using the services of that person in the transaction before the person 
was excluded. However, you are not required to continue using that 
person's services as a principal. You should make a decision about 
whether to discontinue that person's services only after a thorough 
review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate.
    (b) You may not begin to use the services of an excluded person as a 
principal under a covered transaction unless the DOD Component grants an 
exception under Sec. 25.120.


<R05>
Sec. 25.320  Must I verify that principals of my covered transactions are 
eligible to participate?

    Yes, you as a participant are responsible for determining whether 
any of your principals of your covered transactions is excluded or 
disqualified from participating in the transaction. You may decide the 
method and frequency by which you do so. You may, but you are not 
required to, check the EPLS.


<R05>
Sec. 25.325  What happens if I do business with an excluded person in 
a covered transaction?

    If as a participant you knowingly do business with an excluded 
person, we may disallow costs, annul or terminate the transaction, issue

appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 25.330  What requirements must I pass down to persons at lower 
tiers with whom I intend to do business?

    Before entering into a covered transaction with a participant at the 
next lower tier, you must require that participant to--
    (a) Comply with this subpart as a condition of participation in the 
transaction. You may do so using any method(s), unless Sec. 25.440 
requires you to use specific methods.
    (b) Pass the requirement to comply with this subpart to each person 
with whom the participant enters into a covered transaction at the next 
lower tier.

into the transaction with you, if you know that you or any of the 
principals for that covered transaction:
    (a) Are presently excluded or disqualified;
    (b) Have been convicted within the preceding three years of any of

against you for one of those offenses within that time period;
    (c) Are presently indicted for or otherwise criminally or civilly 
charged by a governmental entity (Federal, State or local) with 
commission of any of the offenses listed in Sec. 25.800(a); or
    (d) Have had one or more public transactions (Federal, State, or

[[Page 112]]


<R05>
Sec. 25.340  If I disclose unfavorable information required under 
Sec. 25.335, will I be prevented from participating in the transaction?

    As a primary tier participant, your disclosure of unfavorable 
information about yourself or a principal under Sec. 25.335 will not 
necessarily cause us to deny your participation in the covered 
transaction. We will consider the information when we determine whether 
to enter into the covered transaction. We also will consider any 
additional information or explanation that you elect to submit with the 
disclosed information.


<R05>
Sec. 25.345  What happens if I fail to disclose information required 
under Sec. 25.335?

    If we later determine that you failed to disclose information under 
Sec. 25.335 that you knew at the time you entered into the covered 
transaction, we may--
    (a) Terminate the transaction for material failure to comply with 
the terms and conditions of the transaction; or

Sec. 25.335 after entering into a covered transaction with the DOD 
Component?

    At any time after you enter into a covered transaction, you must 
give immediate written notice to the DOD Component office with which you 
entered into the transaction if you learn either that--
    (a) You failed to disclose information earlier, as required by Sec. 
25.335; or
    (b) Due to changed circumstances, you or any of the principals for 
the transaction now meet any of the criteria in Sec. 25.335.

<R05>
Sec. 25.355  What information must I provide to a higher tier participant 
before entering into a covered transaction with that participant?

    Before you enter into a covered transaction with a person at the 
next higher tier, you as a lower tier participant must notify that 
person if you know that you or any of the principals are presently 
excluded or disqualified.

higher tier that you were excluded or disqualified at the time you 
entered into the covered transaction with that person, we may pursue any 
available remedies, including suspension and debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 25.365  What must I do if I learn of information required under 

Sec. 25.355 after entering into a covered transaction with a higher

<R05>
Sec. 25.415  What must I do if a Federal agency excludes the participant 
or a principal after I enter into a covered transaction?

    (a) You as an agency official may continue covered transactions with 
an excluded person, or under which an excluded person is a principal, if 
the transactions were in existence when the person was excluded. You are

<R04>
                 Subpart E_Excluded Parties List System


<R05>
Sec. 25.500  What is the purpose of the Excluded Parties List System 
(EPLS)?

    The EPLS is a widely available source of the most current 
information about persons who are excluded or disqualified from covered 
transactions.


<R05>
Sec. 25.505  Who uses the EPLS?

    (a) Federal agency officials use the EPLS to determine whether to 
enter into a transaction with a person, as required under Sec. 25.430.
    (b) Participants also may, but are not required to, use the EPLS to 
determine if--
    (1) Principals of their transactions are excluded or disqualified, 
as required under Sec. 25.320; or
    (2) Persons with whom they are entering into covered transactions at 
the next lower tier are excluded or disqualified.
    (c) The EPLS is available to the general public.


<R05>
Sec. 25.510  Who maintains the EPLS?

    In accordance with the OMB guidelines, the General Services 
Administration (GSA) maintains the EPLS. When a Federal agency takes an 
action to exclude a person under the nonprocurement or procurement 
debarment and suspension system, the agency enters the information about 
the excluded person into the EPLS.


<R05>
Sec. 25.515  What specific information is in the EPLS?

    (a) At a minimum, the EPLS indicates--
    (1) The full name (where available) and address of each excluded or 
disqualified person, in alphabetical order, with cross references if 
more than one name is involved in a single action;
    (2) The type of action;
    (3) The cause for the action;
    (4) The scope of the action;
    (5) Any termination date for the action;
    (6) The agency and name and telephone number of the agency point of 
contact for the action; and
    (7) The Dun and Bradstreet Number (DUNS), or other similar code 
approved by the GSA, of the excluded or disqualified person, if 
available.
    (b)(1) The database for the EPLS includes a field for the Taxpayer 
Identification Number (TIN) (the social security number (SSN) for an 
individual) of an excluded or disqualified person.
    (2) Agencies disclose the SSN of an individual to verify the 
identity of an individual, only if permitted under the Privacy Act of 
1974 and, if appropriate, the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection 
Act of 1988, as codified in 5 U.S.C. 552(a).


<R05>
Sec. 25.520  Who places the information into the EPLS?

    Federal officials who take actions to exclude persons under this 
part or officials who are responsible for identifying disqualified 
persons must enter the following information about those persons into 
the EPLS:
    (a) Information required by Sec. 25.515(a);
    (b) The Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) of the excluded or 
disqualified person, including the social security number (SSN) for an 
individual, if

[[Page 115]]

the number is available and may be disclosed under law;
    (c) Information about an excluded or disqualified person, generally 
within five working days, after--
    (1) Taking an exclusion action;
    (2) Modifying or rescinding an exclusion action;
    (3) Finding that a person is disqualified; or
    (4) Finding that there has been a change in the status of a person 
who is listed as disqualified.


<R05>
Sec. 25.525  Whom do I ask if I have questions about a person in the EPLS?

    If you have questions about a person in the EPLS, ask the point of 
contact for the Federal agency that placed the person's name into the 
EPLS. You may find the agency point of contact from the EPLS.


<R05>
Sec. 25.530  Where can I find the EPLS?

    (a) You may access the EPLS through the Internet, currently at 
http://epls.arnet.gov.
    (b) As of November 26, 2003, you may also subscribe to a printed 
version. However, we anticipate discontinuing the printed version. Until 
it is discontinued, you may obtain the printed version by purchasing a 
yearly subscription from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. 
Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, or by calling the 
Government Printing Office Inquiry and Order Desk at (202) 783-3238.


<R04>
   Subpart F_General Principles Relating to Suspension and Debarment 
                                 Actions


<R05>
Sec. 25.600  How do suspension and debarment actions start?

    When we receive information from any source concerning a cause for 
suspension or debarment, we will promptly report and investigate it. We 
refer the question of whether to suspend or debar you to our suspending 
or debarring official for consideration, if appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 25.605  How does suspension differ from debarment?

    Suspension differs from debarment in that--

------------------------------------------------------------------------
        A suspending official . . .          A debarring official . . .
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) Imposes suspension as a temporary       Imposes debarment for a
 status of ineligibility for procurement     specified period as a final
 and nonprocurement transactions, pending    determination that a person

(c) Usually imposes the suspension first,   Imposes debarment after
 and then promptly notifies the suspended    giving the respondent
 person, giving the person an opportunity    notice of the action and an
 to contest the suspension and have it       opportunity to contest the
 lifted.                                     proposed debarment.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 25.610  What procedures does the DOD Component use in suspension and 
debarment actions?

    In deciding whether to suspend or debar you, we handle the actions 
as informally as practicable, consistent with principles of fundamental 
fairness.
    (a) For suspension actions, we use the procedures in this subpart 
and subpart G of this part.
    (b) For debarment actions, we use the procedures in this subpart and 
subpart H of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 25.615  How does the DOD Component notify a person of a suspension 
or debarment action?

    (a) The suspending or debarring official sends a written notice to 
the last known street address, facsimile number, or e-mail address of--
    (1) You or your identified counsel; or
    (2) Your agent for service of process, or any of your partners, 
officers, directors, owners, or joint venturers.
    (b) The notice is effective if sent to any of these persons.


<R05>
Sec. 25.620  Do Federal agencies coordinate suspension and debarment 
actions?

    Yes, when more than one Federal agency has an interest in a 
suspension or debarment, the agencies may consider designating one 
agency as the lead agency for making the decision. Agencies are 
encouraged to establish

[[Page 116]]

methods and procedures for coordinating their suspension and debarment 
actions.


<R05>
Sec. 25.625  What is the scope of a suspension or debarment?

    If you are suspended or debarred, the suspension or debarment is 
effective as follows:
    (a) Your suspension or debarment constitutes suspension or debarment 
of all of your divisions and other organizational elements from all 
covered transactions, unless the suspension or debarment decision is 
limited--
    (1) By its terms to one or more specifically identified individuals, 
divisions, or other organizational elements; or
    (2) To specific types of transactions.
    (b) Any affiliate of a participant may be included in a suspension 
or debarment action if the suspending or debarring official--
    (1) Officially names the affiliate in the notice; and
    (2) Gives the affiliate an opportunity to contest the action.


<R05>
Sec. 25.630  May the DOD Component impute conduct of one person to 
another?

    For purposes of actions taken under this rule, we may impute conduct 
as follows:
    (a) Conduct imputed from an individual to an organization. We may 
impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of any 
officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual 
associated with an organization, to that organization when the improper 
conduct occurred in connection with the individual's performance of 
duties for or on behalf of that organization, or with the organization's 
knowledge, approval or acquiescence. The organization's acceptance of 
the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval 
or acquiescence.
    (b) Conduct imputed from an organization to an individual, or 
between individuals. We may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other 
improper conduct of any organization to an individual, or from one 
individual to another individual, if the individual to whom the improper 
conduct is imputed either participated in, had knowledge of, or reason 
to know of the improper conduct.
    (c) Conduct imputed from one organization to another organization. 
We may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of one 
organization to another organization when the improper conduct occurred 
in connection with a partnership, joint venture, joint application, 
association or similar arrangement, or when the organization to whom the 
improper conduct is imputed has the power to direct, manage, control or 
influence the activities of the organization responsible for the 
improper conduct. Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is 
evidence of knowledge, approval or acquiescence.


<R05>
Sec. 25.635  May the DOD Component settle a debarment or suspension 
action?

    Yes, we may settle a debarment or suspension action at any time if 
it is in the best interest of the Federal Government.


<R05>
Sec. 25.640  May a settlement include a voluntary exclusion?

    Yes, if we enter into a settlement with you in which you agree to be 
excluded, it is called a voluntary exclusion and has governmentwide 
effect.


<R05>
Sec. 25.645  Do other Federal agencies know if the DOD Component agrees 
to a voluntary exclusion?

    (a) Yes, we enter information regarding a voluntary exclusion into 
the EPLS.
    (b) Also, any agency or person may contact us to find out the 
details of a voluntary exclusion.


<R04>
                          Subpart G_Suspension


<R05>
Sec. 25.700  When may the suspending official issue a suspension?

    Suspension is a serious action. Using the procedures of this subpart 
and subpart F of this part, the suspending official may impose 
suspension only when that official determines that--
    (a) There exists an indictment for, or other adequate evidence to 
suspect, an offense listed under Sec. 25.800(a), or

[[Page 117]]

    (b) There exists adequate evidence to suspect any other cause for 
debarment listed under Sec. 25.800(b) through (d); and
    (c) Immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 25.705  What does the suspending official consider in issuing 
a suspension?

    (a) In determining the adequacy of the evidence to support the 
suspension, the suspending official considers how much information is 
available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not 
important allegations are corroborated, and what inferences can 
reasonably be drawn as a result. During this assessment, the suspending 
official may examine the basic documents, including grants, cooperative 
agreements, loan authorizations, contracts, and other relevant 
documents.
    (b) An indictment, conviction, civil judgment, or other official 
findings by Federal, State, or local bodies that determine factual and/
or legal matters, constitutes adequate evidence for purposes of 
suspension actions.
    (c) In deciding whether immediate action is needed to protect the 
public interest, the suspending official has wide discretion. For 
example, the suspending official may infer the necessity for immediate 
action to protect the public interest either from the nature of the 
circumstances giving rise to a cause for suspension or from potential 
business relationships or involvement with a program of the Federal 
Government.


<R05>
Sec. 25.710  When does a suspension take effect?

sends you a Notice of Suspension advising you--
    (a) That you have been suspended;
    (b) That your suspension is based on--
    (1) An indictment;
    (2) A conviction;

notice without disclosing the Federal Government's evidence;

if I contest a suspension?

    (a) In addition to any information and argument in opposition, as a 
respondent your submission to the suspending official must identify--
    (1) Specific facts that contradict the statements contained in the 
Notice of Suspension. A general denial is insufficient to raise a 
genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension;
    (2) All existing, proposed, or prior exclusions under regulations 
implementing E.O. 12549 and all similar actions taken by Federal, state, 
or local agencies, including administrative agreements that affect only

judgment, or other finding by a Federal, State, or local body for which 
an opportunity to contest the facts was provided;
    (2) Your presentation in opposition contains only general denials to 
information contained in the Notice of Suspension;
    (3) The issues raised in your presentation in opposition to the 
suspension are not factual in nature, or are not material to the 
suspending official's initial decision to suspend, or the official's 
decision whether to continue the suspension; or
    (4) On the basis of advice from the Department of Justice, an office 
of the United States Attorney, a State attorney general's office, or a 
State or local prosecutor's office, that substantial interests of the 
government in pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the 
same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced by conducting fact-
finding.
    (b) You will have an opportunity to challenge the facts if the 
suspending official determines that--
    (1) The conditions in paragraph (a) of this section do not exist; 
and
    (2) Your presentation in opposition raises a genuine dispute over 
facts material to the suspension.
    (c) If you have an opportunity to challenge disputed material facts

documentary evidence you want the suspending official to consider.

advance. If you want a copy of the transcribed record, you may purchase 
it.

[[Page 119]]


<R05>
Sec. 25.750  What does the suspending official consider in deciding 
whether to continue or terminate my suspension?

contained in the official record. The record includes--

decision to suspend you;
    (2) Any further information and argument presented in support of, or 
opposition to, the suspension; and
    (3) Any transcribed record of fact-finding proceedings.
    (b) The suspending official may refer disputed material facts to 
another official for findings of fact. The suspending official may

specifically determining them to be arbitrary, capricious, or clearly 
erroneous.


<R05>
Sec. 25.755  When will I know whether the suspension is continued or 
terminated?

    The suspending official must make a written decision whether to 
continue, modify, or terminate your suspension within 45 days of closing 
the official record. The official record closes upon the suspending 
official's receipt of final submissions, information and findings of 
fact, if any. The suspending official may extend that period for good 
cause.


<R05>
Sec. 25.760  How long may my suspension last?

    (a) If legal or debarment proceedings are initiated at the time of,

paragraph (a) of this section for an additional 6 months if an office of 
a U.S. Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Attorney, or other responsible 
prosecuting official requests an extension in writing. In no event may a 
suspension exceed 18 months without initiating proceedings under 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) The suspending official must notify the appropriate officials 
under paragraph (b) of this section of an impending termination of a 
suspension at least 30 days before the 12 month period expires to allow 
the officials an opportunity to request an extension.

for debarment exists. The official may consider the seriousness of your 
acts or omissions and the mitigating or aggravating factors set forth at 
Sec. 25.860.
    (b) The debarring official bases the decision on all information 
contained in the official record. The record includes--

Sec. 25.860  What factors may influence the debarring official's decision?

    This section lists the mitigating and aggravating factors that the 
debarring official may consider in determining whether to debar you and 
the length of your debarment period. The debarring official may consider 
other factors if appropriate in light of the circumstances of a 
particular case. The existence or nonexistence of any factor, such as 
one of those set forth in this section, is not necessarily determinative 
of your present responsibility. In making a debarment decision, the 
debarring official may consider the following factors:
    (a) The actual or potential harm or impact that results or may 
result from the wrongdoing.
    (b) The frequency of incidents and/or duration of the wrongdoing.
    (c) Whether there is a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing. For 
example, if you have been found by another Federal agency or a State 
agency to have engaged in wrongdoing similar to that found in the 
debarment action, the existence of this fact may be used by the 
debarring official in determining that you have a pattern or prior 
history of wrongdoing.
    (d) Whether you are or have been excluded or disqualified by an 
agency of the Federal Government or have not been allowed to participate 
in State or local contracts or assistance agreements on a basis of 
conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in 
this part.
    (e) Whether you have entered into an administrative agreement with a 
Federal agency or a State or local government that is not governmentwide 
but is based on conduct similar to one or more of the causes for 
debarment specified in this part.
    (f) Whether and to what extent you planned, initiated, or carried 
out the wrongdoing.
    (g) Whether you have accepted responsibility for the wrongdoing and 
recognize the seriousness of the misconduct that led to the cause for 
debarment.
    (h) Whether you have paid or agreed to pay all criminal, civil and 
administrative liabilities for the improper activity, including any 
investigative or administrative costs incurred by the government, and 
have made or agreed to make full restitution.
    (i) Whether you have cooperated fully with the government agencies 
during the investigation and any court or administrative action. In 
determining the extent of cooperation, the debarring official may 
consider when the cooperation began and whether you disclosed all 
pertinent information known to you.
    (j) Whether the wrongdoing was pervasive within your organization.
    (k) The kind of positions held by the individuals involved in the 
wrongdoing.
    (l) Whether your organization took appropriate corrective action or 
remedial measures, such as establishing ethics training and implementing 
programs to prevent recurrence.
    (m) Whether your principals tolerated the offense.
    (n) Whether you brought the activity cited as a basis for the 
debarment to the attention of the appropriate government agency in a 
timely manner.
    (o) Whether you have fully investigated the circumstances 
surrounding the cause for debarment and, if so, made the result of the 
investigation available to the debarring official.
    (p) Whether you had effective standards of conduct and internal 
control systems in place at the time the questioned conduct occurred.
    (q) Whether you have taken appropriate disciplinary action against 
the individuals responsible for the activity which constitutes the cause 
for debarment.
    (r) Whether you have had adequate time to eliminate the 
circumstances

[[Page 123]]

within your organization that led to the cause for the debarment.
    (s) Other factors that are appropriate to the circumstances of a 
particular case.


<R05>
Sec. 25.865  How long may my debarment last?

    (a) If the debarring official decides to debar you, your period of 
debarment will be based on the seriousness of the cause(s) upon which 
your debarment is based. Generally, debarment should not exceed three 
years. However, if circumstances warrant, the debarring official may 
impose a longer period of debarment.
    (b) In determining the period of debarment, the debarring official 
may consider the factors in Sec. 25.860. If a suspension has preceded 
your debarment, the debarring official must consider the time you were 
suspended.
    (c) If the debarment is for a violation of the provisions of the 
Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, your period of debarment may not exceed 
five years.

Sec. 25.615 that the official decided, either--

to debar me?

    Yes, as a debarred person you may ask the debarring official to 
reconsider the debarment decision or to reduce the time period or scope 
of the debarment. However, you must put your request in writing and 
support it with documentation.


<R05>
Sec. 25.880  What factors may influence the debarring official during 
reconsideration?

    The debarring official may reduce or terminate your debarment based

    (b) A reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which your 
debarment was based;
    (c) A bona fide change in ownership or management;

or
    (e) Other reasons the debarring official finds appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 25.885  May the debarring official extend a debarment?

    (a) Yes, the debarring official may extend a debarment for an 
additional period, if that official determines that an extension is 
necessary to protect the public interest.
    (b) However, the debarring official may not extend a debarment 
solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon which the 
initial debarment action was based.
    (c) If the debarring official decides that a debarment for an 
additional period is necessary, the debarring official must follow the 
applicable procedures in this subpart, and subpart F of this part, to 
extend the debarment.

<R04>
                     Subpart A_Purpose and Coverage


<R05>
Sec. 26.100  What does this part do?

    This part carries out the portion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 
1988 (41 U.S.C. 701 et seq., as amended) that applies to grants. It also 
applies the provisions of the Act to cooperative agreements and other 
financial assistance awards, as a matter of Federal Government policy.


<R05>
Sec. 26.105  Does this part apply to me?

    (a) Portions of this part apply to you if you are either--
    (1) A recipient of an assistance award from the DOD Component; or
    (2) A(n) DOD Component awarding official. (See definitions of award 
and recipient in Sec. Sec. 26.605 and 26.660, respectively.)
    (b) The following table shows the subparts that apply to you:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
            If you are . . .                    see subparts . . .
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) A recipient who is not an            A, B and E.
 individual.
(2) A recipient who is an individual...  A, C and E.
(3) A(n) DOD Component awarding          A, D and E.
 official.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 26.110  Are any of my Federal assistance awards exempt from this 
part?

    This part does not apply to any award that the Head of the DOD 
Component or his or her designee determines that the application of this 
part would be inconsistent with the international obligations of the 
United States or the laws or regulations of a foreign government.


<R05>
Sec. 26.115  Does this part affect the Federal contracts that I receive?

    It will affect future contract awards indirectly if you are debarred 
or suspended for a violation of the requirements of this part, as 
described in Sec. 26. 510(c). However, this part does not apply 
directly to procurement contracts. The portion of the Drug-Free 
Workplace Act of 1988 that applies to Federal procurement contracts is 
carried out through the Federal Acquisition Regulation in chapter 1 of 
Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (the drug-free workplace 
coverage currently is in 48 CFR part 23, subpart 23.5).


<R04>
      Subpart B_Requirements for Recipients Other Than Individuals


<R05>
Sec. 26.200  What must I do to comply with this part?

    There are two general requirements if you are a recipient other than 
an individual.
    (a) First, you must make a good faith effort, on a continuing basis, 
to maintain a drug-free workplace. You must agree to do so as a 
condition for receiving any award covered by this part. The specific 
measures that you must

[[Page 129]]

take in this regard are described in more detail in subsequent sections 
of this subpart. Briefly, those measures are to--
    (1) Publish a drug-free workplace statement and establish a drug-
free awareness program for your employees (see Sec. Sec. 26.205 through 
26.220); and
    (2) Take actions concerning employees who are convicted of violating 
drug statutes in the workplace (see Sec. 26.225).
    (b) Second, you must identify all known workplaces under your 
Federal awards (see Sec. 26.230).


<R05>
Sec. 26.205  What must I include in my drug-free workplace statement?

    You must publish a statement that--
    (a) Tells your employees that the unlawful manufacture, 
distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance 
is prohibited in your workplace;
    (b) Specifies the actions that you will take against employees for 
violating that prohibition; and
    (c) Lets each employee know that, as a condition of employment under 
any award, he or she:
    (1) Will abide by the terms of the statement; and
    (2) Must notify you in writing if he or she is convicted for a 
violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace and must 
do so no more than five calendar days after the conviction.

Sec. 26.210  To whom must I distribute my drug-free workplace statement?

    You must require that a copy of the statement described in Sec. 
26.205 be given to each employee who will be engaged in the performance 
of any Federal award.


<R05>
Sec. 26.215  What must I include in my drug-free awareness program?

    You must establish an ongoing drug-free awareness program to inform 
employees about--
    (a) The dangers of drug abuse in the workplace;
    (b) Your policy of maintaining a drug-free workplace;
    (c) Any available drug counseling, rehabilitation, and employee 
assistance programs; and
    (d) The penalties that you may impose upon them for drug abuse 
violations occurring in the workplace.


<R05>
Sec. 26.220  By when must I publish my drug-free workplace statement 
and establish my drug-free awareness program?

    If you are a new recipient that does not already have a policy 
statement as described in Sec. 26.205 and an ongoing awareness program 
as described in Sec. 26.215, you must publish the statement and 
establish the program by the time given in the following table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                If . . .                          then you . . .
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) The performance period of the award  must have the policy statement
 is less than 30 days.                    and program in place as soon
                                          as possible, but before the
                                          date on which performance is
                                          expected to be completed.
(b) The performance period of the award  must have the policy statement

 policy statement and establish the       of additional time, if any, to
 awareness program.                       be given is at the discretion
                                          of the awarding official.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 26.225  What actions must I take concerning employees who are 
convicted of drug violations in the workplace?

    There are two actions you must take if an employee is convicted of a 
drug violation in the workplace:
    (a) First, you must notify Federal agencies if an employee who is 
engaged in the performance of an award informs you about a conviction,

conviction. Your notification to the Federal agencies must--
    (1) Be in writing;
    (2) Include the employee's position title;

    (4) Be sent within ten calendar days after you learn of the 
conviction; and

employee was working. It must be sent to every awarding official or his 
or her official designee, unless the Federal agency has specified a 
central point for the receipt of the notices.
    (b) Second, within 30 calendar days of learning about an employee's 
conviction, you must either--
    (1) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to 
and including termination, consistent with the requirements of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), as amended; or
    (2) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug 
abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for these purposes 
by a Federal, State or local health, law enforcement, or other 
appropriate agency.


<R05>
Sec. 26.230  How and when must I identify workplaces?

    (a) You must identify all known workplaces under each DOD Component 
award. A failure to do so is a violation of your drug-free workplace 
requirements. You may identify the workplaces--
    (1) To the DOD Component official that is making the award, either 
at the time of application or upon award; or
    (2) In documents that you keep on file in your offices during the 
performance of the award, in which case you must make the information 
available for inspection upon request by DOD Component officials or 
their designated representatives.
    (b) Your workplace identification for an award must include the 
actual address of buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where 
work under the award takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used 
(e.g., all vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway 
department while in operation, State employees in each local 
unemployment office, performers in concert halls or radio studios).
    (c) If you identified workplaces to the DOD Component awarding 
official at the time of application or award, as described in paragraph

during the performance of the award, you must inform the DOD Component 
awarding official.

    (3) To the DOD Component awarding official or other designee for 
each award that you currently have, unless Sec. 26.301 or the award

    Suspension means an action taken by a Federal agency that

Regulation for procurement contracts (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4) and 
the common rule, Government-wide Debarment and Suspension 
(Nonprocurement), that implements Executive Order 12549 and Executive 
Order 12689. Suspension of a recipient is a distinct and separate action 
from suspension of an award or suspension of payments under an award.

Sec. 28.200  Agency and legislative liaison.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in Sec. 
28.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable 
compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or 
receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if 
the payment is for agency and legislative liaison activities not 
directly related to a covered Federal action.
    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, providing any 
information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is allowable 
at any time.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following 
agency and legislative liaison activities are allowable at any time only 
where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered 
Federal action:
    (1) Discussing with an agency (including individual demonstrations) 
the qualities and characteristics of the person's products or services, 
conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; and,

they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action:
    (1) Providing any information not specifically requested but 
necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of

[[Page 137]]

    (3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an

<R05>
Sec. 28.205  Professional and technical services.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in Sec. 
28.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable 
compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or 
receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or 
an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a 
Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is 
for professional or technical services rendered directly in the 
preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or 
application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative 
agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a 
condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or 
cooperative agreement.
    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, ``professional 
and technical services'' shall be limited to advice and analysis 
directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, 
drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer 
is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the 
performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered 
directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, 
communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such 
as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed 
accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide 
advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical 
expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and 
solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered 
Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to 
influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis 
directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's 
proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not 
allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing 
professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent 
to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior 
to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable 
under this section since the engineer is providing technical services 
but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a 
covered Federal action.
    (c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for 
receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or 
regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, 
and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
    (d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are 
allowable under this section.

receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional 
or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, 
or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal 
contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for

meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for 
receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.
    (b) The reporting requirments in Sec. 28.110 (a) and (b) regarding 
filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply 
with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in 
the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing 
for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, ``professional

directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, 
drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer 
is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the

under this section since the engineer is providing technical services

receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or

and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
    (e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting 
or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade 
associations.

Sec. 28.400  Penalties.

    (a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited herein shall be 
subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than 
$100,000 for each such expenditure.
    (b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see 
Appendix B) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject 
to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 
for each such failure.
    (c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an 
administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced 
does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure 
occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with 
respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in 
writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.
    (d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount 
of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency 
shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the 
violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in 
business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability 
of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such 
other matters as may be appropriate.
    (e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section 
shall be subject

[[Page 139]]

to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second 
and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate 
civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the agency 
head or his or her designee.
    (f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not 
prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply 
to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil 
penalty.


<R05>
Sec. 28.405  Penalty procedures.

    Agencies shall impose and collect civil penalties pursuant to the

Sec. 28.500  Secretary of Defense.

    (a) Exemption authority. The Secretary of Defense may exempt, on a 
case-by-case basis, a covered Federal action from the prohibition 
whenever the Secretary determines, in writing, that such an exemption is 
in the national interest. The Secretary shall transmit a copy of each 
such written exemption to Congress immediately after making such a 
determination.
    (b) Policy. It is the policy of the Department of Defense that 
exemptions under paragraph (a) of this section shall be requested only

national interest, a justification that must be transmitted to Congress 
for each exemption that is approved.

                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 32.1  Purpose.

    (a) General. This part implements OMB Circular A-110 \1\ and 
establishes uniform administrative requirements for awards and subawards 
to institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other non-
governmental, non-profit organizations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ For copies of the Circular, contact the Office of Management and 
Budget, EOP Publications, 725 17th St. NW, New Executive Office 
Building, Washington, DC 20503.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Relationship to other parts. This part is an integral part of 
the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations (DoDGARs), which comprise this 
subchapter of the Code of Federal Regulations. This part includes 
references to other parts of the DoDGARs that implement Governmentwide 
guidance and provide uniform internal policies and procedures for DoD 
Components that make or administer awards. Although parts 21 and 22 of 
this subchapter do not impose any direct requirements on recipients, and 
recipients therefore are not required to be familiar with those parts, 
the information in those parts

[[Page 146]]

concerning internal policies and procedures should be helpful to 
recipients of DoD awards.
    (c) Prime awards. DoD Components shall apply the provisions of this 
part to awards to recipients that are institutions of higher education, 
hospitals, and other non-profit organizations. DoD Components shall not 
impose additional or inconsistent requirements, except as provided in 
Sec. Sec. 32.4 and 32.14, or unless specifically required by Federal 
statute or executive order.
    (d) Subawards. Any legal entity that receives an award from a DoD 
Component shall apply the provisions of this part to subawards with 
institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other non-profit 
organizations. Thus, a governmental or for-profit organization, whose 
prime award from a DoD Component is subject to 32 CFR part 33 or part 
34, respectively, applies this part to subawards with institutions of 
higher education, hospitals, or other non-profit organizations. It 
should be noted that subawards are for the performance of substantive 
work under awards, and are distinct from contracts for procuring goods 
and services. It should be further noted that non-profit organizations 
that implement Federal programs for the States are also subject to State 
requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 32.2  Definitions.

    The following are definitions of terms used in this part. Grants 
officers are cautioned that terms may be defined differently in this 
part than they are in other parts of the DoD Grant and Agreement 
Regulations, because this part implements OMB Circular A-110 and uses 
definitions as stated in that Circular. In such cases, the definition 
given in this section applies to the term as it is used in this part, 
and the definition given in other parts applies to the term as it is 
used in those parts. For example, suspension is defined in this section 
to mean temporary withdrawal of Federal sponsorship under an award, but 
is defined at 32 CFR 25.105 to be an action taken to exclude a person 
from participating in a grant, cooperative agreement, or other covered 
transaction.
    Accrued expenditures. The charges incurred by the recipient during a 
given period requiring the provision of funds for:
    (1) Goods and other tangible property received;
    (2) Services performed by employees, contractors, subrecipients, and 
other payees; and
    (3) Other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current 
services or performance is required.
    Accrued income. The sum of:
    (1) Earnings during a given period from:
    (i) Services performed by the recipient; and
    (ii) Goods and other tangible property delivered to purchasers.
    (2) Amounts becoming owed to the recipient for which no current 
services or performance is required by the recipient.
    Acquisition cost of equipment. The net invoice price of the 
equipment, including the cost of modifications, attachments, 
accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make the property 
usable for the purpose for which it was acquired. Other charges, such as 
the cost of installation, transportation, taxes, duty or protective in-
transit insurance, shall be included or excluded from the unit 
acquisition cost in accordance with the recipient's regular accounting 
practices.
    Advance. A payment made by Treasury check or other appropriate 
payment mechanism to a recipient upon its request either before outlays 
are made by the recipient or through the use of predetermined payment 
schedules.
    Award. Financial assistance that provides support or stimulation to 
accomplish a public purpose. Awards include grants and other agreements 
in the form of money or property in lieu of money, by the Federal 
Government to an eligible recipient. The term does not include: 
Technical assistance, which provides services instead of money; other 
assistance in the form of loans, loan guarantees, interest subsidies, or 
insurance; direct payments of any kind to individuals; and, contracts 
which are required to be entered into and administered under procurement 
laws and regulations.
    Cash contributions. The recipient's cash outlay, including the 
outlay of

[[Page 147]]

money contributed to the recipient by third parties.
    Closeout. The process by which the grants officer administering an 
award made by a DoD Component determines that all applicable 
administrative actions and all required work of the award have been 
completed by the recipient and DoD Component.
    Contract. A procurement contract under an award or subaward, and a 
procurement subcontract under a recipient's or subrecipient's contract.
    Cost sharing or matching. That portion of project or program costs 
not borne by the Federal Government.
    Date of completion. The date on which all work under an award is 
completed or the date on the award document, or any supplement or 
amendment thereto, on which Federal sponsorship ends.
    Disallowed costs. Those charges to an award that the grants officer 
administering an award made by a DoD Component determines to be 
unallowable, in accordance with the applicable Federal cost principles 
or other terms and conditions contained in the award.
    DoD Component. A Military Department, Defense Agency, DoD field 
activity, or organization within the Office of the Secretary of Defense 
that provides or administers an award to a recipient.
    Equipment. Tangible nonexpendable personal property including exempt 
property charged directly to the award having a useful life of more than 
one year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more per unit. However, 
consistent with recipient policy, lower limits may be established.
    Excess property. Property under the control of any DoD Component 
that, as determined by the head thereof, is no longer required for its 
needs or the discharge of its responsibilities.
    Exempt property. Tangible personal property acquired in whole or in 
part with Federal funds, where the DoD Component has statutory authority 
to vest title in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal 
Government. An example of exempt property authority is contained in the 
Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6306), for 
property acquired under an award to conduct basic or applied research by 
a non-profit institution of higher education or non-profit organization 
whose principal purpose is conducting scientific research.
    Federal funds authorized. The total amount of Federal funds 
obligated by a DoD Component for use by the recipient. This amount may

percentage of the property's acquisition costs and any improvement 
expenditures paid with Federal funds.
    Funding period. The period of time when Federal funding is available 
for obligation by the recipient.
    Intangible property and debt instruments. Property that includes, 
but is not limited to, trademarks, copyrights, patents and patent 
applications and such property as loans, notes and other debt 
instruments, lease agreements, stock and other instruments of property 
ownership, whether considered tangible or intangible.
    Obligations. The amounts of orders placed, contracts and grants 
awarded, services received and similar transactions during a given 
period that require payment by the recipient during the same or a future 
period.
    Outlays or expenditures. Charges made to the project or program. 
They may be reported on a cash or accrual basis. For reports prepared on 
a cash basis, outlays are the sum of cash disbursements for direct 
charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense charged, 
the value of third party in-kind contributions applied and the amount of 
cash advances and payments made to subrecipients. For reports prepared 
on an accrual basis, outlays are the sum of cash disbursements for 
direct charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense 
incurred, the value of in-kind contributions applied, and the net 
increase (or decrease) in the amounts owed by the recipient for goods 
and other property received, for services performed by employees, 
contractors, subrecipients and other payees and other amounts becoming 
owed under programs for which no current services or performance are 
required.

performed, the use or rental of real or personal property acquired under 
federally-funded projects, the sale of commodities or items fabricated 
under an award, license fees and royalties on patents and copyrights, 
and interest on loans made with award funds. Interest earned on advances 
of Federal funds is not program income. Except as otherwise provided in 
program regulations or the terms and conditions of the award, program 
income does not include the receipt of principal on loans, rebates, 
credits, discounts, etc., or interest earned on any of them.
    Project costs. All allowable costs, as set forth in the applicable 
Federal cost principles, incurred by a recipient and the value of the 
contributions made by third parties in accomplishing the objectives of 
the award during the project period.
    Project period. The period established in the award document during 
which Federal sponsorship begins and ends.
    Property. Real property and personal property (equipment, supplies, 
intangible property and debt instruments), unless stated otherwise.
    Real property. Land, including land improvements, structures and 
appurtenances thereto, but excluding movable machinery and equipment.
    Recipient. An organization receiving financial assistance directly 
from DoD Components to carry out a project or program. The term includes 
public and private institutions of higher education, public and private 
hospitals, and other quasi-public and private non-profit organizations 
such as, but not limited to, community action agencies, research 
institutes, educational associations, and health centers. The term also 
includes consortia comprised of any combination of universities, other 
nonprofit organizations, governmental organizations, for-profit 
organizations, and other entities, to the extent that the consortia are 
legally incorporated as nonprofit organizations. The term does not 
include Government-owned contractor-operated facilities or research 
centers providing continued support for mission-oriented, large-scale 
programs that are Government-owned or controlled, or are designated as 
federally-funded research and development centers.

applied, and all development activities that are supported at 
universities, colleges, and other non-profit institutions. Research is 
defined as a systematic study directed toward fuller scientific 
knowledge or understanding of the subject studied. Development is the 
systematic use of knowledge and understanding gained from research 
directed toward the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or 
methods, including design and development of prototypes and processes. 
The term research also includes activities involving the training of 
individuals in research techniques where such activities utilize the 
same facilities as other research and development activities and where 
such activities are not included in the instruction function.
    Small award. An award not exceeding the simplified acquisition 
threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently $100,000).
    Subaward. An award of financial assistance in the form of money, or 
property in lieu of money, made under an award by a recipient to an 
eligible subrecipient or by a subrecipient to a lower tier subrecipient. 
The term includes financial assistance when provided by any legal

include procurement of goods and services nor does it include any form 
of assistance which is excluded from the definition of ``award'' in this 
section.
    Subrecipient. The legal entity to which a subaward is made and which 
is

[[Page 149]]

accountable to the recipient for the use of the funds provided.

inventions''), as defined in 37 CFR part 401, ``Rights to Inventions 
Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms Under 
Government Grants, Contracts, and Cooperative Agreements.''
    Suspension. An action by a DoD Component that temporarily withdraws

Component. Suspension of an award is a separate action from suspension 
of a participant under 32 CFR part 25.

and the amount which could have been awarded under the recipient's 
approved negotiated indirect cost rate.

<R05>
Sec. 32.3  Effect on other issuances.

codified program regulations, program manuals, handbooks and other 
nonregulatory materials which are inconsistent with the requirements of 
this part shall be superseded, except to the extent they are required by 
statute, or authorized in accordance with the deviations provision in 
Sec. 32.4.


<R05>
Sec. 32.4  Deviations.

    (a) Individual deviations. Individual deviations affecting only one 
award may be approved by DoD Components in accordance with procedures 
stated in 32 CFR 21.335(a) and 21.340.
    (b) Small awards. DoD Components may apply less restrictive 
requirements than the provisions of this part when awarding small 
awards, except for those requirements which are statutory.
    (c) Other class deviations. (1) For classes of awards other than 
small awards, the Director of Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&E), 
or his or her designee, may grant exceptions from the requirements of 
this part:
    (i) With the written concurrence of the Office of the Management and 
Budget (OMB). The DDR&E, or his or her designee, shall provide written 
notification to OMB of the Department of Defense's intention to grant a 
class deviation; and
    (ii) When exceptions are not prohibited by statute.
    (2) DoD Components shall request approval for such deviations in 
accordance with 32 CFR 21.335(b) and 21.340. However, in the interest of 
maximum uniformity, exceptions from the requirements of this part shall 
be permitted only in unusual circumstances.

[63 FR 12188, Mar. 12, 1998, as amended at 68 FR 47160, Aug. 7, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 32.5  Subawards.

    Unless sections of this part specifically exclude subrecipients from 
coverage, the provisions of this part shall be applied to subrecipients 
performing

[[Page 150]]

work under awards if such subrecipients are institutions of higher 
education, hospitals or other non-profit organizations. State and local 
government subrecipients are subject to the provisions of 32 CFR part 
33. Subrecipients that are for-profit organizations are subject to 32 
CFR part 34.


<R04>
                    Subpart B_Pre-Award Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 32.10  Purpose.

    Sections 32.11 through 32.17 prescribe application forms and 
instructions and other pre-award matters.


<R05>
Sec. 32.11  Pre-award policies.

    (a) Use of grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts. (1) OMB 
Circular A-110 states that:
    (i) In each instance, the Federal awarding agency shall decide on 
the appropriate award instrument (i.e., grant, cooperative agreement, or 
contract).
    (ii) The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 
6301-6308) governs the use of grants, cooperative agreements, and 
contracts. Under that Act:
    (A) A grant or cooperative agreement shall be used only when the 
principal purpose of a transaction is to accomplish a public purpose of 
support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute.
    (B) Contracts shall be used when the principal purpose is 
acquisition of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the 
Federal Government.
    (C) The statutory criterion for choosing between grants and 
cooperative agreements is that for the latter, ``substantial involvement 
is expected between the executive agency and the State, local 
government, or other recipient when carrying out the activity 
contemplated in the agreement.''
    (2) In selecting the appropriate award instruments, DoD Components' 
grants officers shall comply with the DoD implementation of the Federal 
Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act at 32 CFR part 22, subpart B.
    (b) Public notice and priority setting. As a matter of 
Governmentwide policy, Federal awarding agencies shall notify the public 
of intended funding priorities for programs that use discretionary 
awards, unless funding priorities are established by Federal statute. 
For DoD Components, compliance with competition policies and statutory 
requirements implemented in 32 CFR part 22, subpart C, shall constitute 
compliance with this Governmentwide policy.

[63 FR 12188, Mar. 12, 1998, as amended at 68 FR 47160, Aug. 7, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 32.12  Forms for applying for Federal assistance.

    (a) DoD Components shall comply with the applicable report clearance 
requirements of 5 CFR part 1320, ``Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the

Component or the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. The SPOC shall 
advise the applicant whether the program for which application is made 
has been selected by that State for review.
    (d) DoD Components that do not use the SF-424 form should indicate 
whether the application is subject to review by the State under E.O. 
12372.

Sec. 32.13  Debarment and suspension.

    DoD Components and recipients shall comply with the nonprocurement 
debarment and suspension common rule at 32 CFR part 25. This common rule 
restricts subawards and contracts with certain parties that are 
debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for 
participation in Federal assistance programs or activities.


<R05>
Sec. 32.14  Special award conditions.

    (a) DoD Components may impose additional requirements as needed, 
over and above those provided in this part, if an applicant or 
recipient:
    (1) Has a history of poor performance;
    (2) Is not financially stable;
    (3) Has a management system that does not meet the standards 
prescribed in this part;
    (4) Has not conformed to the terms and conditions of a previous 
award; or
    (5) Is not otherwise responsible.
    (b) Before imposing additional requirements, DoD Components shall 
notify the applicant or recipient in writing as to:
    (1) The nature of the additional requirements;
    (2) The reason why the additional requirements are being imposed;
    (3) The nature of the corrective action needed;
    (4) The time allowed for completing the corrective actions; and
    (5) The method for requesting reconsideration of the additional 
requirements imposed.
    (c) Any special conditions shall be promptly removed once the 
conditions that prompted them have been corrected.
    (d) Grants officers:
    (1) Should coordinate the imposition and removal of special award 
conditions with the cognizant grants administration office identified in 
32 CFR 22.710.
    (2) Shall include in the award file the written notification to the 
recipient, described in paragraph (b) of this section, and the 
documentation required by 32 CFR 22.410(b).


<R05>
Sec. 32.15  Metric system of measurement.

    The Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and 
Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205) declares that the metric system is 
the preferred measurement system for U.S. trade and commerce, and for 
Federal agencies' procurements, grants, and other business-related 
activities. DoD grants officers shall comply with requirements 
concerning the use of the metric system at 32 CFR 22.530.


<R05>
Sec. 32.16  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).

    Recipients' procurements shall comply with applicable requirements 
of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as described at 
Sec. 32.49.


<R05>
Sec. 32.17  Certifications and representations.

    (a) OMB Circular A-110 authorizes and encourages each Federal 
agency, unless prohibited by statute or codified regulation, to allow 
recipients to submit certifications and representations required by 
statute, executive order, or regulation on an annual basis, if the 
recipients have ongoing and continuing relationships with the agency. 
The Circular further states that annual certifications and 
representations, when used, shall be signed by responsible officials 
with the authority to ensure recipients' compliance with the pertinent 
requirements.
    (b) DoD grants officers shall comply with the provisions concerning 
certifications and representations at 32 CFR 22.510. Those provisions 
ease burdens on recipients to the extent possible, given current 
statutory and regulatory impediments to obtaining all certifications on 
an annual basis. The provisions thereby also comply with the intent of 
OMB Circular A-110, to use less burdensome methods for obtaining 
certifications and representations, as such methods become feasible.

                    Subpart C_Post-Award Requirements

                    Financial and Program Management


<R05>
Sec. 32.20  Purpose of financial and program management.

    Sections 32.21 through 32.28 prescribe standards for financial 
management systems, methods for making payments and rules for: 
satisfying cost sharing and matching requirements,

[[Page 152]]

accounting for program income, budget revision approvals, making audits, 
determining allowability of cost, and establishing fund availability.


<R05>
Sec. 32.21  Standards for financial management systems.

    (a) DoD Components shall require recipients to relate financial data 
to performance data and develop unit cost information whenever 
practical. For awards that support research, it should be noted that it 
is generally not appropriate to develop unit cost information.
    (b) Recipients' financial management systems shall provide for the 
following.
    (1) Accurate, current and complete disclosure of the financial 
results of each federally-sponsored project or program in accordance 
with the reporting requirements set forth in Sec. 32.52. If a DoD 
Component requires reporting on an accrual basis from a recipient that 
maintains its records on other than an accrual basis, the recipient 
shall not be required to establish an accrual accounting system. These 
recipients may develop such accrual data for its reports on the basis of 
an analysis of the documentation on hand.
    (2) Records that identify adequately the source and application of 
funds for federally-sponsored activities. These records shall contain 
information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations, 
unobligated balances, assets, outlays, income and interest.
    (3) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, 
property and other assets. Recipients shall adequately safeguard all 
such assets and assure they are used solely for authorized purposes.
    (4) Comparison of outlays with budget amounts for each award. 
Whenever appropriate, financial information should be related to 
performance and unit cost data. As discussed in paragraph (a) of this 
section, unit cost data is generally not appropriate for awards that 
support research.
    (5) Written procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the 
transfer of funds to the recipient from the U.S. Treasury and the 
issuance or redemption of checks, warrants or payments by other means 
for program purposes by the recipient. To the extent that the provisions 
of the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (Pub. L. 101-453) govern, 
payment methods of State agencies, instrumentalities, and fiscal agents 
should be consistent with CMIA Treasury-State Agreements or the CMIA 
default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205, ``Withdrawal of Cash 
from the Treasury for Advances under Federal Grant and Other Programs.''
    (6) Written procedures for determining the reasonableness, 
allocability and allowability of costs in accordance with the provisions 
of the applicable Federal cost principles (see Sec. 32.27) and the 
terms and conditions of the award.
    (7) Accounting records including cost accounting records that are 
supported by source documentation.
    (c) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment 
of money borrowed by the recipient, the DoD Component, at its 
discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding 
and insurance requirements of the recipient are not deemed adequate to 
protect the interest of the Federal Government.
    (d) The DoD Component may require adequate fidelity bond coverage 
where the recipient lacks sufficient coverage to protect the Federal 
Government's interest.
    (e) Where bonds are required in the situations described above, the 
bonds shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority 
as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety 
Companies Doing Business with the United States.''


<R05>
Sec. 32.22  Payment.

    (a) Payment methods shall minimize the time elapsing between the 
transfer of funds from the United States Treasury and the issuance or 
redemption of checks, warrants, or payment by other means by the 
recipients. Payment methods of State agencies or instrumentalities shall 
be consistent with Treasury-State agreements under the Cash Management 
Improvement Act (CMIA) (31 U.S.C. 3335 and 6503) or default procedures 
in 31 CFR part 205.
    (b) Recipients are to be paid in advance, provided they maintain or 
demonstrate the willingness to maintain:

[[Page 153]]

    (1) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the 
transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient; and
    (2) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund 
control and accountability as established in Sec. 32.21. Cash advances 
to a recipient organization shall be limited to the minimum amounts 
needed and be timed to be in accordance with the actual, immediate cash 
requirements of the recipient organization in carrying out the purpose 
of the approved program or project. The timing and amount of cash 
advances shall be as close as is administratively feasible to the actual 
disbursements by the recipient organization for direct program or 
project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect 
costs.
    (c) Whenever possible, advances shall be consolidated to cover 
anticipated cash needs for all awards made by the DoD Component to the 
recipient.
    (1) Advance payment mechanisms include, but are not limited to, 
Treasury check and electronic funds transfer.
    (2) Advance payment mechanisms are subject to 31 CFR part 205.
    (3) Recipients shall be authorized to submit requests for advances 
and reimbursements at least monthly when electronic fund transfers are 
not used.
    (d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted 
on SF-270,\3\ ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement,'' or other forms 
as may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury 
check advance payments are made to the recipient automatically through 
the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if inconsistent with DoD 
procedures for electronic funds transfer.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See footnote 2 to Sec. 32.12(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in 
paragraph (b) of this section cannot be met. DoD Components may also use 
this method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of 
the construction project is accomplished through private market 
financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes a 
minor portion of the project.
    (1) When the reimbursement method is used, the responsible DoD 
payment office generally makes payment within 30 calendar days after 
receipt of the billing by the office designated to receive the billing, 
unless the billing is improper (for further information about timeframes 
for payments, see 32 CFR 22.810(c)(3)(ii)).
    (2) Recipients shall be authorized to submit requests for 
reimbursement at least monthly when electronic funds transfers are not 
used.
    (f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and 
the grants officer, in consultation with the program manager, has 
determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the recipient 
lacks sufficient working capital, the award may provide for cash on a 
working capital advance basis. Under this procedure, the award shall 
provide for advancing cash to the recipient to cover its estimated 
disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the 
awardee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the award shall provide for 
reimbursing the recipient for its actual cash disbursements. The working 
capital advance method of payment shall not be used for recipients 
unwilling or unable to provide timely advances to their subrecipient to 
meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.
    (g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds 
available from repayments to and interest earned on a revolving fund, 
program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries 
and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash 
payments.
    (h) Unless otherwise required by statute, grants officers shall not 
withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients at any time 
during the project period unless:
    (1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, 
the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal reporting 
requirements; or
    (2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the 
United States under OMB Circular A-129, ``Managing Federal Credit 
Programs'' (see definitions of ``debt'' and ``delinquent debt,'' at 32 
CFR 22.105). Under such conditions, the grants officer

[[Page 154]]

may, upon reasonable notice, inform the recipient that payments shall 
not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until the 
conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government 
is liquidated (also see 32 CFR 22.420(b)(2) and 22.820).
    (i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as 
depositories of funds advanced under awards are as follows:
    (1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2) of this 
section, DoD Components shall not require separate depository accounts 
for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility 
requirements for depositories for funds provided to a recipient. 
However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation 
and expenditure of funds.
    (2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in 
insured accounts whenever possible.
    (j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities 
for women-owned and minority-owned business enterprises, recipients 
shall be encouraged to use women-owned and minority-owned banks (a bank 
which is owned at least 50 percent by women or minority group members).
    (k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest 
bearing accounts, unless:
    (1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per 
year;
    (2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not 
be expected to earn interest in excess of $250 per year on Federal cash 
balances; or
    (3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so 
high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non-
Federal cash resources.
    (l)(1) Interest earned on Federal advances deposited in interest 
bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to Department of Health and 
Human Services, Payment Management System, PO Box 6021, Rockville, MD 
20852.
    (2) In keeping with Electronic Funds Transfer rules (31 CFR part 
206), interest should be remitted to the HHS Payment Management System 
through an electronic medium such as the FEDWIR Deposit System. 
Electronic remittances should be in the format and should include any 
data that are specified by the grants officer as being necessary to 
facilitate direct deposit in HHS' account at the Department of the 
Treasury.
    (3) Recipients that do not have electronic remittance capability 
should use a check.
    (4) Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the 
recipient for administrative expense.
    (m) Except as noted elsewhere in this part, only the following forms 
shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting advances and 
reimbursements. DoD Components shall not require more than an original 
and two copies of these forms.
    (1) SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. Each DoD Component 
shall adopt the SF-270 as a standard form for all nonconstruction 
programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined advance methods 
are not used. DoD Components, however, have the option of using this 
form for construction programs in lieu of the SF-271,\4\ ``Outlay Report 
and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See footnote 2 to Sec. 32.12(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) SF-271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for 
Construction Programs. Each DoD Component shall adopt the SF-271 as the 
standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for construction 
programs. However, a DoD Component may substitute the SF-270 when the 
DoD Component determines that it provides adequate information to meet 
Federal needs.


<R05>
Sec. 32.23  Cost sharing or matching.

    (a) All contributions, including cash and third party in-kind, shall 
be accepted as part of the recipient's cost sharing or matching when 
such contributions meet all of the following criteria:
    (1) Are verifiable from the recipient's records.
    (2) Are not included as contributions for any other federally-
assisted project or program.
    (3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient 
accomplishment of project or program objectives.

[[Page 155]]

    (4) Are allowable under the applicable cost principles.
    (5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another award, 
except where authorized by Federal statute to be used for cost sharing 
or matching.
    (6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by the DoD 
Component.
    (7) Conform to other provisions of this part, as applicable.
    (b) Unrecovered indirect costs (see definition in Sec. 32.2) may be 
included as part of cost sharing or matching.
    (c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property 
shall be established in accordance with the applicable cost principles. 
If a DoD Component authorizes recipients to donate buildings or land for 
construction/facilities acquisition projects or long-term use, the value 
of the donated property for cost sharing or matching shall be the lesser 
of:
    (1) The certified value of the remaining life of the property 
recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the time of donation; 
or
    (2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient 
justification, the DoD Component may approve the use of the current fair 
market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the certified 
value at the time of donation to the project. The DoD Component may 
accept the use of any reasonable basis for determining the fair market 
value of the property.
    (d) Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical 
personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor may be 
counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and 
necessary part of an approved project or program. Rates for volunteer 
services shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the 
recipient's organization. In those instances in which the required 
skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates shall be 
consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which 
the recipient competes for the kind of services involved. In either 
case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable 
may be included in the valuation.
    (e) When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services 
of an employee, these services shall be valued at the employee's regular 
rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, 
allowable, and allocable, but exclusive of overhead costs), provided 
these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally 
paid.
    (f) Donated supplies may include such items as office supplies, 
laboratory supplies or workshop and classroom supplies. Value assessed 
to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or matching share shall 
be reasonable and shall not exceed the fair market value of the property 
at the time of the donation.
    (g) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for 
donated equipment, buildings and land for which title passes to the 
recipient may differ according to the purpose of the award, if the 
purpose of the award is to:
    (1) Assist the recipient in the acquisition of equipment, buildings 
or land, the total value of the donated property may be claimed as cost 
sharing or matching; or
    (2) Support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings 
or land, normally only depreciation or use charges for equipment and 
buildings may be made. However, the full value of equipment or other 
capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed, provided 
that the DoD Component has approved the charges.
    (h) The value of donated property shall be determined in accordance 
with the usual accounting policies of the recipient, with the following 
qualifications.
    (1) The value of donated land and buildings shall not exceed its 
fair market value at the time of donation to the recipient as 
established by an independent appraiser (e.g., certified real property 
appraiser or General Services Administration representative) and 
certified by a responsible official of the recipient.
    (2) The value of donated equipment shall not exceed the fair market 
value of equipment of the same age and condition at the time of 
donation.

[[Page 156]]

    (3) The value of donated space shall not exceed the fair rental 
value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal of 
comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the 
same locality.
    (4) The value of loaned equipment shall not exceed its fair rental 
value.
    (i) The following requirements pertain to the recipient's supporting 
records for in-kind contributions from third parties:
    (1) Volunteer services shall be documented and, to the extent 
feasible, supported by the same methods used by the recipient for its 
own employees.
    (2) The basis for determining the valuation for personal service and 
property shall be documented.


<R05>
Sec. 32.24  Program income.

    (a) DoD Components shall apply the standards set forth in this 
section in requiring recipient organizations to account for program 
income related to projects financed in whole or in part with Federal 
funds.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, program 
income earned during the project period shall be retained by the 
recipient and, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award, 
shall be used in one or more of the following ways:
    (1) Added to funds committed to the project by the DoD Component and 
recipient and used to further eligible project or program objectives.
    (2) Used to finance the non-Federal share of the project or program.
    (3) Deducted from the total project or program allowable cost in 
determining the net allowable costs on which the Federal share of costs 
is based.
    (c) When a program regulation or award authorizes the disposition of 
program income as described in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this 
section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall be used 
in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    (d) In the event that program regulations or the terms and 
conditions of the award do not specify how program income is to be used, 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall apply automatically to all 
projects or programs except research. For awards that support research, 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall apply automatically unless the 
terms and conditions specify another alternative or the recipient is 
subject to special award conditions, as indicated in Sec. 32.14.
    (e) Unless program regulations or the terms and conditions of the 
award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no obligation to the 
Federal Government regarding program income earned after the end of the 
project period.
    (f) If authorized by program regulations or the terms and conditions 
of the award, costs incident to the generation of program income may be 
deducted from gross income to determine program income, provided these 
costs have not been charged to the award.
    (g) Proceeds from the sale of property shall be handled in 
accordance with the requirements of the Property Standards (see 
Sec. Sec. 32.30 through 32.37).
    (h) Unless program regulations or the terms and condition of the 
award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no obligation to the 
Federal Government with respect to program income earned from license 
fees and royalties for copyrighted material, patents, patent 
applications, trademarks, and inventions produced under an award. Note 
that the Patent and Trademark Amendments (35 U.S.C. chapter 18) apply to 
inventions made under an experimental, developmental, or research award.


<R05>
Sec. 32.25  Revision of budget and program plans.

    (a) The budget plan is the financial expression of the project or 
program as approved during the award process. It may include either the 
sum of the Federal and non-Federal shares, or only the Federal share, 
depending upon DoD Component requirements. It shall be related to 
performance for program evaluation purposes whenever appropriate.
    (b) Recipients are required to report deviations from budget and 
program plans, and request prior approvals for budget and program plan 
revisions, in accordance with this section.
    (c) For nonconstruction awards, recipients shall request prior 
approvals from the cognizant grants officer for one or more of the 
following program or budget related reasons.

[[Page 157]]

    (1) Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program 
(even if there is no associated budget revision requiring prior written 
approval).
    (2) Change in a key person specified in the application or award 
document.
    (3) The absence for more than three months, or a 25 percent 
reduction in time devoted to the project, by the approved project 
director or principal investigator.
    (4) The need for additional Federal funding.
    (5) The transfer of amounts budgeted for indirect costs to absorb 
increases in direct costs, or vice versa, if approval is required by the 
DoD Component. DoD Components should require this prior approval only in 
exceptional circumstances. The requirement in each such case must be 
stated in the award document.
    (6) The inclusion, unless waived by the DoD Component, of costs that 
require prior approval in accordance with OMB Circular A-21,\5\ ``Cost 
Principles for Institutions of Higher Education,'' OMB Circular A-
122,\6\ ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations,'' or Appendix E 
to 45 CFR part 74, ``Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to 
Research and Development under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals,'' or 
48 CFR part 31, ``Contract Cost Principles and Procedures,'' as 
applicable. However, it should be noted that many of the prior approvals 
in these cost principles are appropriately waived only after 
consultation with the cognizant federal agency responsible for 
negotiating the recipient's indirect costs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 32.1(a).
    \6\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 32.1(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (7) The transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (direct 
payment to trainees) to other categories of expense.
    (8) Unless described in the application and funded in the approved 
awards, the subaward, transfer or contracting out of any work under an 
award. This provision does not apply to the purchase of supplies, 
material, equipment or general support services.
    (9) If required by the DoD Component, the transfer of funds among 
direct cost categories that is described in paragraph (e) of this 
section.
    (d) (1) Except for requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and 
(c)(4) of this section, OMB Circular A-110 authorizes DoD Components, at 
their option, to waive cost-related and administrative prior written 
approvals required by this part and OMB Circulars A-21 and A-122 (but 
see cautionary note at end of paragraph (c)(5) of this section).
    (2) The two prior approvals listed in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) 
of this section are automatically waived unless the award document 
states otherwise. DoD Components should override this automatic waiver 
and require the prior approvals, especially for research awards, only in 
exceptional circumstances. Absent an override in the award terms and 
conditions, recipients need not obtain prior approvals before:
    (i) Incurring pre-award costs 90 calendar days prior to award 
(incurring pre-award costs more than 90 calendar days prior to award 
would still require the prior approval of the DoD Component). All pre-
award costs are incurred at the recipient's risk (i.e., the DoD 
Component is under no obligation to reimburse such costs if for any 
reason the recipient does not receive an award or if the award is less 
than anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs).
    (ii) Carrying forward unobligated balances to subsequent funding 
periods.
    (3) Under certain conditions, a DoD Component may authorize a 
recipient to initiate, without prior approval, a one-time, no-cost 
extension (i.e., an extension in the expiration date of an award that 
does not require additional Federal funds) for a period of up to twelve 
months, as long as the no-cost extension does not involve a change in 
the approved objectives or scope of the project. The conditions for 
waiving this prior approval requirement are that the DoD Component must:
    (i) Judge that the recipient's subsequently initiating a one-time, 
no-cost extension would not cause the DoD Component to fail to comply 
with DoD funding policies (for further information on the location of 
DoD funding policies, grants officers may refer to Appendix C to 32 CFR 
part 22).
    (ii) Require a recipient that wishes to initiate a one-time, no-cost 
extension

[[Page 158]]

to so notify the office that made the award at least 10 calendar days 
before the original expiration date of the award.
    (e) The DoD Component may, at its option, restrict the transfer of 
funds among direct cost categories, functions and activities for awards 
in which the Federal share of the project exceeds $100,000 and the 
cumulative amount of such transfers exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 
percent of the total budget as last approved by the DoD Component. As a 
matter of DoD policy, requiring prior approvals for such transfers 
generally is not appropriate for grants to support research. No DoD 
Component shall permit a transfer that would cause any Federal 
appropriation or part thereof to be used for purposes other than those 
consistent with the original intent of the appropriation.
    (f) For construction awards, recipients shall request prior written 
approval promptly from grants officers for budget revisions whenever:
    (1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective 
of the project or program;
    (2) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the 
project; or
    (3) A revision is desired which involves specific costs for which 
prior written approval requirements may be imposed consistent with 
applicable OMB cost principles listed in Sec. 32.27.
    (g) When a DoD Component makes an award that provides support for 
both construction and nonconstruction work, the DoD Component may 
require the recipient to request prior approval from the grants officer 
before making any fund or budget transfers between the two types of work 
supported.
    (h) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be 
imposed unless a deviation has been approved, in accordance with the 
deviation procedures in Sec. 32.4(c).
    (i) For both construction and nonconstruction awards, DoD Components 
shall require recipients to notify the grants officer in writing 
promptly whenever the amount of Federal authorized funds is expected to 
exceed the needs of the recipient for the project period by more than 
$5000 or five percent of the Federal award, whichever is greater. This 
notification shall not be required if an application for additional 
funding is submitted for a continuation award.
    (j) When requesting approval for budget revisions, recipients shall 
use the budget forms that were used in the application unless the grants 
officer indicates a letter of request suffices.
    (k) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request 
for budget revisions, the grants officer shall review the request and 
notify the recipient whether the budget revisions have been approved. If 
the revision is still under consideration at the end of 30 calendar 
days, the grants officer shall inform the recipient in writing of the 
date when the recipient may expect the decision.

Sec. 32.26  Non-Federal audits.

    (a) Recipients and subrecipients that are institutions of higher 
education or other non-profit organizations (including hospitals) shall 
be subject to the audit requirements contained in the Single Audit Act 
Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-
133,\7\ ``Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit 
Organizations.''

    (b) State and local governments that are subrecipients shall be 
subject to the audit requirements contained in the Single Audit Act 
Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, 
``Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.''
    (c) Hospitals that are subrecipients and are not covered by the 
audit provisions of revised OMB Circular A-133 shall be subject to the 
audit requirements specified in award terms and conditions.

to the audit requirements specified in 32 CFR 34.16.


<R05>
Sec. 32.27  Allowable costs.

    (a) General. For each kind of recipient or subrecipient of a cost-
type assistance award, or each contractor receiving a. cost-type 
contract under an

[[Page 159]]

assistance award, there is a set of Federal principles for determining 
allowable costs. Allowability of costs shall be determined in accordance 
with the cost principles applicable to the entity incurring the costs.
    (b) Governmental organizations. Allowability of costs incurred by 
State, local or federally-recognized Indian tribal governments that may 
be subrecipients or contractors under awards subject to this part is 
determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-87,\8\ 
``Cost Principles for State and Local Governments.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 32.1(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Non-profit organizations. The allowability of costs incurred by 
non-profit organizations that may be recipients or subrecipients of 
awards subject to this part, or contractors under such awards, is 
determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-122, 
``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations.''
    (d) Higher educational institutions. The allowability of costs 
incurred by institutions of higher education that may be recipients, 
subrecipients, or contractors is determined in accordance with the 
provisions of OMB Circular A-21, ``Cost Principles for Educational 
Institutions.''
    (e) Hospitals. The allowability of costs incurred by hospitals that 
are recipients, subrecipients, or contractors is determined in 
accordance with the provisions of Appendix E to 45 CFR part 74, 
``Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and 
Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals.''
    (f) For-profit organizations. The allowability of costs incurred by 
subrecipients or contractors that are either for-profit organizations or 
non-profit organizations listed in Attachment C to Circular A-122 is 
determined in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 31; however, the grants officer or the 
award terms and conditions may in rare cases authorize a determination 
of allowable costs that are in accordance with uniform cost accounting 
standards and comply with cost principles acceptable to the Department 
of Defense.


<R05>
Sec. 32.28  Period of availability of funds.

    Where a funding period is specified, a recipient may charge to the 
award only allowable costs resulting from obligations incurred during 
the funding period and any pre-award costs (see Sec. 32.25(d)(2)(i)) 
authorized by the DoD Component.

                           Property Standards


<R05>
Sec. 32.30  Purpose of property standards.

    Sections 32.31 through 32.37 set forth uniform standards governing 
management and disposition of property furnished by the Federal 
Government and property whose cost was charged to a project supported by 
a Federal award. DoD Components shall require recipients to observe 
these standards under awards and shall not impose additional 
requirements, unless specifically required by Federal statute. The 
recipient may use its own property management standards and procedures 
provided it observes the provisions of Sec. Sec. 32.31 through 32.37.


<R05>
Sec. 32.31  Insurance coverage.

    Recipients shall, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance 
coverage for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds as 
provided to property owned by the recipient. Federally-owned property 
need not be insured unless required by the terms and conditions of the 
award.


<R05>
Sec. 32.32  Real property.

    Each DoD Component that makes awards under which real property is 
acquired in whole or in part with Federal funds shall prescribe 
requirements for recipients concerning the use and disposition of such 
property. Unless otherwise provided by statute, such requirements, at a 
minimum, shall contain the following:
    (a) Title to real property shall vest in the recipient subject to 
the condition that the recipient shall use the real property for the 
authorized purpose of the project as long as it is needed and shall not 
encumber the property without approval of the DoD Component.
    (b) The recipient shall obtain written approval by the grants 
officer for the use of real property in other federally sponsored 
projects when the recipient

[[Page 160]]

determines that the property is no longer needed for the purpose of the 
original project. Use in other projects shall be limited to those under 
federally sponsored projects (i.e., awards) or programs that have 
purposes consistent with those authorized for support by the DoD 
Component.
    (c) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the recipient shall request 
disposition instructions from the DoD Component or its successor Federal 
agency. The responsible Federal agency shall observe one or more of the 
following disposition instructions:
    (1) The recipient may be permitted to retain title without further 
obligation to the Federal Government after it compensates the Federal 
Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the 
property attributable to the Federal participation in the project.
    (2) The recipient may be directed to sell the property under 
guidelines provided by the DoD Component and pay the Federal Government 
for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property 
attributable to the Federal participation in the project (after 
deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, 
from the sales proceeds). When the recipient is authorized or required 
to sell the property, proper sales procedures shall be established that 
provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the 
highest possible return.
    (3) The recipient may be directed to transfer title to the property 
to the Federal Government or to an eligible third party provided that, 
in such cases, the recipient shall be entitled to compensation for its 
attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the 
property.


<R05>
Sec. 32.33  Federally-owned and exempt property.

    (a) Federally-owned property. (1) Title to federally-owned property 
remains vested in the Federal Government. Recipients shall submit 
annually an inventory listing of federally-owned property in their 
custody to the DoD Component that made the award. Upon completion of the 
award or when the property is no longer needed, the recipient shall 
report the property to the DoD Component for further Federal agency 
utilization.
    (2) If the DoD Component that made the award has no further need for 
the property, it shall be declared excess and either:
    (i) Reported to the General Services Administration, in accordance 
with the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 
U.S.C. 483(b)(2)), as implemented by General Services Administration 
regulations at 41 CFR 101-47.202; or
    (ii) Disposed of by alternative methods pursuant to other specific 
statutory authority. For example, DoD Components are authorized by the 
Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710(i)), to donate research 
equipment to educational and non-profit organizations for the conduct of 
technical and scientific education and research activities--donations 
under this Act shall be in accordance with the DoD implementation of 
E.O. 12999 (3 CFR, 1996 Comp., p. 180), ``Educational Technology: 
Ensuring Opportunity for All Children in the Next Century,'' as 
applicable. Appropriate instructions shall be issued to the recipient by 
the DoD Component.
    (b) Exempt property. (1) When statutory authority exists, a DoD 
Component may vest title to property acquired with Federal funds in the 
recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government and under 
conditions the DoD Component considers appropriate. For example, under 
31 U.S.C. 6306, DoD Components may so vest title to tangible personal 
property under a grant or cooperative agreement for basic or applied 
research in a nonprofit institution of higher education or a nonprofit 
organization whose primary purpose is conducting scientific research. 
Such property is ``exempt property.''
    (2) As a matter of policy, DoD Components shall make maximum use of 
the authority of 31 U.S.C. 6306 to vest title to exempt property in 
institutions of higher education, without further obligation to the 
Government, to enhance the university infrastructure for future 
performance of defense research

[[Page 161]]

and related, science and engineering education.
    (3) DoD Components may establish conditions, in regulation or in 
award terms and conditions, for vesting title to exempt property. Should 
a DoD Component not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon 
acquisition shall vest in the recipient without further obligation to 
the Federal Government.


<R05>
Sec. 32.34  Equipment.

    (a) Title to equipment acquired by a recipient with Federal funds 
shall vest in the recipient, subject to conditions of this section.
    (b) The recipient shall not use equipment acquired with Federal 
funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee 
that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, 
unless specifically authorized by Federal statute, for as long as the 
Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment.
    (c) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program 
for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project 
or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and shall not 
encumber the property without approval of the DoD Component that made 
the award. When no longer needed for the original project or program, 
the recipient shall use the equipment in connection with its other 
federally-sponsored activities, in the following order of priority:
    (1) First, activities sponsored by the DoD Component that funded the 
original project.
    (2) Second, activities sponsored by other DoD Components.
    (3) Then, activities sponsored by other Federal agencies.
    (d) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program 
for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make it available for use 
on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with 
the work on the project or program for which the equipment was 
originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given 
to other projects or programs sponsored by the DoD Component that 
financed the equipment; second preference shall be given to projects or 
programs sponsored by other DoD Components; and third preference shall 
be given to projects or programs sponsored by other Federal agencies. If 
the property is owned by the Federal Government, use on other activities 
not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if 
authorized by the DoD Component that financed the property. User charges 
shall be treated as program income.
    (e) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient may use the 
equipment to be replaced as trade-in or sell the equipment and use the 
proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment subject to the 
approval of the DoD Component that financed the equipment.
    (f) The recipient's property management standards for equipment 
acquired with Federal funds and federally-owned property shall include 
all of the following:
    (1) Records for equipment and federally-owned property shall be 
maintained accurately and shall include the following information:
    (i) A description of the equipment or federally-owned property.
    (ii) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock 
number, national stock number, or other identification number.
    (iii) Source of the equipment or federally-owned property, including 
the award number.
    (iv) Whether title vests in the recipient or the Federal Government.
    (v) Acquisition date (or date received, if the property was 
furnished by the Federal Government) and cost.
    (vi) Information from which one can calculate the percentage of 
Federal participation in the cost of the equipment (not applicable to 
property furnished by the Federal Government).
    (vii) Location and condition of the equipment or federally-owned 
property and the date the information was reported.
    (viii) Unit acquisition cost.
    (ix) Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales 
price or the method used to determine current fair market value where a 
recipient compensates the DoD Component that made the award for its 
share.

[[Page 162]]

    (2) Property owned by the Federal Government shall be identified to 
indicate Federal ownership.
    (3) A physical inventory of equipment and federally-owned property 
shall be taken and the results reconciled with the equipment records at 
least once every two years. Any differences between quantities 
determined by the physical inspection and those shown in the accounting 
records shall be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. 
The recipient shall, in connection with the inventory, verify the 
existence, current utilization, and continued need for the equipment or 
federally-owned property.
    (4) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate 
safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the equipment or 
federally-owned property. Any loss, damage, or theft of equipment or 
federally-owned property shall be investigated and fully documented; if 
the property was owned by the Federal Government, the recipient shall 
promptly notify the DoD Component.
    (5) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the 
equipment or federally-owned property in good condition.
    (6) Where the recipient is authorized or required to sell the 
equipment, proper sales procedures shall be established which provide 
for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest 
possible return.
    (g) When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, the equipment 
may be used for other activities in accordance with the following 
standards.
    (1) For equipment with a current per unit fair market value of 
$5,000 or more, the recipient may retain the equipment for other uses 
provided that compensation is made to the DoD Component that originally 
made the award or its successor. The amount of compensation shall be 
computed by applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost 
of the original project or program to the current fair market value of 
the equipment.
    (2) If the recipient has no need for the equipment, the recipient 
shall request disposition instructions from the DoD Component. The DoD 
Component shall issue instructions to the recipient no later than 120 
calendar days after the recipient's request and the following procedures 
shall govern:
    (i) The grants officer, in consultation with the program manager, 
shall judge whether the age and nature of the equipment warrant a 
screening procedure to determine whether the equipment is useful to a 
DoD Component or other Federal agency. If a screening procedure is 
warranted:
    (A) The DoD Component shall determine whether the equipment can be 
used to meet DoD requirements.
    (B) If no DoD requirement exists, the availability of the equipment 
shall be reported to the General Services Administration by the DoD 
Component to determine whether a requirement for the equipment exists in 
other Federal agencies.
    (ii) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued 
within 120 calendar days after the recipient's request, the recipient 
shall sell the equipment and reimburse the DoD Component that made the 
award an amount computed by applying to the sales proceeds the 
percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project 
or program. However, the recipient shall be permitted to deduct and 
retain from the Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, 
whichever is less, for the recipient's selling and handling expenses.
    (iii) If the recipient is instructed to ship the equipment 
elsewhere, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal Government 
by an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the 
recipient's participation in the cost of the original project or program 
to the current fair market value of the equipment, plus any reasonable 
shipping or interim storage costs incurred.
    (iv) If the recipient is instructed to otherwise dispose of the 
equipment, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the DoD Component that 
made the award for such costs incurred in its disposition.
    (h) The DoD Component may reserve the right to transfer the title to 
the Federal Government or to a third party named by the Federal 
Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing 
statutes. Such

[[Page 163]]

transfer shall be subject to the following standards.
    (1) The equipment shall be appropriately identified in the award or 
otherwise made known to the recipient in writing. For exempt property, 
in accordance with Sec. 32.33(b)(3), note that this identification must 
occur by the time of award, or title to the property vests in the 
recipient without further obligation to the Government.
    (2) The DoD Component shall issue disposition instructions within 
120 calendar days after receipt of a final inventory. The final 
inventory shall list all equipment acquired with award funds and 
federally-owned property. If the DoD Component fails to issue 
disposition instructions for equipment within the 120 calendar day 
period, the recipient shall apply the standards of paragraph (g) of this 
section.
    (3) When the DoD Component exercises its right to take title, the 
equipment shall be subject to the provisions for federally-owned 
property.


<R05>
Sec. 32.35  Supplies.

    (a) Title to supplies shall vest in the recipient upon acquisition. 
If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies exceeding $5,000 in 
total aggregate value upon termination or completion of the project or 
program and the supplies are not needed for any other federally-
sponsored project or program, the recipient shall retain the supplies 
for use on non-Federal sponsored activities or sell them, but shall, in 
either case, compensate the Federal Government for its share. The amount 
of compensation shall be computed in the same manner as for equipment.
    (b) The recipient shall not use supplies acquired with Federal funds 
to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee that 
is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless 
specifically authorized by Federal statute as long as the Federal 
Government retains an interest in the supplies.


<R05>
Sec. 32.36  Intangible property.

    (a) The recipient may copyright any work that is subject to 
copyright and was developed, or for which ownership was purchased, under 
an award. DoD Components reserve a royalty-free, nonexclusive and 
irrevocable right to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work for 
Federal purposes, and to authorize others to do so.
    (b) Recipients are subject to applicable regulations governing 
patents and inventions, including Governmentwide regulations issued by 
the Department of Commerce at 37 CFR part 401, ``Rights to Inventions 
Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms Under 
Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements.''
    (c) The Federal Government has the right to:
    (1) Obtain, reproduce, publish or otherwise use the data first 
produced under an award; and
    (2) Authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise 
use such data for Federal purposes.
    (d)(1) In addition, in response to a Freedom of Information Act 
(FOIA) request for research data relating to published research findings 
produced under an award that were used by the Federal Government in 
developing an agency action that has the force and effect of law, the 
DoD Component that made the award shall request, and the recipient shall 
provide, within a reasonable time, the research data so that they can be 
made available to the public through the procedures established under 
the FOIA. If the DoD Component that made the award obtains the research 
data solely in response to a FOIA request, the agency may charge the 
requester a reasonable fee equaling the full incremental cost of 
obtaining the research data. This fee should reflect costs incurred by 
the agency, the recipient, and applicable subrecipients. This fee is in 
addition to any fees the agency may assess under the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 
552(a)(4)(A)).
    (2) The following definitions apply for purposes of this paragraph 
(d):
    (i) Research data is defined as the recorded factual material 
commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate 
research findings, but not any of the following: preliminary analyses, 
drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, or 
communications with colleagues. This ``recorded'' material excludes 
physical objects (e.g., laboratory

[[Page 164]]

samples). Research data also do not include:
    (A) Trade secrets, commercial information, materials necessary to be 
held confidential by a researcher until they are published, or similar 
information which is protected under law; and
    (B) Personnel and medical information and similar information the 
disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of 
personal privacy, such as information that could be used to identify a 
particular person in a research study.
    (ii) Published is defined as either when:
    (A) Research findings are published in a peer-reviewed scientific or 
technical journal; or
    (B) A Federal agency publicly and officially cites the research 
findings in support of an agency action that has the force and effect of 
law.
    (iii) Used by the Federal Government in developing an agency action 
that has the force and effect of law is defined as when an agency 
publicly and officially cites the research findings in support of an 
agency action that has the force and effect of law.
    (e) Title to intangible property and debt instruments acquired under 
an award or subaward (rather than developed or produced under the award 
or subaward) vests upon acquisition in the recipient. The recipient 
shall use that property for the originally-authorized purpose, and the 
recipient shall not encumber the property without approval of the DoD 
Component that made the award. When no longer needed for the originally 
authorized purpose, disposition of the intangible property shall occur 
in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 32.34(g).

[63 FR 12188, Mar. 12, 1998, as amended at 65 FR 14407, 14416, Mar. 16, 
2000]


<R05>
Sec. 32.37  Property trust relationship.

    Real property, equipment, intangible property and debt instruments 
that are acquired or improved with Federal funds shall be held in trust 
by the recipient as trustee for the beneficiaries of the project or 
program under which the property was acquired or improved. DoD 
Components may require recipients to record liens or other appropriate 
notices of record to indicate that personal or real property has been 
acquired or improved with Federal funds and that use and disposition 
conditions apply to the property.

                          Procurement Standards


<R05>
Sec. 32.40  Purpose of procurement standards.

    Sections 32.41 through 32.48 set forth standards for use by 
recipients in establishing procedures for the procurement of supplies 
and other expendable property, equipment, real property and other 
services with Federal funds. These standards are furnished to ensure 
that such materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and 
in compliance with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and 
executive orders.


<R05>
Sec. 32.41  Recipient responsibilities.

    The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient 
of the contractual responsibilities arising under its contract(s). The 
recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to the DoD 
Component that made the award, regarding the settlement and satisfaction 
of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements 
entered into in support of an award or other agreement. This includes 
disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters 
of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to 
be referred to such Federal, State or local authority as may have proper 
jurisdiction.


<R05>
Sec. 32.42  Codes of conduct.

    The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing 
the performance of its employees engaged in the award and administration 
of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the 
selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by Federal 
funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved. Such 
a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member 
of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization 
which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, 
has a financial or other interest

[[Page 165]]

in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents 
of the recipient shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or 
anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to 
subagreements. However, recipients may set standards for situations in 
which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an 
unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall 
provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such 
standards by officers, employees, or agents of the recipient.


<R05>
Sec. 32.43  Competition.

    All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to 
provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and free competition. The 
recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well 
as noncompetitive practices among contractors that may restrict or 
eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to ensure 
objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive 
advantage, contractors that develop or draft specifications, 
requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests 
for proposals shall be excluded from competing for such procurements. 
Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer is 
responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the 
recipient, price, quality and other factors considered. Solicitations 
shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror 
shall fulfill in order for the bid or offer to be evaluated by the 
recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the 
recipient's interest to do so.


<R05>
Sec. 32.44  Procurement procedures.

    (a) All recipients shall establish written procurement procedures. 
These procedures shall provide, at a minimum, that:
    (1) Recipients avoid purchasing unnecessary items;
    (2) Where appropriate, an analysis is made of lease and purchase 
alternatives to determine which would be the most economical and 
practical procurement; and
    (3) Solicitations for goods and services provide for all of the 
following:
    (i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements 
for the material, product or service to be procured. In competitive 
procurements, such a description shall not contain features which unduly 
restrict competition.
    (ii) Requirements which the bidder/offeror must fulfill and all 
other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.
    (iii) A description, whenever practicable, of technical requirements 
in terms of functions to be performed or performance required, including 
the range of acceptable characteristics or minimum acceptable standards.
    (iv) The specific features of ``brand name or equal'' descriptions 
that bidders are required to meet when such items are included in the 
solicitation.
    (v) The acceptance, to the extent practicable and economically 
feasible, of products and services dimensioned in the metric system of 
measurement.
    (vi) Preference, to the extent practicable and economically 
feasible, for products and services that conserve natural resources and 
protect the environment and are energy efficient.
    (b) Positive efforts shall be made by recipients to utilize small 
businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises, 
whenever possible. Recipients of Federal awards shall take all of the 
following steps to further this goal:
    (1) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's 
business enterprises are used to the fullest extent practicable.
    (2) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and 
arrange time frames for purchases and contracts to encourage and 
facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and 
women's business enterprises.
    (3) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for 
larger contracts intend to subcontract with small businesses, minority-
owned firms, and women's business enterprises.
    (4) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, 
minority-

[[Page 166]]

owned firms and women's business enterprises when a contract is too 
large for one of these firms to handle individually.
    (5) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such 
organizations as the Small Business Administration and the Department of 
Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and 
utilization of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's 
business enterprises.
    (c) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price 
contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase orders, and incentive 
contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but shall be appropriate 
for the particular procurement and for promoting the best interest of 
the program or project involved. The ``cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost'' 
or ``percentage of construction cost'' methods of contracting shall not 
be used.
    (d) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who 
possess the potential ability to perform successfully under the terms 
and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given 
to such matters as contractor integrity, record of past performance, 
financial and technical resources or accessibility to other necessary 
resources. In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are 
restricted by the DoD implementation, in 32 CFR part 25, of E.O.s 12549 
(3 CFR, 1986 Comp., p. 189) and 12689 (3 CFR, 1989 Comp., p. 235), 
``Debarment and Suspension.''
    (e) Recipients shall, on request, make available for the DoD 
Component's pre-award review, procurement documents such as request for 
proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc., 
when any of the following conditions apply:
    (1) A recipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to 
comply with the procurement standards in this part.
    (2) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition 
threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403 (11) (currently $100,000) and is to be 
awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in 
response to a solicitation.
    (3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product.
    (4) The proposed award over the simplified acquisition threshold is 
to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid 
procurement.
    (5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract 
or increases the contract amount by more than the amount of the 
simplified acquisition threshold.


<R05>
Sec. 32.45  Cost and price analysis.

    Some form of cost or price analysis shall be made and documented in 
the procurement files in connection with every procurement action. Price 
analysis may be accomplished in various ways, including the comparison 
of price quotations submitted, market prices and similar indicia, 
together with discounts. Cost analysis is the review and evaluation of 
each element of cost to determine reasonableness, allocability and 
allowability.


<R05>
Sec. 32.46  Procurement records.

    Procurement records and files for purchases in excess of the 
simplified acquisition threshold shall include the following at a 
minimum:
    (a) Basis for contractor selection;
    (b) Justification for lack of competition when competitive bids or 
offers are not obtained; and
    (c) Basis for award cost or price.


<R05>
Sec. 32.47  Contract administration.

    A system for contract administration shall be maintained to ensure 
contractor conformance with the terms, conditions and specifications of 
the contract and to ensure adequate and timely follow up of all 
purchases. Recipients shall evaluate contractor performance and 
document, as appropriate, whether contractors have met the terms, 
conditions and specifications of the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 32.48  Contract provisions.

    The recipient shall include, in addition to provisions to define a 
sound and complete agreement, the following provisions in all contracts. 
The following provisions shall also be applied to subcontracts:

[[Page 167]]

    (a) Contracts in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold 
shall contain contractual provisions or conditions that allow for 
administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a 
contractor violates or breaches the contract terms, and provide for such 
remedial actions as may be appropriate.
    (b) All contracts in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold 
shall contain suitable provisions for termination by the recipient, 
including the manner by which termination shall be effected and the 
basis for settlement. In addition, such contracts shall describe 
conditions under which the contract may be terminated for default as 
well as conditions where the contract may be terminated because of 
circumstances beyond the control of the contractor.
    (c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires 
the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction or facility 
improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own 
requirements relating to bid guarantees, performance bonds, and payment 
bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. 
For those contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, the DoD 
Component may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the 
recipient, provided the grants officer has made a determination that the 
Federal Government's interest is adequately protected. If such a 
determination has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as 
follows:
    (1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of 
the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist of a firm commitment 
such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument 
accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder shall, upon acceptance 
of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within 
the time specified.
    (2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent 
of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is one executed in 
connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's 
obligations under such contract.
    (3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of 
the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed in connection 
with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons 
supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for 
in the contract.
    (4) Where bonds are required in the situations described in 
Sec. Sec. 32.40 through 32.49, the bonds shall be obtained from 
companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties 
pursuant to 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies Doing Business with the 
United States.''
    (d) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the 
simplified acquisition threshold) awarded by recipients shall include a 
provision to the effect that the recipient, the Department of Defense, 
the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly 
authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, 
papers and records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to a 
specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, 
excerpts and transcriptions.
    (e) All contracts, including those for amounts less than the 
simplified acquisition threshold, by recipients and their contractors 
shall contain the procurement provisions of Appendix A to this part, as 
applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 32.49  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

    Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (section 
6002, Pub. L. 94-580, 42 U.S.C. 6962), any State agency or agency of a 
political subdivision of a State which is using appropriated Federal 
funds must comply with section 6002. Section 6002 requires that 
preference be given in procurement programs to the purchase of specific 
products containing recycled materials identified in guidelines 
developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (40 CFR parts 
247-254). Accordingly, State and local institutions of higher education, 
hospitals, and non-profit organizations that receive direct Federal 
awards or other Federal funds shall give preference in their procurement 
programs funded with Federal funds to the purchase of

[[Page 168]]

recycled products pursuant to the EPA guidelines.

                           Reports and Records


<R05>
Sec. 32.50  Purpose of reports and records.

    Sections 32.51 through 32.53 set forth the procedures for monitoring 
and reporting on the recipient's financial and program performance and 
the necessary standard reporting forms. They also set forth record 
retention requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 32.51  Monitoring and reporting program performance.

    (a) Recipients are responsible for managing and monitoring each 
project, program, subaward, function or activity supported by the award. 
Recipients shall monitor subawards to ensure subrecipients have met the 
audit requirements as delineated in Sec. 32.26.
    (b) The award terms and conditions shall prescribe the frequency 
with which the performance reports shall be submitted. Except as 
provided in paragraph (f) of this section, performance reports shall not 
be required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently than 
annually. Annual reports shall be due 90 calendar days after the award 
year; quarterly or semi-annual reports shall be due 30 calendar days 
after the reporting period. DoD Components may require annual reports 
before the anniversary dates of multiple year awards in lieu of these 
requirements. The final performance reports are due 90 calendar days 
after the expiration or termination of the award.
    (c) If inappropriate, a final technical or performance report shall 
not be required after completion of the project.
    (d) When required, performance reports shall generally contain, for 
each award, brief information on each of the following:
    (1) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and 
objectives established for the period, the findings of the investigator, 
or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can 
be readily quantified, such quantitative data should be related to cost 
data for computation of unit costs. However, unit costs are generally 
inappropriate for research (see Sec. 32.21 (a) and (b)(4)).
    (2) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate.
    (3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, 
analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.
    (e) Recipients shall not be required to submit more than the 
original and two copies of performance reports.
    (f) Recipients shall immediately notify the grants officer of 
developments that have a significant impact on the award-supported 
activities. Also, notification shall be given in the case of problems, 
delays, or adverse conditions which materially impair the ability to 
meet the objectives of the award. This notification shall include a 
statement of the action taken or contemplated, and any assistance needed 
to resolve the situation.
    (g) DoD Components' representatives may make site visits, as needed.
    (h) DoD Components shall comply with applicable clearance 
requirements of 5 CFR part 1320 when requesting performance data from 
recipients.


<R05>
Sec. 32.52  Financial reporting.

    (a) The following forms or such other forms as may be approved by 
OMB are authorized for obtaining financial information from recipients:
    (1) SF-269 \9\ or SF-269A,\10\ Financial Status Report. (i) DoD 
Components shall require recipients to use the SF-269 or SF-269A to 
report the status of funds for all nonconstruction projects or programs. 
A DoD Component may, however, have the option of not requiring the SF-
269 or SF-269A when the SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement, or 
SF-272,\11\ Report of Federal Cash Transactions, is determined to 
provide adequate information to meet agency needs, except that a final 
SF-269 or SF-269A shall be required at the completion of the project 
when the SF-270 is used only for advances.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ See footnote 2 to Sec. 32.12(a).
    \10\ See footnote 2 to Sec. 32.12(a).
    \11\ See footnote 2 to Sec. 32.12(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) The DoD Component shall prescribe whether the report shall be 
on a cash or accrual basis. If the award requires accrual information 
and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on the 
accrual basis, the

[[Page 169]]

recipient shall not be required to convert its accounting system, but 
shall develop such accrual information through best estimates based on 
an analysis of the documentation on hand.
    (iii) The DoD Component shall determine the frequency of the 
Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering the 
size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the 
report shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or less 
frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the 
completion of the award.
    (iv) The DoD Component shall require recipients to submit the SF-269 
or SF-269A (an original and no more than two copies) no later than 30 
calendar days after the end of each specified reporting period for 
quarterly and semi-annual reports, and 90 calendar days for annual and 
final reports. Extensions of reporting due dates may be approved by the 
grants officer upon request of the recipient.
    (2) SF-272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions. (i) When funds are 
advanced to recipients the DoD Component shall require each recipient to 
submit the SF-272 and, when necessary, its continuation sheet, SF-
272a.\12\ The grants officer shall use this report to monitor cash 
advanced to recipients and to obtain disbursement information for each 
award to the recipients.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ See footnote 2 to Sec. 32.12(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) DoD Components may require forecasts of Federal cash 
requirements in the ``Remarks'' section of the report.
    (iii) When practical and deemed necessary, DoD Components may 
require recipients to report in the ``Remarks'' section the amount of 
cash advances received in excess of three working days. Recipients shall 
provide short narrative explanations of actions taken to reduce the 
excess balances.
    (iv) Recipients shall be required to submit not more than the 
original and two copies of the SF-272 15 calendar days following the end 
of each quarter. DoD Components may require a monthly report from those 
recipients receiving advances totaling $1 million or more per year.
    (v) DoD Components may waive the requirement for submission of the 
SF-272 for any one of the following reasons:
    (A) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, 
provided that such advances are monitored through other forms contained 
in this section;
    (B) If, in the grants officer's opinion, the recipient's accounting 
controls are adequate to minimize excessive Federal advances; or
    (C) When electronic payment mechanisms or SF-270 forms provide 
adequate data.
    (b) When the DoD Component needs additional information or more 
frequent reports, the following shall be observed:
    (1) When additional information is needed to comply with legislative 
requirements, grants officers shall issue instructions to require 
recipients to submit such information under the ``Remarks'' section of 
the reports.
    (2) When a grants officer, after consultation with the Federal 
agency assigned cognizance for a recipient's audit and audit resolution, 
determines that the recipient's accounting system does not meet the 
standards in Sec. 32.21, additional pertinent information to further 
monitor awards may be obtained upon written notice to the recipient 
until such time as the system is brought up to standard. The grants 
officer, in obtaining this information, shall comply with applicable 
report clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320.
    (3) Grants officers are encouraged to shade out any line item on any 
report if not necessary.
    (4) DoD Components are encouraged to accept the identical 
information from the recipients in machine readable format or computer 
printouts or electronic outputs in lieu of prescribed formats.
    (5) DoD Components may provide computer or electronic outputs to 
recipients when it expedites or contributes to the accuracy of 
reporting.


<R05>
Sec. 32.53  Retention and access requirements for records.

    (a) This section sets forth requirements for record retention and 
access

[[Page 170]]

to records for awards to recipients. DoD Components shall not impose any 
other record retention or access requirements upon recipients.
    (b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, 
and all other records pertinent to an award shall be retained for a 
period of three years from the date of submission of the final 
expenditure report. The only exceptions are the following:
    (1) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the 
expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall be retained until all 
litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been 
resolved and final action taken.
    (2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal 
funds shall be retained for 3 years after final disposition.
    (3) When records are transferred to or maintained by the DoD 
Component that made the award, the 3-year retention requirement is not 
applicable to the recipient.
    (4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, and 
related records, for which retention requirements are specified in 
paragraph (g) of this section.
    (c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original 
records if authorized by the grants officer.
    (d) The grants officer shall request that recipients transfer 
certain records to DoD Component custody when he or she determines that 
the records possess long term retention value. However, in order to 
avoid duplicate recordkeeping, a grants officer may make arrangements 
for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for 
joint use.
    (e) DoD Components, the Inspector General, Comptroller General of 
the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, have 
the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents, 
papers, or other records of recipients that are pertinent to the awards, 
in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, transcripts and copies 
of such documents. This right also includes timely and reasonable access 
to a recipient's personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion 
related to such documents. The rights of access in this paragraph are 
not limited to the required retention period, but shall last as long as 
records are retained.
    (f) Unless required by statute, no DoD Component shall place 
restrictions on recipients that limit public access to the records of 
recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when the DoD Component 
can demonstrate that such records shall be kept confidential and would 
have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records had belonged to the DoD 
Component making the award.
    (g) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. 
Paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section apply to the following 
types of documents, and their supporting records: indirect cost rate 
computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar 
accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs 
is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite 
fringe benefit rates).
    (1) If submitted for negotiation. If the recipient submits an 
indirect-cost proposal, plan, or other computation to the Federal agency 
responsible for negotiating the recipient's indirect cost rate, as the 
basis for negotiation of the rate, or the subrecipient submits such a 
proposal, plan, or computation to the recipient, then the 3-year 
retention period for its supporting records starts on the date of such 
submission.
    (2) If not submitted for negotiation. If the recipient is not 
required to submit to the cognizant Federal agency or the subrecipient 
is not required to submit to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other 
computation for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year retention period 
for the proposal, plan, or other computation and its supporting records 
starts at the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) 
covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.
    (h) If the information described in this section is maintained on a 
computer, recipients shall retain the computer data on a reliable medium 
for the time periods prescribed. Recipients may transfer computer data 
in machine readable form from one reliable

[[Page 171]]

computer medium to another. Recipients' computer data retention and 
transfer procedures shall maintain the integrity, reliability, and 
security of the original computer data. Recipients shall also maintain 
an audit trail describing the data transfer. For the record retention 
time periods prescribed in this section, recipients shall not destroy, 
discard, delete, or write over such computer data.

                       Termination and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 32.60  Purpose of termination and enforcement.

    Sections 32.61 and 32.62 set forth uniform suspension, termination 
and enforcement procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 32.61  Termination.

    (a) Awards may be terminated in whole or in part only as follows:
    (1) By the grants officer, if a recipient materially fails to comply 
with the terms and conditions of an award;
    (2) By the grants officer with the consent of the recipient, in 
which case the two parties shall agree upon the termination conditions, 
including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, 
the portion to be terminated; or
    (3) By the recipient upon sending to the grants officer written 
notification setting forth the reasons for such termination, the 
effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to 
be terminated. The recipient must provide such notice at least 30 
calendar days prior to the effective date of the termination. However, 
if the grants officer determines in the case of partial termination that 
the reduced or modified portion of the award will not accomplish the 
purposes for which the award was made, he or she may terminate the award 
in its entirety.
    (b) If costs are allowed under an award, the responsibilities of the 
recipient referred to in Sec. 32.71, including those for property 
management as applicable, shall be considered in the termination of the 
award, and provision shall be made for continuing responsibilities of 
the recipient after termination, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 32.62  Enforcement.

    (a) Remedies for noncompliance. If a recipient materially fails to 
comply with the terms and conditions of an award, whether stated in a 
Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, 
the grants officer may, in addition to imposing any of the special 
conditions outlined in Sec. 32.14, take one or more of the following 
actions, as appropriate in the circumstances:
    (1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the 
deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement action by the 
grants officer and DoD Component.
    (2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable 
matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action 
not in compliance.
    (3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award.
    (4) Withhold further awards for the project or program.
    (5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.
    (b) Hearings and appeals. In taking an enforcement action, the DoD 
Component shall provide the recipient an opportunity for hearing, 
appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the recipient is 
entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action 
involved. Award terms or conditions will incorporate the procedures of 
32 CFR 22.815 for processing recipient claims and disputes and for 
deciding appeals of grants officers' decisions.
    (c) Effects of suspension and termination. Costs of a recipient 
resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension 
or after termination of an award are not allowable unless the grants 
officer expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or 
termination or subsequently. Other recipient costs during suspension or 
after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are 
allowable if the costs:
    (1) Result from obligations which were properly incurred by the 
recipient before the effective date of suspension or termination, are 
not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are 
noncancellable; and

[[Page 172]]

    (2) Would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired 
normally at the end of the funding period in which the termination takes 
effect.
    (d) Relationship to debarment and suspension. The enforcement 
remedies identified in this section, including suspension and 
termination, do not preclude a recipient from being subject to debarment 
and suspension under 32 CFR part 25.


<R04>
                 Subpart D_After-the-Award Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 32.70  Purpose.

    Sections 32.71 through 32.73 contain closeout procedures and other 
procedures for subsequent disallowances and adjustments.


<R05>
Sec. 32.71  Closeout procedures.

    (a) Recipients shall submit, within 90 calendar days after the date 
of completion of the award, all financial, performance, and other 
reports required by the terms and conditions of the award. The grants 
officer may approve extensions when requested by the recipient.
    (b) Unless the grants officer authorizes an extension, a recipient 
shall liquidate all obligations incurred under the award not later than 
90 calendar days after the funding period or the date of completion as 
specified in the terms and conditions of the award or in agency 
implementing instructions.
    (c) The responsible grants officer and payment office shall expedite 
completion of steps needed to close out awards and make prompt, final 
payments to a recipient for allowable reimbursable costs under the award 
being closed out.
    (d) The recipient shall promptly refund any balances of unobligated 
cash that the DoD Component has advanced or paid and that is not 
authorized to be retained by the recipient for use in other projects. 
OMB Circular A-129\13\ governs unreturned amounts that become delinquent 
debts (see 32 CFR 22.820).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 32.1(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) When authorized by the terms and conditions of the award, the 
grants officer shall make a settlement for any upward or downward 
adjustments to the Federal share of costs after closeout reports are 
received.
    (f) The recipient shall account for any real and personal property 
acquired with Federal funds or received from the Federal Government in 
accordance with Sec. Sec. 32.31 through 32.37.
    (g) In the event a final audit has not been performed prior to the 
closeout of an award, the DoD Component shall retain the right to 
recover an appropriate amount after fully considering the 
recommendations on disallowed costs resulting from the final audit.


<R05>
Sec. 32.72  Subsequent adjustments and continuing responsibilities.

    (a) The closeout of an award does not affect any of the following:
    (1) The right of the Department of Defense to disallow costs and 
recover funds on the basis of a later audit or other review.
    (2) The obligation of the recipient to return any funds due as a 
result of later refunds, corrections, or other transactions.
    (3) Audit requirements in Sec. 32.26.
    (4) Property management requirements in Sec. Sec. 32.31 through 
32.37.
    (5) Records retention as required in Sec. 32.53.
    (b) After closeout of an award, a relationship created under an 
award may be modified or ended in whole or in part with the consent of 
the grants officer and the recipient, provided the responsibilities of 
the recipient referred to in Sec. 32.73(a), including those for 
property management as applicable, are considered and provisions made 
for continuing responsibilities of the recipient, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 32.73  Collection of amounts due.

    (a) Any funds paid to a recipient in excess of the amount to which 
the recipient is finally determined to be entitled under the terms and 
conditions of the award constitute a debt to the Federal Government.
    (b) OMB Circular A-110 informs each Federal agency that:
    (1) If a debt is not paid within a reasonable period after the 
demand for payment, the Federal agency may reduce the debt by:

[[Page 173]]

    (i) Making administrative offset against other requests for 
reimbursement.
    (ii) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the recipient.
    (iii) Taking other action permitted by statute.
    (2) Except as otherwise provided by law, the Federal awarding agency 
shall charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance with 4 CFR 
Chapter II, ``Federal Claims Collection Standards.''
    (c) DoD grants officers shall follow the procedures in 32 CFR 22.820 
for issuing demands for payment and transferring debts to DoD payment 
offices for collection. Recipients will be informed about pertinent 
procedures and timeframes through the written notices of grants 
officers' decisions and demands for payment.

               Appendix A to Part 32--Contract Provisions

    All contracts awarded by a recipient, including those for amounts 
less than the simplified acquisition threshold, shall contain the 
following provisions as applicable:
    1. Equal Employment Opportunity--All contracts shall contain a 
provision requiring compliance with E.O. 11246 (3 CFR, 1964-1965 Comp., 
p. 339), ``Equal Employment Opportunity,'' as amended by E.O. 11375 (3 
CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 684), ``Amending Executive Order 11246 Relating 
to Equal Employment Opportunity,'' and as supplemented by regulations at 
41 CFR ch. 60, ``Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Equal 
Employment Opportunity, Department of Labor.''
    2. Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18 U.S.C. 874 and 40 U.S.C. 
276c)--All contracts and subawards in excess of $2000 for construction 
or repair awarded by recipients and subrecipients shall include a 
provision for compliance with the Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18 
U.S.C. 874), as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR 
part 3, ``Contractors and Subcontractors on Public Building or Public 
Work Financed in Whole or in Part by Loans or Grants from the United 
States''). The Act provides that each contractor or subrecipient shall 
be prohibited from inducing, by any means, any person employed in the 
construction, completion, or repair of public work, to give up any part 
of the compensation to which he is otherwise entitled. The recipient 
shall report all suspected or reported violations to the responsible DoD 
Component.
    3. Davis-Bacon Act, as amended (40 U.S.C. 276a to a-7)--This Act 
applies to procurements under awards only when the Federal program 
legislation specifically makes it apply (i.e., Davis-Bacon does not by 
itself apply to procurements under awards). In cases where another 
statute does make the Davis-Bacon Act apply, all construction contracts 
awarded by the recipients and subrecipients of more than $2,000 shall 
include a provision for compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 
276a to a-7) and as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 
CFR part 5, ``Labor Standards Provisions Applicable to Contracts 
Governing Federally Financed and Assisted Construction''). Under this 
Act, contractors shall be required to pay wages to laborers and 
mechanics at a rate not less than the minimum wages specified in a wage 
determination made by the Secretary of Labor. In addition, contractors 
shall be required to pay wages not less than once a week. The recipient 
shall place a copy of the current prevailing wage determination issued 
by the Department of Labor in each solicitation and the award of a 
contract shall be conditioned upon the acceptance of the wage 
determination. The recipient shall report all suspected or reported 
violations to the Federal awarding agency.
    4. Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-
333)--Where applicable, all contracts awarded by recipients in excess of 
$100,000 for construction or other purposes that involve the employment 
of mechanics or laborers shall include a provision for compliance with 
sections 102 and 107 of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act 
(40 U.S.C. 327-333), as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations 
(29 CFR part 5). Under section 102 of the Act, each contractor shall be 
required to compute the wages of every mechanic and laborer on the basis 
of a standard work week of 40 hours. Work in excess of the standard work 
week is permissible provided that the worker is compensated at a rate of 
not less than 1\1/2\ times the basic rate of pay for all hours worked in 
excess of 40 hours in the work week. Section 107 of the Act is 
applicable to construction work and provides that no laborer or mechanic 
shall be required to work in surroundings or under working conditions 
which are unsanitary, hazardous or dangerous. These requirements do not 
apply to the purchases of supplies or materials or articles ordinarily 
available on the open market, or contracts for transportation or 
transmission of intelligence.
    5. Rights to Inventions Made Under a Contract, Grant or Cooperative 
Agreement--Contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements for the 
performance of experimental, developmental, or research work shall 
provide for the rights of the Federal Government and the recipient in 
any resulting invention in accordance with 37 CFR part 401, ``Rights to 
Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations

[[Page 174]]

and Small Business Firms Under Government Grants, Contracts and 
Cooperative Agreements.''
    6. Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) and the Federal Water 
Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), as amended--Contracts 
and subawards of amounts in excess of $100,000 shall contain a provision 
that requires the recipient to agree to comply with all applicable 
standards, orders or regulations issued pursuant to the Clean Air Act 
(42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as 
amended (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). Violations shall be reported to the 
responsible DoD Component and the Regional Office of the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA).
    7. Byrd Anti-Lobbying Amendment (31 U.S.C. 1352)--Contractors who 
apply or bid for an award of $100,000 or more shall file the required 
certification. Each tier certifies to the tier above that it will not 
and has not used Federal appropriated funds to pay any person or 
organization for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or 
employee of any agency, a member of Congress, officer or employee of 
Congress, or an employee of a member of Congress in connection with 
obtaining any Federal contract, grant or any other award covered by 31 
U.S.C. 1352. Each tier shall also disclose any lobbying with non-Federal 
funds that takes place in connection with obtaining any Federal award. 
Such disclosures are forwarded from tier to tier up to the recipient.
    8. Debarment and Suspension (E.O.s 12549 and 12689)--Contract awards

                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 33.1  Purpose and scope of this part.

    This part establishes uniform administrative rules for Federal 
grants and cooperative agreements and subawards

[[Page 175]]

to State, local and Indian tribal governments.


<R05>
Sec. 33.2  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart contains general rules pertaining to this part and 
procedures for control of exceptions from this part.


<R05>
Sec. 33.3  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    Accrued expenditures mean the charges incurred by the grantee during 
a given period requiring the provision of funds for:
    (1) Goods and other tangible property received;
    (2) Services performed by employees, contractors, subgrantees, 
subcontractors, and other payees; and
    (3) Other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current 
services or performance is required, such as annuities, insurance 
claims, and other benefit payments.
    Accrued income means the sum of:
    (1) Earnings during a given period from services performed by the 
grantee and goods and other tangible property delivered to purchasers, 
and
    (2) Amounts becoming owed to the grantee for which no current 
services or performance is required by the grantee.
    Acquisition cost of an item of purchased equipment means the net 
invoice unit price of the property including the cost of modifications, 
attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make the 
property usable for the purpose for which it was acquired. Other charges 
such as the cost of installation, transportation, taxes, duty or 
protective in-transit insurance, shall be included or excluded from the 
unit acquisition cost in accordance with the grantee's regular 
accounting practices.
    Administrative requirements mean those matters common to grants in 
general, such as financial management, kinds and frequency of reports, 
and retention of records. These are distinguished from ``programmatic'' 
requirements, which concern matters that can be treated only on a 
program-by-program or grant-by-grant basis, such as kinds of activities 
that can be supported by grants under a particular program.
    Awarding agency means:
    (1) With respect to a grant, the Federal agency, and
    (2) With respect to a subgrant, the party that awarded the subgrant.
    Cash contributions means the grantee's cash outlay, including the 
outlay of money contributed to the grantee or subgrantee by other public 
agencies and institutions, and private organizations and individuals. 
When authorized by Federal legislation, Federal funds received from 
other assistance agreements may be considered as grantee or subgrantee 
cash contributions.
    Contract means (except as used in the definitions for ``grant'' and 
``subgrant'' in this section and except where qualified by ``Federal'') 
a procurement contract under a grant or subgrant, and means a 
procurement subcontract under a contract.
    Cost sharing or matching means the value of the third party in-kind 
contributions and the portion of the costs of a federally assisted 
project or program not borne by the Federal Government.
    Cost-type contract means a contract or subcontract under a grant in 
which the contractor or subcontractor is paid on the basis of the costs 
it incurs, with or without a fee.
    Equipment means tangible, nonexpendable, personal property having a 
useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or 
more per unit. A grantee may use its own definition of equipment 
provided that such definition would at least include all equipment 
defined above.
    Expenditure report means:
    (1) For nonconstruction grants, the SF-269 ``Financial Status 
Report'' (or other equivalent report);
    (2) For construction grants, the SF-271 ``Outlay Report and Request 
for Reimbursement'' (or other equivalent report).
    Federally recognized Indian tribal government means the governing 
body or a governmental agency of any Indian tribe, band, nation, or 
other organized group or community (including any Native village as 
defined in section 3 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement

[[Page 176]]

Act, 85 Stat. 688) certified by the Secretary of the Interior as 
eligible for the special programs and services provided by him through 
the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
    Government means a State or local government or a federally 
recognized Indian tribal government.
    Grant means an award of financial assistance, including cooperative 
agreements, in the form of money, or property in lieu of money, by the 
Federal Government to an eligible grantee. The term does not include 
technical assistance which provides services instead of money, or other 
assistance in the form of revenue sharing, loans, loan guarantees, 
interest subsidies, insurance, or direct appropriations. Also, the term 
does not include assistance, such as a fellowship or other lump sum 
award, which the grantee is not required to account for.
    Grantee means the government to which a grant is awarded and which 
is accountable for the use of the funds provided. The grantee is the 
entire legal entity even if only a particular component of the entity is 
designated in the grant award document.
    Local government means a county, municipality, city, town, township, 
local public authority (including any public and Indian housing agency 
under the United States Housing Act of 1937) school district, special 
district, intrastate district, council of governments (whether or not 
incorporated as a nonprofit corporation under State law), any other 
regional or interstate government entity, or any agency or 
instrumentality of a local government.
    Obligations means the amounts of orders placed, contracts and 
subgrants awarded, goods and services received, and similar transactions 
during a given period that will require payment by the grantee during 
the same or a future period.
    OMB means the United States Office of Management and Budget.
    Outlays (expenditures) mean charges made to the project or program. 
They may be reported on a cash or accrual basis. For reports prepared on 
a cash basis, outlays are the sum of actual cash disbursement for direct 
charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense incurred, 
the value of in-kind contributions applied, and the amount of cash 
advances and payments made to contractors and subgrantees. For reports 
prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, outlays are the sum of actual 
cash disbursements, the amount of indirect expense incurred, the value 
of inkind contributions applied, and the new increase (or decrease) in 
the amounts owed by the grantee for goods and other property received, 
for services performed by employees, contractors, subgrantees, 
subcontractors, and other payees, and other amounts becoming owed under 
programs for which no current services or performance are required, such 
as annuities, insurance claims, and other benefit payments.
    Percentage of completion method refers to a system under which 
payments are made for construction work according to the percentage of 
completion of the work, rather than to the grantee's cost incurred.
    Prior approval means documentation evidencing consent prior to 
incurring specific cost.
    Real property means land, including land improvements, structures 
and appurtenances thereto, excluding movable machinery and equipment.
    Share, when referring to the awarding agency's portion of real 
property, equipment or supplies, means the same percentage as the 
awarding agency's portion of the acquiring party's total costs under the 
grant to which the acquisition costs under the grant to which the 
acquisition cost of the property was charged. Only costs are to be 
counted--not the value of third-party in-kind contributions.
    State means any of the several States of the United States, the 
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or 
possession of the United States, or any agency or instrumentality of a 
State exclusive of local governments. The term does not include any 
public and Indian housing agency under United States Housing Act of 
1937.
    Subgrant means an award of financial assistance in the form of 
money, or property in lieu of money, made under a grant by a grantee to 
an eligible subgrantee. The term includes financial

[[Page 177]]

assistance when provided by contractual legal agreement, but does not 
include procurement purchases, nor does it include any form of 
assistance which is excluded from the definition of ``grant'' in this 
part.
    Subgrantee means the government or other legal entity to which a 
subgrant is awarded and which is accountable to the grantee for the use 
of the funds provided.
    Supplies means all tangible personal property other than 
``equipment'' as defined in this part.
    Suspension means depending on the context, either:
    (1) Temporary withdrawal of the authority to obligate grant funds 
pending corrective action by the grantee or subgrantee or a decision to 
terminate the grant, or
    (2) An action taken by a suspending official in accordance with 
agency regulations implementing E.O. 12549 to immediately exclude a 
person from participating in grant transactions for a period, pending 
completion of an investigation and such legal or debarment proceedings 
as may ensue.
    Termination means permanent withdrawal of the authority to obligate 
previously-awarded grant funds before that authority would otherwise 
expire. It also means the voluntary relinquishment of that authority by 
the grantee or subgrantee. ``Termination'' does not include:
    (1) Withdrawal of funds awarded on the basis of the grantee's 
underestimate of the unobligated balance in a prior period;
    (2) Withdrawal of the unobligated balance as of the expiration of a 
grant;
    (3) Refusal to extend a grant or award additional funds, to make a 
competing or noncompeting continuation, renewal, extension, or 
supplemental award; or
    (4) Voiding of a grant upon determination that the award was 
obtained fraudulently, or was otherwise illegal or invalid from 
inception.
    Terms of a grant or subgrant mean all requirements of the grant or 
subgrant, whether in statute, regulations, or the award document.
    Third party in-kind contributions mean property or services which 
benefit a federally assisted project or program and which are 
contributed by non-Federal third parties without charge to the grantee, 
or a cost-type contractor under the grant agreement.
    Unliquidated obligations for reports prepared on a cash basis mean 
the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee that has not been 
paid. For reports prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, they 
represent the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee for which an 
outlay has not been recorded.
    Unobligated balance means the portion of the funds authorized by the 
Federal agency that has not been obligated by the grantee and is 
determined by deducting the cumulative obligations from the cumulative 
funds authorized.

<R04>
                    Subpart B_Pre-Award Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 33.10  Forms for applying for grants.

    (a) Scope. (1) This section prescribes forms and instructions to be 
used by governmental organizations (except hospitals and institutions of 
higher education operated by a government) in applying for grants. This 
section is not applicable, however, to formula grant programs which do 
not require applicants to apply for funds on a project basis.
    (2) This section applies only to applications to Federal agencies 
for grants,

[[Page 179]]

and is not required to be applied by grantees in dealing with applicants 
for subgrants. However, grantees are encouraged to avoid more detailed 
or burdensome application requirements for subgrants.
    (b) Authorized forms and instructions for governmental 
organizations. (1) In applying for grants, applicants shall only use 
standard application forms or those prescribed by the granting agency 
with the approval of OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.
    (2) Applicants are not required to submit more than the original and 
two copies of preapplications or applications.
    (3) Applicants must follow all applicable instructions that bear OMB 
clearance numbers. Federal agencies may specify and describe the 
programs, functions, or activities that will be used to plan, budget, 
and evaluate the work under a grant. Other supplementary instructions 
may be issued only with the approval of OMB to the extent required under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. For any standard form, except the 
SF-424 facesheet, Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the 
applicant to disregard any line item that is not needed.
    (4) When a grantee applies for additional funding (such as a 
continuation or supplemental award) or amends a previously submitted 
application, only the affected pages need be submitted. Previously 
submitted pages with information that is still current need not be 
resubmitted.


<R05>
Sec. 33.11  State plans.

    (a) Scope. The statutes for some programs require States to submit 
plans before receiving grants. Under regulations implementing Executive 
Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' States 
are allowed to simplify, consolidate and substitute plans. This section 
contains additional provisions for plans that are subject to regulations 
implementing the Executive order.
    (b) Requirements. A State need meet only Federal administrative or 
programmatic requirements for a plan that are in statutes or codified 
regulations.
    (c) Assurances. In each plan the State will include an assurance 
that the State shall comply with all applicable Federal statutes and 
regulations in effect with respect to the periods for which it receives 
grant funding. For this assurance and other assurances required in the 
plan, the State may:
    (1) Cite by number the statutory or regulatory provisions requiring 
the assurances and affirm that it gives the assurances required by those 
provisions,
    (2) Repeat the assurance language in the statutes or regulations, or
    (3) Develop its own language to the extent permitted by law.
    (d) Amendments. A State will amend a plan whenever necessary to 
reflect: (1) New or revised Federal statutes or regulations or (2) a 
material change in any State law, organization, policy, or State agency 
operation. The State will obtain approval for the amendment and its 
effective date but need submit for approval only the amended portions of 
the plan.


<R05>
Sec. 33.12  Special grant or subgrant conditions for ``high-risk'' 
grantees.

    (a) A grantee or subgrantee may be considered ``high risk'' if an 
awarding agency determines that a grantee or subgrantee:
    (1) Has a history of unsatisfactory performance, or
    (2) Is not financially stable, or
    (3) Has a management system which does not meet the management 
standards set forth in this part, or
    (4) Has not conformed to terms and conditions of previous awards, or
    (5) Is otherwise not responsible; and if the awarding agency 
determines that an award will be made, special conditions and/or 
restrictions shall correspond to the high risk condition and shall be 
included in the award.
    (b) Special conditions or restrictions may include:
    (1) Payment on a reimbursement basis;
    (2) Withholding authority to proceed to the next phase until receipt 
of evidence of acceptable performance within a given funding period;
    (3) Requiring additional, more detailed financial reports;
    (4) Additional project monitoring;

[[Page 180]]

    (5) Requiring the grantee or subgrantee to obtain technical or 
management assistance; or
    (6) Establishing additional prior approvals.
    (c) If an awarding agency decides to impose such conditions, the 
awarding official will notify the grantee or subgrantee as early as 
possible, in writing, of:
    (1) The nature of the special conditions/restrictions;
    (2) The reason(s) for imposing them;
    (3) The corrective actions which must be taken before they will be 
removed and the time allowed for completing the corrective actions and
    (4) The method of requesting reconsideration of the conditions/
restrictions imposed.


<R04>
                    Subpart C_Post-Award Requirements

                        Financial Administration


<R05>
Sec. 33.20  Standards for financial management systems.

    (a) A State must expand and account for grant funds in accordance 
with State laws and procedures for expending and accounting for its own 
funds. Fiscal control and accounting procedures of the State, as well as 
its subgrantees and cost-type contractors, must be sufficient to--
    (1) Permit preparation of reports required by this part and the 
statutes authorizing the grant, and
    (2) Permit the tracing of funds to a level of expenditures adequate 
to establish that such funds have not been used in violation of the 
restrictions and prohibitions of applicable statutes.
    (b) The financial management systems of other grantees and 
subgrantees must meet the following standards:
    (1) Financial reporting. Accurate, current, and complete disclosure 
of the financial results of financially assisted activities must be made 
in accordance with the financial reporting requirements of the grant or 
subgrant.
    (2) Accounting records. Grantees and subgrantees must maintain 
records which adequately identify the source and application of funds 
provided for financially-assisted activities. These records must contain 
information pertaining to grant or subgrant awards and authorizations, 
obligations, unobligated balances, assets, liabilities, outlays or 
expenditures, and income.
    (3) Internal control. Effective control and accountability must be 
maintained for all grant and subgrant cash, real and personal property, 
and other assets. Grantees and subgrantees must adequately safeguard all 
such property and must assure that it is used solely for authorized 
purposes.
    (4) Budget control. Actual expenditures or outlays must be compared 
with budgeted amounts for each grant or subgrant. Financial information 
must be related to performance or productivity data, including the 
development of unit cost information whenever appropriate or 
specifically required in the grant or subgrant agreement. If unit cost 
data are required, estimates based on available documentation will be 
accepted whenever possible.
    (5) Allowable cost. Applicable OMB cost principles, agency program 
regulations, and the terms of grant and subgrant agreements will be 
followed in determining the reasonableness, allowability, and 
allocability of costs.
    (6) Source documentation. Accounting records must be supported by 
such source documentation as cancelled checks, paid bills, payrolls, 
time and attendance records, contract and subgrant award documents, etc.
    (7) Cash management. Procedures for minimizing the time elapsing 
between the transfer of funds from the U.S. Treasury and disbursement by 
grantees and subgrantees must be followed whenever advance payment 
procedures are used. Grantees must establish reasonable procedures to 
ensure the receipt of reports on subgrantees' cash balances and cash 
disbursements in sufficient time to enable them to prepare complete and 
accurate cash transactions reports to the awarding agency. When advances 
are made by letter-of-credit or electronic transfer of funds methods, 
the grantee must make drawdowns as close as possible to the time of 
making disbursements. Grantees must monitor cash drawdowns by their 
subgrantees to assure that they conform substantially to the same

[[Page 181]]

standards of timing and amount as apply to advances to the grantees.
    (c) An awarding agency may review the adequacy of the financial 
management system of any applicant for financial assistance as part of a 
preaward review or at any time subsequent to award.


<R05>
Sec. 33.21  Payment.

    (a) Scope. This section prescribes the basic standard and the 
methods under which a Federal agency will make payments to grantees, and 
grantees will make payments to subgrantees and contractors.
    (b) Basic standard. Methods and procedures for payment shall 
minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and 
disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee, in accordance with Treasury 
regulations at 31 CFR part 205.
    (c) Advances. Grantees and subgrantees shall be paid in advance, 
provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness and ability to 
maintain procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer 
of the funds and their disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee.
    (d) Reimbursement. Reimbursement shall be the preferred method when 
the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section are not met. Grantees 
and subgrantees may also be paid by reimbursement for any construction 
grant. Except as otherwise specified in regulation, Federal agencies 
shall not use the percentage of completion method to pay construction 
grants. The grantee or subgrantee may use that method to pay its 
construction contractor, and if it does, the awarding agency's payments 
to the grantee or subgrantee will be based on the grantee's or 
subgrantee's actual rate of disbursement.
    (e) Working capital advances. If a grantee cannot meet the criteria 
for advance payments described in paragraph (c) of this section, and the 
Federal agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because 
the grantee lacks sufficient working capital, the awarding agency may 
provide cash or a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure 
the awarding agency shall advance cash to the grantee to cover its 
estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to 
the grantee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the awarding agency shall 
reimburse the grantee for its actual cash disbursements. The working 
capital advance method of payment shall not be used by grantees or 
subgrantees if the reason for using such method is the unwillingness or 
inability of the grantee to provide timely advances to the subgrantee to 
meet the subgrantee's actual cash disbursements.
    (f) Effect of program income, refunds, and audit recoveries on 
payment. (1) Grantees and subgrantees shall disburse repayments to and 
interest earned on a revolving fund before requesting additional cash 
payments for the same activity.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, grantees 
and subgrantees shall disburse program income, rebates, refunds, 
contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds 
before requesting additional cash payments.
    (g) Withholding payments. (1) Unless otherwise required by Federal 
statute, awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper 
charges incurred by grantees or subgrantees unless--
    (i) The grantee or subgrantee has failed to comply with grant award 
conditions or
    (ii) The grantee or subgrantee is indebted to the United States.
    (2) Cash withheld for failure to comply with grant award condition, 
but without suspension of the grant, shall be released to the grantee 
upon subsequent compliance. When a grant is suspended, payment 
adjustments will be made in accordance with Sec. 33.43(c).
    (3) A Federal agency shall not make payment to grantees for amounts 
that are withheld by grantees or subgrantees from payment to contractors 
to assure satisfactory completion of work. Payments shall be made by the 
Federal agency when the grantees or subgrantees actually disburse the 
withheld funds to the contractors or to escrow accounts established to 
assure satisfactory completion of work.
    (h) Cash depositories. (1) Consistent with the national goal of 
expanding the opportunities for minority business enterprises, grantees 
and subgrantees are

[[Page 182]]

encouraged to use minority banks (a bank which is owned at least 50 
percent by minority group members). A list of minority owned banks can 
be obtained from the Minority Business Development Agency, Department of 
Commerce, Washington, DC 20230.
    (2) A grantee or subgrantee shall maintain a separate bank account 
only when required by Federal-State agreement.
    (i) Interest earned on advances. Except for interest earned on 
advances of funds exempt under the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (31 
U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) and the Indian Self-Determination Act (23 U.S.C. 
450), grantees and subgrantees shall promptly, but at least quarterly, 
remit interest earned on advances to the Federal agency. The grantee or 
subgrantee may keep interest amounts up to $100 per year for 
administrative expenses.

<R05>
Sec. 33.22  Allowable costs.

    (a) Limitation on use of funds. Grant funds may be used only for:
    (1) The allowable costs of the grantees, subgrantees and cost-type 
contractors, including allowable costs in the form of payments to fixed-
price contractors; and
    (2) Reasonable fees or profit to cost-type contractors but not any 
fee or profit (or other increment above allowable costs) to the grantee 
or subgrantee.
    (b) Applicable cost principles. For each kind of organization, there 
is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. 
Allowable costs will be determined in accordance with the cost 
principles applicable to the organization incurring the costs. The 
following chart lists the kinds of organizations and the applicable cost 
principles.

<R05>
Sec. 33.23  Period of availability of funds.

    (a) General. Where a funding period is specified, a grantee may 
charge to the award only costs resulting from obligations of the funding 
period unless carryover of unobligated balances is permitted, in which 
case the carryover balances may be charged for costs resulting from 
obligations of the subsequent funding period.
    (b) Liquidation of obligations. A grantee must liquidate all 
obligations incurred under the award not later than 90 days after the 
end of the funding period (or as specified in a program regulation) to 
coincide with the submission of the annual Financial Status Report (SF-
269). The Federal agency may extend this deadline at the request of the 
grantee.


<R05>
Sec. 33.24  Matching or cost sharing.

    (a) Basic rule: Costs and contributions acceptable. With the 
qualifications and exceptions listed in paragraph (b) of this section, a 
matching or cost sharing requirement may be satisfied by either or both 
of the following:
    (1) Allowable costs incurred by the grantee, subgrantee or a cost-
type contractor under the assistance agreement. This includes allowable 
costs borne by non-Federal grants or by others cash donations from non-
Federal third parties.
    (2) The value of third party in-kind contributions applicable to the 
period to which the cost sharing or matching requirements applies.
    (b) Qualifications and exceptions--(1) Costs borne by other Federal 
grant agreements. Except as provided by Federal statute, a cost sharing 
or matching requirement may not be met by costs borne by another Federal 
grant. This prohibition does not apply to income earned by a grantee or 
subgrantee from a contract awarded under another Federal grant.

[[Page 183]]

    (2) General revenue sharing. For the purpose of this section, 
general revenue sharing funds distributed under 31 U.S.C. 6702 are not 
considered Federal grant funds.
    (3) Cost or contributions counted towards other Federal costs-
sharing requirements. Neither costs nor the values of third party in-
kind contributions may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or 
matching requirement of a grant agreement if they have been or will be 
counted towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement of 
another Federal grant agreement, a Federal procurement contract, or any 
other award of Federal funds.
    (4) Costs financed by program income. Costs financed by program 
income, as defined in Sec. 33.25, shall not count towards satisfying a 
cost sharing or matching requirement unless they are expressly permitted 
in the terms of the assistance agreement. (This use of general program 
income is described in Sec. 33.25(g).)
    (5) Services or property financed by income earned by contractors. 
Contractors under a grant may earn income from the activities carried 
out under the contract in addition to the amounts earned from the party 
awarding the contract. No costs of services or property supported by 
this income may count toward satisfying a cost sharing or matching 
requirement unless other provisions of the grant agreement expressly 
permit this kind of income to be used to meet the requirement.
    (6) Records. Costs and third party in-kind contributions counting 
towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement must be 
verifiable from the records of grantees and subgrantee or cost-type 
contractors. These records must show how the value placed on third party 
in-kind contributions was derived. To the extent feasible, volunteer 
services will be supported by the same methods that the organization 
uses to support the allocability of regular personnel costs.
    (7) Special standards for third party in-kind contributions. (i) 
Third party in-kind contributions count towards satisfying a cost 
sharing or matching requirement only where, if the party receiving the 
contributions were to pay for them, the payments would be allowable 
costs.
    (ii) Some third party in-kind contributions are goods and services 
that, if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor receiving the 
contribution had to pay for them, the payments would have been an 
indirect costs. Costs sharing or matching credit for such contributions 
shall be given only if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor has 
established, along with its regular indirect cost rate, a special rate 
for allocating to individual projects or programs the value of the 
contributions.
    (iii) A third party in-kind contribution to a fixed-price contract 
may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement only 
if it results in:
    (A) An increase in the services or property provided under the 
contract (without additional cost to the grantee or subgrantee) or
    (B) A cost savings to the grantee or subgrantee.
    (iv) The values placed on third party in-kind contributions for cost 
sharing or matching purposes will conform to the rules in the succeeding 
sections of this part. If a third party in-kind contribution is a type 
not treated in those sections, the value placed upon it shall be fair 
and reasonable.
    (c) Valuation of donated services--(1) Volunteer services. Unpaid 
services provided to a grantee or subgrantee by individuals will be 
valued at rates consistent with those ordinarily paid for similar work 
in the grantee's or subgrantee's organization. If the grantee or 
subgrantee does not have employees performing similar work, the rates 
will be consistent with those ordinarily paid by other employers for 
similar work in the same labor market. In either case, a reasonable 
amount for fringe benefits may be included in the valuation.
    (2) Employees of other organizations. When an employer other than a 
grantee, subgrantee, or cost-type contractor furnishes free of charge 
the services of an employee in the employee's normal line of work, the 
services will be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay exclusive 
of the employee's fringe benefits and overhead costs. If the services

[[Page 184]]

are in a different line of work, paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
applies.
    (d) Valuation of third party donated supplies and loaned equipment 
or space. (1) If a third party donates supplies, the contribution will 
be valued at the market value of the supplies at the time of donation.
    (2) If a third party donates the use of equipment or space in a 
building but retains title, the contribution will be valued at the fair 
rental rate of the equipment or space.
    (e) Valuation of third party donated equipment, buildings, and land. 
If a third party donates equipment, buildings, or land, and title passes 
to a grantee or subgrantee, the treatment of the donated property will 
depend upon the purpose of the grant or subgrant, as follows:
    (1) Awards for capital expenditures. If the purpose of the grant or 
subgrant is to assist the grantee or subgrantee in the acquisition of 
property, the market value of that property at the time of donation may 
be counted as cost sharing or matching,
    (2) Other awards. If assisting in the acquisition of property is not 
the purpose of the grant or subgrant, paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii) of 
this section apply:
    (i) If approval is obtained from the awarding agency, the market 
value at the time of donation of the donated equipment or buildings and 
the fair rental rate of the donated land may be counted as cost sharing 
or matching. In the case of a subgrant, the terms of the grant agreement 
may require that the approval be obtained from the Federal agency as 
well as the grantee. In all cases, the approval may be given only if a 
purchase of the equipment or rental of the land would be approved as an 
allowable direct cost. If any part of the donated property was acquired 
with Federal funds, only the non-Federal share of the property may be 
counted as cost-sharing or matching.
    (ii) If approval is not obtained under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this 
section, no amount may be counted for donated land, and only 
depreciation or use allowances may be counted for donated equipment and 
buildings. The depreciation or use allowances for this property are not 
treated as third party in-kind contributions. Instead, they are treated 
as costs incurred by the grantee or subgrantee. They are computed and 
allocated (usually as indirect costs) in accordance with the cost 
principles specified in Sec. 33.22, in the same way as depreciation or 
use allowances for purchased equipment and buildings. The amount of 
depreciation or use allowances for donated equipment and buildings is 
based on the property's market value at the time it was donated.
    (f) Valuation of grantee or subgrantee donated real property for 
construction/acquisition. If a grantee or subgrantee donates real 
property for a construction or facilities acquisition project, the 
current market value of that property may be counted as cost sharing or 
matching. If any part of the donated property was acquired with Federal 
funds, only the non-Federal share of the property may be counted as cost 
sharing or matching.
    (g) Appraisal of real property. In some cases under paragraphs (d), 
(e) and (f) of this section, it will be necessary to establish the 
market value of land or a building or the fair rental rate of land or of 
space in a building. In these cases, the Federal agency may require the 
market value or fair rental value be set by an independent appraiser, 
and that the value or rate be certified by the grantee. This requirement 
will also be imposed by the grantee on subgrantees.

<R05>
Sec. 33.25  Program income.

    (a) General. Grantees are encouraged to earn income to defray 
program costs. Program income includes income from fees for services 
performed, from the use or rental of real or personal property acquired 
with grant funds, from the sale of commodities or items fabricated under 
a grant agreement, and from payments of principal and interest on loans 
made with grant funds. Except as otherwise provided in regulations of 
the Federal agency, program income does not include interest on grant 
funds, rebates, credits, discounts, refunds, etc. and interest earned on 
any of them.

[[Page 185]]

    (b) Definition of program income. Program income means gross income 
received by the grantee or subgrantee directly generated by a grant 
supported activity, or earned only as a result of the grant agreement 
during the grant period. ``During the grant period'' is the time between 
the effective date of the award and the ending date of the award 
reflected in the final financial report.
    (c) Cost of generating program income. If authorized by Federal 
regulations or the grant agreement, costs incident to the generation of 
program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program 
income.
    (d) Governmental revenues. Taxes, special assessments, levies, 
fines, and other such revenues raised by a grantee or subgrantee are not 
program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the 
grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as program income.
    (e) Royalties. Income from royalties and license fees for 
copyrighted material, patents, and inventions developed by a grantee or 
subgrantee is program income only if the revenues are specifically 
identified in the grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as 
program income. (See Sec. 33.34.)
    (f) Property. Proceeds from the sale of real property or equipment 
will be handled in accordance with the requirements of Sec. Sec. 33.31 
and 33.32.
    (g) Use of program income. Program income shall be deducted from 
outlays which may be both Federal and non-Federal as described below, 
unless the Federal agency regulations or the grant agreement specify 
another alternative (or a combination of the alternatives). In 
specifying alternatives, the Federal agency may distinguish between 
income earned by the grantee and income earned by subgrantees and 
between the sources, kinds, or amounts of income. When Federal agencies 
authorize the alternatives in paragraphs (g) (2) and (3) of this 
section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall also be 
deducted from outlays.
    (1) Deduction. Ordinarily program income shall be deducted from 
total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs. Program 
income shall be used for current costs unless the Federal agency 
authorizes otherwise. Program income which the grantee did not 
anticipate at the time of the award shall be used to reduce the Federal 
agency and grantee contributions rather than to increase the funds 
committed to the project.
    (2) Addition. When authorized, program income may be added to the 
funds committed to the grant agreement by the Federal agency and the 
grantee. The program income shall be used for the purposes and under the 
conditions of the grant agreement.
    (3) Cost sharing or matching. When authorized, program income may be 
used to meet the cost sharing or matching requirement of the grant 
agreement. The amount of the Federal grant award remains the same.
    (h) Income after the award period. There are no Federal requirements 
governing the disposition of program income earned after the end of the 
award period (i.e., until the ending date of the final financial report, 
see paragraph (a) of this section), unless the terms of the agreement or 
the Federal agency regulations provide otherwise.

<R05>
Sec. 33.26  Non-Federal audit.

    (a) Basic rule. Grantees and subgrantees are responsible for 
obtaining audits in accordance with the Single Audit Act Amendments of 
1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, ``Audits of 
States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.'' The audits 
shall be made by an independent auditor in accordance with generally 
accepted government auditing standards covering financial audits.
    (b) Subgrantees. State or local governments, as those terms are 
defined for purposes of the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, that 
provide Federal awards to a subgrantee, which expends $300,000 or more 
(or other amount as specified by OMB) in Federal awards in a fiscal 
year, shall:
    (1) Determine whether State or local subgrantees have met the audit 
requirements of the Act and whether subgrantees covered by OMB Circular 
A-

[[Page 186]]

110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements 
with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit 
Organizations,'' have met the audit requirements of the Act. Commercial 
contractors (private for-profit and private and governmental 
organizations) providing goods and services to State and local 
governments are not required to have a single audit performed. State and 
local governments should use their own procedures to ensure that the 
contractor has complied with laws and regulations affecting the 
expenditure of Federal funds;
    (2) Determine whether the subgrantee spent Federal assistance funds 
provided in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This may be 
accomplished by reviewing an audit of the subgrantee made in accordance 
with the Act, Circular A-110, or through other means (e.g., program 
reviews) if the subgrantee has not had such an audit;
    (3) Ensure that appropriate corrective action is taken within six 
months after receipt of the audit report in instance of noncompliance 
with Federal laws and regulations;
    (4) Consider whether subgrantee audits necessitate adjustment of the 
grantee's own records; and
    (5) Require each subgrantee to permit independent auditors to have 
access to the records and financial statements.
    (c) Auditor selection. In arranging for audit services, Sec. 33.36 
shall be followed.

                    Changes, Property, and Subawards


<R05>
Sec. 33.30  Changes.

    (a) General. Grantees and subgrantees are permitted to rebudget 
within the approved direct cost budget to meet unanticipated 
requirements and may make limited program changes to the approved 
project. However, unless waived by the awarding agency, certain types of 
post-award changes in budgets and projects shall require the prior 
written approval of the awarding agency.
    (b) Relation to cost principles. The applicable cost principles (see 
Sec. 33.22) contain requirements for prior approval of certain types of 
costs. Except where waived, those requirements apply to all grants and 
subgrants even if paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section do not.
    (c) Budget changes--(1) Nonconstruction projects. Except as stated 
in other regulations or an award document, grantees or subgrantees shall 
obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the 
following changes is anticipated under a nonconstruction award:
    (i) Any revision which would result in the need for additional 
funding.
    (ii) Unless waived by the awarding agency, cumulative transfers 
among direct cost categories, or, if applicable, among separately 
budgeted programs, projects, functions, or activities which exceed or 
are expected to exceed ten percent of the current total approved budget, 
whenever the awarding agency's share exceeds $100,000.
    (iii) Transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (i.e., from 
direct payments to trainees to other expense categories).
    (2) Construction projects. Grantees and subgrantees shall obtain 
prior written approval for any budget revision which would result in the 
need for additional funds.
    (3) Combined construction and nonconstruction projects. When a grant 
or subgrant provides funding for both construction and nonconstruction 
activities, the grantee or subgrantee must obtain prior written approval 
from the awarding agency before making any fund or budget transfer from 
nonconstruction to construction or vice versa.
    (d) Programmatic changes. Grantees or subgrantees must obtain the 
prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the following 
actions is anticipated:
    (1) Any revision of the scope or objectives of the project 
(regardless of whether there is an associated budget revision requiring 
prior approval).
    (2) Need to extend the period of availability of funds.
    (3) Changes in key persons in cases where specified in an 
application or a grant award. In research projects, a

[[Page 187]]

change in the project director or principal investigator shall always 
require approval unless waived by the awarding agency.
    (4) Under nonconstruction projects, contracting out, subgranting (if 
authorized by law) or otherwise obtaining the services of a third party 
to perform activities which are central to the purposes of the award. 
This approval requirement is in addition to the approval requirements of 
Sec. 33.36 but does not apply to the procurement of equipment, 
supplies, and general support services.
    (e) Additional prior approval requirements. The awarding agency may 
not require prior approval for any budget revision which is not 
described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) Requesting prior approval. (1) A request for prior approval of 
any budget revision will be in the same budget formal the grantee used 
in its application and shall be accompanied by a narrative justification 
for the proposed revision.
    (2) A request for a prior approval under the applicable Federal cost 
principles (see Sec. 33.22) may be made by letter.
    (3) A request by a subgrantee for prior approval will be addressed 
in writing to the grantee. The grantee will promptly review such request 
and shall approve or disapprove the request in writing. A grantee will 
not approve any budget or project revision which is inconsistent with 
the purpose or terms and conditions of the Federal grant to the grantee. 
If the revision, requested by the subgrantee would result in a change to 
the grantee's approved project which requires Federal prior approval, 
the grantee will obtain the Federal agency's approval before approving 
the subgrantee's request.

<R05>
Sec. 33.31  Real property.

    (a) Title. Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in 
this section, title to real property acquired under a grant or subgrant 
will vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) Use. Except as otherwise provided by Federal statutes, real 
property will be used for the originally authorized purposes as long as 
needed for that purposes, and the grantee or subgrantee shall not 
dispose of or encumber its title or other interests.
    (c) Disposition. When real property is no longer needed for the 
originally authorized purpose, the grantee or subgrantee will request 
disposition instructions from the awarding agency. The instructions will 
provide for one of the following alternatives:
    (1) Retention of title. Retain title after compensating the awarding 
agency. The amount paid to the awarding agency will be computed by 
applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost 
of the original purchase to the fair market value of the property. 
However, in those situations where a grantee or subgrantee is disposing 
of real property acquired with grant funds and acquiring replacement 
real property under the same program, the net proceeds from the 
disposition may be used as an offset to the cost of the replacement 
property.
    (2) Sale of property. Sell the property and compensate the awarding 
agency. The amount due to the awarding agency will be calculated by 
applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost 
of the original purchase to the proceeds of the sale after deduction of 
any actual and reasonable selling and fixing-up expenses. If the grant 
is still active, the net proceeds from sale may be offset against the 
original cost of the property. When a grantee or subgrantee is directed 
to sell property, sales procedures shall be followed that provide for 
competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible 
return.
    (3) Transfer of title. Transfer title to the awarding agency or to a 
third-party designated/approved by the awarding agency. The grantee or 
subgrantee shall be paid an amount calculated by applying the grantee or 
subgrantee's percentage of participation in the purchase of the real 
property to the current fair market value of the property.

Sec. 33.32  Equipment.

    (a) Title. Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in 
this section, title to equipment acquired under a grant or subgrant will 
vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) States. A State will use, manage, and dispose of equipment 
acquired under a grant by the State in accordance with State laws and 
procedures. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (c) 
through (e) of this section.
    (c) Use. (1) Equipment shall be used by the grantee or subgrantee in 
the program or project for which it was acquired as long as needed, 
whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by 
Federal funds. When no longer needed for the original program or 
project, the equipment may be used in other activities currently or 
previously supported by a Federal agency.
    (2) The grantee or subgrantee shall also make equipment available 
for use on other projects or programs currently or previously supported 
by the Federal Government, providing such use will not interfere with 
the work on the projects or program for which it was originally 
acquired. First preference for other use shall be given to other 
programs or projects supported by the awarding agency. User fees should 
be considered if appropriate.
    (3) Notwithstanding the encouragement in Sec. 33.25(a) to earn 
program income, the grantee or subgrantee must not use equipment 
acquired with grant funds to provide services for a fee to compete 
unfairly with private companies that provide equivalent services, unless 
specifically permitted or contemplated by Federal statute.
    (4) When acquiring replacement equipment, the grantee or subgrantee 
may use the equipment to be replaced as a trade-in or sell the property 
and use the proceeds to offset the cost of the replacement property, 
subject to the approval of the awarding agency.
    (d) Management requirements. Procedures for managing equipment 
(including replacement equipment), whether acquired in whole or in part 
with grant funds, until disposition takes place will, as a minimum, meet 
the following requirements:
    (1) Property records must be maintained that include a description 
of the property, a serial number or other identification number, the 
source of property, who holds title, the acquisition date, and cost of 
the property, percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the 
property, the location, use and condition of the property, and any 
ultimate disposition data including the date of disposal and sale price 
of the property.
    (2) A physical inventory of the property must be taken and the 
results reconciled with the property records at least once every two 
years.
    (3) A control system must be developed to ensure adequate safeguards 
to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the property. Any loss, damage, or 
theft shall be investigated.
    (4) Adequate maintenance procedures must be developed to keep the 
property in good condition.
    (5) If the grantee or subgrantee is authorized or required to sell 
the property, proper sales procedures must be established to ensure the 
highest possible return.
    (e) Disposition. When original or replacement equipment acquired 
under a grant or subgrant is no longer needed for the original project 
or program or for other activities currently or previously supported by 
a Federal agency, disposition of the equipment will be made as follows:
    (1) Items of equipment with a current per-unit fair market value of 
less than $5,000 may be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no 
further obligation to the awarding agency.
    (2) Items of equipment with a current per unit fair market value in 
excess of $5,000 may be retained or sold and the awarding agency shall 
have a right to an amount calculated by multiplying the current market 
value or proceeds from sale by the awarding agency's share of the 
equipment.
    (3) In cases where a grantee or subgrantee fails to take appropriate 
disposition actions, the awarding agency may direct the grantee or 
subgrantee to take excess and disposition actions.

[[Page 189]]

    (f) Federal equipment. In the event a grantee or subgrantee is 
provided federally-owned equipment:
    (1) Title will remain vested in the Federal Government.
    (2) Grantees or subgrantees will manage the equipment in accordance 
with Federal agency rules and procedures, and submit an annual inventory 
listing.
    (3) When the equipment is no longer needed, the grantee or 
subgrantee will request disposition instructions from the Federal 
agency.
    (g) Right to transfer title. The Federal awarding agency may reserve 
the right to transfer title to the Federal Government or a third part 
named by the awarding agency when such a third party is otherwise 
eligible under existing statutes. Such transfers shall be subject to the 
following standards:
    (1) The property shall be identified in the grant or otherwise made 
known to the grantee in writing.
    (2) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instruction 
within 120 calendar days after the end of the Federal support of the 
project for which it was acquired. If the Federal awarding agency fails 
to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar-day period the 
grantee shall follow Sec. 33.32(e).
    (3) When title to equipment is transferred, the grantee shall be 
paid an amount calculated by applying the percentage of participation in 
the purchase to the current fair market value of the property.

[53 FR 8070 and 8087, Mar. 11, 1988. Redesignated and amended at 57 FR 
6199 and 6201, Feb. 21, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 33.33  Supplies.

    (a) Title. Title to supplies acquired under a grant or subgrant will 
vest, upon acquisition, in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) Disposition. If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies 
exceeding $5,000 in total aggregate fair market value upon termination 
or completion of the award, and if the supplies are not needed for any 
other federally sponsored programs or projects, the grantee or 
subgrantee shall compensate the awarding agency for its share.


<R05>
Sec. 33.34  Copyrights.

    The Federal awarding agency reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, 
and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish or otherwise use, and to 
authorize others to use, for Federal Government purposes:
    (a) The copyright in any work developed under a grant, subgrant, or 
contract under a grant or subgrant; and
    (b) Any rights of copyright to which a grantee, subgrantee or a 
contractor purchases ownership with grant support.


<R05>
Sec. 33.35  Subawards to debarred and suspended parties.

    Grantees and subgrantees must not make any award or permit any award 
(subgrant or contract) at any tier to any party which is debarred or 
suspended or is otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation 
in Federal assistance programs under Executive Order 12549, ``Debarment 
and Suspension.''


<R05>
Sec. 33.36  Procurement.

    (a) States. When procuring property and services under a grant, a 
State will follow the same policies and procedures it uses for 
procurements from its non-Federal funds. The State will ensure that 
every purchase order or other contract includes any clauses required by 
Federal statutes and executive orders and their implementing 
regulations. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (b) 
through (i) in this section.
    (b) Procurement standards. (1) Grantees and subgrantees will use 
their own procurement procedures which reflect applicable State and 
local laws and regulations, provided that the procurements conform to 
applicable Federal law and the standards identified in this section.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a contract administration 
system which ensures that contractors perform in accordance with the 
terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts or purchase 
orders.
    (3) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a written code of 
standards of conduct governing the performance of their employees 
engaged in the award and administration of contracts. No

[[Page 190]]

employee, officer or agent of the grantee or subgrantee shall 
participate in selection, or in the award or administration of a 
contract supported by Federal funds if a conflict of interest, real or 
apparent, would be involved. Such a conflict would arise when:
    (i) The employee, officer or agent,
    (ii) Any member of his immediate family,
    (iii) His or her partner, or
    (iv) An organization which employs, or is about to employ, any of 
the above, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for 
award. The grantee's or subgrantee's officers, employees or agents will 
neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors or anything of monetary 
value from contractors, potential contractors, or parties to 
subagreements. Grantee and subgrantees may set minimum rules where the 
financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item 
of nominal intrinsic value. To the extent permitted by State or local 
law or regulations, such standards or conduct will provide for 
penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions for violations of 
such standards by the grantee's and subgrantee's officers, employees, or 
agents, or by contractors or their agents. The awarding agency may in 
regulation provide additional prohibitions relative to real, apparent, 
or potential conflicts of interest.
    (4) Grantee and subgrantee procedures will provide for a review of 
proposed procurements to avoid purchase of unnecessary or duplicative 
items. Consideration should be given to consolidating or breaking out 
procurements to obtain a more economical purchase. Where appropriate, an 
analysis will be made of lease versus purchase alternatives, and any 
other appropriate analysis to determine the most economical approach.
    (5) To foster greater economy and efficiency, grantees and 
subgrantees are encouraged to enter into State and local 
intergovernmental agreements for procurement or use of common goods and 
services.
    (6) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use Federal excess 
and surplus property in lieu of purchasing new equipment and property 
whenever such use is feasible and reduces project costs.
    (7) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use value engineering 
clauses in contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to 
offer reasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering is 
a systematic and creative anaylsis of each contract item or task to 
ensure that its essential function is provided at the overall lower 
cost.
    (8) Grantees and subgrantees will make awards only to responsible 
contractors possessing the ability to perform successfully under the 
terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration will be 
given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with public 
policy, record of past performance, and financial and technical 
resources.
    (9) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain records sufficient to 
detail the significant history of a procurement. These records will 
include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: rationale for 
the method of procurement, selection of contract type, contractor 
selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.
    (10) Grantees and subgrantees will use time and material type 
contracts only--
    (i) After a determination that no other contract is suitable, and
    (ii) If the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor 
exceeds at its own risk.
    (11) Grantees and subgrantees alone will be responsible, in 
accordance with good administrative practice and sound business 
judgment, for the settlement of all contractual and administrative 
issues arising out of procurements. These issues include, but are not 
limited to source evaluation, protests, disputes, and claims. These 
standards do not relieve the grantee or subgrantee of any contractual 
responsibilities under its contracts. Federal agencies will not 
substitute their judgment for that of the grantee or subgrantee unless 
the matter is primarily a Federal concern. Violations of law will be 
referred to the local, State, or Federal authority having proper 
jurisdiction.
    (12) Grantees and subgrantees will have protest procedures to handle 
and

[[Page 191]]

resolve disputes relating to their procurements and shall in all 
instances disclose information regarding the protest to the awarding 
agency. A protestor must exhaust all administrative remedies with the 
grantee and subgrantee before pursuing a protest with the Federal 
agency. Reviews of protests by the Federal agency will be limited to:
    (i) Violations of Federal law or regulations and the standards of 
this section (violations of State or local law will be under the 
jurisdiction of State or local authorities) and
    (ii) Violations of the grantee's or subgrantee's protest procedures 
for failure to review a complaint or protest. Protests received by the 
Federal agency other than those specified above will be referred to the 
grantee or subgrantee.
    (c) Competition. (1) All procurement transactions will be conducted 
in a manner providing full and open competition consistent with the 
standards of Sec. 33.36. Some of the situations considered to be 
restrictive of competition include but are not limited to:
    (i) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to 
qualify to do business,
    (ii) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding,
    (iii) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between 
affiliated companies,
    (iv) Noncompetitive awards to consultants that are on retainer 
contracts,
    (v) Organizational conflicts of interest,
    (vi) Specifying only a ``brand name'' product instead of allowing 
``an equal'' product to be offered and describing the performance of 
other relevant requirements of the procurement, and
    (vii) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will conduct procurements in a manner 
that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed in-
State or local geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or 
proposals, except in those cases where applicable Federal statutes 
expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. Nothing in this 
section preempts State licensing laws. When contracting for 
architectural and engineering (A/E) services, geographic location may be 
a selection criteria provided its application leaves an appropriate 
number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project, to 
compete for the contract.
    (3) Grantees will have written selection procedures for procurement 
transactions. These procedures will ensure that all solicitations:
    (i) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical 
requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such 
description shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features 
which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a 
statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service 
to be procured, and when necessary, shall set forth those minimum 
essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it 
is to satisfy its intended use. Detailed product specifications should 
be avoided if at all possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to 
make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a 
``brand name or equal'' description may be used as a means to define the 
performance or other salient requirements of a procurement. The specific 
features of the named brand which must be met by offerors shall be 
clearly stated; and
    (ii) Identify all requirements which the offerors must fulfill and 
all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.
    (4) Grantees and subgrantees will ensure that all prequalified lists 
of persons, firms, or products which are used in acquiring goods and 
services are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure 
maximum open and free competition. Also, grantees and subgrantees will 
not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the solicitation 
period.
    (d) Methods of procurement to be followed--(1) Procurement by small 
purchase procedures. Small purchase procedures are those relatively 
simple and informal procurement methods for securing services, supplies, 
or other property that do not cost more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently set at $100,000). If 
small purchase procedures are used,

[[Page 192]]

price or rate quotations shall be obtained from an adequate number of 
qualified sources.
    (2) Procurement by sealed bids (formal advertising). Bids are 
publicly solicited and a firm-fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit 
price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with 
all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is the 
lowest in price. The sealed bid method is the preferred method for 
procuring construction, if the conditions in Sec. 33.36(d)(2)(i) apply.
    (i) In order for sealed bidding to be feasible, the following 
conditions should be present:
    (A) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase 
description is available;
    (B) Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete 
effectively and for the business; and
    (C) The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price contract and 
the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally on the 
basis of price.
    (ii) If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply:
    (A) The invitation for bids will be publicly advertised and bids 
shall be solicited from an adequate number of known suppliers, providing 
them sufficient time prior to the date set for opening the bids;
    (B) The invitation for bids, which will include any specifications 
and pertinent attachments, shall define the items or services in order 
for the bidder to properly respond;
    (C) All bids will be publicly opened at the time and place 
prescribed in the invitation for bids;
    (D) A firm fixed-price contract award will be made in writing to the 
lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding 
documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life 
cycle costs shall be considered in determining which bid is lowest. 
Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior 
experience indicates that such discounts are usually taken advantage of; 
and
    (E) Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound documented 
reason.
    (3) Procurement by competitive proposals. The technique of 
competitive proposals is normally conducted with more than one source 
submitting an offer, and either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement type 
contract is awarded. It is generally used when conditions are not 
appropriate for the use of sealed bids. If this method is used, the 
following requirements apply:
    (i) Requests for proposals will be publicized and identify all 
evaluation factors and their relative importance. Any response to 
publicized requests for proposals shall be honored to the maximum extent 
practical;
    (ii) Proposals will be solicited from an adequate number of 
qualified sources;
    (iii) Grantees and subgrantees will have a method for conducting 
technical evaluations of the proposals received and for selecting 
awardees;
    (iv) Awards will be made to the responsible firm whose proposal is 
most advantageous to the program, with price and other factors 
considered; and
    (v) Grantees and subgrantees may use competitive proposal procedures 
for qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) 
professional services whereby competitors' qualifications are evaluated 
and the most qualified competitor is selected, subject to negotiation of 
fair and reasonable compensation. The method, where price is not used as 
a selection factor, can only be used in procurement of A/E professional 
services. It cannot be used to purchase other types of services though 
A/E firms are a potential source to perform the proposed effort.
    (4) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals is procurement through 
solicitation of a proposal from only one source, or after solicitation 
of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.
    (i) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals may be used only when 
the award of a contract is infeasible under small purchase procedures, 
sealed bids or competitive proposals and one of the following 
circumstances applies:
    (A) The item is available only from a single source;
    (B) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not 
permit a delay resulting from competitive solicitation;

[[Page 193]]

    (C) The awarding agency authorizes noncompetitive proposals; or
    (D) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is 
determined inadequate.
    (ii) Cost analysis, i.e., verifying the proposed cost data, the 
projections of the data, and the evaluation of the specific elements of 
costs and profits, is required.
    (iii) Grantees and subgrantees may be required to submit the 
proposed procurement to the awarding agency for pre-award review in 
accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (e) Contracting with small and minority firms, women's business 
enterprise and labor surplus area firms. (1) The grantee and subgrantee 
will take all necessary affirmative steps to assure that minority firms, 
women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used when 
possible.
    (2) Affirmative steps shall include:
    (i) Placing qualified small and minority businesses and women's 
business enterprises on solicitation lists;
    (ii) Assuring that small and minority businesses, and women's 
business enterprises are solicited whenever they are potential sources;
    (iii) Dividing total requirements, when economically feasible, into 
smaller tasks or quantities to permit maximum participation by small and 
minority business, and women's business enterprises;
    (iv) Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirement permits, 
which encourage participation by small and minority business, and 
women's business enterprises;
    (v) Using the services and assistance of the Small Business 
Administration, and the Minority Business Development Agency of the 
Department of Commerce; and
    (vi) Requiring the prime contractor, if subcontracts are to be let, 
to take the affirmative steps listed in paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through 
(v) of this section.
    (f) Contract cost and price. (1) Grantees and subgrantees must 
perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement 
action including contract modifications. The method and degree of 
analysis is dependent on the facts surrounding the particular 
procurement situation, but as a starting point, grantees must make 
independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. A cost 
analysis must be performed when the offeror is required to submit the 
elements of his estimated cost, e.g., under professional, consulting, 
and architectural engineering services contracts. A cost analysis will 
be necessary when adequate price competition is lacking, and for sole 
source procurements, including contract modifications or change orders, 
unless price resonableness can be established on the basis of a catalog 
or market price of a commercial product sold in substantial quantities 
to the general public or based on prices set by law or regulation. A 
price analysis will be used in all other instances to determine the 
reasonableness of the proposed contract price.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will negotiate profit as a separate 
element of the price for each contract in which there is no price 
competition and in all cases where cost analysis is performed. To 
establish a fair and reasonable profit, consideration will be given to 
the complexity of the work to be performed, the risk borne by the 
contractor, the contractor's investment, the amount of subcontracting, 
the quality of its record of past performance, and industry profit rates 
in the surrounding geographical area for similar work.
    (3) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts under 
grants will be allowable only to the extent that costs incurred or cost 
estimates included in negotiated prices are consistent with Federal cost 
principles (see Sec. 33.22). Grantees may reference their own cost 
principles that comply with the applicable Federal cost principles.
    (4) The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of 
construction cost methods of contracting shall not be used.
    (g) Awarding agency review. (1) Grantees and subgrantees must make 
available, upon request of the awarding agency, technical specifications 
on proposed procurements where the awarding agency believes such review 
is needed to ensure that the item and/or

[[Page 194]]

service specified is the one being proposed for purchase. This review 
generally will take place prior to the time the specification is 
incorporated into a solicitation document. However, if the grantee or 
subgrantee desires to have the review accomplished after a solicitation 
has been developed, the awarding agency may still review the 
specifications, with such review usually limited to the technical 
aspects of the proposed purchase.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees must on request make available for 
awarding agency pre-award review procurement documents, such as requests 
for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc. 
when:
    (i) A grantee's or subgrantee's procurement procedures or operation 
fails to comply with the procurement standards in this section; or
    (ii) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold and is to be awarded without competition or only 
one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation; or
    (iii) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product; or
    (iv) The proposed award is more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold and is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder 
under a sealed bid procurement; or
    (v) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract 
or increases the contract amount by more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold.
    (3) A grantee or subgrantee will be exempt from the pre-award review 
in paragraph (g)(2) of this section if the awarding agency determines 
that its procurement systems comply with the standards of this section.
    (i) A grantee or subgrantee may request that its procurement system 
be reviewed by the awarding agency to determine whether its system meets 
these standards in order for its system to be certified. Generally, 
these reviews shall occur where there is a continuous high-dollar 
funding, and third-party contracts are awarded on a regular basis.
    (ii) A grantee or subgrantee may self-certify its procurement 
system. Such self-certification shall not limit the awarding agency's 
right to survey the system. Under a self-certification procedure, 
awarding agencies may wish to rely on written assurances from the 
grantee or subgrantee that it is complying with these standards. A 
grantee or subgrantee will cite specific procedures, regulations, 
standards, etc., as being in compliance with these requirements and have 
its system available for review.
    (h) Bonding requirements. For construction or facility improvement 
contracts or subcontracts exceeding the simplified acquisition 
threshold, the awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and 
requirements of the grantee or subgrantee provided the awarding agency 
has made a determination that the awarding agency's interest is 
adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the 
minimum requirements shall be as follows:
    (1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of 
the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist of a firm commitment 
such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument 
accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of 
his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within 
the time specified.
    (2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent 
of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is one executed in 
connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's 
obligations under such contract.
    (3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of 
the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed in connection 
with a contract to assure payment as required by law of all persons 
supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for 
in the contract.
    (i) Contract provisions. A grantee's and subgrantee's contracts must 
contain provisions in paragraph (i) of this section. Federal agencies 
are permitted to require changes, remedies, changed conditions, access 
and records retention, suspension of work, and other

[[Page 195]]

clauses approved by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy.
    (1) Administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances 
where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such 
sanctions and penalties as may be appropriate. (Contracts more than the 
simplified acquisition threshold)
    (2) Termination for cause and for convenience by the grantee or 
subgrantee including the manner by which it will be effected and the 
basis for settlement. (All contracts in excess of $10,000)
    (3) Compliance with Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, 
entitled ``Equal Employment Opportunity,'' as amended by Executive Order 
11375 of October 13, 1967, and as supplemented in Department of Labor 
regulations (41 CFR chapter 60). (All construction contracts awarded in 
excess of $10,000 by grantees and their contractors or subgrantees)
    (4) Compliance with the Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18 U.S.C. 
874) as supplemented in Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 3). 
(All contracts and subgrants for construction or repair)
    (5) Compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a to 276a-7) 
as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5). 
(Construction contracts in excess of $2000 awarded by grantees and 
subgrantees when required by Federal grant program legislation)
    (6) Compliance with Sections 103 and 107 of the Contract Work Hours 
and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-330) as supplemented by 
Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5). (Construction contracts 
awarded by grantees and subgrantees in excess of $2000, and in excess of 
$2500 for other contracts which involve the employment of mechanics or 
laborers)
    (7) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations 
pertaining to reporting.
    (8) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations 
pertaining to patent rights with respect to any discovery or invention 
which arises or is developed in the course of or under such contract.
    (9) Awarding agency requirements and regulations pertaining to 
copyrights and rights in data.
    (10) Access by the grantee, the subgrantee, the Federal grantor 
agency, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their 
duly authorized representatives to any books, documents, papers, and 
records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to that specific 
contract for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts, and 
transcriptions.
    (11) Retention of all required records for three years after 
grantees or subgrantees make final payments and all other pending 
matters are closed.
    (12) Compliance with all applicable standards, orders, or 
requirements issued under section 306 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C.

              Reports, Records, Retention, and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 33.40  Monitoring and reporting program performance.

    (a) Monitoring by grantees. Grantees are responsible for managing 
the day-to-day operations of grant and subgrant supported activities. 
Grantees must monitor grant and subgrant supported activities to assure 
compliance with applicable Federal requirements and that performance 
goals are being achieved. Grantee monitoring must cover each program, 
function or activity.
    (b) Nonconstruction performance reports. The Federal agency may, if 
it decides that performance information available from subsequent 
applications contains sufficient information to meet its programmatic 
needs, require the grantee to submit a performance report only upon 
expiration or termination of grant support. Unless waived by the Federal 
agency this report will be due on the same date as the final Financial 
Status Report.
    (1) Grantees shall submit annual performance reports unless the 
awarding agency requires quarterly or semi-annual reports. However, 
performance reports will not be required more frequently than quarterly. 
Annual reports shall be due 90 days after the grant year, quarterly or 
semi-annual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The 
final performance report will be due 90 days after the expiration or 
termination of grant support. If a justified request is submitted by a 
grantee, the Federal agency may extend the due date for any performance 
report. Additionally, requirements for unnecessary performance reports 
may be waived by the Federal agency.
    (2) Performance reports will contain, for each grant, brief 
information on the following:
    (i) A comparison of actual accomplishments to the objectives 
established for the period. Where the output of the project can be 
quantified, a computation of the cost per unit of output may be required 
if that information will be useful.
    (ii) The reasons for slippage if established objectives were not 
met.
    (iii) Additional pertinent information including, when appropriate, 
analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.
    (3) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original 
and two copies of performance reports.
    (4) Grantees will adhere to the standards in this section in 
prescribing performance reporting requirements for subgrantees.
    (c) Construction performance reports. For the most part, on-site 
technical inspections and certified percentage-of-completion data are 
relied on heavily by Federal agencies to monitor progress under 
construction grants and subgrants. The Federal agency will require 
additional formal performance reports only when considered necessary, 
and never more frequently than quarterly.

[[Page 197]]

    (d) Significant developments. Events may occur between the scheduled 
performance reporting dates which have significant impact upon the grant 
or subgrant supported activity. In such cases, the grantee must inform 
the Federal agency as soon as the following types of conditions become 
known:
    (1) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially 
impair the ability to meet the objective of the award. This disclosure 
must include a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and any 
assistance needed to resolve the situation.
    (2) Favorable developments which enable meeting time schedules and 
objectives sooner or at less cost than anticipated or producing more 
beneficial results than originally planned.
    (e) Federal agencies may make site visits as warranted by program 
needs.
    (f) Waivers, extensions. (1) Federal agencies may waive any 
performance report required by this part if not needed.
    (2) The grantee may waive any performance report from a subgrantee 
when not needed. The grantee may extend the due date for any performance 
report from a subgrantee if the grantee will still be able to meet its 
performance reporting obligations to the Federal agency.


<R05>
Sec. 33.41  Financial reporting.

    (a) General. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) (2) and (5) of 
this section, grantees will use only the forms specified in paragraphs 
(a) through (e) of this section, and such supplementary or other forms 
as may from time to time be authorized by OMB, for:
    (i) Submitting financial reports to Federal agencies, or
    (ii) Requesting advances or reimbursements when letters of credit 
are not used.
    (2) Grantees need not apply the forms prescribed in this section in 
dealing with their subgrantees. However, grantees shall not impose more 
burdensome requirements on subgrantees.
    (3) Grantees shall follow all applicable standard and supplemental 
Federal agency instructions approved by OMB to the extend required under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 for use in connection with forms 
specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. Federal 
agencies may issue substantive supplementary instructions only with the 
approval of OMB. Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the grantee 
to disregard any line item that the Federal agency finds unnecessary for 
its decisionmaking purposes.
    (4) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original 
and two copies of forms required under this part.
    (5) Federal agencies may provide computer outputs to grantees to 
expedite or contribute to the accuracy of reporting. Federal agencies 
may accept the required information from grantees in machine usable 
format or computer printouts instead of prescribed forms.
    (6) Federal agencies may waive any report required by this section 
if not needed.
    (7) Federal agencies may extend the due date of any financial report 
upon receiving a justified request from a grantee.
    (b) Financial Status Report--(1) Form. Grantees will use Standard 
Form 269 or 269A, Financial Status Report, to report the status of funds 
for all nonconstruction grants and for construction grants when required 
in accordance with Sec. 33.41(e)(2)(iii).
    (2) Accounting basis. Each grantee will report program outlays and 
program income on a cash or accrual basis as prescribed by the awarding 
agency. If the Federal agency requires accrual information and the 
grantee's accounting records are not normally kept on the accural basis, 
the grantee shall not be required to convert its accounting system but 
shall develop such accrual information through and analysis of the 
documentation on hand.
    (3) Frequency. The Federal agency may prescribe the frequency of the 
report for each project or program. However, the report will not be 
required more frequently than quarterly. If the Federal agency does not 
specify the frequency of the report, it will be submitted annually. A 
final report will be required upon expiration or termination of grant 
support.
    (4) Due date. When reports are required on a quarterly or semiannual 
basis, they will be due 30 days after the

[[Page 198]]

reporting period. When required on an annual basis, they will be due 90 
days after the grant year. Final reports will be due 90 days after the 
expiration or termination of grant support.
    (c) Federal Cash Transactions Report--(1) Form. (i) For grants paid 
by letter or credit, Treasury check advances or electronic transfer of 
funds, the grantee will submit the Standard Form 272, Federal Cash 
Transactions Report, and when necessary, its continuation sheet, 
Standard Form 272a, unless the terms of the award exempt the grantee 
from this requirement.
    (ii) These reports will be used by the Federal agency to monitor 
cash advanced to grantees and to obtain disbursement or outlay 
information for each grant from grantees. The format of the report may 
be adapted as appropriate when reporting is to be accomplished with the 
assistance of automatic data processing equipment provided that the 
information to be submitted is not changed in substance.
    (2) Forecasts of Federal cash requirements. Forecasts of Federal 
cash requirements may be required in the ``Remarks'' section of the 
report.
    (3) Cash in hands of subgrantees. When considered necessary and 
feasible by the Federal agency, grantees may be required to report the 
amount of cash advances in excess of three days' needs in the hands of 
their subgrantees or contractors and to provide short narrative 
explanations of actions taken by the grantee to reduce the excess 
balances.
    (4) Frequency and due date. Grantees must submit the report no later 
than 15 working days following the end of each quarter. However, where 
an advance either by letter of credit or electronic transfer of funds is 
authorized at an annualized rate of one million dollars or more, the 
Federal agency may require the report to be submitted within 15 working 
days following the end of each month.
    (d) Request for advance or reimbursement--(1) Advance payments. 
Requests for Treasury check advance payments will be submitted on 
Standard Form 270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. (This form will 
not be used for drawdowns under a letter of credit, electronic funds 
transfer or when Treasury check advance payments are made to the grantee 
automatically on a predetermined basis.)
    (2) Reimbursements. Requests for reimbursement under nonconstruction 
grants will also be submitted on Standard Form 270. (For reimbursement 
requests under construction grants, see paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section.)
    (3) The frequency for submitting payment requests is treated in 
Sec. 33.41(b)(3).
    (e) Outlay report and request for reimbursement for construction 
programs--(1) Grants that support construction activities paid by 
reimbursement method. (i) Requests for reimbursement under construction 
grants will be submitted on Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request 
for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Federal agencies may, 
however, prescribe the Request for Advance or Reimbursement form, 
specified in Sec. 33.41(d), instead of this form.
    (ii) The frequency for submitting reimbursement requests is treated 
in Sec. 33.41(b)(3).
    (2) Grants that support construction activities paid by letter of 
credit, electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advance. (i) When a 
construction grant is paid by letter of credit, electronic funds 
transfer or Treasury check advances, the grantee will report its outlays 
to the Federal agency using Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request 
for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. The Federal agency will 
provide any necessary special instruction. However, frequency and due 
date shall be governed by Sec. 33.41(b) (3) and (4).
    (ii) When a construction grant is paid by Treasury check advances 
based on periodic requests from the grantee, the advances will be 
requested on the form specified in Sec. 33.41(d).
    (iii) The Federal agency may substitute the Financial Status Report 
specified in Sec. 33.41(b) for the Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement for Construction Programs.

[[Page 199]]

    (3) Accounting basis. The accounting basis for the Outlay Report and 
Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs shall be governed by 
Sec. 33.41(b)(2).

<R05>
Sec. 33.42  Retention and access requirements for records.

    (a) Applicability. (1) This section applies to all financial and 
programmatic records, supporting documents, statistical records, and 
other records of grantees or subgrantees which are:
    (i) Required to be maintained by the terms of this part, program 
regulations or the grant agreement, or
    (ii) Otherwise reasonably considered as pertinent to program 
regulations or the grant agreement.
    (2) This section does not apply to records maintained by contractors 
or subcontractors. For a requirement to place a provision concerning 
records in certain kinds of contracts, see Sec. 33.36(i)(10).
    (b) Length of retention period. (1) Except as otherwise provided, 
records must be retained for three years from the starting date 
specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action 
involving the records has been started before the expiration of the 3-
year period, the records must be retained until completion of the action 
and resolution of all issues which arise from it, or until the end of 
the regular 3-year period, whichever is later.
    (3) To avoid duplicate recordkeeping, awarding agencies may make 
special arrangements with grantees and subgrantees to retain any records 
which are continuously needed for joint use. The awarding agency will 
request transfer of records to its custody when it determines that the 
records possess long-term retention value. When the records are 
transferred to or maintained by the Federal agency, the 3-year retention 
requirement is not applicable to the grantee or subgrantee.
    (c) Starting date of retention period--(1) General. When grant 
support is continued or renewed at annual or other intervals, the 
retention period for the records of each funding period starts on the 
day the grantee or subgrantee submits to the awarding agency its single 
or last expenditure report for that period. However, if grant support is 
continued or renewed quarterly, the retention period for each year's 
records starts on the day the grantee submits its expenditure report for 
the last quarter of the Federal fiscal year. In all other cases, the 
retention period starts on the day the grantee submits its final 
expenditure report. If an expenditure report has been waived, the 
retention period starts on the day the report would have been due.
    (2) Real property and equipment records. The retention period for 
real property and equipment records starts from the date of the 
disposition or replacement or transfer at the direction of the awarding 
agency.
    (3) Records for income transactions after grant or subgrant support. 
In some cases grantees must report income after the period of grant 
support. Where there is such a requirement, the retention period for the 
records pertaining to the earning of the income starts from the end of 
the grantee's fiscal year in which the income is earned.
    (4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. This 
paragraph applies to the following types of documents, and their 
supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost 
allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at 
which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage 
chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).
    (i) If submitted for negotiation. If the proposal, plan, or other 
computation is required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to 
the grantee) to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-
year retention period for its supporting records starts from the date of 
such submission.
    (ii) If not submitted for negotiation. If the proposal, plan, or 
other computation is not required to be submitted to the Federal 
Government (or to the grantee) for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year 
retention period for the proposal plan, or computation and its 
supporting records starts from end of the fiscal year (or other 
accounting period)

[[Page 200]]

covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.
    (d) Substitution of microfilm. Copies made by microfilming, 
photocopying, or similar methods may be substituted for the original 
records.
    (e) Access to records--(1) Records of grantees and subgrantees. The 
awarding agency and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any 
of their authorized representatives, shall have the right of access to 
any pertinent books, documents, papers, or other records of grantees and 
subgrantees which are pertinent to the grant, in order to make audits, 
examinations, excerpts, and transcripts.
    (2) Expiration of right of access. The rights of access in this 
section must not be limited to the required retention period but shall 
last as long as the records are retained.
    (f) Restrictions on public access. The Federal Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) does not apply to records Unless required 
by Federal, State, or local law, grantees and subgrantees are not 
required to permit public access to their records.

[53 FR 8070 and 8087, Mar. 11, 1988. Redesignated and amended at 57 FR 
6199 and 6201, Feb. 21, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 33.43  Enforcement.

    (a) Remedies for noncompliance. If a grantee or subgrantee 
materially fails to comply with any term of an award, whether stated in 
a Federal statute or regulation, an assurance, in a State plan or 
application, a notice of award, or elsewhere, the awarding agency may 
take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the 
circumstances:
    (1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the 
deficiency by the grantee or subgrantee or more severe enforcement 
action by the awarding agency,
    (2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and matching credit 
for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in 
compliance,
    (3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award for the 
grantee's or subgrantee's program,
    (4) Withhold further awards for the program, or
    (5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.
    (b) Hearings, appeals. In taking an enforcement action, the awarding 
agency will provide the grantee or subgrantee an opportunity for such 
hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the grantee 
or subgrantee is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to 
the action involved.
    (c) Effects of suspension and termination. Costs of grantee or 
subgrantee resulting from obligations incurred by the grantee or 
subgrantee during a suspension or after termination of an award are not 
allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes them in the 
notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other grantee or 
subgrantee costs during suspension or after termination which are 
necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if:
    (1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred 
by the grantee or subgrantee before the effective date of suspension or 
termination, are not in anticipation of it, and, in the case of a 
termination, are noncancellable, and,
    (2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or 
expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the 
termination takes effect.
    (d) Relationship to debarment and suspension. The enforcement 
remedies identified in this section, including suspension and 
termination, do not preclude grantee or subgrantee from being subject to 
``Debarment and Suspension'' under E.O. 12549 (see Sec. 33.35).

6199 and 6201, Feb. 21, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 33.44  Termination for convenience.

    Except as provided in Sec. 33.43 awards may be terminated in whole 
or in part only as follows:
    (a) By the awarding agency with the consent of the grantee or 
subgrantee in which case the two parties shall agree upon the 
termination conditions, including the effective date and in the case of 
partial termination, the portion to be terminated, or

[[Page 201]]

    (b) By the grantee or subgrantee upon written notification to the 
awarding agency, setting forth the reasons for such termination, the 
effective date, and in the case of partial termination, the portion to 
be terminated. However, if, in the case of a partial termination, the 
awarding agency determines that the remaining portion of the award will 
not accomplish the purposes for which the award was made, the awarding 
agency may terminate the award in its entirety under either Sec. 33.43 
or paragraph (a) of this section.

[53 FR 8070 and 8087, Mar. 11, 1988. Redesignated and amended at 57 FR

<R04>
                 Subpart D_After-The-Grant Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 33.50  Closeout.

    (a) General. The Federal agency will close out the award when it 
determines that all applicable administrative actions and all required 
work of the grant has been completed.
    (b) Reports. Within 90 days after the expiration or termination of 
the grant, the grantee must submit all financial, performance, and other 
reports required as a condition of the grant. Upon request by the 
grantee, Federal agencies may extend this timeframe. These may include 
but are not limited to:
    (1) Final performance or progress report.
    (2) Financial Status Report (SF 269) or Outlay Report and Request 
for Reimbursement for Construction Programs (SF-271) (as applicable).
    (3) Final request for payment (SF-270) (if applicable).
    (4) Invention disclosure (if applicable).
    (5) Federally-owned property report:

In accordance with Sec. 33.32(f), a grantee must submit an inventory of 
all federally owned property (as distinct from property acquired with 
grant funds) for which it is accountable and request disposition 
instructions from the Federal agency of property no longer needed.
    (c) Cost adjustment. The Federal agency will, within 90 days after 
receipt of reports in paragraph (b) of this section, make upward or 
downward adjustments to the allowable costs.
    (d) Cash adjustments. (1) The Federal agency will make prompt 
payment to the grantee for allowable reimbursable costs.
    (2) The grantee must immediately refund to the Federal agency any 
balance of unobligated (unencumbered) cash advanced that is not 
authorized to be retained for use on other grants.

[53 FR 8070 and 8087, Mar. 11, 1988. Redesignated and amended at 57 FR 
6199 and 6201, Feb. 21, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 33.51  Later disallowances and adjustments.

    The closeout of a grant does not affect:
    (a) The Federal agency's right to disallow costs and recover funds 
on the basis of a later audit or other review;
    (b) The grantee's obligation to return any funds due as a result of 
later refunds, corrections, or other transactions;
    (c) Records retention as required in Sec. 33.42;
    (d) Property management requirements in Sec. Sec. 33.31 and 33.32;

<R05>
Sec. 33.52  Collection of amounts due.

    (a) Any funds paid to a grantee in excess of the amount to which the 
grantee is finally determined to be entitled under the terms of the 
award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If not paid within a 
reasonable period after demand, the Federal agency may reduce the debt 
by:
    (1) Making an adminstrative offset against other requests for 
reimbursements,
    (2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the grantee, or
    (3) Other action permitted by law.
    (b) Except where otherwise provided by statutes or regulations, the 
Federal agency will charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance 
with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR Ch. II). The date 
from which interest is computed is not extended by litigation or the 
filing of any form of appeal.

for-profit entity) that receives an award from a DoD Component shall 
apply the provisions of this part to subawards with for-profit 
organizations. It should be noted that subawards (see definition in 
Sec. 34.2) are financial assistance for substantive programmatic 
performance and do not include recipients' procurement of goods and 
services.
    (ii) For-profit organizations that receive prime awards covered by 
this part shall apply to each subaward the administrative requirements 
that are applicable to the particular type of subrecipient (e.g., 32 CFR 
part 33 specifies requirements for subrecipients that are States or 
local governments, and 32 CFR part 32 contains requirements for 
universities or other nonprofit organizations).


<R05>
Sec. 34.2  Definitions.

    The following are definitions of terms as used in this part. Grants 
officers are cautioned that terms may be defined differently in this 
part than they are in other parts of the DoD Grant and Agreement 
Regulations (DoDGARs).

[[Page 203]]

    Advance. A payment made by Treasury check or other appropriate 
payment mechanism to a recipient upon its request either before outlays 
are made by the recipient or through the use of predetermined payment 
schedules.
    Award. A grant or a cooperative agreement other than a technology 
investment agreement (TIA). TIAs are covered by part 37 of the DoDGARs 
(32 CFR part 37). Portions of this part may apply to a TIA, but only to 
the extent that 32 CFR part 37 makes them apply.
    Cash contributions. The recipient's cash outlay, including the 
outlay of money contributed to the recipient by third parties.
    Closeout. The process by which the grants officer administering an 
award made by a DoD Component determines that all applicable 
administrative actions and all required work of the award have been 
completed by the recipient and DoD Component.
    Contract. Either:
    (1) A procurement contract made by a recipient under a DoD 
Component's award or by a subrecipient under a subaward; or
    (2) A procurement subcontract under a contract awarded by a 
recipient or subrecipient.
    Cost sharing or matching. That portion of project or program costs 
not borne by the Federal Government.
    Disallowed costs. Those charges to an award that the grants officer 
administering an award made by a DoD Component determines to be 
unallowable, in accordance with the applicable Federal cost principles 
or other terms and conditions contained in the award.
    DoD Component. A Military Department, Defense Agency, DoD Field 
Activity, or organization within the Office of the Secretary of Defense 
that provides or administers an award to a recipient.
    Equipment. Tangible nonexpendable personal property charged directly 
to the award having a useful life of more than one year and an 
acquisition cost of $5,000 or more per unit. That definition applies for 
the purposes of the Federal administrative requirements in this part. 
However, the recipient's policy may be to use a lower dollar value for 
defining ``equipment,'' and nothing in this part should be construed as 
requiring the recipient to establish a higher limit for purposes other 
than the administrative requirements in this part.
    Excess property. Property under the control of any DoD Component 
that, as determined by the head thereof, is no longer required for its 
needs or the discharge of its responsibilities.
    Expenditures. See the definition for outlays in this section.
    Federally owned property. Property in the possession of, or directly 
acquired by, the Government and subsequently made available to the 
recipient.
    Funding period. The period of time when Federal funding is available 
for obligation by the recipient.
    Intellectual property. Intangible personal property such as patents 
and patent applications, trademarks, copyrights, technical data, and 
software rights.
    Obligations. The amounts of orders placed, contracts and grants 
awarded, services received and similar transactions during a given 
period that require payment by the recipient during the same or a future 
period.
    Outlays or expenditures. Charges made to the project or program. 
They may be reported on a cash or accrual basis. For reports prepared on 
a cash basis, outlays are the sum of cash disbursements for direct 
charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense charged, 
the value of third party in-kind contributions applied and the amount of 
cash advances and payments made to subrecipients. For reports prepared 
on an accrual basis, outlays are the sum of cash disbursements for 
direct charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense 
incurred, the value of in-kind contributions applied, and the net 
increase (or decrease) in the amounts owed by the recipient for goods 
and other property received, for services performed by employees, 
contractors, subrecipients and other payees and other amounts becoming 
owed under programs for which no current services or performance are 
required.
    Personal property. Property of any kind except real property. It may 
be:
    (1) Tangible, having physical existence (i.e., equipment and 
supplies); or

[[Page 204]]

    (2) Intangible, having no physical existence, such as patents, 
copyrights, data and software.
    Prior approval. Written or electronic approval by an authorized 
official evidencing prior consent.
    Program income. Gross income earned by the recipient that is 
directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the 
award. Program income includes, but is not limited to, income from fees 
for services performed, the use or rental of real or personal property 
acquired under federally-funded projects, the sale of commodities or 
items fabricated under an award, license fees and royalties on patents 
and copyrights, and interest on loans made with award funds. Interest 
earned on advances of Federal funds is not program income. Except as 
otherwise provided in program regulations or the terms and conditions of 
the award, program income does not include the receipt of principal on 
loans, rebates, credits, discounts, etc., or interest earned on any of 
them.
    Project costs. All allowable costs, as set forth in the applicable 
Federal cost principles, incurred by a recipient and the value of the 
contributions made by third parties in accomplishing the objectives of 
the award during the project period.
    Project period. The period established in the award document during 
which Federal sponsorship begins and ends.
    Property. Real property and personal property (equipment, supplies, 
and intellectual property), unless stated otherwise.
    Real property. Land, including land improvements, structures and 
appurtenances thereto, but excludes movable machinery and equipment.
    Recipient. A for-profit organization receiving an award directly 
from a DoD Component to carry out a project or program.
    Research. Basic, applied, and advanced research activities. Basic 
research is defined as efforts directed toward increasing knowledge or 
understanding in science and engineering. Applied research is defined as 
efforts that attempt to determine and exploit the potential of 
scientific discoveries or improvements in technology, such as new 
materials, devices, methods, and processes. ``Advanced research,'' 
advanced technology development that creates new technology or 
demonstrates the viability of applying existing technology to new 
products and processes in a general way, is most closely analogous to 
precommercialization or precompetitive technology development in the 
commercial sector (it does not include development of military systems 
and hardware where specific requirements have been defined).
    Small award. An award not exceeding the simplified acquisition 
threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently $100,000).
    Small business concern. A concern, including its affiliates, that is 
independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation 
in which it has applied for an award, and qualified as a small business 
under the criteria and size standards in 13 CFR part 121. For more 
details, grants officers should see 48 CFR part 19 in the ``Federal 
Acquisition Regulation.''
    Subaward. Financial assistance in the form of money, or property in 
lieu of money, provided under an award by a recipient to an eligible 
subrecipient or by a subrecipient to a lower tier subrecipient. The term 
includes financial assistance when provided by any legal agreement, even 
if the agreement is called a contract, but the term includes neither 
procurement of goods and services nor any form of assistance which is 
excluded from the definition of ``award'' in this section.
    Subrecipient. The legal entity to which a subaward is made and which 
is accountable to the recipient for the use of the funds provided.
    Supplies. Tangible expendable personal property that is charged 
directly to the award and that has a useful life of less than one year 
or an acquisition cost of less than $5000 per unit.
    Suspension. An action by a DoD Component that temporarily withdraws 
Federal sponsorship under an award, pending corrective action by the 
recipient or pending a decision to terminate the award by the DoD 
Component. Suspension of an award is a separate action from suspension 
of a recipient under 32 CFR part 25.

[[Page 205]]

    Termination. The cancellation of an award, in whole or in part, 
under an agreement at any time prior to either:
    (1) The date on which all work under an award is completed; or
    (2) The date on which Federal sponsorship ends, as given on the 
award document or any supplement or amendment thereto.
    Third party in-kind contributions. The value of non-cash 
contributions provided by non-Federal third parties. Third party in-kind 
contributions may be in the form of real property, equipment, supplies 
and other expendable property, and the value of goods and services 
directly benefiting and specifically identifiable to the project or 
program.
    Unobligated balance. The portion of the funds authorized by a DoD 
Component that has not been obligated by the recipient and is determined 
by deducting the cumulative obligations from the cumulative funds 
authorized.

Sec. 34.3  Deviations.

    (a) Individual deviations. Individual deviations affecting only one 
award may be approved by DoD Components in accordance with procedures 
stated in 32 CFR 21.335(a) and 21.340.
    (b) Small awards. DoD Components may apply less restrictive 
requirements than the provisions of this part when awarding small 
awards, except for those requirements which are statutory.
    (c) Other class deviations. For classes of awards other than small 
awards, the Director, Defense Research and Engineering, or his or her 
designee, may grant exceptions from the requirements of this part when 
exceptions are not prohibited by statute. DoD Components shall request 
approval for such deviations in accordance with 32 CFR 21.335 (b) and 
21.340.

[63 FR 12204, Mar. 12, 1998, as amended at 68 FR 47160, Aug. 7, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 34.4  Special award conditions.

    (a) Grants officers may impose additional requirements as needed, 
over and above those provided in this part, if an applicant or 
recipient:
    (1) Has a history of poor performance;
    (2) Is not financially stable;
    (3) Has a management system that does not meet the standards 
prescribed in this part;
    (4) Has not conformed to the terms and conditions of a previous 
award; or
    (5) Is not otherwise responsible.
    (b) Before imposing additional requirements, DoD Components shall 
notify the applicant or recipient in writing as to:
    (1) The nature of the additional requirements;
    (2) The reason why the additional requirements are being imposed;
    (3) The nature of the corrective action needed;
    (4) The time allowed for completing the corrective actions; and
    (5) The method for requesting reconsideration of the additional 
requirements imposed.
    (c) Any special conditions shall be promptly removed once the 
conditions that prompted them have been corrected.
    (d) Grants officers:
    (1) Should coordinate the imposition and removal of special award 
conditions with the cognizant grants administration office identified in 
32 CFR 22.710.
    (2) Shall include in the award file the written notification to the 
recipient, described in paragraph (b) of this section, and the 
documentation required by 32 CFR 22.410(b).


<R04>
                    Subpart B_Post-award Requirements

                    Financial and Program Management


<R05>
Sec. 34.10  Purpose of financial and program management.

    Sections 34.11 through 34.17 prescribe standards for financial 
management systems; methods for making payments; and rules for cost 
sharing and matching, program income, revisions to budgets and program 
plans, audits, allowable costs, and fee and profit.


<R05>
Sec. 34.11  Standards for financial management systems.

    (a) Recipients shall be allowed and encouraged to use existing 
financial management systems established for

[[Page 206]]

doing business in the commercial marketplace, to the extent that the 
systems comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and 
the minimum standards in this section. As a minimum, a recipient's 
financial management system shall provide:
    (1) Effective control of all funds. Control systems must be adequate 
to ensure that costs charged to Federal funds and those counted as the 
recipient's cost share or match are consistent with requirements for 
cost reasonableness, allowability, and allocability in the applicable 
cost principles (see Sec. 34.17) and in the terms and conditions of the 
award.
    (2) Accurate, current and complete records that document for each 
project funded wholly or in part with Federal funds the source and 
application of the Federal funds and the recipient's required cost share 
or match. These records shall:
    (i) Contain information about receipts, authorizations, assets, 
expenditures, program income, and interest.
    (ii) Be adequate to make comparisons of outlays with budgeted 
amounts for each award (as required for programmatic and financial 
reporting under Sec. 34.41. Where appropriate, financial information 
should be related to performance and unit cost data. Note that unit cost 
data are generally not appropriate for awards that support research.
    (3) To the extent that advance payments are authorized under Sec. 
34.12, procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer 
of funds to the recipient from the Government and the recipient's 
disbursement of the funds for program purposes.
    (4) The recipient shall have a system to support charges to Federal 
awards for salaries and wages, whether treated as direct or indirect 
costs. Where employees work on multiple activities or cost objectives, a 
distribution of their salaries and wages will be supported by personnel 
activity reports which must:
    (i) Reflect an after the fact distribution of the actual activity of 
each employee.
    (ii) Account for the total activity for which each employee is 
compensated.
    (iii) Be prepared at least monthly, and coincide with one or more 
pay periods.
    (b) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment 
of money borrowed by the recipient, the DoD Component, at its 
discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding 
and insurance requirements of the recipient are not deemed adequate to 
protect the interest of the Federal Government.
    (c) The DoD Component may require adequate fidelity bond coverage 
where the recipient lacks sufficient coverage to protect the Federal 
Government's interest.
    (d) Where bonds are required in the situations described above, the 
bonds shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority 
as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety 
Companies Doing Business with the United States.''


<R05>
Sec. 34.12  Payment.

    (a) Methods available. Payment methods for awards with for-profit 
organizations are:
    (1) Reimbursement. Under this method, the recipient requests 
reimbursement for costs incurred during a time period. In cases where 
the recipient submits each request for payment to the grants officer, 
the DoD payment office reimburses the recipient by electronic funds 
transfer or check after approval of the request by the grants officer 
designated to do so.
    (2) Advance payments. Under this method, a DoD Component makes a 
payment to a recipient based upon projections of the recipient's cash 
needs. The payment generally is made upon the recipient's request, 
although predetermined payment schedules may be used when the timing of 
the recipient's needs to disburse funds can be predicted in advance with 
sufficient accuracy to ensure compliance with paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of 
this section.
    (b) Selecting a method. (1) The preferred payment method is the 
reimbursement method, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section
    (2) Advance payments, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, may be used in exceptional circumstances, subject to the 
following conditions:

[[Page 207]]

    (i) The grants officer, in consultation with the program official, 
must judge that advance payments are necessary or will materially 
contribute to the probability of success of the project contemplated 
under the award (e.g., as startup funds for a project performed by a 
newly formed company). The rationale for the judgment shall be 
documented in the award file.
    (ii) Cash advances shall be limited to the minimum amounts needed to 
carry out the program.
    (iii) Recipients and the DoD Component shall maintain procedures to 
ensure that the timing of cash advances is as close as is 
administratively feasible to the recipients' disbursements of the funds 
for program purposes, including direct program or project costs and the 
proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs.
    (iv) Recipients shall maintain advance payments of Federal funds in 
interest-bearing accounts, and remit annually the interest earned to the 
administrative grants officer responsible for post-award administration 
(the grants officer shall forward the payment to the responsible payment 
office, for return to the Department of Treasury's miscellaneous 
receipts account), unless one of the following applies:
    (A) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per 
year.
    (B) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not 
be expected to earn interest in excess of $250 per year on Federal cash 
balances.
    (C) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so 
high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non-
Federal cash resources.
    (c) Frequency of payments. For either reimbursements or advance 
payments, recipients shall be authorized to submit requests for payment 
at least monthly.
    (d) Forms for requesting payment. DoD Components may authorize 
recipients to use the SF-270,<SUP>1</SUP> ``Request for Advance or 
Reimbursement;'' the SF-271,<SUP>2</SUP> ``Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement for Construction Programs;'' or prescribe other forms or 
formats as necessary.

    \2\ See footnote 1 to this paragraph (d).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) Timeliness of payments. Payments normally will be made within 30 
calendar days of the receipt of a recipient's request for reimbursement 
or advance by the office designated to receive the request (for further 
information about timeframes for payments, see 32 CFR 22.810(c)(3)(ii)).
    (f) Precedence of other available funds. Recipients shall disburse 
funds available from program income, rebates, refunds, contract 
settlements, audit recoveries, and interest earned on such funds before 
requesting additional cash payments.
    (g) Withholding of payments. Unless otherwise required by statute, 
grants officers shall not withhold payments for proper charges made by 
recipients during the project period for reasons other than the 
following:
    (1) A recipient has failed to comply with project objectives, the 
terms and conditions of the award, or Federal reporting requirements, in 
which case the grants officer may suspend payments in accordance with 
Sec. 34.52.
    (2) The recipient is delinquent on a debt to the United States (see 
definitions of ``debt'' and ``delinquent debt'' in 32 CFR 22.105). In 
that case, the grants officer may, upon reasonable notice, withhold 
payments for obligations incurred after a specified date, until the debt 
is resolved.


<R05>
Sec. 34.13  Cost sharing or matching.

    (a) Acceptable contributions. All contributions, including cash 
contributions and third party in-kind contributions, shall be accepted 
as part of the recipient's cost sharing or matching when such 
contributions meet all of the following criteria:
    (1) They are verifiable from the recipient's records.

[[Page 208]]

    (2) They are not included as contributions for any other federally-
assisted project or program.
    (3) They are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient 
accomplishment of project or program objectives.
    (4) They are allowable under Sec. 34.17.
    (5) They are not paid by the Federal Government under another award, 
except:
    (i) Costs that are authorized by Federal statute to be used for cost 
sharing or matching; or
    (ii) Independent research and development (IR&D) costs. In 
accordance with the for-profit cost principle in 48 CFR 31.205-18(e), 
use of IR&D as cost sharing is permitted, whether or not the Government 
decides at a later date to reimburse any of the IR&D as allowable 
indirect costs. In such cases, the IR&D must meet all of the criteria in 
paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) and (a) (6) through (8) of this section.
    (6) They are provided for in the approved budget, when approval of 
the budget is required by the DoD Component.
    (7) If they are real property or equipment, whether purchased with 
recipient's funds or donated by third parties, they must have the grants 
officer's prior approval if the contributions' value is to exceed 
depreciation or use charges during the project period (paragraphs (b)(1) 
and (b)(4)(ii) of this section discuss the limited circumstances under 
which a grants officer may approve higher values). If a DoD Component 
requires approval of a recipient's budget (see paragraph (a)(6) of this 
section), the grants officer's approval of the budget satisfies this 
prior approval requirement, for real property or equipment items listed 
in the budget.
    (8) They conform to other provisions of this part, as applicable.
    (b) Valuing and documenting contributions--(1) Valuing recipient's 
property or services of recipient's employees. Values shall be 
established in accordance with the applicable cost principles in Sec. 
34.17, which means that amounts chargeable to the project are determined 
on the basis of costs incurred. For real property or equipment used on 
the project, the cost principles authorize depreciation or use charges. 
The full value of the item may be applied when the item will be consumed 
in the performance of the award or fully depreciated by the end of the 
award. In cases where the full value of a donated capital asset is to be 
applied as cost sharing or matching, that full value shall be the lesser 
of the following:
    (i) The certified value of the remaining life of the property 
recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the time of donation; 
or
    (ii) The current fair market value. However, when there is 
sufficient justification, the grants officer may approve the use of the 
current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds 
the certified value at the time of donation to the project. The grants 
officer may accept the use of any reasonable basis for determining the 
fair market value of the property.
    (2) Valuing services of others' employees. When an employer other 
than the recipient furnishes the services of an employee, those services 
shall be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay plus an amount of 
fringe benefits and overhead (at an overhead rate appropriate for the 
location where the services are performed) provided these services are 
in the same skill for which the employee is normally paid.
    (3) Valuing volunteer services. Volunteer services furnished by 
professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and 
unskilled labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the 
service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project or 
program. Rates for volunteer services shall be consistent with those 
paid for similar work in the recipient's organization. In those 
instances in which the required skills are not found in the recipient 
organization, rates shall be consistent with those paid for similar work 
in the labor market in which the recipient competes for the kind of 
services involved. In either case, paid fringe benefits that are 
reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation.
    (4) Valuing property donated by third parties. (i) Donated supplies 
may include such items as office supplies or laboratory supplies. Value 
assessed to donated supplies included in the cost

[[Page 209]]

sharing or matching share shall be reasonable and shall not exceed the 
fair market value of the property at the time of the donation.
    (ii) Normally only depreciation or use charges for equipment and 
buildings may be applied. However, the fair rental charges for land and 
the full value of equipment or other capital assets may be allowed, when 
they will be consumed in the performance of the award or fully 
depreciated by the end of the award, provided that the grants officer 
has approved the charges. When use charges are applied, values shall be 
determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the 
recipient, with the following qualifications:
    (A) The value of donated space shall not exceed the fair rental 
value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal of 
comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the 
same locality.
    (B) The value of loaned equipment shall not exceed its fair rental 
value.
    (5) Documentation. The following requirements pertain to the 
recipient's supporting records for in-kind contributions from third 
parties:
    (i) Volunteer services shall be documented and, to the extent 
feasible, supported by the same methods used by the recipient for its 
own employees.
    (ii) The basis for determining the valuation for personal services 
and property shall be documented.


<R05>
Sec. 34.14  Program income.

    (a) DoD Components shall apply the standards in this section to the 
disposition of program income from projects financed in whole or in part 
with Federal funds.
    (b) Recipients shall have no obligation to the Government, unless 
the terms and conditions of the award provide otherwise, for program 
income earned:
    (1) From license fees and royalties for copyrighted material, 
patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions produced under 
an award. Note, however, that the Patent and Trademark Amendments (35 
U.S.C. Chapter 18), as implemented in Sec. 34.25, apply to inventions 
made under a research award.
    (2) After the end of the project period. If a grants officer 
anticipates that an award is likely to generate program income after the 
end of the project period, the grants officer should indicate in the 
award document whether the recipient will have any obligation to the 
Federal Government with respect to such income.
    (c) If authorized by the terms and conditions of the award, costs 
incident to the generation of program income may be deducted from gross 
income to determine program income, provided these costs have not been 
charged to the award.
    (d) Other than any program income excluded pursuant to paragraphs 
(b) and (c) of this section, program income earned during the project 
period shall be retained by the recipient and used in one or more of the 
following ways, as specified in program regulations or the terms and 
conditions of the award:
    (1) Added to funds committed to the project by the DoD Component and 
recipient and used to further eligible project or program objectives.
    (2) Used to finance the non-Federal share of the project or program.
    (3) Deducted from the total project or program allowable cost in 
determining the net allowable costs on which the Federal share of costs 
is based.
    (e) If the terms and conditions of an award authorize the 
disposition of program income as described in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) 
of this section, and stipulate a limit on the amounts that may be used 
in those ways, program income in excess of the stipulated limits shall 
be used in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
    (f) In the event that the terms and conditions of the award do not 
specify how program income is to be used, paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section shall apply automatically to all projects or programs except 
research. For awards that support research, paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section shall apply automatically unless the terms and conditions 
specify another alternative or the recipient is subject to special award 
conditions, as indicated in Sec. 34.4.
    (g) Proceeds from the sale of property that is acquired, rather than 
fabricated, under an award are not program income and shall be handled 
in

[[Page 210]]

accordance with the requirements of the Property Standards (see 
Sec. Sec. 34.20 through 34.25).


<R05>
Sec. 34.15  Revision of budget and program plans.

    (a) The budget plan is the financial expression of the project or 
program as approved during the award process. It may include either the 
sum of the Federal and non-Federal shares, or only the Federal share, 
depending upon DoD Component requirements. It shall be related to 
performance for program evaluation purposes whenever appropriate.
    (b) Recipients are required to report deviations from budget and 
program plans, and request prior approvals for budget and program plan 
revisions, in accordance with this section.
    (c) Recipients shall immediately request, in writing, prior approval 
from the cognizant grants officer when there is reason to believe that 
within the next seven calendar days a programmatic or budgetary revision 
will be necessary for certain reasons, as follows:
    (1) The recipient always must obtain the grants officer's prior 
approval when a revision is necessary for either of the following two 
reasons (i.e., these two requirements for prior approval may never be 
waived):
    (i) A change in the scope or the objective of the project or program 
(even if there is no associated budget revision requiring prior written 
approval).
    (ii) A need for additional Federal funding.
    (2) The recipient must obtain the grants officer's prior approval 
when a revision is necessary for any of the following six reasons, 
unless the requirement for prior approval is waived in the terms and 
conditions of the award (i.e., if the award document is silent, these 
prior approvals are required):
    (i) A change in a key person specified in the application or award 
document.
    (ii) The absence for more than three months, or a 25 percent 
reduction in time devoted to the project, by the approved project 
director or principal investigator.
    (iii) The inclusion of any additional costs that require prior 
approval in accordance with applicable cost principles for Federal funds 
and recipients' cost share or match, in Sec. 34.17 and Sec. 34.13, 
respectively.
    (iv) The inclusion of pre-award costs. All such costs are incurred 
at the recipient's risk (i.e., the DoD Component is under no obligation 
to reimburse such costs if for any reason the recipient does not receive 
an award, or if the award is less than anticipated and inadequate to 
cover such costs).
    (v) A ``no-cost'' extension of the project period that does not 
require additional Federal funds and does not change the approved 
objectives or scope of the project.
    (vi) Any subaward, transfer or contracting out of substantive 
program performance under an award, unless described in the application 
and funded in the approved awards. This provision does not apply to the 
purchase of supplies, material, or general support services, except that 
procurement of equipment or other capital items of property always is 
subject to the grants officer's prior approval under Sec. 34.21(a), if 
it is to be purchased with Federal funds, or Sec. 34.13(a)(7), if it is 
to be used as cost sharing or matching.
    (3) The recipient also must obtain the grants officer's prior 
approval when a revision is necessary for either of the following 
reasons, if specifically required in the terms and conditions of the 
award document (i.e., if the award document is silent, these prior 
approvals are not required):
    (i) The transfer of funds among direct cost categories, functions 
and activities for awards in which the Federal share of the project 
exceeds $100,000 and the cumulative amount of such transfers exceeds or 
is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by 
the DoD Component. No DoD Component shall permit a transfer that would 
cause any Federal appropriation or part thereof to be used for purposes 
other than those consistent with the original intent of the 
appropriation.
    (ii) For awards that provide support for both construction and 
nonconstruction work, any fund or budget transfers between the two types 
of work supported.

[[Page 211]]

    (d) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the 
recipient's request for budget revisions, the grants officer shall 
review the request and notify the recipient whether the budget revisions 
have been approved. If the revision is still under consideration at the 
end of 30 calendar days, the grants officer shall inform the recipient 
in writing of the date when the recipient may expect the decision.


<R05>
Sec. 34.16  Audits.

    (a) Any recipient that expends $300,000 or more in a year under 
Federal awards shall have an audit made for that year by an independent 
auditor, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. The audit 
generally should be made a part of the regularly scheduled, annual audit 
of the recipient's financial statements. However, it may be more 
economical in some cases to have the Federal awards separately audited, 
and a recipient may elect to do so, unless that option is precluded by 
award terms and conditions, or by Federal laws or regulations applicable 
to the program(s) under which the awards were made.
    (b) The auditor shall determine and report on whether:
    (1) The recipient has an internal control structure that provides 
reasonable assurance that it is managing Federal awards in compliance 
with Federal laws and regulations, and with the terms and conditions of 
the awards.
    (2) Based on a sampling of Federal award expenditures, the recipient 
has complied with laws, regulations, and award terms that may have a 
direct and material effect on Federal awards.
    (c) The recipient shall make the auditor's report available to DoD 
Components whose awards are affected.
    (d) The requirement for an annual independent audit is intended to 
ascertain the adequacy of the recipient's internal financial management 
systems and to curtail the unnecessary duplication and overlap that 
usually results when Federal agencies request audits of individual 
awards on a routine basis. Therefore, a grants officer:
    (1) Shall consider whether the independent audit satisfies his or 
her requirements, before requesting any additional audits; and
    (2) When requesting an additional audit, shall:
    (i) Limit the scope of such additional audit to areas not adequately 
addressed by the independent audit.
    (ii) Coordinate the audit request with the Federal agency with the 
predominant fiscal interest in the recipient, as the agency responsible 
for the scheduling and distribution of audits. If DoD has the 
predominant fiscal interest in the recipient, the Defense Contract 
Management Command (DCMC) is responsible for monitoring audits, ensuring 
resolution of audit findings, and distributing audit reports. When an 
additional audit is requested and DoD has the predominant fiscal 
interest in the recipient, DCMC shall, to the extent practicable, ensure 
that the additional audit builds upon the independent audit or other 
audits performed in accordance with this section.
    (e) There may be instances in which Federal auditors have recently 
performed audits, are performing audits, or are planning to perform 
audits, of a recipient. In these cases, the recipient and its Federal 
cognizant agency should seek to have the non-Federal, independent 
auditors work with the Federal auditors to develop a coordinated audit 
approach, to minimize duplication of audit work.
    (f) Audit costs (including a reasonable allocation of the costs of 
the audit of the recipient's financial statement, based on the relative 
benefit to the Government and the recipient) are allowable costs of DoD 
awards.


<R05>
Sec. 34.17  Allowable costs.

    Allowability of costs shall be determined in accordance with the 
cost principles applicable to the type of entity incurring the costs, as 
follows:
    (a) For-profit organizations. Allowability of costs incurred by for-
profit organizations that are recipients of prime awards from DoD 
Components, and those that are subrecipients under prime awards to other 
organizations, is to be determined in accordance with:
    (1) The for-profit cost principles in 48 CFR parts 31 and 231 (in 
the Federal Acquisition Regulation, or FAR, and the Defense Federal 
Acquisition Regulation Supplement, or DFARS, respectively).

[[Page 212]]

    (2) The supplemental information on allowability of audit costs, in 
Sec. 34.16(f).
    (b) Other types of organizations. Allowability of costs incurred by 
other types of organizations that may be subrecipients under a prime 
award to a for-profit organization is determined as follows:
    (1) Institutions of higher education. Allowability is determined in 
accordance with OMB Circular A-21,\3\ `` Cost Principles for Educational 
Institutions.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ For copies of the Circular, contact the Office of Management and 
Budget, EOP Publications, 725 17th St. N.W., New Executive Office 
Building, Washington, D.C. 20503.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Other nonprofit organizations. Allowability is determined in 
accordance with OMB Circular A-122,\4\ ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit 
Organizations.'' Note that Attachment C of the Circular identifies 
selected nonprofit organizations for whom cost allowability is 
determined in accordance with the FAR cost principles for for-profit 
organizations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See footnote 3 to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Hospitals. Allowability is determined in accordance with the 
provisions of 45 CFR part 74, Appendix E, ``Principles for Determining 
Costs Applicable to Research and Development Under Grants and Contracts 
with Hospitals.''
    (4) Governmental organizations. Allowability for State, local, or 
federally recognized Indian tribal governments is determined in 
accordance with OMB Circular A-87,\5\ ``Cost Principles for State and 
Local Governments.''

<R05>
Sec. 34.18  Fee and profit.

    In accordance with 32 CFR 22.205(b), grants and cooperative 
agreements shall not:
    (a) Provide for the payment of fee or profit to the recipient.
    (b) Be used to carry out programs where fee or profit is necessary 
to achieving program objectives.

                           Property Standards


<R05>
Sec. 34.20  Purpose of property standards.

    Sections 34.21 through 34.25 set forth uniform standards for 
management, use, and disposition of property. DoD Components shall 
encourage recipients to use existing property-management systems, to the 
extent that the systems meet these minimum requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 34.21  Real property and equipment.

    (a) Prior approval for acquisition with Federal funds. Recipients 
may purchase real property or equipment in whole or in part with Federal 
funds under an award only with the prior approval of the grants officer.
    (b) Title. Title to such real property or equipment shall vest in 
the recipient upon acquisition. Unless a statute specifically authorizes 
a DoD Component to vest title in the recipient without further 
obligation to the Government, and the DoD Component elects to do so, the 
title shall be a conditional title. Title shall vest in the recipient 
subject to the conditions that the recipient:
    (1) Use the real property or equipment for the authorized purposes 
of the project until funding for the project ceases, or until the 
property is no longer needed for the purposes of the project.
    (2) Not encumber the property without approval of the grants 
officer.
    (3) Use and dispose of the property in accordance with paragraphs 
(d) and (e) of this section.
    (c) Federal interest in real property or equipment offered as cost-
share. A recipient may offer the full value of real property or 
equipment that is purchased with recipient's funds or that is donated by 
a third party to meet a portion of any required cost sharing or 
matching, subject to the prior approval requirement in Sec. 
34.13(a)(7). If a recipient does so, the Government has a financial 
interest in the property, a share of the property value attributable to 
the Federal participation in the project. The property therefore shall 
be considered as if it had been acquired in part with Federal funds, and 
shall be subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2) and 
(b)(3) of this section, and to the provisions of Sec. 34.23.
    (d) Use. If real property or equipment is acquired in whole or in 
part with Federal funds under an award, and the

[[Page 213]]

award provides that title vests conditionally in the recipient, the real 
property or equipment is subject to the following:
    (1) During the time that the real property or equipment is used on 
the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient shall 
make it available for use on other projects or programs, if such other 
use will not interfere with the work on the project or program for which 
the real property or equipment was originally acquired. Use of the real 
property or equipment on other projects will be in the following order 
of priority:
    (i) Activities sponsored by DoD Components' grants, cooperative 
agreements, or other assistance awards;
    (ii) Activities sponsored by other Federal agencies' grants, 
cooperative agreements, or other assistance awards;
    (iii) Activities under Federal procurement contracts, or activities 
not sponsored by any Federal agency. If so used, use charges shall be 
assessed to those activities. For real property or equipment, the use 
charges shall be at rates equivalent to those for which comparable real 
property or equipment may be leased. The use charges shall be treated as 
program income.
    (2) After Federal funding for the project ceases, or when the real 
property or equipment is no longer needed for the purposes of the 
project, the recipient may use the real property or equipment for other 
projects, insofar as:
    (i) There are Federally sponsored projects for which the real 
property or equipment may be used. If the only use for the real property 
or equipment is for projects that have no Federal sponsorship, the 
recipient shall proceed with disposition of the real property or 
equipment, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
    (ii) The recipient obtains written approval from the grants officer 
to do so. The grants officer shall ensure that there is a formal change 
of accountability for the real property or equipment to a currently 
funded, Federal award.
    (iii) The recipient's use of the real property or equipment for 
other projects is in the same order of priority as described in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (e) Disposition. (1) When an item of real property or equipment is 
no longer needed for Federally sponsored projects, the recipient shall 
proceed as follows:
    (i) If the property that is no longer needed is equipment (rather 
than real property), the recipient may wish to replace it with an item 
that is needed currently for the project. In that case, the recipient 
may use the original equipment as trade-in or sell it and use the 
proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment, subject to 
the approval of the responsible agency (i.e., the DoD Component or the 
Federal agency to which the DoD Component delegated responsibility for 
administering the equipment).
    (ii) The recipient may elect to retain title, without further 
obligation to the Federal Government, by compensating the Federal 
Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the 
real property or equipment that is attributable to the Federal 
participation in the project.
    (iii) If the recipient does not elect to retain title to real 
property or equipment (see paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section), or 
request approval to use equipment as trade-in or offset for replacement 
equipment (see paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section), the recipient shall 
request disposition instructions from the responsible agency.
    (2) If a recipient requests disposition instructions, in accordance 
with paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section, the responsible grants 
officer shall:
    (i) For equipment (but not real property), consult with the Federal 
program manager and judge whether the age and nature of the equipment 
warrant a screening procedure, to determine whether the equipment is 
useful to a DoD Component or other Federal agency. If a screening 
procedure is warranted, the responsible agency shall determine whether 
the equipment can be used to meet a DoD Component's requirement. If no 
DoD requirement is found, the responsible agency shall report the 
availability of the equipment

[[Page 214]]

to the General Services Administration, to determine whether a 
requirement for the equipment exists in other Federal agencies.
    (ii) For either real property or equipment, issue instructions to 
the recipient for disposition of the property no later than 120 calendar 
days after the recipient's request. The grants officer's options for 
disposition are to direct the recipient to:
    (A) Transfer title to the real property or equipment to the Federal 
Government or to an eligible third party provided that, in such cases, 
the recipient shall be entitled to compensation for its attributable 
percentage of the current fair market value of the real property or 
equipment, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs 
incurred. If title is transferred to the Federal Government, it shall be 
subject thereafter to provisions for Federally owned property in Sec. 
34.22.
    (B) Sell the real property or equipment and pay the Federal 
Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the 
property that is attributable to the Federal participation in the 
project (after deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up 
expenses, if any, from the sale proceeds). When the recipient is 
authorized or required to sell the real property or equipment, proper 
sales procedures shall be established that provide for competition to 
the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.
    (3) If the responsible agency fails to issue disposition 
instructions within 120 calendar days of the recipient's request, as 
described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, the recipient shall 
dispose of the real property or equipment through the option described 
in paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 34.22  Federally owned property.

    (a) Annual inventory. Recipients shall submit annually an inventory 
listing of all Federally owned property in their custody (property 
furnished by the Federal Government, rather than acquired by the 
recipient with Federal funds under the award), to the DoD Component or 
other Federal agency responsible for administering the property under 
the award.
    (b) Use on other activities. (1) Use of federally owned property on 
other activities is permissible, if authorized by the DoD Component 
responsible for administering the award to which the property currently 
is charged.
    (2) Use on other activities will be in the following order of 
priority:
    (i) Activities sponsored by DoD Components' grants, cooperative 
agreements, or other assistance awards;
    (ii) Activities sponsored by other Federal agencies' grants, 
cooperative agreements, or other assistance awards;
    (iii) Activities under Federal procurement contracts, or activities 
not sponsored by any Federal agency. If so used, use charges shall be 
assessed to those activities. For real property or equipment, the use 
charges shall be at rates equivalent to those for which comparable real 
property or equipment may be leased. The use charges shall be treated as 
program income.
    (c) Disposition of property. Upon completion of the award, the 
recipient shall report the property to the responsible agency. The 
agency may:
    (1) Use the property to meet another Federal Government need (e.g, 
by transferring accountability for the property to another Federal award 
to the same recipient, or by directing the recipient to transfer the 
property to a Federal agency that needs the property, or to another 
recipient with a currently funded award).
    (2) Declare the property to be excess property and either:
    (i) Report the property to the General Services Administration, in 
accordance with the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 
1949 (40 U.S.C. 483(b)(2)), as implemented by General Services 
Administration regulations at 41 CFR 101-47.202; or
    (ii) Dispose of the property by alternative methods, if there is 
statutory authority to do so (e.g., DoD Components are authorized by 15 
U.S.C. 3710(i), the Federal Technology Transfer Act, to donate research 
equipment to educational and nonprofit organizations for the conduct of 
technical and

[[Page 215]]

scientific education and research activities. Such donations shall be in 
accordance with the DoD implementation of E.O. 12999 (3 CFR, 1996 Comp., 
p. 180), ``Educational Technology: Ensuring Opportunity for All Children 
in the Next Century,'' as applicable.) Appropriate instructions shall be 
issued to the recipient by the responsible agency.


<R05>
Sec. 34.23  Property management system.

    The recipient's property management system shall include the 
following, for property that is Federally owned, and for equipment that 
is acquired in whole or in part with Federal funds, or that is used as 
matching share:
    (a) Property records shall be maintained, to include the following 
information:
    (1) A description of the property.
    (2) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock 
number, national stock number, or any other identification number.
    (3) Source of the property, including the award number.
    (4) Whether title vests in the recipient or the Federal Government.
    (5) Acquisition date (or date received, if the property was 
furnished by the Federal Government) and cost.
    (6) Information from which one can calculate the percentage of 
Federal participation in the cost of the property (not applicable to 
property furnished by the Federal Government).
    (7) The location and condition of the property and the date the 
information was reported.
    (8) Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales 
price or the method used to determine current fair market value where a 
recipient compensates the Federal Government for its share.
    (b) Federally owned equipment shall be marked, to indicate Federal 
ownership.
    (c) A physical inventory shall be taken and the results reconciled 
with the property records at least once every two years. Any differences 
between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown 
in the accounting records shall be investigated to determine the causes 
of the difference. The recipient shall, in connection with the 
inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need 
for the property.
    (d) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate 
safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the property. Any loss, 
damage, or theft of property shall be investigated and fully documented; 
if the property was owned by the Federal Government, the recipient shall 
promptly notify the Federal agency responsible for administering the 
property.
    (e) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the 
property in good condition.


<R05>
Sec. 34.24  Supplies.

    (a) Title shall vest in the recipient upon acquisition for supplies 
acquired with Federal funds under an award.
    (b) Upon termination or completion of the project or program, the 
recipient shall retain any unused supplies. If the inventory of unused 
supplies exceeds $5,000 in total aggregate value and the items are not 
needed for any other Federally sponsored project or program, the 
recipient shall retain the items for use on non-Federal sponsored 
activities or sell them, but shall, in either case, compensate the 
Federal Government for its share.


<R05>
Sec. 34.25  Intellectual property developed or produced under awards.

    (a) Patents. Grants and cooperative agreements with:
    (1) Small business concerns shall comply with 35 U.S.C. Chapter 18, 
as implemented by 37 CFR part 401, which applies to inventions made 
under grants and cooperative agreements with small business concerns for 
research and development. 37 CFR 401.14 provides a standard clause that 
is required in such grants and cooperative agreements in most cases, 37 
CFR 401.3 specifies when the clause shall be included, and 37 CFR 401.5 
specifies how the clause may be modified and tailored.
    (2) For-profit organizations other than small business concerns 
shall comply with 35 U.S.C. 210(c) and Executive Order 12591 (3 CFR, 
1987 Comp., p. 220) (which codifies a Presidential Memorandum on 
Government Patent Policy, dated February 18, 1983).

[[Page 216]]

    (i) The Executive order states that, as a matter of policy, grants 
and cooperative agreements should grant to all for-profit organizations, 
regardless of size, title to patents made in whole or in part with 
Federal funds, in exchange for royalty-free use by or on behalf of the 
Government (i.e., it extends the applicability of 35 U.S.C. Chapter 18, 
to the extent permitted by law, to for-profit organizations other than 
small business concerns).
    (ii) 35 U.S.C. 210(c) states that 35 U.S.C. Chapter 18 is not 
intended to limit agencies' authority to agree to the disposition of 
rights in inventions in accordance with the Presidential memorandum 
codified by the Executive order. It also states that such grants and 
cooperative agreements shall provide for Government license rights 
required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(4) and march-in rights required by 35 
U.S.C. 203.
    (b) Copyright, data and software rights. Requirements concerning 
data and software rights are as follows:
    (1) The recipient may copyright any work that is subject to 
copyright and was developed under an award. DoD Components reserve a 
royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish, 
or otherwise use the work for Federal purposes, and to authorize others 
to do so.
    (2) Unless waived by the DoD Component making the award, the Federal 
Government has the right to:
    (i) Obtain, reproduce, publish or otherwise use for Federal 
Government purposes the data first produced under an award.
    (ii) Authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise 
use such data for Federal purposes.

                          Procurement Standards


<R05>
Sec. 34.30  Purpose of procurement standards.

    Section 34.31 sets forth requirements necessary to ensure:
    (a) Compliance of recipients' procurements that use Federal funds 
with applicable Federal statutes and executive orders.
    (b) Proper stewardship of Federal funds used in recipients' 
procurements.


<R05>
Sec. 34.31  Requirements.

    The following requirements pertain to recipients' procurements 
funded in whole or in part with Federal funds or with recipients' cost-
share or match:
    (a) Reasonable cost. Recipients procurement procedures shall make 
maximum practicable use of competition, or shall use other means that 
ensure reasonable cost for procured goods and services.
    (b) Pre-award review of certain procurements. Prior to awarding a 
procurement contract under an award, a recipient may be required to 
provide the grants officer administering the award with pre-award 
documents (e.g., requests for proposals, invitations for bids, or 
independent cost estimates) related to the procurement. Recipients will 
only be required to provide such documents for the grants officer's pre-
award review in exceptional cases where the grants officer judges that 
there is a compelling need to do so. In such cases, the grants officer 
must include a provision in the award that states the requirement.
    (c) Contract provisions. (1) Contracts in excess of the simplified 
acquisition threshold shall contain contractual provisions or conditions 
that allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in 
instances in which a contractor violates or breaches the contract terms, 
and provide for such remedial actions as may be appropriate.
    (2) All contracts in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold 
shall contain suitable provisions for termination for default by the 
recipient or for termination due to circumstances beyond the control of 
the contractor.
    (3) All negotiated contracts in excess of the simplified acquisition 
threshold shall include a provision permitting access of the Department 
of Defense, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of 
their duly authorized representatives, to any books, documents, papers, 
and records of the contractor that are directly pertinent to a specific 
program, for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts, and 
transcriptions.
    (4) All contracts, including those for amounts less than the 
simplified acquisition threshold, awarded by recipients and their 
contractors shall contain the

[[Page 217]]

procurement provisions of Appendix A to this part, as applicable.

                           Reports and Records


<R05>
Sec. 34.40  Purpose of reports and records.

    Sections 34.41 and 34.42 prescribe requirements for monitoring and 
reporting financial and program performance and for records retention.


<R05>
Sec. 34.41  Monitoring and reporting program and financial performance.

    Grants officers may use the provisions of 32 CFR 32.51 and 32.52 for 
awards to for-profit organizations, or may include equivalent technical 
and financial reporting requirements that ensure reasonable oversight of 
the expenditure of appropriated funds. As a minimum, equivalent 
requirements must include:
    (a) Periodic reports (at least annually, and no more frequently than 
quarterly) addressing both program status and business status, as 
follows:
    (1) The program portions of the reports must address progress toward 
achieving program performance goals, including current issues, problems, 
or developments.
    (2) The business portions of the reports shall provide summarized 
details on the status of resources (federal funds and non-federal cost 
sharing or matching), including an accounting of expenditures for the 
period covered by the report. The report should compare the resource 
status with any payment and expenditure schedules or plans provided in 
the original award; explain any major deviations from those schedules; 
and discuss actions that will be taken to address the deviations.
    (3) When grants officers previously authorized advance payments, 
pursuant to Sec. 34.12(a)(2), they should consult with the program 
official and consider whether program progress reported in the periodic 
report, in relation to reported expenditures, is sufficient to justify 
continued authorization of advance payments.
    (b) Unless inappropriate, a final performance report that addresses 
all major accomplishments under the award.


<R05>
Sec. 34.42  Retention and access requirements for records.

    (a) This section sets forth requirements for records retention and 
access to records for awards to recipients.
    (b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, 
and all other records pertinent to an award shall be retained for a 
period of three years from the date of submission of the final 
expenditure report. The only exceptions are the following:
    (1) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the 
expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall be retained until all 
litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been 
resolved and final action taken.
    (2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal 
funds shall be retained for 3 years after final disposition.
    (3) When records are transferred to or maintained by the DoD 
Component that made the award, the 3-year retention requirement is not 
applicable to the recipient.
    (4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, and 
related records, for which retention requirements are specified in Sec. 
34.42(g).
    (c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original 
records if authorized by the grants officer.
    (d) The grants officer shall request that recipients transfer 
certain records to DoD Component custody when he or she determines that 
the records possess long term retention value. However, in order to 
avoid duplicate recordkeeping, a grants officer may make arrangements 
for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for 
joint use.
    (e) DoD Components, the Inspector General, Comptroller General of 
the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, have 
the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents, 
papers, or other records of recipients that are pertinent to the awards, 
in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, transcripts and copies 
of such documents. This right also includes timely and reasonable access 
to a recipient's personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion 
related to such documents.

[[Page 218]]

The rights of access in this paragraph are not limited to the required 
retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained.
    (f) Unless required by statute, no DoD Component shall place 
restrictions on recipients that limit public access to the records of 
recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when the DoD Component 
can demonstrate that such records shall be kept confidential and would 
have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records had belonged to the DoD 
Component making the award.
    (g) Indirect cost proposals, cost allocation plans, and other cost 
accounting documents (such as documents related to computer usage 
chargeback rates), along with their supporting records, shall be 
retained for a 3-year period, as follows:
    (1) If a recipient is required to submit an indirect-cost proposal, 
cost allocation plan, or other computation to the cognizant Federal 
agency, for purposes of negotiating an indirect cost rate or other 
rates, the 3-year retention period starts on the date of the submission. 
This retention requirement also applies to subrecipients submitting 
similar documents for negotiation to the recipient.
    (2) If the recipient or the subrecipient is not required to submit 
the documents or supporting records for negotiating an indirect cost 
rate or other rates, the 3-year retention period for the documents and 
records starts at the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting 
period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.
    (h) If the information described in this section is maintained on a 
computer, recipients shall retain the computer data on a reliable medium 
for the time periods prescribed. Recipients may transfer computer data 
in machine readable form from one reliable computer medium to another. 
Recipients' computer data retention and transfer procedures shall 
maintain the integrity, reliability, and security of the original 
computer data. Recipients shall also maintain an audit trail describing 
the data transfer. For the record retention time periods prescribed in 
this section, recipients shall not destroy, discard, delete, or write 
over such computer data.

                       Termination and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 34.50  Purpose of termination and enforcement.

    Sections 34.51 through 34.53 set forth uniform procedures for 
suspension, termination, enforcement, and disputes.


<R05>
Sec. 34.51  Termination.

    (a) Awards may be terminated in whole or in part only in accordance 
with one of the following:
    (1) By the grants officer, if a recipient materially fails to comply 
with the terms and conditions of an award.
    (2) By the grants officer with the consent of the recipient, in 
which case the two parties shall agree upon the termination conditions, 
including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, 
the portion to be terminated.
    (3) By the recipient upon sending to the grants officer written 
notification setting forth the reasons for such termination, the 
effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to 
be terminated. The recipient must provide such notice at least 30 
calendar days prior to the effective date of the termination. However, 
if the grants officer determines in the case of partial termination that 
the reduced or modified portion of the award will not accomplish the 
purposes for which the award was made, he or she may terminate the award 
in its entirety.
    (b) If costs are allowed under an award, the responsibilities of the 
recipient referred to in Sec. 34.61(b), including those for property 
management as applicable, shall be considered in the termination of the 
award, and provision shall be made for continuing responsibilities of 
the recipient after termination, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 34.52  Enforcement.

    (a) Remedies for noncompliance. If a recipient materially fails to 
comply with the terms and conditions of an award, whether stated in a 
Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, 
the grants officer may,

[[Page 219]]

in addition to imposing any of the special conditions outlined in Sec. 
34.4, take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the 
circumstances:
    (1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the 
deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement action by the 
grants officer and DoD Component.
    (2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable 
matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action 
not in compliance.
    (3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award. In the 
case of termination, the recipient will be reimbursed for allowable 
costs incurred prior to termination, with the possible exception of 
those for activities and actions described in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section.
    (4) Withhold further awards for the project or program.
    (5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.
    (b) Hearings and appeals. In taking an enforcement action, the 
grants officer and DoD Component shall provide the recipient an 
opportunity for hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to 
which the recipient is entitled under any statute or regulation 
applicable to the action involved (see Sec. 34.53 and 32 CFR 22.815).
    (c) Effects of suspension and termination. Costs of a recipient 
resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension 
or after termination of an award are not allowable unless the grants 
officer expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or 
termination or subsequently. Other recipient costs during suspension or 
after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are 
allowable if the costs:
    (1) Result from obligations which were properly incurred by the 
recipient before the effective date of suspension or termination, are 
not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are 
noncancellable; and
    (2) Would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired 
normally at the end of the funding period in which the termination takes 
effect.
    (d) Relationship to debarment and suspension. The enforcement 
remedies identified in this section, including suspension and 
termination, do not preclude a recipient from being subject to debarment 
and suspension under 32 CFR part 25.


<R05>
Sec. 34.53  Disputes and appeals.

    Recipients have the right to appeal certain decisions by grants 
officers. In resolving such issues, DoD policy is to use Alternative 
Dispute Resolution (ADR) techniques, to the maximum practicable extent. 
See 32 CFR 22.815 for standards for DoD Components' dispute resolution 
and formal, administrative appeal procedures.


<R04>
                 Subpart C_After-the-Award Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 34.60  Purpose.

    Sections 34.61 through 34.63 contain procedures for closeout and for 
subsequent disallowances and adjustments.


<R05>
Sec. 34.61  Closeout procedures.

    (a) The cognizant grants officer shall, at least six months prior to 
the expiration date of the award, contact the recipient to establish:
    (1) All steps needed to close out the award, including submission of 
financial and performance reports, liquidation of obligations, and 
decisions on property disposition.
    (2) A schedule for completing those steps.
    (b) The following provisions shall apply to the closeout:
    (1) The responsible grants officer and payment office shall expedite 
completion of steps needed to close out awards and make prompt, final 
payments to a recipient for allowable reimbursable costs under the award 
being closed out.
    (2) The recipient shall promptly refund any unobligated balances of 
cash that the DoD Component has advanced or paid and that is not 
authorized to be retained by the recipient for use in other projects. 
For unreturned amounts that become delinquent debts, see 32 CFR 22.820.
    (3) When authorized by the terms and conditions of the award, the 
grants officer shall make a settlement for any upward or downward 
adjustments to the Federal share of costs after closeout reports are 
received.

[[Page 220]]

    (4) The recipient shall account for any real property and personal 
property acquired with Federal funds or received from the Federal 
Government in accordance with Sec. Sec. 34.21 through 34.25.
    (5) If a final audit is required and has not been performed prior to 
the closeout of an award, the DoD Component shall retain the right to 
recover an appropriate amount after fully considering the 
recommendations on disallowed costs resulting from the final audit.


<R05>
Sec. 34.62  Subsequent adjustments and continuing responsibilities.

    (a) The closeout of an award does not affect any of the following:
    (1) The right of the Department of Defense to disallow costs and 
recover funds on the basis of a later audit or other review.
    (2) The obligation of the recipient to return any funds due as a 
result of later refunds, corrections, or other transactions.
    (3) Audit requirements in Sec. 34.16.
    (4) Property management requirements in Sec. Sec. 34.21 through 
34.25.
    (5) Records retention as required in Sec. 34.42.
    (b) After closeout of an award, a relationship created under an 
award may be modified or ended in whole or in part with the consent of 
the grants officer and the recipient, provided the responsibilities of 
the recipient referred to in Sec. 34.61(a), including those for 
property management as applicable, are considered and provisions made 
for continuing responsibilities of the recipient, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 34.63  Collection of amounts due.

    Any funds paid to a recipient in excess of the amount to which the 
recipient is finally determined to be entitled under the terms and 
conditions of the award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. 
Procedures for issuing the demand for payment and pursuing 
administrative offset and other remedies are described in 32 CFR 22.820.

               Appendix A to Part 34--Contract Provisions

    All contracts awarded by a recipient, including those for amounts 
less than the simplified acquisition threshold, shall contain the 
following provisions as applicable:
    1. Equal Employment Opportunity--All contracts shall contain a 
provision requiring compliance with E.O. 11246 (3 CFR, 1964-1965 Comp., 
p. 339), ``Equal Employment Opportunity,'' as amended by E.O. 11375 (3 
CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 684), ``Amending Executive Order 11246 Relating 
to Equal Employment Opportunity,'' and as supplemented by regulations at 
41 CFR chapter 60, ``Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, 
Equal Employment Opportunity, Department of Labor.''
    2. Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18 U.S.C. 874 and 40 U.S.C. 
276c)--All contracts and subawards in excess of $2000 for construction 
or repair awarded by recipients and subrecipients shall include a 
provision for compliance with the Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18 
U.S.C. 874), as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR 
part 3, ``Contractors and Subcontractors on Public Building or Public 
Work Financed in Whole or in Part by Loans or Grants from the United 
States''). The Act provides that each contractor or subrecipient shall 
be prohibited from inducing, by any means, any person employed in the 
construction, completion, or repair of public work, to give up any part 
of the compensation to which he is otherwise entitled. The recipient 
shall report all suspected or reported violations to the responsible DoD 
Component.
    3. Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-
333)--Where applicable, all contracts awarded by recipients in excess of 
$100,000 for construction and other purposes that involve the employment 
of mechanics or laborers shall include a provision for compliance with 
Sections 102 and 107 of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act 
(40 U.S.C. 327-333), as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations 
(29 CFR part 5). Under Section 102 of the Act, each contractor shall be 
required to compute the wages of every mechanic and laborer on the basis 
of a standard work week of 40 hours. Work in excess of the standard work 
week is permissible provided that the worker is compensated at a rate of 
not less than 1\1/2\ times the basic rate of pay for all hours worked in 
excess of 40 hours in the work week. Section 107 of the Act is 
applicable to construction work and provides that no laborer or mechanic 
shall be required to work in surroundings or under working conditions 
which are unsanitary, hazardous or dangerous. These requirements do not 
apply to the purchases of supplies or materials or articles ordinarily 
available on the open market, or contracts for transportation or 
transmission of intelligence.
    4. Rights to Inventions Made Under a Contract, Grant or Cooperative 
Agreement--Contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements for

[[Page 221]]

the performance of experimental, developmental, or research work shall 
provide for the rights of the Federal Government and the recipient in 
any resulting invention in accordance with 37 CFR part 401, ``Rights to 
Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms 
Under Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements.''
    5. Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) and the Federal Water 
Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), as amended--Contracts 
and subawards of amounts in excess of $100,000 shall contain a provision 
that requires the recipient to agree to comply with all applicable 
standards, orders or regulations issued pursuant to the Clean Air Act 
(42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as 
amended (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). Violations shall be reported to the 
responsible DoD Component and the Regional Office of the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA).
    6. Byrd Anti-Lobbying Amendment (31 U.S.C. 1352)--Contractors who 
apply or bid for an award of $100,000 or more shall file the required 
certification. Each tier certifies to the tier above that it will not 
and has not used Federal appropriated funds to pay any person or 
organization for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or 
employee of any agency, a member of Congress, officer or employee of 
Congress, or an employee of a member of Congress in connection with 
obtaining any Federal contract, grant or any other award covered by 31 
U.S.C. 1352. Each tier shall also disclose any lobbying with non-Federal 
funds that takes place in connection with obtaining any Federal award. 
Such disclosures are forwarded from tier to tier up to the recipient.
    7. Debarment and Suspension (E.O.s 12549 and 12689)--Contract awards 
that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and certain other 
contract awards shall not be made to parties listed on nonprocurement 
portion of the General Services Administration's Lists of Parties 
Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs in

<R04>
                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 37.100  What does this part do?

    This part establishes uniform policies and procedures for the DoD 
Components' award and administration of technology investment agreements 
(TIAs).


<R05>
Sec. 37.105  Does this part cover all types of instruments that 10 
U.S.C. 2371 authorizes?

    No, this part covers only TIAs, some of which use the authority of 
10 U.S.C. 2371 (see appendix B to this part). This part does not cover 
assistance instruments other than TIAs that use the authority of 10 
U.S.C. 2371. It also does not cover acquisition agreements for prototype 
projects that use 10 U.S.C. 2371 authority augmented by the authority in 
section 845 of Public Law 103-160, as amended.


<R05>
Sec. 37.110  What type of instruments are technology investment 
agreements (TIAs)?

    TIAs are assistance instruments used to stimulate or support 
research. As discussed in appendix B to this part, a TIA may be either a 
kind of cooperative agreement or a type of assistance transaction other 
than a grant or cooperative agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 37.115  For what purposes are TIAs used?

    The ultimate goal for using TIAs, like other assistance instruments 
used in defense research programs, is to foster the best technologies 
for future defense needs. TIAs differ from and complement other 
assistance instruments available to agreements officers, in that TIAs 
address the goal by fostering civil-military integration (see appendix A 
to this part). TIAs therefore are designed to:
    (a) Reduce barriers to commercial firms' participation in defense 
research, to give the Department of Defense (DoD) access to the broadest 
possible technology and industrial base.
    (b) Promote new relationships among performers in both the defense 
and commercial sectors of that technology and industrial base.
    (c) Stimulate performers to develop, use, and disseminate improved 
practices.


<R05>
Sec. 37.120  Can my organization award or administer TIAs?

    Your office may award or administer TIAs if it has a delegation of 
the authorities in 10 U.S.C. 2371, as well as 10 U.S.C. 2358. If your 
office is in a Military Department, it must have a delegation of the 
authority of the Secretary of that Military Department under those 
statutes. If your office is in a Defense Agency, it must have a 
delegation of the authority of the Secretary of Defense under 10 U.S.C. 
2358 and 2371. Your office needs those authorities to be able to:

[[Page 225]]

    (a) Enter into cooperative agreements to stimulate or support 
research, using the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2358, as well as assistance 
transactions other than grants or cooperative agreements, using the 
authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371. The reason that both authorities are needed 
is that a TIA, depending upon its patent rights provision (see appendix 
B to this part), may be either a cooperative agreement or a type of 
assistance transaction other than a grant or cooperative agreement.
    (b) Recover funds from a recipient and reuse the funds for program 
purposes, as authorized by 10 U.S.C. 2371 and described in Sec. 37.580.
    (c) Exempt certain information received from proposers from 
disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, as authorized by 10 
U.S.C. 2371 and described in Sec. 37.420.


<R05>
Sec. 37.125  May I award or administer TIAs if I am authorized to award 
or administer other assistance instruments?

    (a) You must have specific authorization to award or administer 
TIAs. Being authorized to award or administer grants and cooperative 
agreements is not sufficient; a grants officer is an agreements officer 
only if the statement of appointment also authorizes the award or 
administration of TIAs.
    (b) You receive that authorization in the same way that you receive 
authority to award other assistance instruments, as described in 32 CFR 
21.425 and 21.435 through 21.445.


<R05>
Sec. 37.130  Which other parts of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations 
apply to TIAs?

    (a) TIAs are explicitly covered in this part and part 21 of the DoD 
Grant and Agreement Regulations (DoDGARs). Part 21 (32 CFR part 21) 
addresses deviation procedures and other general matters that relate to 
the DoDGARs, to DoD Components' authorities and responsibilities for 
assistance instruments, and to requirements for reporting information 
about assistance awards.
    (b) Two additional parts of the DoDGARs apply to TIAs, although they 
do not mention TIAs explicitly. They are:
    (1) Part 25 (32 CFR part 25), on debarment, suspension, and drug-
free workplace requirements, which applies because it covers 
nonprocurement instruments in general; and
    (2) Part 28 (32 CFR part 28), on lobbying restrictions, which 
applies by law (31 U.S.C. 1352) to TIAs that are cooperative agreements 
and as a matter of DoD policy to all other TIAs.
    (c) Portions of four other DoDGARs parts apply to TIAs only as cited 
by reference in this part. Those parts of the DoDGARs are parts 22, 32, 
33, and 34 (32 CFR parts 22, 32, 33, and 34).


<R04>
      Subpart B_Appropriate Use of Technology Investment Agreements


<R05>
Sec. 37.200  What are my responsibilities as an agreements officer for 
ensuring the appropriate use of TIAs?

    You must ensure that you use TIAs only in appropriate situations. To 
do so, you must conclude that the use of a TIA is justified based on:
    (a) The nature of the project, as discussed in Sec. 37.205;
    (b) The type of recipient, addressed in Sec. 37.210;
    (c) The recipient's commitment and cost sharing, as described in 
Sec. 37.215;
    (d) The degree of involvement of the Government program official, as 
discussed in Sec. 37.220; and
    (e) Your judgment that the use of a TIA could benefit defense 
research objectives in ways that likely would not happen if another type 
of assistance instrument were used. Your answers to the four questions 
in Sec. 37.225 should be the basis for your judgment.


<R05>
Sec. 37.205  What judgments must I make about the nature of the project?

    You must:
    (a) Conclude that the principal purpose of the project is 
stimulation or support of research (i.e., assistance), rather than 
acquiring goods or services for the benefit of the Government (i.e., 
acquisition);
    (b) Decide that the basic, applied, or advanced research project is 
relevant to the policy objective of civil-military integration (see 
appendix A of this part); and

[[Page 226]]

    (c) Ensure that, to the maximum extent practicable, any TIA that 
uses the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371 (see appendix B of this part) does 
not support research that duplicates other research being conducted 
under existing programs carried out by the Department of Defense. This 
is a statutory requirement of 10 U.S.C. 2371.
    (d) When your TIA is a type of assistance transaction other than a 
grant or cooperative agreement, satisfy the condition in 10 U.S.C. 2371 
to judge that the use of a standard grant or cooperative agreement for 
the research project is not feasible or appropriate. As discussed in 
appendix B to this part:
    (1) This situation arises if your TIA includes a patent provision 
that is less restrictive than is possible under the Bayh-Dole statute 
(because the patent provision is what distinguishes a TIA that is a 
cooperative agreement from a TIA that is an assistance transaction other 
than a grant or cooperative agreement).
    (2) You satisfy the requirement to judge that a standard cooperative 
agreement is not feasible or appropriate when you judge that execution 
of the research project warrants a less restrictive patent provision 
than is possible under Bayh-Dole.


<R05>
Sec. 37.210  To what types of recipients may I award a TIA?

    (a) As a matter of DoD policy, you may award a TIA only when one or 
more for-profit firms are to be involved either in the:
    (1) Performance of the research project; or
    (2) The commercial application of the research results. In that 
case, you must determine that the nonprofit performer has at least a 
tentative agreement with specific for-profit partners who plan on being 
involved when there are results to transition. You should review the 
agreement between the nonprofit and for-profit partners, because the 
for-profit partners' involvement is the basis for using a TIA rather 
than another type of assistance instrument.
    (b) Consistent with the goals of civil-military integration, TIAs 
are most appropriate when one or more commercial firms (as defined at 
Sec. 37.1250) are to be involved in the project.
    (c) You are encouraged to make awards to consortia (a consortium may 
include one or more for-profit firms, as well as State or local 
government agencies, institutions of higher education, or other 
nonprofit organizations). The reasons are that:
    (1) When multiple performers are participating as a consortium, they 
are more equal partners in the research performance than usually is the 
case with a prime recipient and subawards. All of them therefore are 
more likely to be directly involved in developing and revising plans for 
the research effort, reviewing technical progress, and overseeing 
financial and other business matters. That feature makes consortia well 
suited to building new relationships among performers in the defense and 
commercial sectors of the technology and industrial base, a principal 
objective for the use of TIAs.
    (2) In addition, interactions among the participants within a 
consortium potentially provide a self-governance mechanism. The 
potential for additional self-governance is particularly good when a 
consortium includes multiple for-profit participants that normally are 
competitors within an industry.
    (d) TIAs also may be used for carrying out research performed by 
single firms or multiple performers in prime award-subaward 
relationships. In awarding TIAs in those cases, however, you should 
consider providing for greater involvement of the program official or a 
way to increase self-governance (e.g., a prime award with multiple 
subawards arranged so as to give the subrecipients more insight into and 
authority and responsibility for programmatic and business aspects of 
the overall project than they usually have).


<R05>
Sec. 37.215  What must I conclude about the recipient's commitment 
and cost sharing?

    (a) You should judge that the recipient has a strong commitment to 
and self-interest in the success of the project. You should find 
evidence of that commitment and interest in the proposal, in the 
recipient's management plan, or through other means. A

[[Page 227]]

recipient's self-interest might be driven, for example, by a research 
project's potential for fostering technology to be incorporated into 
products and processes for the commercial marketplace.
    (b) You must seek cost sharing. The purpose of cost share is to 
ensure that the recipient incurs real risk that gives it a vested 
interest in the project's success; the willingness to commit to 
meaningful cost sharing therefore is one good indicator of a recipient's 
self-interest. The requirements are that:
    (1) To the maximum extent practicable, the non-Federal parties 
carrying out a research project under a TIA are to provide at least half 
of the costs of the project. Obtaining this cost sharing, to the maximum 
extent practicable, is a statutory condition for any TIA under the 
authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371, and is a matter of DoD policy for all other 
TIAs.
    (2) The parties must provide the cost sharing from non-Federal 
resources that are available to them unless there is specific authority 
to use other Federal resources for that purpose (see Sec. 37.530(f)).
    (c) You may consider whether cost sharing is impracticable in a 
given case, unless there is a non-waivable, statutory requirement for 
cost sharing that applies to the particular program under which the 
award is to be made. Before deciding that cost sharing is impracticable, 
you should carefully consider whether there are other factors that 
demonstrate the recipient's self-interest in the success of the current 
project.


<R05>
Sec. 37.220  How involved should the Government program official be 
in the project?

    (a) TIAs are used to carry out cooperative relationships between the 
Federal Government and the recipient, which requires a greater level of 
involvement of the Government program official in the execution of the 
research than the usual oversight of a research grant or procurement 
contract. For example, program officials will participate in recipients' 
periodic reviews of research progress and will be substantially involved 
with the recipients in the resulting revisions of plans for future 
effort. That increased programmatic involvement before and during 
program execution with a TIA can reduce the need for some Federal 
financial requirements that are problematic for commercial firms.
    (b) Some aspects of their involvement require program officials to 
have greater knowledge about and participation in business matters that 
traditionally would be your exclusive responsibility as the agreements 
officer. TIAs therefore also require closer cooperation between program 
officials and you, as the one who decides business matters.


<R05>
Sec. 37.225  What judgment must I make about the benefits of using a TIA?

    Before deciding that a TIA is appropriate, you also must judge that 
using a TIA could benefit defense research objectives in ways that 
likely would not happen if another type of assistance instrument were 
used (e.g., a cooperative agreement subject to all of the requirements 
of 32 CFR part 34). You, in conjunction with Government program 
officials, must consider the questions in paragraphs (a) through (d) of 
this section, to help identify the benefits that may justify using a TIA 
and reducing some of the usual requirements. In accordance with Sec. 
37.1030, you will report your answers to these questions to help the DoD 
measure the Department-wide benefits of using TIAs and meet requirements 
to report to the Congress. Note that you must give full concise answers 
only to questions that relate to the benefits that you perceive for 
using the TIA, rather than another type of funding instrument, for the 
particular research project. A simple ``no'' or ``not applicable'' is a 
sufficient response for other questions. The questions are:
    (a) Will the use of a TIA permit the involvement in the research of 
any commercial firms or business units of firms that would not otherwise 
participate in the project? If so:
    (1) What are the expected benefits of those firms' or divisions' 
participation (e.g., is there a specific technology that could be 
better, more readily available, or less expensive)?
    (2) Why would they not participate if an instrument other than a TIA 
were

[[Page 228]]

used? You should identify specific provisions of the TIA or features of 
the TIA award process that enable their participation.
    (b) Will the use of a TIA allow the creation of new relationships 
among participants at the prime or subtier levels, among business units 
of the same firm, or between non-Federal participants and the Federal 
Government that will help the DoD get better technology in the future? 
If so:
    (1) Why do these new relationships have the potential for helping 
the DoD get technology in the future that is better, more affordable, or 
more readily available?
    (2) Are there provisions of the TIA or features of the TIA award 
process that enable these relationships to form? If so, you should be 
able to identify specifically what they are. If not, you should be able 
to explain specifically why you think that the relationships could not 
be created if an assistance instrument other than a TIA were used.
    (c) Will the use of a TIA allow firms or business units of firms 
that traditionally accept Government awards to use new business 
practices in the execution of the research that will help us get better 
technology, help us get new technology more quickly or less expensively, 
or facilitate partnering with commercial firms? If so:
    (1) What specific benefits will the DoD potentially get from the use 
of these new practices? You should be able to explain specifically why 
you foresee a potential for those benefits.
    (2) Are there provisions of the TIA or features of the TIA award 
process that enable the use of the new practices? If so, you should be 
able to identify those provisions or features and explain why you think 
that the practices could not be used if the award were made using an 
assistance instrument other than a TIA.
    (d) Are there any other benefits of the use of a TIA that could help 
the Department of Defense better meet its objectives in carrying out the 
research project? If so, you should be able to identify specifically 
what they are, how they can help meet defense objectives, what features 
of the TIA or award process enable the DoD to realize them, and why the 
benefits likely would not be realized if an assistance instrument other 
than a TIA were used.


<R05>
Sec. 37.230  May I use a TIA if a participant is to receive fee or profit?

    In accordance with 32 CFR 22.205(b), you may not use a TIA if any 
participant is to receive fee or profit. Note that this policy extends 
to all performers of the research project carried out under the TIA, 
including any subawards for substantive program performance, but it does 
not preclude participants' or subrecipients' payment of reasonable fee 
or profit when making purchases from suppliers of goods (e.g., supplies 
and equipment) or services needed to carry out the research.


<R04>
  Subpart C_Expenditure-Based and Fixed-Support Technology Investment 
                               Agreements


<R05>
Sec. 37.300  What is the difference between an expenditure-based and 
fixed-support TIA?

    The fundamental difference between an expenditure-based and fixed-
support TIA is that:
    (a) For an expenditure-based TIA, the amounts of interim payments or 
the total amount ultimately paid to the recipient are based on the 
amounts the recipient expends on project costs. If a recipient completes 
the project specified at the time of award before it expends all of the 
agreed-upon Federal funding and recipient cost sharing, the Federal 
Government may recover its share of the unexpended balance of funds or, 
by mutual agreement with the recipient, amend the agreement to expand 
the scope of the research project. An expenditure-based TIA therefore is 
analogous to a cost-type procurement contract or grant.
    (b) For a fixed-support TIA, the amount of assistance established at 
the time of award is not meant to be adjusted later if the research 
project is carried out to completion. In that sense, a fixed-support TIA 
is somewhat analogous to a fixed-price procurement contract (although 
``price,'' a concept appropriate to a procurement contract for buying a 
good or service, is not appropriate for a TIA or other assistance

[[Page 229]]

instrument for stimulation or support of a project).


<R05>
Sec. 37.305  When may I use a fixed-support TIA?

    You may use a fixed-support TIA if:
    (a) The agreement is to support or stimulate research with outcomes 
that are well defined, observable, and verifiable;
    (b) You can reasonably estimate the resources required to achieve 
those outcomes well enough to ensure the desired level of cost sharing 
(see example in Sec. 37.560(b)); and
    (c) Your TIA does not require a specific amount or percentage of 
recipient cost sharing. In cases where the agreement does require a 
specific amount or percentage of cost sharing, a fixed-support TIA is 
not practicable because the agreement has to specify cost principles or 
standards for costs that may be charged to the project; require the 
recipient to track the costs of the project; and provide access for 
audit to allow verification of the recipient's compliance with the 
mandatory cost sharing. You therefore must use an expenditure-based TIA 
if you:
    (1) Have a non-waivable requirement (e.g., in statute) for a 
specific amount or percentage of recipient cost sharing; or
    (2) Have otherwise elected to include in the TIA a requirement for a 
specific amount or percentage of cost sharing.


<R05>
Sec. 37.310  When would I use an expenditure-based TIA?

    In general, you must use an expenditure-based TIA under conditions 
other than those described in Sec. 37.305. Reasons for any exceptions 
to this general rule must be documented in the award file and must be 
consistent with the policy in Sec. 37.230 that precludes payment of fee 
or profit to participants.


<R05>
Sec. 37.315  What are the advantages of using a fixed-support TIA?

    In situations where the use of fixed-support TIAs is permissible 
(see Sec. Sec. 37.305 and 37.310), their use may encourage some 
commercial firms' participation in the research. With a fixed-support 
TIA, you can eliminate or reduce some post-award requirements that 
sometimes are cited as disincentives for those firms to participate. For 
example, a fixed-support TIA need not:
    (a) Specify minimum standards for the recipient's financial 
management system.
    (b) Specify cost principles or standards stating the types of costs 
the recipient may charge to the project.
    (c) Provide for financial audits by Federal auditors or independent 
public accountants of the recipient's books and records.
    (d) Set minimum standards for the recipient's purchasing system.
    (e) Require the recipient to prepare financial reports for 
submission to the Federal Government.


<R04>
                       Subpart D_Competition Phase


<R05>
Sec. 37.400  Must I use competitive procedures to award TIAs?

    DoD policy is to award TIAs using merit-based, competitive 
procedures, as described in 32 CFR 22.315:
    (a) In every case where required by statute; and
    (b) To the maximum extent practicable in all other cases.


<R05>
Sec. 37.405  What must my announcement or solicitation include?

    Your announcement, to be considered as part of a competitive 
procedure, must include the basic information described in 32 CFR 
22.315(a). Additional elements for you to consider in the case of a 
program that may use TIAs are described in Sec. Sec. 37.410 through 
37.420.


<R05>
Sec. 37.410  Should my announcement or solicitation state that TIAs 
may be awarded?

    Yes, once you consider the factors described in subpart B of this 
part and decide that TIAs are among the types of instruments that you 
may award pursuant to a solicitation, it is important for you to state 
that fact in the solicitation. You also should state that TIAs are more 
flexible than traditional Government funding instruments and that 
provisions are negotiable in areas such as audits and intellectual 
property rights that may cause concern for commercial firms. Doing so 
should increase the likelihood that commercial

[[Page 230]]

firms will be willing to submit proposals.


<R05>
Sec. 37.415  Should I address cost sharing in the announcement or 
solicitation?

    To help ensure a competitive process that is fair and equitable to 
all potential proposers, you should state clearly in the solicitation:
    (a) That, to the maximum extent practicable, the non-Federal parties 
carrying out a research project under a TIA are to provide at least half 
of the costs of the project (see Sec. 37.215(b)).
    (b) The types of cost sharing that are acceptable;
    (c) How any in-kind contributions will be valued, in accordance with 
Sec. Sec. 37.530 through 37.555; and
    (d) Whether you will give any consideration to alternative 
approaches a proposer may offer to demonstrate its strong commitment to 
and self-interest in the project's success, in accordance with Sec. 
37.215.


<R05>
Sec. 37.420  Should I tell proposers that we will not disclose 
information that they submit?

    Your solicitation should tell potential proposers that:
    (a) For all TIAs, information described in paragraph (b) of this 
section is exempt from disclosure requirements of the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA)(codified at 5 U.S.C. 552) for a period of five 
years after the date on which the DoD Component receives the information 
from them.
    (b) As provided in 10 U.S.C. 2371, disclosure is not required, and 
may not be compelled, under FOIA during that period if:
    (1) A proposer submits the information in a competitive or 
noncompetitive process that could result in their receiving a 
cooperative agreement for basic, applied, or advanced research under the 
authority of 10 U.S.C. 2358 or any other type of transaction authorized 
by 10 U.S.C. 2371 (as explained in appendix B to this part, that 
includes all TIAs); and
    (2) The type of information is among the following types that are 
exempt:
    (i) Proposals, proposal abstracts, and supporting documents; and
    (ii) Business plans and technical information submitted on a 
confidential basis.
    (c) If proposers desire to protect business plans and technical 
information for five years from FOIA disclosure requirements, they must 
mark them with a legend identifying them as documents submitted on a 
confidential basis. After the five-year period, information may be 
protected for longer periods if it meets any of the criteria in 5 U.S.C. 
552(b) (as implemented by the DoD in subpart C of 32 CFR part 286) for 
exemption from FOIA disclosure requirements.

                 Subpart E_Pre-Award Business Evaluation


<R05>
Sec. 37.500  What must my pre-award business evaluation address?

    (a) You must determine the qualification of the recipient, as 
described in Sec. Sec. 37.510 and 37.515.
    (b) As the business expert working with the program official, you 
also must address the financial aspects of the proposed agreement. You 
must:
    (1) Determine that the total amount of funding for the proposed 
effort is reasonable, as addressed in Sec. 37.520.
    (2) Assess the value and determine the reasonableness of the 
recipient's proposed cost sharing contribution, as discussed in 
Sec. Sec. 37.525 through 37.555.
    (3) If you are contemplating the use of a fixed-support rather than 
expenditure-based TIA, ensure that its use is justified, as explained in 
Sec. Sec. 37.560 and 37.565.
    (4) Address issues of inconsistent cost accounting by traditional 
Government contractors, should they arise, as noted in Sec. 37.570.
    (5) Determine amounts for milestone payments, if you use them, as 
discussed in Sec. 37.575.


<R05>
Sec. 37.505  What resources are available to assist me during the 
pre-award business evaluation?

    Administrative agreements officers of the Defense Contract 
Management Agency and the Office of Naval Research can share lessons 
learned from administering other TIAs. Program officials can be a source 
of information

[[Page 231]]

when you are determining the reasonableness of proposed funding (e.g., 
on labor rates, as discussed in Sec. 37.520) or establishing observable 
and verifiable technical milestones for payments (see Sec. 37.575). 
Auditors at the Defense Contract Audit Agency can act in an advisory 
capacity to help you determine the reasonableness of proposed amounts, 
including values of in-kind contributions toward cost sharing.

                         Recipient Qualification


<R05>
Sec. 37.510  What are my responsibilities for determining that a 
recipient is qualified?

    Prior to award of a TIA, your responsibilities for determining that 
the recipient is qualified are the same as those of a grants officer who 
is awarding a grant or cooperative agreement. Those responsibilities are 
described in subpart D of 32 CFR part 22. When the recipient is a 
consortium that is not formally incorporated, you have the additional 
responsibility described in Sec. 37.515.


<R05>
Sec. 37.515  Must I do anything additional to determine the qualification 
of a consortium?

    (a) When the prospective recipient of a TIA is a consortium that is 
not formally incorporated, your determination that the recipient meets 
the standard at 32 CFR 22.415(a) requires that you, in consultation with 
legal counsel, review the management plan in the consortium's 
collaboration agreement. The purpose of your review is to ensure that 
the management plan is sound and that it adequately addresses the 
elements necessary for an effective working relationship among the 
consortium members. An effective working relationship is essential to 
increase the research project's chances of success.
    (b) The collaboration agreement, commonly referred to as the 
articles of collaboration, is the document that sets out the rights and 
responsibilities of each consortium member. It binds the individual 
consortium members together, whereas the TIA binds the Government and 
the consortium as a group (or the Government and a consortium member on 
behalf of the consortium, as explained in Sec. 37.1015). The document 
should discuss, among other things, the consortium's:
    (1) Management structure.
    (2) Method of making payments to consortium members.
    (3) Means of ensuring and overseeing members' efforts on the 
project.
    (4) Provisions for members' cost sharing contributions.
    (5) Provisions for ownership and rights in intellectual property 
developed previously or under the agreement.

                              Total Funding


<R05>
Sec. 37.520  What is my responsibility for determining that the total 
project funding is reasonable?

    In cooperation with the program official, you must assess the 
reasonableness of the total estimated budget to perform the research 
that will be supported by the agreement. Additional guidance follows 
for:
    (a) Labor. Much of the budget likely will involve direct labor and 
associated indirect costs, which may be represented together as a 
``loaded'' labor rate. The program official is an essential advisor on 
reasonableness of the overall level of effort and its composition by 
labor category. You also may rely on your experience with other awards 
as the basis for determining reasonableness. If you have any unresolved 
questions, two of the ways that you might find helpful in establishing 
reasonableness are to:
    (1) Consult the administrative agreements officers or auditors 
identified in Sec. 37.505.
    (2) Compare loaded labor rates of for-profit firms that do not have 
expenditure-based Federal procurement contracts or assistance awards 
with a standard or average for the particular industry. Note that the 
program official may have knowledge about customary levels of direct 
labor charges in the particular industry that is involved. You may be 
able to compare associated indirect charges with Government-approved 
indirect cost rates that exist for many nonprofit and for-profit 
organizations that have Federal procurement contracts or assistance 
awards (note the requirement in Sec. 37.630

[[Page 232]]

for a for-profit participant to use Federally approved provisional 
indirect cost rates, if it has them).
    (b) Real property and equipment. In almost all cases, the project 
costs may include only depreciation or use charges for real property and 
equipment of for-profit participants, in accordance with Sec. 37.685. 
Remember that the budget for an expenditure-based TIA may not include 
depreciation of a participant's property as a direct cost of the project 
if that participant's practice is to charge the depreciation of that 
type of property as an indirect cost, as many organizations do.

                              Cost Sharing


<R05>
Sec. 37.525  What is my responsibility for determining the value and 
reasonableness of the recipient's cost sharing contribution?

    You must:
    (a) Determine that the recipient's cost sharing contributions meet 
the criteria for cost sharing and determine values for them, in 
accordance with Sec. Sec. 37.530 through 37.555. In doing so, you must:
    (1) Ensure that there are affirmative statements from any third 
parties identified as sources of cash contributions.
    (2) Include in the award file an evaluation that documents how you 
determined the values of the recipient's contributions to the funding of 
the project.
    (b) Judge that the recipient's cost sharing contribution, as a 
percentage of the total budget, is reasonable. To the maximum extent 
practicable, the recipient must provide at least half of the costs of 
the project, in accordance with Sec. 37.215.


<R05>
Sec. 37.530  What criteria do I use in deciding whether to accept a 
recipient's cost sharing?

    You may accept any cash or in-kind contributions that meet all of 
the following criteria:
    (a) In your judgment, they represent meaningful cost sharing that 
demonstrates the recipient's commitment to the success of the research 
project. Cash contributions clearly demonstrate commitment and they are 
strongly preferred over in-kind contributions.
    (b) They are necessary and reasonable for accomplishment of the 
research project's objectives.
    (c) They are costs that may be charged to the project under Sec. 
37.625 and Sec. 37.635, as applicable to the participant making the 
contribution.
    (d) They are verifiable from the recipient's records.
    (e) They are not included as cost sharing contributions for any 
other Federal award.
    (f) They are not paid by the Federal Government under another award, 
except:
    (1) Costs that are authorized by Federal statute to be used for cost 
sharing; or
    (2) Independent research and development (IR&D) costs, as described 
at 32 CFR 34.13(a)(5)(ii), that meet all of the criteria in paragraphs 
(a) through (e) of this section. IR&D is acceptable as cost sharing, 
even though it may be reimbursed by the Government through other awards. 
It is standard business practice for all for-profit firms, including 
commercial firms, to recover their research and development (R&D) costs 
(which for Federal procurement contracts is recovered as IR&D) through 
prices charged to their customers. Thus, the cost principles at 48 CFR 
part 31 allow a for-profit firm that has expenditure-based, Federal 
procurement contracts to recover through those procurement contracts the 
allocable portion of its R&D costs associated with a technology 
investment agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 37.535  How do I value cost sharing related to real property or 
equipment?

    You rarely should accept values for cost sharing contributions of 
real property or equipment that are in excess of depreciation or 
reasonable use charges, as discussed in Sec. 37.685 for for-profit 
participants. You may accept the full value of a donated capital asset 
if the real property or equipment is to be dedicated to the project and 
you expect that it will have a fair market value that is less than 
$5,000 at the project's end. In those cases, you should value the 
donation at the lesser of:

[[Page 233]]

    (a) The value of the property as shown in the recipient's accounting 
records (i.e., purchase price less accumulated depreciation); or
    (b) The current fair market value. You may accept the use of any 
reasonable basis for determining the fair market value of the property. 
If there is a justification to do so, you may accept the current fair 
market value even if it exceeds the value in the recipient's records.


<R05>
Sec. 37.540  May I accept fully depreciated real property or equipment 
as cost sharing?

    You should limit the value of any contribution of a fully 
depreciated asset to a reasonable use charge. In determining what is 
reasonable, you must consider:
    (a) The original cost of the asset;
    (b) Its estimated remaining useful life at the time of your 
negotiations;
    (c) The effect of any increased maintenance charges or decreased 
performance due to age; and
    (d) The amount of depreciation that the participant previously 
charged to Federal awards.


<R05>
Sec. 37.545  May I accept costs of prior research as cost sharing?

    No, you may not count any participant's costs of prior research as a 
cost sharing contribution. Only the additional resources that the 
recipient will provide to carry out the current project (which may 
include pre-award costs for the current project, as described in Sec. 
37.830) are to be counted.


<R05>
Sec. 37.550  May I accept intellectual property as cost sharing?

    (a) In most instances, you should not count costs of patents and 
other intellectual property (e.g., copyrighted material, including 
software) as cost sharing, because:
    (1) It is difficult to assign values to these intangible 
contributions;
    (2) Their value usually is a manifestation of prior research costs, 
which are not allowed as cost share under Sec. 37.545; and
    (3) Contributions of intellectual property rights generally do not 
represent the same cost of lost opportunity to a recipient as 
contributions of cash or tangible assets. The purpose of cost share is 
to ensure that the recipient incurs real risk that gives it a vested 
interest in the project's success.
    (b) You may include costs associated with intellectual property if 
the costs are based on sound estimates of market value of the 
contribution. For example, a for-profit firm may offer the use of 
commercially available software for which there is an established 
license fee for use of the product. The costs of the development of the 
software would not be a reasonable basis for valuing its use.


<R05>
Sec. 37.555  How do I value a recipient's other contributions?

    For types of participant contributions other than those addressed in 
Sec. Sec. 37.535 through 37.550, the general rule is that you are to 
value each contribution consistently with the cost principles or 
standards in Sec. 37.625 and Sec. 37.635 that apply to the participant 
making the contribution. When valuing services and property donated by 
parties other than the participants, you may use as guidance the 
provisions of 32 CFR 34.13(b)(2) through (5).

               Fixed-Support or Expenditure-Based Approach


<R05>
Sec. 37.560  Must I be able to estimate project expenditures precisely 
in order to justify use of a fixed-support TIA?

    (a) To use a fixed-support TIA, rather than an expenditure-based 
TIA, you must have confidence in your estimate of the expenditures 
required to achieve well-defined outcomes. Therefore, you must work 
carefully with program officials to select outcomes that, when the 
recipient achieves them, are reliable indicators of the amount of effort 
the recipient expended. However, your estimate of the required 
expenditures need not be a precise dollar amount, as illustrated by the 
example in paragraph (b) of this section, if:
    (1) The recipient is contributing a substantial share of the costs 
of achieving the outcomes, which must meet the criteria in Sec. 
37.305(a); and
    (2) You are confident that the costs of achieving the outcomes will 
be at least a minimum amount that you can specify and the recipient is 
willing to

[[Page 234]]

accept the possibility that its cost sharing percentage ultimately will 
be higher if the costs exceed that minimum amount.
    (b) To illustrate the approach, consider a project for which you are 
confident that the recipient will have to expend at least $800,000 to 
achieve the specified outcomes. You must determine, in conjunction with 
program officials, the minimum level of recipient cost sharing that you 
want to negotiate, based on the circumstances, to demonstrate the 
recipient's commitment to the success of the project. For purposes of 
this illustration, let that minimum recipient cost sharing be 40% of the 
total project costs. In that case, the Federal share should be no more 
than 60% and you could set a fixed level of Federal support at $480,000 
(60% of $800,000). With that fixed level of Federal support, the 
recipient would be responsible for the balance of the costs needed to 
complete the project.
    (c) Note, however, that the level of recipient cost sharing you 
negotiate is to be based solely on the level needed to demonstrate the 
recipient's commitment. You may not use a shortage of Federal Government 
funding for the program as a reason to try to persuade a recipient to 
accept a fixed-support TIA, rather than an expenditure-based instrument, 
or to accept responsibility for a greater share of the total project 
costs than it otherwise is willing to offer. If you lack sufficient 
funding to provide an appropriate Federal Government share for the 
entire project, you instead should rescope the effort covered by the 
agreement to match the available funding.


<R05>
Sec. 37.565  May I use a hybrid instrument that provides fixed support 
for only a portion of a project?

    Yes, for a research project that is to be carried out by a number of 
participants, you may award a TIA that provides for some participants to 
perform under fixed-support arrangements and others to perform under 
expenditure-based arrangements. This approach may be useful, for 
example, if a commercial firm that is a participant will not accept an 
agreement with all of the post-award requirements of an expenditure-
based award. Before using a fixed-support arrangement for that firm's 
portion of the project, you must judge that it meets the criteria in 
Sec. 37.305.

               Accounting, Payments, and Recovery of Funds


<R05>
Sec. 37.570  What must I do if a CAS-covered participant accounts 

differently for its own and the Federal Government shares of project 
costs?

    (a) If a participant has Federal procurement contracts that are 
subject to the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) in part 30 of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the associated FAR Appendix (48 CFR 
part 30 and 48 CFR 9903.201-1, respectively), you must alert the 
participant during the pre-award negotiations to the potential for a CAS 
violation, as well as the cognizant administrative contracting officer 
(ACO) for the participant's procurement contracts, if you learn that the 
participant plans to account differently for its own share and the 
Federal Government's share of project costs under the TIA. This may 
arise, for example, if a for-profit firm or other organization subject 
to the FAR cost principles in 48 CFR parts 31 and 231 proposes to 
charge:
    (1) Its share of project costs as independent research and 
development (IR&D) costs to enable recovery of the costs through Federal 
Government procurement contracts, as allowed under the FAR cost 
principles; and
    (2) The Federal Government's share to the project, rather than as 
IR&D costs.
    (b) The reason for alerting the participant and the ACO is that the 
inconsistent charging of the two shares could cause a noncompliance with 
Cost Accounting Standard (CAS) 402. Noncompliance with CAS 402 is a 
potential issue only for a participant that has CAS-covered Federal 
procurement contracts (note that CAS requirements do not apply to a for-
profit participant's TIAs).
    (c) For for-profit participants with CAS-covered procurement 
contracts, the cognizant ACO in most cases will be an individual within 
the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). You can identify a 
cognizant ACO at the DCMA by querying the contract administration team 
locator that

[[Page 235]]

matches contractors with their ACOs (currently on the World Wide Web at 
http://alerts.dcmdw.dcma.mil/support, a site that also can be accessed 
through the DCMA home page at http://www.dcma.mil).


<R05>
Sec. 37.575  What are my responsibilities for determining milestone 
payment amounts?

    (a) If you select the milestone payment method (see Sec. 37.805), 
you must assess the reasonableness of the estimated amount for reaching 
each milestone. This assessment enables you to set the amount of each 
milestone payment to approximate the Federal share of the anticipated 
resource needs for carrying out that phase of the research effort.
    (b) The Federal share at each milestone need not be the same as the 
Federal share of the total project. For example, you might deliberately 
set payment amounts with a larger Federal share for early milestones if 
a project involves a start-up company with limited resources.
    (c) For an expenditure-based TIA, if you have minimum percentages 
that you want the recipient's cost sharing to be at the milestones, you 
should indicate those percentages in the agreement or in separate 
instructions to the post-award administrative agreements officer. That 
will help the administrative agreements officer decide when a project's 
expenditures have fallen too far below the original projections, 
requiring adjustments of future milestone payment amounts (see Sec. 
37.1105(c)).
    (d) For fixed-support TIAs, the milestone payments should be 
associated with the well-defined, observable and verifiable technical 
outcomes (e.g., demonstrations, tests, or data analysis) that you 
establish for the project in accordance with Sec. Sec. 37.305(a) and 
37.560(a).


<R05>
Sec. 37.580  What is recovery of funds and when should I consider 
including it in my TIA?

    (a) Recovery of funds refers to the use of the authority in 10 
U.S.C. 2371 to include a provision in certain types of agreements, 
including TIAs, that require a recipient to make payments to the 
Department of Defense or another Federal agency as a condition of the 
agreement. Recovery of funds is a good tool in the right circumstances, 
at the discretion of the agreements officer and the awarding 
organization, but its purpose is not to augment program budgets. It may 
be used to recover funds provided to a recipient through a TIA or 
another Federal procurement or assistance instrument, and the recovery 
should not exceed the amounts provided. Recovery of funds is distinct 
from program income, as described in Sec. 37.835.
    (b) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2371, as implemented by policy 
guidance from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense 
(Comptroller), the payment amounts may be credited to an existing 
account of the Department of Defense and used for the same program 
purposes as other funds in that account.
    (c) Before you use the authority to include a provision for recovery 
of funds, note that 10 U.S.C. 2371 requires you to judge that it would 
not be feasible or appropriate to use for the research project a 
standard grant or cooperative agreement (in this instance, a ``standard 
cooperative agreement'' means a cooperative agreement without a 
provision for recovery of funds). You satisfy that 10 U.S.C. 2371 
requirement when you judge that execution of the research project 
warrants inclusion of a provision for recovery of funds.


<R04>
 Subpart F_Award Terms Affecting Participants' Financial, Property, and 
                           Purchasing Systems


<R05>
Sec. 37.600  Which administrative matters are covered in this subpart?

    This subpart addresses ``systemic'' administrative matters that 
place requirements on the operation of a participant's financial 
management, property management, or purchasing system. Each 
participant's systems are organization-wide and do not vary with each 
agreement. Therefore, all TIAs should address systemic requirements in a 
uniform way for each type of participant organization.

[[Page 236]]


<R05>
Sec. 37.605  What is the general policy on participants' financial, 
property, and purchasing systems?

    The general policy for expenditure-based TIAs is to avoid 
requirements that would force participants to use different financial 
management, property management, and purchasing systems than they 
currently use for:
    (a) Expenditure-based Federal procurement contracts and assistance 
awards in general, if they receive them; or
    (b) Commercial business, if they have no expenditure-based Federal 
procurement contracts and assistance awards.


<R05>
Sec. 37.610  Must I tell participants what requirements they are to 
flow down for subrecipients' systems?

    If it is an expenditure-based award, your TIA must require 
participants to flow down the same financial management, property 
management, and purchasing systems requirements to a subrecipient that 
would apply if the subrecipient were a participant. For example, a for-
profit participant would flow down to a university subrecipient the 
requirements that apply to a university participant. Note that this 
policy applies to subawards for substantive performance of portions of 
the research project supported by the TIA, and not to participants' 
purchases of goods or services needed to carry out the research.

                            Financial Matters


<R05>
Sec. 37.615  What standards do I include for financial systems of 
for-profit firms?

    (a) To avoid causing needless changes in participants' financial 
management systems, your expenditure-based TIAs will make for-profit 
participants that currently perform under other expenditure-based 
Federal procurement contracts or assistance awards subject to the same 
standards for financial management systems that apply to those other 
awards. Therefore, if a for-profit participant has expenditure-based DoD 
assistance awards other than TIAs, your TIAs are to apply the standards 
in 32 CFR 34.11. You may grant an exception and allow a for-profit 
participant that has other expenditure-based Federal Government awards 
to use an alternative set of standards that meets the minimum criteria 
in paragraph (b) of this section, if there is a compelling programmatic 
or business reason to do so. For each case in which you grant an 
exception, you must document the reason in the award file.
    (b) For an expenditure-based TIA, you are to allow and encourage 
each for-profit participant that does not currently perform under 
expenditure-based Federal procurement contracts or assistance awards 
(other than TIAs) to use its existing financial management system as 
long as the system, as a minimum:
    (1) Complies with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
    (2) Effectively controls all project funds, including Federal funds 
and any required cost share. The system must have complete, accurate, 
and current records that document the sources of funds and the purposes 
for which they are disbursed. It also must have procedures for ensuring 
that project funds are used only for purposes permitted by the agreement 
(see Sec. 37.625).
    (3) Includes, if advance payments are authorized under Sec. 37.805, 
procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the payment of funds by 
the Government and the firm's disbursement of the funds for program 
purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 37.620  What financial management standards do I include for 
nonprofit participants?

    So as not to force system changes for any State, local government, 
institution of higher education, or other nonprofit organization, your 
expenditure-based TIA's requirements for the financial management system 
of any nonprofit participant are the same as those that apply to the 
participant's other Federal assistance awards. Specifically, the 
requirements are those in:
    (a) 32 CFR 33.20 for State and local governments; and
    (b) 32 CFR 32.21(b) for other nonprofit organizations, with the 
exception of Government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) facilities and 
Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) that are 
excepted from the definition of ``recipient'' in 32

[[Page 237]]

CFR part 32. Although it should occur infrequently, if a nonprofit GOCO 
or FFRDC is a participant, you must specify appropriate standards that 
conform as much as practicable with requirements in that participant's 
other Federal awards.


<R05>
Sec. 37.625  What cost principles or standards do I require for 
for-profit participants?

    (a) So as not to require any firm to needlessly change its cost-
accounting system, your expenditure-based TIAs are to apply the 
Government cost principles in 48 CFR parts 31 and 231 to for-profit 
participants that currently perform under expenditure-based Federal 
procurement contracts or assistance awards (other than TIAs) and 
therefore have existing systems for identifying allowable costs under 
those principles. If there are programmatic or business reasons to do 
otherwise, you may grant an exception from this requirement and use 
alternative standards as long as the alternative satisfies the 
conditions described in paragraph (b) of this section; if you do so, you 
must document the reasons in your award file.
    (b) For other for-profit participants, you may establish alternative 
standards in the agreement as long as that alternative provides, as a 
minimum, that Federal funds and funds counted as recipients' cost 
sharing will be used only for costs that:
    (1) A reasonable and prudent person would incur in carrying out the 
research project contemplated by the agreement. Generally, elements of 
cost that appropriately are charged are those identified with research 
and development activities under the Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles (see Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Number 2, 
``Accounting for Research and Development Costs,'' October 1974 \1\). 
Moreover, costs must be allocated to DoD and other projects in 
accordance with the relative benefits the projects receive. Costs 
charged to DoD projects must be given consistent treatment with costs 
allocated to the participants' other research and development activities 
(e.g., activities supported by the participants themselves or by non-
Federal sponsors).

    (2) Are consistent with the purposes stated in the governing 
Congressional authorizations and appropriations. You are responsible for

that result from authorizations and appropriations.


<R05>
Sec. 37.630  Must I require a for-profit firm to use Federally approved 
indirect cost rates?

    In accordance with the general policy in Sec. 37.605, you must 
require a for-profit participant that has Federally approved indirect 
cost rates for its Federal procurement contracts to use those rates to 
accumulate and report costs under an expenditure-based TIA. This 
includes both provisional and final rates that are approved up until the 
time that the TIA is closed out. You may grant an exception from this 
requirement if there are programmatic or business reasons to do 
otherwise (e.g., the participant offers you a lower rate). If you grant 
an exception, the participant must accumulate and report the costs using 
an accounting system and practices that it uses for other customers 
(e.g., its commercial customers). Also, you must document the reason for 
the exception in your award file.


<R05>
Sec. 37.635  What cost principles do I require a nonprofit participant 
to use?

    So as not to force financial system changes for any nonprofit

charged to the research project by any nonprofit participant must be 
determined to be allowable in accordance with:

<R05>
Sec. 37.640  Must I include a provision for audits of for-profit 
participants?

    If your TIA is an expenditure-based award, you must include in it an 
audit provision that addresses, for each for-profit participant:
    (a) Whether the for-profit participant must have periodic audits, in 
addition to any award-specific audits, as described in Sec. 37.645. 
Note that the DCAA or the Office of the Inspector General, DoD (OIG, 
DoD), can provide advice on the types and scope of audits that may be 
needed in various circumstances.
    (b) Whether the DCAA or an independent public accountant (IPA) will 
perform required audits, as discussed in Sec. 37.650.
    (c) How frequently any periodic audits are to be performed, 
addressed in Sec. 37.655.
    (d) Other matters described in Sec. 37.660, such as audit coverage, 
allowability of audit costs, auditing standards, and remedies for 
noncompliance.


<R05>
Sec. 37.645  Must I require periodic audits, as well as award-specific 
audits, of for-profit participants?

    You need to consider requirements for both periodic audits and 
award-specific audits (as defined in Sec. 37.1325 and Sec. 37.1235, 
respectively). The way that your expenditure-based TIA addresses the two 
types of audits will vary, depending upon the type of for-profit 
participant.
    (a) For for-profit participants that are audited by the DCAA or 
other Federal auditors, as described in Sec. Sec. 37.650(b) and 37.655, 
you need not add specific requirements for periodic audits because the 
Federal audits should be sufficient to address whatever may be needed. 
Your inclusion in the TIA of the standard access-to-records provision 
for those for-profit participants, as discussed in Sec. 37.915(a), 
gives the necessary access in the event that you or administrative 
agreements officers later need to request audits to address award-
specific issues that arise.
    (b) For each other for-profit participant, you:
    (1) Should require that the participant have an independent auditor 
(i.e., the DCAA or an independent public accountant) conduct periodic 
audits of its systems if it expends $500,000 or more per year in TIAs 
and other Federal assistance awards. A prime reason for including this 
requirement is that the Federal Government, for an expenditure-based 
award, necessarily relies on amounts reported by the participant's 
systems when it sets payment amounts or adjusts performance outcomes. 
The periodic audit provides some assurance that the reported amounts are 
reliable.
    (2) Must ensure that the award provides an independent auditor the 
access needed for award-specific audits, to be performed at the request 
of the cognizant administrative agreements officer if issues arise that 
require audit support. However, consistent with the government-wide 
policies on single audits that apply to nonprofit participants (see 
Sec. 37.665), you should rely on periodic audits to the maximum extent 
possible to resolve any award-specific issues.


<R05>
Sec. 37.650  Who must I identify as the auditor for a for-profit 
participant?

    The auditor that you will identify in the expenditure-based TIA to 
perform periodic and award-specific audits of a for-profit participant 
depends on the circumstances, as follows:
    (a) You may provide that an IPA will be the auditor for a for-profit 
participant that does not meet the criteria in paragraph (b) of this 
section, but only if the participant will not agree to give the DCAA 
access to the necessary books and records for audit purposes. Note that 
the allocable portion of the costs of the IPA's audit may be 
reimbursable under the TIA, as described in Sec. 37.660(b). The IPA 
should be the one that the participant uses to perform

[[Page 239]]

other audits (e.g., of its financial statement), to minimize added 
burdens and costs. You must document in the award file the participant's 
unwillingness to give the DCAA access. The DCAA is to be the auditor if 
the participant grants the necessary access.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, you must 
identify the DCAA as the auditor for any for-profit participant that is 
subject to DCAA audits because it is currently performing under a 
Federal award that is subject to the:
    (1) Cost principles in 48 CFR part 31 of the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) and 48 CFR part 231 of the Defense FAR Supplement; or
    (2) Cost Accounting Standards in 48 CFR chapter 99.
    (c) If there are programmatic or business reasons that justify the 
use of an auditor other than the DCAA for a for-profit participant that 
meets the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section, you may provide 
that an IPA will be the auditor for that participant if you obtain prior 
approval from the Office of the Inspector General, DoD. You must submit 
requests for prior approval to the Assistant Inspector General 
(Auditing), 400 Army-Navy Drive, Arlington, VA 22202. Your request must 
include the name and address of the business unit(s) for which IPAs will 
be used. It also must explain why you judge that the participant will 
not give the DCAA the necessary access to records for audit purposes 
(e.g., you may submit a statement to that effect from the participant). 
The OIG, DoD, will respond within five working days of receiving the 
request for prior approval, either by notifying you of the decision 
(approval or disapproval) or giving you a date by which they will notify 
you of the decision.


<R05>
Sec. 37.655  Must I specify the frequency of IPAs' periodic audits of 
for-profit participants?

    If your expenditure-based TIA provides for periodic audits of a for-
profit participant by an IPA, you must specify the frequency for those 
audits. You should consider having an audit performed during the first 
year of the award, when the participant has its IPA do its next 
financial statement audit, unless the participant already had a systems 
audit due to other Federal awards within the past two years. The 
frequency thereafter may vary depending upon the dollars the participant 
is expending annually under the award, but it is not unreasonable to 
require an updated audit every two to three years to reverify that the 
participant's systems are reliable (the audit then would cover the two 
or three-year period between audits). The DCAA is a source of advice on 
audit frequencies if your TIA provides for audits by IPAs.


<R05>
Sec. 37.660  What else must I specify concerning audits of for-profit 
participants by IPAs?

    If your expenditure-based TIA provides for audits of a for-profit 
participant by an IPA, you also must specify:
    (a) What periodic audits are to cover. It is important that you 
specify audit coverage that is only as broad as needed to provide 
reasonable assurance of the participant's compliance with award terms 
that have a direct and material effect on the research project. Appendix 
C to this part provides guidance to for-profit participants and their 
IPAs that you may use for this purpose. The DCAA and the OIG, DoD, also 
can provide advice to help you set appropriate limits on audit 
objectives and scope.
    (b) Who will pay for periodic and award-specific audits. The 
allocable portion of the costs of any audits by IPAs may be reimbursable 
under the TIA. The costs may be direct charges or allocated indirect 
costs, consistent with the participant's accounting system and 
practices.
    (c) The auditing standards that the IPA will use. Unless you receive 
prior approval from the OIG, DoD, to do otherwise, you must provide that 
the IPA will perform the audits in accordance with the Generally 
Accepted Government Auditing Standards.\4\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) The available remedies for noncompliance. The agreement must 
provide that the participant may not

[[Page 240]]

charge costs to the award for any audit that the agreements officer, 
with the advice of the OIG, DoD, determines was not performed in 
accordance with the Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards or 
other terms of the agreement. It also must provide that the Government 
has the right to require the participant to have the IPA take corrective 
action and, if corrective action is not taken, that the agreements 
officer has recourse to any of the remedies for noncompliance identified 
in 32 CFR 34.52(a).
    (e) The remedy if it later is found that the participant, at the 
time it entered into the TIA, was performing on a procurement contract 
or other Federal award subject to the Cost Accounting Standards at 48 
CFR part 30 and the cost principles at 48 CFR part 31. Unless the OIG, 
DoD, approves an exception (see Sec. 37.650(c)), the TIA's terms must 
provide that the DCAA will perform the audits for the agreement if it 
later is found that the participant, at the time the TIA was awarded, 
was performing under awards described in Sec. 37.650(b) that gave the 
DCAA audit access to the participant's books and records.
    (f) Where the IPA is to send audit reports. The agreement must 
provide that the IPA is to submit audit reports to the administrative 
agreements officer and the OIG, DoD. It also must require that the IPA 
report instances of fraud directly to the OIG, DoD.
    (g) The retention period for the IPA's working papers. You must 
specify that the IPA is to retain working papers for a period of at 
least three years after the final payment, unless the working papers 
relate to an audit whose findings are not fully resolved within that 
period or to an unresolved claim or dispute (in which case, the IPA must 
keep the working papers until the matter is resolved and final action 
taken).
    (h) Who will have access to the IPA's working papers. The agreement 
must provide for Government access to working papers.


<R05>
Sec. 37.665  Must I require nonprofit participants to have periodic 
audits?

    Yes, expenditure-based TIAs are assistance instruments subject to 
the Single Audit Act (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507), so nonprofit participants 
are subject to their usual requirements under that Act and OMB Circular 
A-133.\5\ Specifically, the requirements are those in:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See footnote 2 to Sec. 37.635(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (a) 32 CFR 33.26 for State and local governments; and
    (b) 32 CFR 32.26 for other nonprofit organizations. Note that those 
requirements also are appropriate for Government-owned, contractor-
operated (GOCO) facilities and Federally Funded Research and Development 
Centers (FFRDCs) that are excluded from the definition of ``recipient'' 
in 32 CFR part 32, because nonprofit GOCOs and FFRDCs are subject to the 
Single Audit Act.


<R05>
Sec. 37.670  Must I require participants to flow down audit requirements 
to subrecipients?

    (a) Yes, in accordance with Sec. 37.610, your expenditure-based TIA 
must require participants to flow down the same audit requirements to a 
subrecipient that would apply if the subrecipient were a participant.
    (b) For example, a for-profit participant that is audited by the 
DCAA:
    (1) Would flow down to a university subrecipient the Single Audit 
Act requirements that apply to a university participant.
    (2) Could enter into a subaward allowing a for-profit participant, 
under the circumstances described in Sec. 37.650(a), to use an IPA to 
do its audits.
    (c) This policy applies to subawards for substantive performance of 
portions of the research project supported by the TIA, and not to 
participants' purchases of goods or services needed to carry out the 
research.


<R05>
Sec. 37.675  Must I report when I enter into a TIA allowing a for-profit 
firm to use an IPA?

    Yes, you must include that information with the data you provide for 
your DoD Component's annual submission to the Defense Technical 
Information Center (DTIC), as provided in Sec. 37.1030(c).

[[Page 241]]


<R05>
Sec. 37.680  Must I require a participant to report when it enters 
into a subaward allowing a for-profit firm to use an IPA?

    Yes, your expenditure-based TIA must require participants to report 
to you when they enter into any subaward allowing a for-profit 
subawardee to use an IPA, as described in Sec. 37.670(b)(2). You must 
provide that information about the new subaward under the TIA for your 
DoD Component's annual submission to the DTIC, even though the TIA may 
have been reported in a prior year and does not itself have to be 
reported again.

                                Property


<R05>
Sec. 37.685  May I allow for-profit firms to purchase real property 
and equipment with project funds?

    (a) With the two exceptions described in paragraph (b) of this 
section, you must require a for-profit firm to purchase real property or 
equipment with its own funds that are separate from the research 
project. You should allow the firm to charge to an expenditure-based TIA 
only depreciation or use charges for real property or equipment (and 
your cost estimate for a fixed-support TIA only would include those 
costs). Note that the firm must charge depreciation consistently with 
its usual accounting practice. Many firms treat depreciation as an 
indirect cost. Any firm that usually charges depreciation indirectly for 
a particular type of property must not charge depreciation for that 
property as a direct cost to the TIA.
    (b) In two situations, you may grant an exception and allow a for-
profit firm to use project funds, which includes both the Federal 
Government and recipient shares, to purchase real property or equipment 
(i.e., to charge to the project the full acquisition cost of the 
property). The two circumstances, which should be infrequent for 
equipment and extremely rare for real property, are those in which you 
either:
    (1) Judge that the real property or equipment will be dedicated to 
the project and have a current fair market value that is less than 
$5,000 by the time the project ends; or
    (2) Give prior approval for the firm to include the full acquisition 
cost of the real property or equipment as part of the cost of the 
project (see Sec. 37.535).
    (c) If you grant an exception in either of the circumstances 
described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, you must make 
the real property or equipment subject to the property management 
standards in 32 CFR 34.21(b) through (d). As provided in those 
standards, the title to the real property or equipment will vest 
conditionally in the for-profit firm upon acquisition. Your TIA, whether 
it is a fixed-support or expenditure-based award, must specify that any 
item of equipment that has a fair market value of $5,000 or more at the 
conclusion of the project also will be subject to the disposition 
process in 32 CFR 34.21(e), whereby the Federal Government will recover 
its interest in the property at that time.


<R05>
Sec. 37.690  How are nonprofit participants to manage real property 
and equipment?

    For nonprofit participants, your TIA's requirements for vesting of 
title, use, management, and disposition of real property or equipment 
acquired under the award are the same as those that apply to the 
participant's other Federal assistance awards. Specifically, the 
requirements are those in:
    (a) 32 CFR 33.31 and 33.32, for participants that are States and 
local governmental organizations.
    (b) 32 CFR 32.32 and 32.33, for other nonprofit participants, with 
the exception of nonprofit GOCOs and FFRDCs that are exempted from the 
definition of ``recipient'' in 32 CFR part 32. Although it should occur 
infrequently, if a nonprofit GOCO or FFRDC is a participant, you must 
specify appropriate standards that conform as much as practicable with 
requirements in that participant's other Federal awards. Note also that:
    (1) If the TIA is a cooperative agreement (see appendix B to this 
part), 31 U.S.C. 6306 provides authority to vest title to tangible 
personal property in a nonprofit institution of higher education or in a 
nonprofit organization whose primary purpose is conducting

[[Page 242]]

scientific research, without further obligation to the Federal 
Government; and
    (2) Your TIA therefore must specify any conditions on the vesting of 
title to real property or equipment acquired by any such nonprofit 
participant, or the title will vest in the participant without further 
obligation to the Federal Government, as specified in 32 CFR 
32.33(b)(3).


<R05>
Sec. 37.695  What are the requirements for Federally owned property?

    If you provide Federally owned property to any participant for the 
performance of research under a TIA, you must require that participant 
to account for, use, and dispose of the property in accordance with:
    (a) 32 CFR 34.22, if the participant is a for-profit firm.
    (b) 32 CFR 33.32(f), if the participant is a State or local 
governmental organization. Note that 32 CFR 33.32(f) requires you to 
provide additional information to the participant on the procedures for 
managing the property.
    (c) 32 CFR 32.33(a) and 32.34(f), if the participant is a nonprofit 
organization other than a GOCO or FFRDC (requirements for nonprofit 
GOCOs and FFRDCs should conform with the property standards that apply 
to their Federal procurement contracts).


<R05>
Sec. 37.700  What are the requirements for supplies?

    Your expenditure-based TIA's provisions should permit participants 
to use their existing procedures to account for and manage supplies. A 
fixed-support TIA should not include requirements to account for or 
manage supplies.

                               Purchasing


<R05>
Sec. 37.705  What standards do I include for purchasing systems of 
for-profit firms?

    (a) If your TIA is an expenditure-based award, it should require 
for-profit participants that currently perform under DoD assistance 
instruments subject to the purchasing standards in 32 CFR 34.31 to use 
the same requirements for TIAs, unless there are programmatic or 
business reasons to do otherwise (in which case you must document the 
reasons in the award file).
    (b) You should allow other for-profit participants under 
expenditure-based TIAs to use their existing purchasing systems, as long 
as they flow down the applicable requirements in Federal statutes, 
Executive orders or Governmentwide regulations (see appendix E to this 
part for a list of those requirements).
    (c) If your TIA is a fixed-support award, you need only require for-
profit participants to flow down the requirements listed in appendix F 
to this part.


<R05>
Sec. 37.710  What standards do I include for purchasing systems of 
nonprofit organizations?

    (a) So as not to force system changes for any nonprofit participant, 
your expenditure-based TIA will provide that each nonprofit 
participant's purchasing system comply with:
    (1) 32 CFR 33.36, if the participant is a State or local 
governmental organization.
    (2) 32 CFR 32.40 through 32.49 if the participant is a nonprofit 
organization other than a GOCO or FFRDC that is excepted from the 
definition of ``recipient'' in 32 CFR part 32. Although it should occur 
infrequently, if a nonprofit GOCO or FFRDC is a participant, you must 
specify appropriate standards that conform as much as practicable with 
requirements in that participant's other Federal awards.
    (b) If your TIA is a fixed-support award, you need only require 
nonprofit participants to flow down the requirements listed in appendix 
E to this part.


<R04>
      Subpart G_Award Terms Related to Other Administrative Matters


<R05>
Sec. 37.800  Which administrative matters are covered in this subpart?

    This subpart addresses ``non-systemic'' administrative matters that 
do not impose organization-wide requirements on a participant's 
financial management, property management, or purchasing system. Because 
an organization does not have to redesign its systems to accommodate 
award-to-

[[Page 243]]

award variations in these requirements, a TIA that you award may differ 
from other TIAs in the non-systemic requirements that it specifies for a 
given participant, based on the circumstances of the particular research 
project. To eliminate needless administrative complexity, you should 
handle some non-systemic requirements, such as the payment method, in a 
uniform way for the agreement as a whole.

                                Payments


<R05>
Sec. 37.805  If I am awarding a TIA, what payment methods may I specify?

    Your TIA may provide for:
    (a) Reimbursement, as described in 32 CFR 34.12(a)(1), if it is an 
expenditure-based award.
    (b) Advance payments, as described in 32 CFR 34.12(a)(2), subject to 
the conditions in 32 CFR 34.12(b)(2)(i) through (iii).
    (c) Payments based on payable milestones. These are payments made 
according to a schedule that is based on predetermined measures of 
technical progress or other payable milestones. This approach relies 
upon the fact that, as research progresses throughout the term of the 
agreement, observable activity will be taking place. The recipient is 
paid upon the accomplishment of the predetermined measure of progress. 
Fixed-support TIAs must use this payment method and each measure of 
progress appropriately would be one of the well-defined outcomes that 
you identify in the agreement (this does not preclude use of an initial 
advance payment, if there is no alternative to meeting immediate cash 
needs). There are cash management considerations when this payment 
method is used as a means of financing for an expenditure-based TIA (see 
Sec. 37.575 and Sec. 37.1105).


<R05>
Sec. 37.810  What should my TIA's provisions specify for the method and 
frequency of recipients' payment requests?

    The procedure and frequency for payment requests depend upon the 
payment method, as follows:
    (a) For either reimbursements or advance payments, your TIA must 
allow recipients to submit requests for payment at least monthly. You 
may authorize the recipients to use the forms or formats described in 32 
CFR 34.12(d).
    (b) If the payments are based on payable milestones, the recipient 
will submit a report or other evidence of accomplishment to the program 
official at the completion of each predetermined activity. The agreement 
administrator may approve payment to the recipient after receiving 
validation from the program manager that the milestone was successfully 
reached.


<R05>
Sec. 37.815  May the Government withhold payments?

    Your TIA must provide that the administrative agreements officer may 
withhold payments in the circumstances described in 32 CFR 34.12(g), but 
not otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 37.820  Must I require a recipient to return interest on advance 
payments?

    If your expenditure-based TIA provides for either advance payments 
or payable milestones, the agreement must require the recipient to:
    (a) Maintain in an interest-bearing account any advance payments or 
milestone payment amounts received in advance of needs to disburse the 
funds for program purposes unless:
    (1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal grants, 
cooperative agreements, and TIAs per year;
    (2) The best reasonably available interest-bearing account would not 
be expected to earn interest in excess of $1,000 per year on the advance 
or milestone payments; or
    (3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so 
high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non-
Federal cash resources for the project.
    (b) Remit annually the interest earned to the administrative 
agreements officer.

                  Revision of Budget and Program Plans


<R05>
Sec. 37.825  Must I require the recipient to obtain prior approval from 
the Government for changes in plans?

    If it is an expenditure-based award, your agreement must require the 
recipient to obtain the agreement administrator's prior approval if 
there is to

[[Page 244]]

be a change in plans that results in a need for additional Federal 
funding (this is unnecessary for a fixed-support TIA because the 
recipient is responsible for additional costs of achieving the 
outcomes). Other than that, the program official's substantial 
involvement in the project should ensure that the Government has advance 
notice of changes in plans.


<R05>
Sec. 37.830  May I let a recipient charge pre-award costs to the 
agreement?

    Pre-award costs, as long as they are otherwise allowable costs of 
the project, may be charged to an expenditure-based TIA only with the 
specific approval of the agreements officer. All pre-award costs are 
incurred at the recipient's risk (i.e., no DoD Component is obligated to 
reimburse the costs if for any reason the recipient does not receive an 
award or if the award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover 
the costs).

                             Program Income


<R05>
Sec. 37.835  What requirements do I include for program income?

    Your TIA should apply the standards of 32 CFR 34.14 for program 
income that may be generated. Note the need to specify whether the 
recipient is to have any obligation to the Federal Government with 
respect to program income generated after the end of the project period 
(the period, as established in the award document, during which Federal 
support is provided). Doing so is especially important if the TIA 
includes a provision for the recipient to return any amounts to the 
Federal Government (see Sec. 37.580).

                          Intellectual Property


<R05>
Sec. 37.840  What general approach should I take in negotiating data 
and patent rights?

    (a) You should confer with program officials and legal counsel to 
develop an overall strategy for intellectual property that takes into 
account inventions and data that may result from the project and future 
needs the Government may have for rights in them. The strategy should 
take into account any intellectual property the Government is furnishing 
and any pre-existing proprietary information that the recipient is 
furnishing, as well as data and inventions that may be generated under 
the award (recognizing that new data and inventions may be less valuable 
without pre-existing information). All pre-existing intellectual 
property, both the Government's and the recipient's, should be marked to 
give notice of its status.
    (b) Because TIAs entail substantial cost sharing by recipients, you 
must use discretion in negotiating Government rights to data and 
patentable inventions resulting from research under the agreements. The 
considerations in Sec. Sec. 37.845 through 37.875 are intended to serve 
as guidelines, within which you necessarily have considerable latitude 
to negotiate provisions appropriate to a wide variety of circumstances 
that may arise. Your goal should be a good balance between DoD interests 
in:
    (1) Gaining access to the best technologies for defense needs, 
including technologies available in the commercial marketplace, and 
promoting commercialization of technologies resulting from the research. 
Either of these interests may be impeded if you negotiate excessive 
rights for the Government. One objective of TIAs is to help incorporate 
defense requirements into the development of what ultimately will be 
commercially available technologies, an objective that is best served by 
reducing barriers to commercial firms' participation in the research. In 
that way, the commercial technology and industrial base can be a source 
of readily available, reliable, and affordable components, subsystems, 
computer software, and other technological products and manufacturing 
processes for military systems.
    (2) Providing adequate protection of the Government's investment, 
which may be weakened if the Government's rights are inadequate. You 
should consider whether the Government may require access to data or 
inventions for Governmental purposes, such as a need to develop defense-
unique products or processes that the commercial marketplace likely will 
not address.

<R05>
Sec. 37.845  What data rights should I obtain?

    (a) You should seek to obtain what you, with the advice of legal 
counsel, judge is needed to ensure future Government use of technology 
that emerges from the research, as long as doing so is consistent with 
the balance between DoD interests described in Sec. 37.840(b). You 
should consider data in which you wish to obtain license rights and data 
that you may wish to be delivered; since TIAs are assistance instruments 
rather than acquisition instruments, however, it is not expected that 
data would be delivered in most cases. What generally is needed is an 
irrevocable, world-wide license for the Government to use, modify, 
reproduce, release, or disclose for Governmental purposes the data that 
are generated under TIAs (including any data, such as computer software, 
in which a recipient may obtain a copyright). A Governmental purpose is 
any activity in which the United States Government participates, but a 
license for Governmental purposes does not include the right to use, or 
have or permit others to use, modify, reproduce, release, or disclose 
data for commercial purposes.
    (b) You may negotiate licenses of different scope than described in 
paragraph (a) of this section when necessary to accomplish program 
objectives or to protect the Government's interests. Consult with legal 
counsel before negotiating a license of different scope.
    (c) In negotiating data rights, you should consider the rights in 
background data that are necessary to fully utilize technology that is 
expected to result from the TIA, in the event the recipient does not 
commercialize the technology or chooses to protect any invention as a 
trade secret rather than by a patent. If a recipient intends to protect 
any invention as a trade secret, you should consult with your 
intellectual property counsel before deciding what information related 
to the invention the award should require the recipient to report.


<R05>
Sec. 37.850  Should I require recipients to mark data?

    To protect the recipient's interests in data, your TIA should 
require the recipient to mark any particular data that it wishes to 
protect from disclosure with a legend identifying the data as licensed 
data subject to use, release, or disclosure restrictions.


<R05>
Sec. 37.855  How should I handle protected data?

    Prior to releasing or disclosing data marked with a restrictive 
legend (as described in Sec. 37.850) to third parties, you should 
require those parties to agree in writing that they will:
    (a) Use the data only for governmental purposes; and
    (b) Not release or disclose the data without the permission of the 
licensor (i.e., the recipient).


<R05>
Sec. 37.860  What rights should I obtain for inventions?

    (a) You should negotiate rights in inventions that represent a good 
balance between the Government's interests (see Sec. 37.840(b)) and the 
recipient's interests. As explained in appendix B to this part:
    (1) You have the flexibility to negotiate patent rights provisions 
that vary from what the Bayh-Dole statute (Chapter 18 of Title 35, 
U.S.C.) requires in many situations. You have that flexibility because 
TIAs include not only cooperative agreements, but also assistance 
transactions other than grants or cooperative agreements.
    (2) Your TIA becomes an assistance instrument other than a grant or 
cooperative agreement if its patent rights provision varies from what 
Bayh-Dole requires in your situation. However, you need not consider 
that difference in the type of transaction until the agreement is 
finalized, and it should not affect the provision you negotiate.
    (b) As long as it is consistent with the balance between DoD 
interests described in Sec. 37.840(b) and the recipient's interests, 
you should seek to obtain for the Government, when an invention is 
conceived or first actually reduced to practice under a TIA, a 
nonexclusive, nontransferrable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice 
the invention, or to have it practiced, for or on behalf of

[[Page 246]]

the United States throughout the world. The license is for Governmental 
purposes, and does not include the right to practice the invention for 
commercial purposes.
    (c) To provide for the license described in paragraph (b) of this 
section, your TIA generally would include the patent-rights clause that 
37 CFR 401.14 specifies to implement the Bayh-Dole statute's 
requirements. Note that:
    (1) The clause is designed specifically for grants, contracts, and 
cooperative agreements awarded to small businesses and nonprofit 
organizations, the types of funding instruments and recipients to which 
the entire Bayh-Dole statute applies. As explained in appendix B to this 
part, only two Bayh-Dole requirements (in 35 U.S.C. sections 202(c)(4) 
and 203) apply to cooperative agreements with other performers, by 
virtue of an amendment to Bayh-Dole at 35 U.S.C. 210(c).
    (2) You may use the same clause, suitably modified, in cooperative 
agreements with performers other than small businesses and nonprofit 
organizations. Doing so is consistent with a 1983 Presidential 
memorandum that calls for giving other performers rights in inventions 
from Federally supported research that are at least as great as the 
rights that Bayh-Dole gives to small businesses and nonprofit 
organizations (see appendix B to this part for details). That 
Presidential memorandum is incorporated by reference in Executive Order 
12591 (52 FR 13414, 3 CFR, 1987 Comp., p. 220), as amended by Executive 
Order 12618 (52 FR 48661, 3 CFR, 1987 Comp., p. 262).
    (3) The clause provides for flow-down of Bayh-Dole patent-rights 
provisions to subawards with small businesses and nonprofit 
organizations.
    (4) There are provisions in 37 CFR part 401 stating when you must 
include the clause (37 CFR 401.3) and, in cases when it is required, how 
you may modify and tailor it (37 CFR 401.5).
    (d) You may negotiate Government rights of a different scope than 
the standard patent-rights provision described in paragraph (c) of this 
section when necessary to accomplish program objectives and foster the 
Government's interests. If you do so:
    (1) With the help of the program manager and legal counsel, you must 
decide what best represents a reasonable arrangement considering the 
circumstances, including past investments, contributions under the 
current TIA, and potential commercial markets. Taking past investments 
as an example, you should consider whether the Government or the 
recipient has contributed more substantially to the prior research and 
development that provides the foundation for the planned effort. If the 
predominant past contributor to the particular technology has been:
    (i) The Government, then the TIA's patent-rights provision should be 
at or close to the standard Bayh-Dole provision.
    (ii) The recipient, then a less restrictive patent provision may be 
appropriate, to allow the recipient to benefit more directly from its 
investments.
    (2) You should keep in mind that obtaining a nonexclusive license at 
the time of award, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, is 
valuable if the Government later requires access to inventions to enable 
development of defense-unique products or processes that the commercial 
marketplace is not addressing. If you do not obtain a license at the 
time of award, you should consider alternative approaches to ensure 
access, such as negotiating a priced option for obtaining nonexclusive 
licenses in the future to inventions that are conceived or reduced to 
practice under the TIA.
    (3) You also may consider whether you want to provide additional 
flexibility by giving the recipient more time than the standard patent-
rights provision does to:
    (i) Notify the Government of an invention, from the time the 
inventor discloses it within the for-profit firm.
    (ii) Inform the Government whether it intends to take title to the 
invention.
    (iii) Commercialize the invention, before the Government license 
rights in the invention become effective.


<R05>
Sec. 37.865  Should my patent provision include march-in rights?

    Your TIA's patent rights provision should include the Bayh-Dole 
march-in

[[Page 247]]

rights clause at paragraph (j)(1) of 37 CFR 401.14, or an equivalent 
clause, concerning actions that the Government may take to obtain the 
right to use subject inventions, if the recipient fails to take 
effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject 
inventions within a reasonable time. The march-in provision may be 
modified to best meet the needs of the program. However, only 
infrequently should the march-in provision be entirely removed (e.g., 
you may wish to do so if a recipient is providing most of the funding 
for a research project, with the Government providing a much smaller 
share).


<R05>
Sec. 37.870  Should I require recipients to mark documents related to 
inventions?

    To protect the recipient's interest in inventions, your TIA should 
require the recipient to mark documents disclosing inventions it desires 
to protect by obtaining a patent. The recipient should mark the 
documents with a legend identifying them as intellectual property 
subject to public release or public disclosure restrictions, as provided 
in 35 U.S.C. 205.


<R05>
Sec. 37.875  Should my TIA include a provision concerning foreign access 
to technology?

    (a) Consistent with the objective of enhancing the national security 
by increasing DoD reliance on the U.S. commercial technology and 
industrial bases, you must include a provision in the TIA that addresses 
foreign access to technology developed under the TIA.
    (b) The provision must provide, as a minimum, that any transfer of 
the:
    (1) Technology must be consistent with the U.S. export laws, 
regulations and policies (e.g., the International Traffic in Arms 
Regulation at chapter I, subchapter M, title 22 of the CFR (22 CFR parts 
120 through 130), the DoD Industrial Security Regulation in DoD 5220.22-
R,\6\ and the Department of Commerce Export Regulation at chapter VII, 
subchapter C, title 15 of the CFR (15 CFR parts 730 through 774), as 
applicable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ Electronic copies may be obtained at the Washington Headquarters 
Services Internet site http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives. Paper copies 
may be obtained, at cost, from the National Technical Information 
Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Exclusive right to use or sell the technology in the United 
States must, unless the Government grants a waiver, require that 
products embodying the technology or produced through the use of the 
technology will be manufactured substantially in the United States. The 
provision may further provide that:
    (i) In individual cases, the Government may waive the requirement of 
substantial manufacture in the United States upon a showing by the 
recipient that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to 
transfer the technology under similar terms to those likely to 
manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the 
circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.
    (ii) In those cases, the DoD Component may require a refund to the 
Government of some or all the funds paid under the TIA for the 
development of the transferred technology.
    (c) You may, but are not required to, seek to negotiate a domestic 
manufacture condition for transfers of nonexclusive rights to use or 
sell the technology in the United States, to parallel the one described 
for exclusive licenses in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if you judge 
that nonexclusive licenses for foreign manufacture could effectively 
preclude the establishment of domestic sources of the technology for 
defense purposes.

                  Financial and Programmatic Reporting


<R05>
Sec. 37.880  What requirements must I include for periodic reports on 
program and business status?

    Your TIA must include either:
    (a) The requirements in 32 CFR 32.51 and 32.52 for status reports on 
programmatic performance and, if it is an expenditure-based award, on 
financial performance; or
    (b) Alternative requirements that, as a minimum, include periodic 
reports addressing program and, if it is an expenditure-based award, 
business status. You must require submission of the reports at least 
annually, and you may require submission as frequently as

[[Page 248]]

quarterly (this does not preclude a recipient from electing to submit 
more frequently than quarterly the financial information that is 
required to process payment requests if the award is an expenditure-
based TIA that uses reimbursement or advance payments under Sec. 
37.810(a)). The requirements for the content of the reports are as 
follows:
    (1) The program portions of the reports must address progress toward 
achieving program performance goals, including current issues, problems, 
or developments.
    (2) The business portions of the reports, applicable only to 
expenditure-based awards, must provide summarized details on the status 
of resources (federal funds and non-federal cost sharing), including an 
accounting of expenditures for the period covered by the report. The 
report should compare the resource status with any payment and 
expenditure schedules or plans provided in the original award; explain 
any major deviations from those schedules; and discuss actions that will 
be taken to address the deviations. You may require a recipient to 
separately identify in these reports the expenditures for each 
participant in a consortium and for each programmatic milestone or task, 
if you, after consulting with the program official, judge that those 
additional details are needed for good stewardship.


<R05>
Sec. 37.885  May I require updated program plans?

    In addition to reports on progress to date, your TIA may include a 
provision requiring the recipient to annually prepare updated technical 
plans for the future conduct of the research effort. If your TIA does 
include a requirement for annual program plans, you also must require 
the recipient to submit the annual program plans to the agreements 
officer responsible for administering the TIA.


<R05>
Sec. 37.890  Must I require a final performance report?

    You need not require a final performance report that addresses all 
major accomplishments under the TIA. If you do not do so, however, there 
must be an alternative that satisfies the requirement in DoD Instruction 
3200.14\7\ to document all DoD Science and Technology efforts and 
disseminate the results through the Defense Technical Information Center 
(DTIC). An example of an alternative would be periodic reports 
throughout the performance of the research that collectively cover the 
entire project.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See footnote 6 to Sec. 37.875(b)(1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 37.895  How is the final performance report to be sent to the Defense 
Technical Information Center?

    (a) Whether your TIA requires a final performance report or uses an 
alternative means under Sec. 37.890,\8\ you may include an award term 
or condition or otherwise instruct the recipient to submit the 
documentation, electronically if available, either:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ Additional information on electronic submission to the DTIC can 
be found online, currently at http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/submitting/elec--
subm.html.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) Directly to the DTIC; or
    (2) To the office that is administering the award (for subsequent 
transmission to the DTIC).
    (b) If you specify that the recipient is to submit the report 
directly to the DTIC, you also:
    (1) Must instruct the recipient to include a fully completed 
Standard Form 298, ``Report Documentation Page,'' with each document, so 
that the DTIC can recognize the document as being related to the 
particular award and properly record its receipt; and
    (2) Should advise the recipient to provide a copy of the completed 
Standard Form 298 to the agreements officer responsible for 
administering the TIA.


<R05>
Sec. 37.900  May I tell a participant that information in financial and 
programmatic reports will not be publicly disclosed?

    You may tell a participant that:
    (a) We may exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information 
Act (FOIA) a trade secret or commercial and financial information that a 
participant provides after the award, if the information is privileged 
or confidential information. The DoD Component that receives the FOIA 
request will review the information in accordance with DoD procedures at 
32 CFR

[[Page 249]]

286.23(h) (and any DoD Component supplementary procedures) to determine 
whether it is privileged or confidential information under the FOIA 
exemption at 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), as implemented by the DoD at 32 CFR 
286.12(d).
    (b) If the participant also provides information in the course of a 
competition prior to award, there is a statutory exemption for five 
years from FOIA disclosure requirements for certain types of information 
submitted at that time (see Sec. 37.420).


<R05>
Sec. 37.905  Must I make receipt of the final performance report a 
condition for final payment?

    If a final report is required, your TIA should make receipt of the 
report a condition for final payment. If the payments are based on 
payable milestones, the submission and acceptance of the final report by 
the Government representative will be incorporated as an event that is a 
prerequisite for one of the payable milestones.

                Records Retention and Access Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 37.910  How long must I require participants to keep records 
related to the TIA?

    Your TIA must require participants to keep records related to the 
TIA (for which the agreement provides Government access under Sec. 
37.915) for a period of three years after submission of the final 
financial status report for an expenditure-based TIA or final 
programmatic status report for a fixed-support TIA, with the following 
exceptions:
    (a) The participant must keep records longer than three years after 
submission of the final financial status report if the records relate to 
an audit, claim, or dispute that begins but does not reach its 
conclusion within the 3-year period. In that case, the participant must 
keep the records until the matter is resolved and final action taken.
    (b) Records for any real property or equipment acquired with project 
funds under the TIA must be kept for three years after final 
disposition.


<R05>
Sec. 37.915  What requirement for access to a for-profit participant's 
records do I include in a TIA?

    (a) If a for-profit participant currently grants access to its 
records to the DCAA or other Federal Government auditors, your TIA must 
include for that participant the standard access-to-records requirements 
at 32 CFR 34.42(e). If the agreement is a fixed-support TIA, the 
language in 32 CFR 34.42(e) may be modified to provide access to records 
concerning the recipient's technical performance, without requiring 
access to the recipient's financial or other records. Note that any need 
to address access to technical records in this way is in addition to, 
not in lieu of, the need to address rights in data (see Sec. 37.845).
    (b) For other for-profit participants that do not currently give the 
Federal Government direct access to their records and are not willing to 
grant full access to records pertinent to the award, there is no set 
requirement to include a provision in your TIA for Government access to 
records. If the audit provision of an expenditure-based TIA gives an IPA 
access to the recipient's financial records for audit purposes, the 
Federal Government must have access to the IPA's reports and working 
papers and you need not include a provision requiring direct Government 
access to the recipient's financial records. For both fixed-support and 
expenditure-based TIAs, you may wish to negotiate Government access to 
recipient records concerning technical performance. Should you negotiate 
a provision giving access only to specific Government officials (e.g., 
the agreements officer), rather than a provision giving Government 
access generally, it is important to let participants know that the OIG, 
DoD, has a statutory right of access to records and other materials to 
which other DoD Component officials have access.


<R05>
Sec. 37.920  What requirement for access to a nonprofit participant's 
records do I include in a TIA?

    Your TIA must include for any nonprofit participant the standard 
access-to-records requirement at:

[[Page 250]]

    (a) 32 CFR 33.42(e), for a participant that is a State or local 
governmental organization.
    (b) 32 CFR 32.53(e), for a participant that is a nonprofit 
organization. The same requirement applies to any nonprofit GOCO or 
FFRDC, even though nonprofit GOCOs and FFRDCs are exempted from the 
definition of ``recipient'' in 32 CFR part 32.

                       Termination and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 37.925  What requirements do I include for termination and 
enforcement?

    Your TIA must apply the standards of 32 CFR 34.51 for termination, 
32 CFR 34.52 for enforcement, and your organization's procedures 
implementing 32 CFR 22.815 for disputes and appeals.


<R04>
                      Subpart H_Executing the Award


<R05>
Sec. 37.1000  What are my responsibilities at the time of award?

    At the time of the award, you must:
    (a) Ensure that the award document contains the appropriate terms 
and conditions and is signed by the appropriate parties, in accordance 
with Sec. Sec. 37.1005 through 37.1015.
    (b) Document your analysis of the agreement in the award file, as 
discussed in Sec. 37.1020.
    (c) Provide information about the award to offices responsible for 
reporting, as described in Sec. Sec. 37.1025 through 37.1035.
    (d) Distribute copies of the award document, as required by Sec. 
37.1045.

                           The Award Document


<R05>
Sec. 37.1005  What are my general responsibilities concerning the award 
document?

    You are responsible for ensuring that the award document is complete 
and accurate. Your objective is to create a document that:
    (a) Addresses all issues;
    (b) States requirements directly. It is not helpful to readers to 
incorporate statutes or rules by reference, without sufficient 
explanation of the requirements. You generally should not incorporate 
clauses from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR parts 1-53) or 
Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (48 CFR parts 201-
253), because those provisions are designed for procurement contracts 
that are used to acquire goods and services, rather than for TIAs or 
other assistance instruments.
    (c) Is written in clear and concise language, to minimize potential 
ambiguity.


<R05>
Sec. 37.1010  What substantive issues should my award document address?

    You necessarily will design and negotiate a TIA individually to meet 
the specific requirements of the particular project, so the complete 
list of substantive issues that you will address in the award document 
may vary. Every award document must address:
    (a) Project scope. The scope is an overall vision statement for the 
project, including a discussion of the project's purpose, objectives, 
and detailed military and commercial goals. It is a critical provision 
because it provides a context for resolving issues that may arise during 
post-award administration. In a fixed-support TIA, you also must clearly 
specify the well-defined outcomes that reliably indicate the amount of 
effort expended and serve as the basis for the level of the fixed 
support (see Sec. Sec. 37.305 and 37.560(a)).
    (b) Project management. You should describe the nature of the 
relationship between the Federal Government and the recipient; the 
relationship among the participants, if the recipient is an 
unincorporated consortium; and the overall technical and administrative 
management of the project. TIAs are used to carry out collaborative 
relationships between the Federal Government and the recipient. 
Consequently, there must be substantial involvement of the DoD program 
official (see Sec. 37.220) and usually the administrative agreements 
officer. The program official provides technical insight, which differs 
from the usual technical oversight of a project. The management 
provision also should discuss how you and the recipient will make any 
modifications to the TIA.
    (c) Termination, enforcement, and disputes. Your TIA must provide 
for termination, enforcement remedies, and

[[Page 251]]

disputes and appeals procedures, in accordance with Sec. 37.925.
    (d) Funding. You must:
    (1) Show the total amount of the agreement and the total period of 
performance.
    (2) If the TIA is an expenditure-based award, state the Government's 
and recipient's agreed-upon cost shares. The award document should 
identify values for any in-kind contributions, determined in accordance 
with Sec. Sec. 37.530 through 37.555, to preclude later disagreements 
about them.
    (3) Specify the amount of Federal funds obligated and the 
performance period for those obligated funds.
    (4) State, if the agreement is to be incrementally funded, that the 
Government's obligation for additional funding is contingent upon the 
availability of funds and that no legal obligation on the part of the 
Government exists until additional funds are made available and the 
agreement is amended. You also must include a prior approval requirement 
for changes in plans requiring additional Government funding, in 
accordance with Sec. 37.825.
    (e) Payment. You must choose the payment method and tell the 
recipient how, when, and where to submit payment requests, as discussed 
in Sec. Sec. 37.805 through 37.815. Your payment method must take into 
account sound cash management practices by avoiding unwarranted cash 
advances. For an expenditure-based TIA, your payment provision must 
require the return of interest should excess cash balances occur, in 
accordance with Sec. 37.820. For any TIA using the milestone payment 
method described in Sec. 37.805(c), you must include language notifying 
the recipient that post-award administrators may adjust amounts of 
future milestone payments if a project's expenditures fall too far below 
the projections that were the basis for setting the amounts (see Sec. 
37.575(c) and Sec. 37.1105(c)).
    (f) Records retention and access to records. You must include the 
records retention requirement at Sec. 37.910. You also must provide for 
access to for-profit and nonprofit participants' records, in accordance 
with Sec. 37.915 and Sec. 37.920.
    (g) Patents and data rights. In designing the patents and data 
rights provision, you must set forth the minimum required Federal 
Government rights in intellectual property generated under the award and 
address related matters, as provided in Sec. Sec. 37.840 through 
37.875. It is important to define all essential terms in the patent 
rights provision.
    (h) Foreign access to technology. You must include a provision, in 
accordance with Sec. 37.875, concerning foreign access and domestic 
manufacture of products using technology generated under the award.
    (i) Title to, management of, and disposition of tangible property. 
Your property provisions for for-profit and nonprofit participants must 
be in accordance with Sec. Sec. 37.685 through 37.700.
    (j) Financial management systems. For an expenditure-based award, 
you must specify the minimum standards for financial management systems 
of both for-profit and nonprofit participants, in accordance with 
Sec. Sec. 37.615 and 37.620.
    (k) Allowable costs. If the TIA is an expenditure-based award, you 
must specify the standards that both for-profit and nonprofit 
participants are to use to determine which costs may be charged to the 
project, in accordance with Sec. Sec. 37.625 through 37.635, as well as 
Sec. 37.830.
    (l) Audits. If your TIA is an expenditure-based award, you must 
include an audit provision for both for-profit and nonprofit 
participants and subrecipients, in accordance with Sec. Sec. 37.640 
through 37.670 and Sec. 37.680.
    (m) Purchasing system standards. You should include a provision 
specifying the standards in Sec. Sec. 37.705 and 37.710 for purchasing 
systems of for-profit and nonprofit participants, respectively.
    (n) Program income. You should specify requirements for program 
income, in accordance with Sec. 37.835.
    (o) Financial and programmatic reporting. You must specify the 
reports that the recipient is required to submit and tell the recipient 
when and where to submit them, in accordance with Sec. Sec. 37.880 
through 37.905.
    (p) Assurances for applicable national policy requirements. You must 
incorporate assurances of compliance with applicable requirements in 
Federal

[[Page 252]]

statutes, Executive orders, or regulations (except for national policies 
that require certifications). Appendix D to this part contains a list of 
commonly applicable requirements that you need to augment with any 
specific requirements that apply in your particular circumstances (e.g., 
general provisions in the appropriations act for the specific funds that 
you are obligating).
    (q) Other routine matters. The agreement should address any other 
issues that need clarification, including who in the Government will be 
responsible for post-award administration and the statutory authority or 
authorities for entering into the TIA (see appendix B to this part for a 
discussion of statutory authorities). In addition, the agreement must 
specify that it takes precedence over any inconsistent terms and 
conditions in collateral documents such as attachments to the TIA or the 
recipient's articles of collaboration.


<R05>
Sec. 37.1015  How do I decide who must sign the TIA if the recipient is 
an unincorporated consortium?

    (a) If the recipient is a consortium that is not formally 
incorporated and the consortium members prefer to have the agreement 
signed by all of them individually, you may execute the agreement in 
that manner.
    (b) If they wish to designate one consortium member to sign the 
agreement on behalf of the consortium as a whole, you should not decide 
whether to execute the agreement in that way until you review the 
consortium's articles of collaboration with legal counsel.
    (1) The purposes of the review are to:
    (i) Determine whether the articles properly authorize one 
participant to sign on behalf of the other participants and are binding 
on all consortium members with respect to the research project; and
    (ii) Assess the risk that otherwise could exist when entering into 
an agreement signed by a single member on behalf of a consortium that is 
not a legal entity. For example, you should assess whether the articles 
of collaboration adequately address consortium members' future 
liabilities related to the research project (i.e., whether they will 
have joint and severable liability).
    (2) After the review, in consultation with legal counsel, you should 
determine whether it is better to have all of the consortium members 
sign the agreement individually or to allow them to designate one member 
to sign on all members' behalf.

                  Reporting Information About the Award


<R05>
Sec. 37.1020  What must I document in my award file?

    You should include in your award file an agreements analysis in 
which you:
    (a) Briefly describe the program and detail the specific military 
and commercial benefits that should result from the project supported by 
the TIA. If the recipient is a consortium that is not formally 
incorporated, you should attach a copy of the signed articles of 
collaboration.
    (b) Describe the process that led to the award of the TIA, including 
how you and program officials solicited and evaluated proposals and 
selected the one supported through the TIA.
    (c) Explain how you decided that a TIA was the most appropriate 
instrument, in accordance with the factors in Subpart B of this part. 
Your explanation must include your answers to the relevant questions in 
Sec. 37.225(a) through (d).
    (d) Explain how you valued the recipient's cost sharing 
contributions, in accordance with Sec. Sec. 37.530 through 37.555. For 
a fixed-support TIA, you must document the analysis you did (see Sec. 
37.560) to set the fixed level of Federal support; the documentation 
must explain how you determined the recipient's minimum cost share and 
show how you estimated the expenditures required to achieve the project 
outcomes.
    (e) Document the results of your negotiation, addressing all 
significant issues in the TIA's provisions. For example, this includes 
specific explanations if you:
    (1) Specify requirements for a participant's systems that vary from 
the standard requirements in Sec. Sec. 37.615(a), 37.625(a), 37.630, or 
37.705(a) in cases where those sections provide flexibility for you to 
do so.
    (2) Provide that any audits are to be performed by an IPA, rather 
than the

[[Page 253]]

DCAA, where permitted under Sec. 37.650. Your documentation must 
include:
    (i) The names and addresses of business units for which IPAs will be 
the auditors;
    (ii) Estimated amounts of Federal funds expected under the award for 
those business units; and
    (iii) The basis (e.g., a written statement from the recipient) for 
your judging that the business units do not currently perform under 
types of awards described in Sec. 37.650(b)(1) and (2) and are not 
willing to grant the DCAA audit access.
    (3) Include an intellectual property provision that varies from 
Bayh-Dole requirements.
    (4) Determine that cost sharing is impracticable.


<R05>
Sec. 37.1025  Must I report information to the Defense Assistance Awards 
Data System?

    Yes, you must give the necessary information about the award to the 
office in your organization that is responsible for preparing DD Form 
2566, ``DoD Assistance Award Action Report,'' reports for the Defense 
Assistance Award Data System, to ensure timely and accurate reporting of 
data required by 31 U.S.C. 6101-6106 (see 32 CFR part 21, subpart E).


<R05>
Sec. 37.1030  What information must I report to the Defense Technical 
Information Center?

    (a) For any TIA, you must give your answers to the questions in 
Sec. 37.225(a) through (d) to the office in your DoD Component that is 
responsible for providing data on TIAs to the DTIC. Contact DTIC staff 
either by electronic mail at aq@dtic.mil, by telephone at 1-800-225-
3842, or at DTIC-OCA, 8725 John J. Kingman Rd., Suite 0944, Fort 
Belvoir, VA 22060-6218, if you are unsure about the responsible office 
in your DoD Component. The DTIC compiles the information to help the 
Department of Defense measure the Department-wide benefits of using TIAs 
and assess the instruments' value in helping to meet the policy 
objectives described in Sec. 37.205(b) and appendix A to this part.
    (b) If the TIA uses the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371, as described in 
Sec. 37.1035, your information submission for the DTIC under paragraph 
(a) of this section must include the additional data required for the 
DoD's annual report to Congress.
    (c) If, as permitted under Sec. 37.650, the TIA includes a 
provision allowing a for-profit participant to have audits performed by 
an IPA, rather than the DCAA, you must report that fact with the other 
information you submit about the TIA. Note that you also must include 
information about any use of IPAs permitted by subawards that 
participants make to for-profit firms, as provided in Sec. 37.670. 
Information about a subaward under the TIA must be reported even if you 
receive the information in a subsequent year, when information about the 
TIA itself does not need to be reported.
    (d) The requirements in this section to report information to the 
DTIC should not be confused with the post-award requirement to forward 
copies of technical reports to the DTIC, as described at Sec. Sec. 
37.890 and 37.895. The reporting requirements in this section are 
assigned the Report Control Symbol DD-AT&L(A) 1936.


<R05>
Sec. 37.1035  How do I know if my TIA uses the 10 U.S.C. 2371 authority 
and I must report additional data under Sec. 37.1030(b)?

    As explained in appendix B to this part, a TIA uses the authority of 
10 U.S.C. 2371 and therefore must be included in the DoD's annual report 
to Congress on the use of 10 U.S.C. 2371 authorities if it:
    (a) Is an assistance transaction other than a grant or cooperative 
agreement, by virtue of its patent rights provision; or
    (b) Includes a provision to recover funds from a recipient, as 
described at Sec. 37.580.


<R05>
Sec. 37.1040  When and how do I report information required by 
Sec. 37.1035?

    Information that you report, in accordance with Sec. 37.1030, to 
the office that your DoD Component designates as the central point for 
reporting to the DTIC must be:

[[Page 254]]

    (a) Submitted by the dates that your central point establishes 
(which is consistent with the schedule DTIC specifies to DoD 
Components).
    (b) In the format that your central point provides (which is 
consistent with the format that the DTIC specifies to DoD Components).

                Distributing Copies of the Award Document


<R05>
Sec. 37.1045  To whom must I send copies of the award document?

    You must send a copy of the award document to the:
    (a) Recipient. You must include on the first page of the recipient's 
copy a prominent notice about the current DoD requirements for payment 
by electronic funds transfer (EFT).
    (b) Office you designate to administer the TIA. You are strongly 
encouraged to delegate post-award administration to the regional office 
of the Defense Contract Management Agency or Office of Naval Research 
that administers awards to the recipient. When delegating, you should 
clearly indicate on the cover sheet or first page of the award document 
that the award is a TIA, to help the post-award administrator 
distinguish it from other types of assistance instruments.
    (c) Finance and accounting office designated to make the payments to 
the recipient.


<R04>
                   Subpart I_Post-Award Administration


<R05>
Sec. 37.1100  What are my responsibilities generally as an administrative 
agreements officer for a TIA?

    As the administrative agreements officer for a TIA, you have the 
responsibilities that your office agreed to accept in the delegation 
from the office that made the award. Generally, you will have the same 
responsibilities as a post-award administrator of a grant or cooperative 
agreement, as described in 32 CFR 22.715. Responsibilities for TIAs 
include:
    (a) Advising agreements officers before they award TIAs on how to 
establish award terms and conditions that better meet research 
programmatic needs, facilitate effective post-award administration, and 
ensure good stewardship of Federal funds.
    (b) Participating as the business partner to the DoD program 
official to ensure the Government's substantial involvement in the 
research project. This may involve attendance with program officials at 
kickoff meetings or post-award conferences with recipients. It also may 
involve attendance at the consortium management's periodic meetings to 
review technical progress, financial status, and future program plans.
    (c) Tracking and processing of reports required by the award terms 
and conditions, including periodic business status reports, programmatic 
progress reports, and patent reports.
    (d) Handling payment requests and related matters. For a TIA using 
advance payments, that includes reviews of progress to verify that there 
is continued justification for advancing funds, as discussed in Sec. 
37.1105(b). For a TIA using milestone payments, it includes making any 
needed adjustments in future milestone payment amounts, as discussed in 
Sec. 37.1105(c).
    (e) Coordinating audit requests and reviewing audit reports for both 
single audits of participants' systems and any award-specific audits 
that may be needed, as discussed in Sec. Sec. 37.1115 and 37.1120.
    (f) Responding, after coordination with program officials, to 
recipient requests for permission to sell or exclusively license 
intellectual property to entities that do not agree to manufacture 
substantially in the United States, as described in Sec. 37.875(b). 
Before you grant approval for any technology, you must secure assurance 
that the Government will be able to use the technology (e.g., a 
reasonable license for Government use, if the recipient is selling the 
technology) or seek reimbursement of the Government's investments.
    (g) Notifying the agreements officer who made the award if a 
participant informs you about a subaward allowing a for-profit 
subrecipient to have audits performed by an IPA, rather than the DCAA. 
You should alert the awarding official that he or she must report the 
information, as required by Sec. 37.1030(c).

[[Page 255]]


<R05>
Sec. 37.1105  What additional duties do I have as the administrator of 
a TIA with advance payments or payable milestones?

    Your additional post-award responsibilities as an administrative 
agreements officer for an expenditure-based TIA with advance payments or 
payable milestones are to ensure good cash management. To do so, you 
must:
    (a) For any expenditure-based TIA with advance payments or payable 
milestones, forward to the responsible payment office any interest that 
the recipient remits in accordance with Sec. 37.820(b). The payment 
office will return the amounts to the Department of the Treasury's 
miscellaneous receipts account.
    (b) For any expenditure-based TIA with advance payments, consult 
with the program official and consider whether program progress reported 
in periodic reports, in relation to reported expenditures, is sufficient 
to justify your continued authorization of advance payments under Sec. 
37.805(b).
    (c) For any expenditure-based TIA using milestone payments, work 
with the program official at the completion of each payable milestone or 
upon receipt of the next business status report to:
    (1) Compare the total amount of project expenditures, as recorded in 
the payable milestone report or business status report, with the 
projected budget for completing the milestone; and
    (2) Adjust future payable milestones, as needed, if expenditures lag 
substantially behind what was originally projected and you judge that 
the recipient is receiving Federal funds sooner than necessary for 
program purposes. Before making adjustments, you should consider how 
large a deviation is acceptable at the time of the milestone. For 
example, suppose that the first milestone payment for a TIA you are 
administering is $50,000, and that the awarding official set the amount 
based on a projection that the recipient would have to expend $100,000 
to reach the milestone (i.e., the original plan was for the recipient's 
share at that milestone to be 50% of project expenditures). If the 
milestone payment report shows $90,000 in expenditures, the recipient's 
share at this point is 44% ($40,000 out of the total $90,000 expended, 
with the balance provided by the $50,000 milestone payment of Federal 
funds). For this example, you should adjust future milestones if you 
judge that a 6% difference in the recipient's share at the first 
milestone is too large, but not otherwise. Remember that milestone 
payment amounts are not meant to track expenditures precisely at each 
milestone and that a recipient's share will increase as it continues to 
perform research and expend funds, until it completes another milestone 
to trigger the next Federal payment.


<R05>
Sec. 37.1110  What other responsibilities related to payments do I have?

    If you are the administrative agreements officer, you have the 
responsibilities described in 32 CFR 22.810(c), regardless of the 
payment method. You also must ensure that you do not withhold payments, 
except in one of the circumstances described in 32 CFR 34.12(g).


<R05>
Sec. 37.1115  What are my responsibilities related to participants' 
single audits?

    For audits of for-profit participant's systems, under Sec. Sec. 
37.640 through 37.660, you are the focal point within the Department of 
Defense for ensuring that participants submit audit reports and for 
resolving any findings in those reports. Nonprofit participants send 
their single audit reports to a Governmentwide clearinghouse. For those 
participants, the Office of the Assistant Inspector General (Auditing) 
should receive any DoD-specific findings from the clearinghouse and 
refer them to you for resolution, if you are the appropriate official to 
do so.


<R05>
Sec. 37.1120  When and how may I request an award-specific audit?

    Guidance on when and how you should request additional audits for 
expenditure-based TIAs is identical to the guidance for grants officers 
in 32 CFR 34.16(d). If you require an award-specific examination or 
audit of a for-profit participant's records related to a TIA, you must 
use the auditor specified in the award terms and conditions, which 
should be the same auditor who

[[Page 256]]

performs periodic audits of the participant. The DCAA and the OIG, DoD, 
are possible sources of advice on audit-related issues, such as 
appropriate audit objectives and scope.


<R04>
            Subpart J_Definitions of Terms Used in This Part


<R05>
Sec. 37.1205  Advance.

    A payment made to a recipient before the recipient disburses the 
funds for program purposes. Advance payments may be based upon 
recipients' requests or predetermined payment schedules.


<R05>
Sec. 37.1210  Advanced research.

    Research that creates new technology or demonstrates the viability 
of applying existing technology to new products and processes in a 
general way. Advanced research is most closely analogous to 
precompetitive technology development in the commercial sector (i.e., 
early phases of research and development on which commercial competitors 
are willing to collaborate, because the work is not so coupled to 
specific products and processes that the results of the work must be 
proprietary). It does not include development of military systems and 
hardware where specific requirements have been defined. It is typically 
funded in Research, Development, Test and Evaluation programs within 
Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development.


<R05>
Sec. 37.1215  Agreements officer.

    An official with the authority to enter into, administer, and/or 
terminate TIAs (see Sec. 37.125).


<R05>
Sec. 37.1220  Applied research.

    Efforts that attempt to determine and exploit the potential of 
scientific discoveries or improvements in technology such as new 
materials, devices, methods and processes. It typically is funded in 
Research, Development, Test and Evaluation programs within Budget 
Activity 2, Applied Research (also known informally as research category 
6.2) programs. Applied research normally follows basic research but may 
not be fully distinguishable from the related basic research. The term 
does not include efforts whose principal aim is the design, development, 
or testing of specific products, systems or processes to be considered 
for sale or acquisition; these efforts are within the definition of 
``development.''


<R05>
Sec. 37.1225  Articles of collaboration.

    An agreement among the participants in a consortium that is not 
formally incorporated as a legal entity, by which they establish their 
relative rights and responsibilities (see Sec. 37.515).


<R05>
Sec. 37.1230  Assistance.

    The transfer of a thing of value to a recipient to carry out a 
public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by a law of the 
United States (see 31 U.S.C. 6101(3)). Grants, cooperative agreements, 
and technology investment agreements are examples of legal instruments 
used to provide assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 37.1235  Award-specific audit.

    An audit of a single TIA, usually done at the cognizant agreements 
officer's request, to help resolve issues that arise during or after the 
performance of the research project. An award-specific audit of an 
individual award differs from a periodic audit of a participant (as 
defined in Sec. 37.1325).


<R05>
Sec. 37.1240  Basic research.

    Efforts directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in 
science and engineering, rather than the practical application of that 
knowledge and understanding. It typically is funded within Research, 
Development, Test and Evaluation programs in Budget Activity 1, Basic 
Research (also known informally as research category 6.1).


<R05>
Sec. 37.1245  Cash contributions.

    A recipient's cash expenditures made as contributions toward cost 
sharing, including expenditures of money that third parties contributed 
to the recipient.


<R05>
Sec. 37.1250  Commercial firm.

    A for-profit firm or segment of a for-profit firm (e.g., a division 
or other business unit) that does a substantial portion of its business 
in the commercial marketplace.

[[Page 257]]


<R05>
Sec. 37.1255  Consortium.

    A group of research-performing organizations that either is formally 
incorporated or that otherwise agrees to jointly carry out a research 
project (see definition of ``articles of collaboration,'' in Sec. 
37.1225).


<R05>
Sec. 37.1260  Cooperative agreement.

    A legal instrument which, consistent with 31 U.S.C. 6305, is used to 
enter into the same kind of relationship as a grant (see definition of 
``grant,'' in Sec. 37.1295), except that substantial involvement is 
expected between the Department of Defense and the recipient when 
carrying out the activity contemplated by the cooperative agreement. The 
term does not include ``cooperative research and development 
agreements'' as defined in 15 U.S.C. 3710a.


<R05>
Sec. 37.1265  Cost sharing.

    A portion of project costs that are borne by the recipient or non-
Federal third parties on behalf of the recipient, rather than by the 
Federal Government.


<R05>
Sec. 37.1270  Data.

    Recorded information, regardless of form or method of recording. The 
term includes technical data, which are data of a scientific or 
technical nature, and computer software. It does not include financial, 
cost, or other administrative information related to the administration 
of a TIA.


<R05>
Sec. 37.1275  DoD Component.

    The Office of the Secretary of Defense, a Military Department, a 
Defense Agency, or a DoD Field Activity.

of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more per 
unit.


<R05>
Sec. 37.1285  Expenditure-based award.

    A Federal Government contract or assistance award for which the 
amounts of interim payments or the total amount ultimately paid (i.e., 
the sum of interim payments and final payment) are subject to 
redetermination or adjustment, based on the amounts expended by the 
recipient in carrying out the purposes for which the award was made. 
Most Federal Government grants and cooperative agreements are 
expenditure-based awards.


<R05>
Sec. 37.1290  Expenditures or outlays.

    Charges made to the project or program. They may be reported either 
on a cash or accrual basis, as shown in the following table:

[[Page 258]]

<R05>
Sec. 37.1295  Grant.

    A legal instrument which, consistent with 31 U.S.C. 6304, is used to 
enter into a relationship:
    (a) The principal purpose of which is to transfer a thing of value 
to the recipient to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation 
authorized by a law of the United States, rather than to acquire 
property or services for the Department of Defense's direct benefit or 
use.
    (b) In which substantial involvement is not expected between the 
Department of Defense and the recipient when carrying out the activity 
contemplated by the grant.


<R05>

1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001); and
    (b) Is subject to the provisions of OMB Circular A-110, 
``Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with 
Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit 
Organizations,'' as implemented by the Department of Defense at 32 CFR 
part 32.


<R05>
Sec. 37.1310  Intellectual property.

    Inventions, data, works of authorship, and other intangible products 
of intellectual effort that can be owned by a person, whether or not 
they are patentable or may be copyrighted. The term also includes mask 
works, such as those used in microfabrication, whether or not they are 
tangible.


<R05>
Sec. 37.1315  Nonprofit organization.

    (a) Any corporation, trust, association, cooperative or other 
organization that:
    (1) Is operated primarily for scientific, educational, service, or 
similar purposes in the public interest.
    (2) Is not organized primarily for profit; and

[[Page 259]]

    (3) Uses its net proceeds to maintain, improve, or expand the 
operations of the organization.
    (b) The term includes any nonprofit institution of higher education 
or nonprofit hospital.


<R05>
Sec. 37.1320  Participant.

    A consortium member or, in the case of an agreement with a single 
for-profit entity, the recipient. Note that a for-profit participant may 
be a firm or a segment of a firm (e.g., a division or other business 
unit).


<R05>
Sec. 37.1325  Periodic audit.

    An audit of a participant, performed at an agreed-upon time (usually 
a regular time interval), to determine whether the participant as a 
whole is managing its Federal awards in compliance with the terms of 
those awards. Appendix C to this part describes what such an audit may 
cover. A periodic audit of a participant differs from an award-specific 
audit of an individual award (as defined in Sec. 37.1235).


<R05>
Sec. 37.1330  Procurement contract.

    A Federal Government procurement contract. It is a legal instrument 
which, consistent with 31 U.S.C. 6303, reflects a relationship between 
the Federal Government and a State, a local government, or other 
recipient when the principal purpose of the instrument is to acquire 
property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal 
Government. See the more detailed definition of the term ``contract'' at 
48 CFR 2.101.


<R05>
Sec. 37.1335  Program income.

    Gross income earned by the recipient or a participant that is 
generated by a supported activity or earned as a direct result of a TIA. 
Program income includes but is not limited to: income from fees for 
performing services; the use or rental of real property, equipment, or 
supplies acquired under a TIA; the sale of commodities or items 
fabricated under a TIA; and license fees and royalties on patents and 
copyrights. Interest earned on advances of Federal funds is not program 
income.

<R05>
Sec. 43.1  Reissuance and purpose.

    This part:
    (a) Consolidates into a single document parts 43 and 276 of this 
title and update DoD policies and procedures governing personal 
commercial solicitation and insurance sales on DoD installations.
    (b) Continues the established annual DoD accreditation requirements

Federal nor State consumer protection regulations apply.


<R05>
Sec. 43.2  Applicability and scope.

    (a) This part applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense 
(OSD), the Military Departments, the Organization of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff (OJCS), the Unified Commands, and the Defense Agencies (hereafter 
referred to collectively as ``DoD Components''). The term ``Military 
Services,'' as used herein, refers to the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine 
Corps, and Coast Guard.
    (b) The provisions of this part do not apply to services furnished 
by commercial companies, such as deliveries of milk, laundry, and 
related residence services when such services are authorized by the DoD 
installation commander.
    (c) Nothing in this part should be construed to preclude private, 
non-profit, tax-exempt organizations composed of active and retired 
members of the Military Services from holding membership meetings which 
do not involve commercial solicitation on DoD installations. Attendance 
at these meetings shall be voluntary and the time and place of such 
meetings are subject to the discretion of the installation commander or 
his or her designee.

[51 FR 7552, Mar. 5, 1986, as amended at 52 FR 25008, July 2, 1987]


<R05>

products.
    Association. Any organization, whether or not the word 
``Association'' appears in its title, composed of and serving

combination of both.

reservation, post, camp, building, or other facility to which DoD 
personnel are assigned for duty, including barracks, transient housing, 
and family quarters.
    DoD personnel. All active duty officers (commissioned and warrant)

<R05>
Sec. 43.4  Policy.

    It is the policy of the Department of Defense to safeguard and 
promote the welfare of DoD personnel as consumers by setting forth a 
uniform approach to the conduct of all personal commercial solicitation 
and sales to them by dealers and their agents.


<R05>
Sec. 43.5  Responsibilities.

    (a) The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Force Management and 
Personnel) (ASD(FM&P)) shall be responsible for developing policies and 
procedures governing personal commercial solicitation activities 
conducted on DoD installations.
    (b) The Heads of DoD Components, or their designees, shall assure 
implementation of this Directive and compliance with its provisions.


<R05>
Sec. 43.6  Procedures.

    (a) General. (1) No person has authority to enter upon a DoD 
installation and transact personal commercial solicitation as a matter 
of rights. Personal commercial solicitation will be permitted only if 
the following requirements are met:
    (i) The solicitor is duly licensed under applicable Federal, State, 
or municipal laws and has complied with installation regulations in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
    (ii) Personal commercial solicitation is permitted by the local 
installation commander.
    (iii) A specific appointment has been made with the individual 
concerned and conducted in family quarters or in other areas designated 
by the installation commander.
    (2) Those seeking to transact personal commercial solicitation on 
overseas installations shall be required to observe, in addition to the 
above, the applicable laws of the host country and, upon demand, present 
documentary evidence to the installation commander, or designee, that 
the company they represent, and its agents, meet the licensing 
requirements of the host country.
    (3) Organizations involved in sales are permitted to display 
literature on DoD installations in locations selected by the commander.
    (b) Life insurance products and securities. (1) Life insurance 
products and securities offered and sold to DoD personnel must meet the 
prerequisites described in Appendix A.
    (2) Insurers and their agents are authorized to solicit on DoD 
installations provided they are licensed under the insurance laws of the 
State in which the installation is located. In overseas areas, DoD 
Components shall limit this authorization to those insurers accredited 
under the provisions of Appendix B.
    (3) The conduct of all insurance business on DoD installations shall 
be by specific appointment. When establishing the appointment, insurance 
agents must identify themselves to the prospective purchaser as an agent 
for a specific company.
    (4) Installation commanders shall designate areas where interviews 
by appointment may be conducted. Invitations to conduct interviews shall 
be extended to all agents on an equitable

[[Page 281]]

basis. Where space and other considerations limit the number of agents 
using the interviewing area, the installation commander may develop and 
publish local policy consistent with this concept.
    (5) Installation commanders shall make disinterested third-party 
counseling available to DoD personnel desiring counseling.
    (6) In addition to the solicitation prohibitions contained in 
paragraph (d) of this section, DoD Components shall prohibit:
    (i) DoD personnel from representing any insurer, or dealing directly 
or indirectly with any insurer or any recognized representative of any 
insurer on the installation, as an agent or in any official or business 
capacity with or without compensation.
    (ii) The use of an agent as a participant in any Military Services-
sponsored insurance education or orientation program.
    (iii) The designation of any agent or the use by any agent of titles 
such as ``Battalion Insurance Counselor,'' ``Unit Insurance Advisor,'' 
``Servicemen's Group Life Insurance Conversion Consultant,'' etc.
    (iv) The assignment of desk space for interviews for other than a 
specific prearranged appointment. During such appointment, the agent 
shall not be permitted to display desk or other signs announcing his or 
her name or company affiliation.
    (v) The use of the ``Daily Bulletin'' or any other notice, official 
or unofficial, announcing the presence of an agent and his or her 
availability.
    (c) Supervision of on-base commercial activities. (1) All pertinent 
installation regulations shall be posted in a place easily accessible to 
those conducting personal commercial solicitation activities on the 
installation.
    (2) When practicable, as determined by the installation commander, a 
copy of the applicable installation regulations shall be given to those 
conducting on-base commercial activities with the warning that any 
infractions of the regulations will result in the withdrawal of 
solicitation privileges.
    (d) Prohibited practices. The following commercial solicitation 
practices shall be prohibited on all DoD installations:
    (1) Solicitation of recruits, trainees, and transient personnel in a 
``mass'' or ``captive'' audience.
    (2) Making appointments with or soliciting military personnel who 
are in an ``on-duty'' status.
    (3) Soliciting without appointment in areas utilized for the housing 
or processing of transient personnel, in barracks areas used as 
quarters, in unit areas, in family quarters areas, and in areas provided 
by installation commanders for interviews by appointment.
    (4) Use of official identification cards by retired or reserve 
members of the Military Services to gain access to DoD installations for 
the purpose of soliciting.
    (5) Procuring, or attempting to procure, or supplying roster 
listings of DoD personnel for purposes of commercial solicitation, 
except for releases granted in accordance with DoD Directive 5400.7.
    (6) Offering unfair, improper, and deceptive inducements to purchase 
or trade.
    (7) Using rebates to facilitate transactions or to eliminate 
competition.
    (8) Using manipulative, deceptive, or fraudulent devices, schemes, 
or artifices, including misleading advertising and sales literature.
    (9) Using oral or written representations to suggest or give the 
appearance that the Department of Defense sponsors or endorses any 
particular company, its agents, or the goods, services, and commodities 
it sells.
    (10) Full-time DoD personnel making personal commercial 
solicitations or sales to DoD personnel who are junior in rank or grade 
as provided in DoD Directive 5500.7 \1\.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Copies may be obtained, if needed, from the US Naval 
Publications and Forms Center 5801 Tabor Avenue, ATTN: Code 301, 
Philadelphia PA 19120.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (11) Entering into any unauthorized or restricted area.
    (12) Using any portion of installation facilities, including 
quarters, as a showroom or store for the sale of goods or services, 
except as specifically authorized by DoD Directives 1330.9 \2\ and

[[Page 282]]

1330.17 \3\ and DoD Instructions 1330.18 \4\ and 1000.15 \5\. This is 
not intended to preclude normal home enterprises, providing applicable 
State and local laws are complied with.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2-5\ See footnote 1 to paragraph (d)(10) of this section.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (13) Soliciting door to door.
    (14) Advertising addresses or telephone numbers of commercial sales 
activities conducted on the installation, except for authorized 
activities conducted by members of military families residing in family 
housing.
    (e) Denial and revocation of on-base solicitation. (1) The 
installation commander shall deny or revoke permission to a company and 
its agents to conduct commercial activities on the base if such action 
is in the best interests of the command. The grounds for taking this 
action shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
    (i) Failure to meet the licensing and other regulatory requirements 
prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (ii) Commission of any of the practices prohibited in paragraphs 
(b)(6) and (d) of this section.
    (iii) Substantiated complaints or adverse reports regarding quality 
of goods, services, and commodities and the manner in which they are 
offered for sale.
    (iv) Knowing and willful violations of Pub. L. 90-321.
    (v) Personal misconduct by a company's agent or representative while 
on the installation.
    (vi) The possession of or any attempt to obtain supplies of 
allotment forms used by the Military Departments, or possession or use 
of facsimiles thereof.
    (vii) Failure to incorporate and abide by the Standards of Fairness 
policies contained in DoD Directive 1344.9.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ See footnote 1 to paragraph (d)(10) of this section.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) In withdrawing solicitation privileges, the commander shall 
determine whether to limit it to the agent alone or extend it to the 
company the agent represents. This decision shall be communicated to the 
agent and to the company the agent represents and shall be based on the 
circumstances of the particular case, including, among others, the 
nature of the violations, frequency of violations, the extent to which 
other agents of the company have engaged in such practices, and any 
other matters tending to show the company's culpability.
    (i) Upon withdrawing solicitation privileges, the commander shall 
promptly inform the agent and the company the agent represents orally or 
in writing.
    (ii) If the grounds for the action involve the eligibility of the 
agent or company to hold a State license or to meet other regulatory 
requirements, the appropriate authorities will be notified.
    (iii) The commander shall afford the individual or company an 
opportunity to show cause why the action should not be taken. To ``show 
cause'' means an opportunity must be given for the grieved party to 
present facts on his or her behalf on an informal basis for the 
consideration of the installation commander.
    (iv) If warranted, the commander shall recommend to the Military 
Department concerned that the action taken be extended to other DoD 
installations. If so approved, and when appropriate, the Assistant 
Secretary of Defense (Force Management and Personnel) (ASD(FM&P)), 
following consultation with the Military Department concerned, shall 
order the action extended to other Military Departments.
    (v) All denials or withdrawals of privileges will be for a set 
period of time, at the end of which the individual may reapply for 
permission to solicit through the Military Department originally 
imposing the restriction. Denial or withdrawal of soliciting privileges 
may or may not be continued, as warranted.
    (vi) When such denials or withdrawals are lifted, the Office of the 
ASD(FM&P) shall be notified for parallel action if the same denial or 
withdrawal has been extended to other Military Departments.
    (vii) The commanding officer may, if circumstances dictate, make 
immediate suspensions of solicitation privileges for a period of 30 days 
while an investigation is conducted. Exceptions to this amount of time 
must be approved by the Military Department concerned.

[[Page 283]]

    (3) Upon receipt of the information outlined above, the Secretaries 
of the Military Departments may direct the Armed Forces Disciplinary 
Control Boards in all geographical areas in which the grounds for action 
have occurred to consider the charges and take appropriate action.
    (f) Advertising policies. (1) The Department of Defense expects 
voluntary observance of the highest business ethics both by commercial 
enterprises soliciting DoD personnel through advertisements in 
unofficial military publications, and by the publishers of those 
publications in describing goods, services, and commodities, and the 
terms of the sale (including guarantees, warranties, and the like).
    (2) The advertising of credit terms shall conform to the provisions 
of Pub. L. 90-321 as implemented by Regulation Z.
    (g) Educational programs. (1) The Military Departments shall develop 
and disseminate information and education programs for members of the 
Military Services on how to conduct their personal commercial affairs, 
including such subjects as the Truth-in-Lending Act, insurance, 
Government benefits, savings, and budgeting. The services of 
representatives of credit unions, banks, and those nonprofit military 
associations (provided such associations are not underwritten by a 
commercial insurance company) approved by the Military Departments may 
be used for this purpose. Under no circumstances shall commercial 
agents, including representatives of loan, finance, insurance or 
investment companies, be used for this purpose. Educational materials 
prepared or presented by outside organizations expert in this field may, 
with appropriate disclaimers and permission, be adapted or used if 
approved by the Military Department concerned. Presentations by approved 
organizations shall only be conducted at the express request of the 
installation commander.
    (2) The Military Departments shall also make qualified personnel and 
facilities available for individual counseling on loans and consumer 
credit transactions in order to encourage thrift and financial 
responsibility and promote a better understanding of the wise use of 
credit, as prescribed in DoD Directive 1344.9.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 43.6(d)(10).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Military members shall be encouraged to seek advice from a legal 
assistance officer or their own lawyer before making a substantial loan 
or credit commitment.
    (4) Each Military Department shall provide advice and guidance to 
military personnel who have a complaint under Pub. L. 90-321 or who 
allege a criminal violation of its provisions, including referral to the 
appropriate regulatory agency for processing of the complaint.

[51 FR 7552, Mar. 5, 1986, as amended at 52 FR 25008, July 2, 1987]

      Appendix A to Part 43--Life Insurance Products and Securities

             A. Life Insurance Product Content Prerequisites

    1. Insurance products, other than certificates or other evidence of 
insurance issued by a self-insured association, offered and sold 
worldwide to personnel on DoD installations, must:
    a. Comply with the insurance laws of the State or country in which 
the installation is located and the procedural requirements of this 
Directive.
    b. Contain no restrictions by reason of military service or military 
occupational specialty of the insured, unless such restrictions are 
clearly indicated on the face of the contract.
    c. Plainly indicate any extra premium charges imposed by reason of 
military service or military occupational specialty.
    d. Contain no variation in the amount of death benefit or premium 
based upon the length of time the contract has been in force, unless all 
such variations are clearly described therein.
    2. To comply with paragraphs A.1.b., c., and d., above, an 
appropriate reference stamped on the face of the contract shall draw the 
attention of the policyholder to any extra premium charges and any 
variations in the amount of death benefit or premium based upon the 
length of time the contract has been in force.
    3. Variable life insurance products may be offered provided they 
meet the criteria of the appropriate insurance regulatory agency and the 
Securities and Exchange Commission.
    4. Premiums shall reflect only the actual premiums payable for the 
life insurance product.

[[Page 284]]

                          B. Sale of Securities

    1. All securities must be registered with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission.
    2. All sales of securities must comply with existing and appropriate 
Securities and Exchange Commission regulations.
    3. All securities representatives must apply directly to the 
commander of the installation on which they desire to solicit the sale 
of securities.
    4. Where the accredited insurer's policy permits, an overseas 
accredited life insurance agent--if duly qualified to engage in security 
activities either as a registered representative of the National 
Association of Securities Dealers or as an associate of a broker or 
dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission--may offer 
life insurance and securities for sale simultaneously. In cases of 
commingled sales, the allotment of pay for the purchase of securities 
cannot be made to the insurer.

                  C. Use of the Allotment of Pay System

    1. Allotments of military pay for life insurance products shall be 
made in accordance with DoD Directive 7330.1.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 43.6(d)(10).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2. For personnel in pay grades E-1, E-2, and E-3, at least seven 
days shall elapse for counseling between the signing of a life insurance 
application and the certification of an allotment. The purchaser's 
commanding officer may grant a waiver of this requirement for good 
cause, such as the purchaser's imminent permanent change of station.

                         D. Association--General

    The recent growth and general acceptability of quasimilitary 
associations offering various insurance plans to military personnel are 
acknowledged. Some associations are not organized within the supervision 
of insurance laws of either a State or the Federal Government. While 
some are organized for profit, others function as nonprofit associations 
under Internal Revenue Service regulations. Regardless of the manner in 
which insurance plans are offered to members, the management of the 
association is responsible for complying fully with the instructions 
contained herein and the spirit of this part.

Appendix B to Part 43--The Overseas Life Insurance Accreditation Program

                        A. Accreditation Criteria

    1. Initial Accreditation.
    a. Insurers must demonstrate continuous successful operation in the 
life insurance business for a period of not less than five years on 
December 31 of the year preceding the date of filing the application.
    b. Insurers must be listed in Best's Life-Health Insurance Reports 
and be assigned a rating of B+ (Very Good) or better for the business 
year preceding the Government's fiscal year for which accreditation is 
sought.
    2. Reaccreditation.
    a. Insurers must demonstrate continuous successful operation in the 
life insurance business, as described in subsection A.1.a., above.
    b. Insurers must retain a Best's rating of B+ or better, as 
described in paragraph A.1.b., above.
    c. Insurers must establish an agency sales force in one of the 
overseas commands within two years of initial accreditation.
    3. Waiver Provisions.
    Waivers of the initial accreditation and reaccreditation provisions 
will be considered for those insurers demonstrating substantial 
compliance with the aforementioned criteria.

                       B. Application Instructions

    1. Applications Filed Annually. During the months of May and June of 
each year insurers may apply for solicitation privileges for personnel 
assigned to U.S. military installations in foreign areas for the fiscal 
year beginning the following October 1.
    2. Application Prerequisites. A letter of application, signed by the 
president, vice president, or designated official of the insurance 
company shall be forwarded to the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Force 
Management and Personnel), Attention: Personnel Administration and 
Services Directorate, ODASD(MM&PP), The Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-
4000. The letter shall contain the information set forth below, 
submitted in the order listed. Where not applicable, so state.
    a. The overseas commands (e.g., European, Pacific, Atlantic , 
Southern) where the company is presently soliciting, or planning to 
solicit on U.S. military installations.
    b. A statement that the company has complied with, or will comply 
with, the applicable laws of the country or countries wherein it 
proposes to solicit. ``Laws of the country'' means all natural, 
provincial, city, or county laws or ordinances of any country, as 
applicable.
    c. A statement that the products to be offered for sale conform to 
the standards prescribed in Appendix A and contain only the standard 
provisions such as those prescribed by the laws of the State where the 
company's headquarters are located.
    d. A statement that the company shall assume full responsibility for 
the acts of its agents with respect to solicitation. Sales personnel 
will be limited in numbers to one general agent and no more than 50 
sales personnel for each overseas area. If warranted,

[[Page 285]]

the number of agents may be further limited by the overseas command 
concerned.
    e. A statement that the company will not utilize agents who have not 
been accredited by the appropriate overseas command to sell to DoD 
personnel on or off its DoD installations.
    f. Any explanatory or supplemental comments that will assist in 
evaluating the application.
    g. If the Department of Defense requires facts or statistics beyond 
those normally involved in accreditation, the company shall make 
separate arrangements to provide them.
    h. A statement that the company's general agent and other accredited 
agents are appointed in accordance with the prerequisites established in 
section C., below.
    3. If a company is a life insurance company subsidiary, it must be 
accredited separately on its own merits.

                          C. Agent Requirements

    Unified commanders shall apply the following principles:
    1. An agent must possess a current State license. The overseas 
commander may waive this requirement for an accredited agent 
continuously residing and successfully selling life insurance in foreign 
areas, who, through no fault of his or her own, due to State law (or 
regulation) governing domicile requirements, or requiring that the 
agent's company be licensed to do business in that State, forfeits 
eligibility for a State license. The request for a waiver shall contain 
the name of the State or jurisdiction which would not renew the agent's 
license.
    2. General agents and agents shall represent only one accredited 
commercial insurance company. This requirement may be waived by the 
overseas commander if multiple representation can be proven to be in the 
best interest of DoD personnel.
    3. An agent must have at least one year of successful life insurance 
underwriting in the United States or its territories, generally within 
the five years preceding the date of application, in order to be 
designated as accredited and employed for overseas solicitation.
    4. Appropriate overseas commanders shall exercise further agent 
control procedures as deemed necessary.
    5. An agent, once accredited in an overseas area, may not change 
affiliation from the staff of one general agent to another and retain 
accreditation, unless the previous employer certifies in writing that 
the release is without justifiable prejudice. Unified commanders will 
have final authority to determine justifiable prejudice. Indebtedness of 
an agent to a previous employer is an example of justifiable prejudice.

                       D. Announcement of Findings

    1. Accreditation by the Department of defense upon annual 
applications of insurers shall be announced as soon as practicable by a 
notice to each applicant and by a listing released annually in September 
to the appropriate overseas commander. This approval does not constitute 
DoD endorsement of the insurer. Any advertising by insurers which 
suggests such endorsement is prohibited.
    2. In the event accreditation is denied, specific reasons for such 
findings shall be submitted to the applicant.
    a. Upon receipt of notification of an unfavorable finding, the 
insurer shall have 30 days from the receipt of such notification 
(forwarded certified mail, return recipt requested) in which to request 
reconsideration of the original decision. This request must be 
accompanied by substantiating data or information in rebuttal of the 
specific reasons upon which the adverse findings are based.
    b. Action by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Force Management 
and Personnel) on appeal is final.
    c. If the applicant is presently accredited as an insurer, up to 90 
days from final action on an unfavorable finding shall be granted in 
which to close out operations.
    3. Upon receiving the annual letter of accreditation, each company 
shall send to the applicable unified commander a verified list of agents 
currently accredited for overseas solicitation. Where applicable, the 
company shall also include the names of new agents for whom original 
accreditation and permission to solicit on base is requested. Insurers 
initially accredited will be furnished instructions by the Department of 
Defense for agent accreditation procedures in overseas areas.
    4. Material changes affecting the corporate status and financial 
conditions of the company which may occur during the fiscal year of 
accreditation must be reported as they occur.
    a. The Department of Defense reserves the right to terminate 
accreditation if such material changes appear to substantially affect 
the financial and operational criteria described in section A., above, 
on which accreditation was based.
    b. Failure to report such material changes can result in termination 
of accreditation regardless of how it affects the criteria.
    5. If an analysis of information furnished by the company indicates 
that unfavorable trends are developing which may possibly adversely 
affect its future operations, the Department of Defense may, at its 
option, bring such matters to the attention of the company and request a 
statement as to what action, if any, is contemplated to deal with such 
unfavorable trends.

Appendix A to Part 44--Guidance

    Authority: 10 U.S.C. 10145.

    Source: 64 FR 72027, Dec. 23, 1999, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 44.1  Purpose.

    Updates DoD policy and responsibilities for the screening of Ready 
Reservists under 10 U.S.C. 1003, 1005, and 1209.


<R05>
Sec. 44.2  Applicability.

    This part applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the 
Military Departments (including the Coast Guard, when it is not 
operating as a Military Service in the Navy by agreement with the 
Department of Transportation), the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, the Combatant Commands, the Inspector General of the Department 
of Defense, the Defense Agencies, the DoD Field Activities and all other 
organizational entities within the Department of Defense (hereafter 
referred to collectively as the ``DoD Components''). The term ``Military 
Services'' as used in this part, refers to the Army, the Navy, the Air 
Force and the Marine Corps.


<R05>
Sec. 44.3  Definitions.

    For purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:
    Extreme community hardship. A situation that, because of a 
Reservist's mobilization, may have a substantially adverse effect on the 
health, safety, or welfare of the community. Any request for a 
determination of such hardship shall be made by the Reservist and must 
be supported by documentation, as required by the Secretary concerned.
    Extreme personal hardship. An adverse impact on a Reservist's 
dependents resulting from his or her mobilization. Any request for a 
determination of such hardship shall be made by the Reservist and must 
be supported by documentation, as required by the Secretary concerned.
    Individual Ready Reserve. Within the Ready Reserve of each of the 
Reserve Components there is an Individual Ready Reserve. The Individual 
Ready Reserve consists of members of the Ready Reserve who are not in 
the Selected Reserve or the Inactive National Guard.
    Key employee. Any Federal employee occupying a key position.
    Key position. A Federal position that shall not be vacated during a 
national emergency or mobilization without SERIOUSLY impairing the 
capability of the parent Federal Agency or office to function 
effectively. The four categories of Federal key positions are set out in 
this paragraph. The first three categories are, by definition, key 
positions. However, the third category, Article III Judges, provides for 
exceptions on a case-by-case basis. The fourth category requires a case-
by-case determination and designation as described in the following:
    (1) The Vice President of the United States or any official 
specified in the order of presidential succession as in 3 U.S.C. 19.
    (2) The members of the Congress and the heads of the Federal 
Agencies appointed by the President with the consent of the Senate. For 
this part, the term ``the heads of the Federal Agencies'' does not-
include any person appointed by the President with the consent of the 
Senate to a Federal Agency as a member of a multimember board or 
commission. Such positions may be designated as key positions only in 
accordance with paragraph (4) of this definition.
    (3) Article III Judges. However, each Article III Judge, who is a 
member of the Ready Reserve and desires to remain in the Ready Reserve, 
must have his or her position reviewed by the Chief Judge of the 
affected Judge's Circuit. If the Chief Judge determines that 
mobilization of the Article III Judge concerned will not seriously 
impair the capability of the Judge's court to function effectively, the 
Chief Judge will provide a certification to that effect to the Secretary 
of the Military Department concerned. Concurrently, the affected Judge 
will provide a statement to the Secretary concerned requesting continued 
service in the

[[Page 287]]

Ready Reserve and acknowledging that he or she may be involuntarily 
called to active duty (AD) under the laws of the United States and the 
Directives and Regulations of the Department of Defense and pledging not 
to seek to be excused from such orders based upon his or her judicial 
duties.
    (4) Other Federal positions determined by the Federal Agency heads, 
or their designees, to be key positions in accordance with the 
guidelines in the appendix to this part.
    Mobilization. Involuntary call-up of Reserve component members in 
accordance with 10 U.S.C. 12301, 12302, or 12304. That includes full 
mobilization, partial mobilization and, selective mobilization 
(Presidential Reserve Call-Up Authority).
    Ready reserve. Reserve unit members or individual Reserve and 
National Guard members, or both, liable for AD, as provided in 10 U.S.C. 
12301, 12302, and, for some members, 10 U.S.C. 12304. It consists of the 
Selected Reserve, the Individual Ready Reserve, and the Inactive 
National Guard.
    Selected reserve. A category of the Ready Reserve in each of the 
Reserve components. The Selected Reserve consists of units, and, as 
designated by the Secretary concerned, of individual Reserve members, 
trained as prescribed in 10 U.S.C. 10147(a)(1) or 32 U.S.C. 502(a), as 
appropriate.
    Standby reserve. The Standby Reserve consists of those units or 
members, or both, of the Reserve components, other than those in the 
Ready Reserve or the Retired Reserve, who are liable for active duty 
only as provided for in 10 U.S.C. 12301 and 12306. The Standby Reserve 
consists of personnel who are maintaining their military affiliation 
without being in the Ready Reserve, but have been designated ``key 
civilian employees,'' or have a temporary hardship or disability. Those 
individuals are not required to perform training and are not part of the 
Ready Reserve. The Standby Reserve is a pool of trained individuals who 
may be mobilized as needed to fill manpower needs in specific skills. 
The Standby Reserve consists of the active status list and the inactive 
status list categories.


<R05>
Sec. 44.4  Policy.

    It is DoD policy that:
    (a) Members of the Ready Reserve shall be screened (see the appendix 
to this part for specific screening guidance) at least annually to meet 
the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 10149 and to provide a Ready Reserve force 
composed of members who:
    (1) Meet Military Service wartime standards of mental, moral, 
professional, and physical fitness.
    (2) Possess the military qualifications required in the various 
ranks, ratings, and specialties.
    (3) Are available immediately for active duty (AD) during a 
mobilization or as otherwise required by law.
    (b) On mobilization under 10 U.S.C. 12301(a) or 10 U.S.C. 12302, all 
personnel actions relating to the screening program shall be held in 
abeyance, and all members remaining in the Ready Reserve shall be 
considered immediately available for AD service. After such a 
mobilization is ordered, no deferment, delay, or exemption from 
mobilization shall be granted to Ready Reservists because of their 
civilian employment. On involuntary activation of Reserve members under 
10 U.S.C. 12304 (Presidential Reserve Call-Up Authority), the Secretary 
of Defense, or designee, shall make a determination regarding the 
continuation or cessation of personnel actions related to the screening 
program.
    (c) All Ready Reservists shall be retained in the Ready Reserve for 
the entire period of their statutory obligation or voluntary contract. 
Exceptions to that policy are made in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of 
this section, or may be made by the Secretaries concerned, in accordance 
with 10 U.S.C. 10145 and 10146.
    (d) A member of the Army National Guard of the United States or the 
Air National Guard of the United States may be transferred to the 
Standby Reserve only with the consent of the governor or other 
applicable authority of the State, commonwealth, or territory concerned 
(including the District of Columbia) in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 10146.
    (e) Any eligible member of the Standby Reserve may be transferred 
back to the Ready Reserve when the reason for

[[Page 288]]

the member's transfer to the Standby Reserve no longer exists in 
accordance with 10 U.S.C. 10150 and DoD Instruction 1200.15. \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Copies may be obtained at http://web7.whs.osd.mil/corres.htm.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (f) Ready Reservists whose immediate recall to AD during an 
emergency would create an extreme personal or community hardship shall 
be transferred to the Standby Reserve or the Retired Reserve, or shall 
be discharged, as applicable, except as specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (g) Ready Reservists who are designated key employees or who occupy 
key positions, as defined in this section, shall be transferred to the 
Standby Reserve or the Retired Reserve, or shall be discharged, as 
appropriate, except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (h) Ready Reservists who are also DoD civilian employees may not 
hold a mobilization assignment to the same positions that they fill as 
civilian employees. Those Ready Reservists shall be reassigned or 
transferred, as applicable. Reserve component military technicians (dual 
status), as members of Reserve units, are excluded from this provision.
    (i) Ready Reservists who are preparing for the ministry in an 
accredited theology or divinity school cannot be involuntarily called to 
AD or required to participate in inactive duty training (IDT) in 
accordance with 10 U.S.C. 12317. Accordingly, such Ready Reservists 
(other than those participating in a military Chaplain Candidate or 
Theology Student Program) shall be transferred to the Standby Reserve 
(active status list) for the duration of their ministerial studies and 
duties at accredited theology or divinity schools. Ready Reservists 
participating in a military Chaplain Candidate or Theology Student 
Program may continue their Ready Reserve affiliation and engage in AD 
and IDT.
    (j) Ready Reservists may not be transferred from the Ready Reserve 
solely because they are students, interns, residents, or fellows in the 
healthcare professions. On mobilization, they either shall be deferred 
or shall be mobilized in a student, intern, resident, or fellow status 
until qualified in the applicable medical specialty, as prescribed by 
the Secretaries of the Military Departments.
    (k) The Secretaries concerned, or their designees, shall make 
determinations for mobilization availability on a case-by-case basis, 
consistent with this part, and not by class or group determinations.


<R05>
Sec. 44.5  Responsibilities.

    (a) The Deputy Secretary of Defense shall adjudicate, before 
mobilization, conflicts between the mobilization manpower needs of the 
civilian sector and the military that the Ready Reserve Screening 
process has identified, but has not resolved.
    (b) The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs, under 
the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, shall:
    (1) Provide oversight and policy support to the overall Ready 
Reserve screening program, and manage and control the Federal sector 
screening program in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 10149, Executive Order 
11190, and pp. 63-66 of House Appropriations Committee Report 95-451, 
which is available from the Government Printing Office, Washington, DC

employer screening activities.
    (3) Prepare an annual report on the status of Ready Reservists 
employed by the Federal Government.
    (4) Employ the guidance in appendix A of this part in coordinating 
the screening program with employers of Ready Reservists.
    (5) Coordinate conflicts between the mobilization manpower needs of 
the civilian sector and the military identified but not resolved through 
the Ready Reserve Screening process.
    (c) The Secretaries of the Military Departments shall:
    (1) Screen, at least annually, all Ready Reservists under their 
jurisdiction to ensure their immediate availability for active duty (AD) 
and to ensure compliance with 10 U.S.C. 10149.

[[Page 289]]

    (2) Ensure coordination with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for 
Reserve Affairs to resolve conflicts (identified, but not resolved 
through the Ready Reserve screening process) between the mobilization 
manpower needs of the civilian sector and the military.
    (3) Review recommendations for removal of both Federal and other 
civilian employees from the Ready Reserve submitted by employers and 
take applicable action.
    (4) After making a removal determination in response to a petition 
for such action, promptly transmit the results of that determination to 
the Ready Reservist concerned and his/her employer.
    (5) Transfer Ready Reservists identified as occupying key positions 
to the Standby Reserve or the Retired Reserve, or discharge them, as 
applicable.
    (6) Ensure that Ready Reservists not on AD are examined as to 
physical fitness in accordance with DoD Directive 1332.18. \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 44.4(e).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (7) Process members of the Ready Reserve who do not participate 
satisfactorily in accordance with DoD Instruction 1200.15 and DoD 
Directive 1215.13.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 44.4(e).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (8) Ensure that all Ready Reservists have a favorably completed 
background check for military service suitability on file (e.g., 
Entrance National Agency Check (ENTNAC), NAC).
    (9) Ensure that personnel records systems incorporate information on 
any factors that limit the mobilization availability of a Ready 
Reservist.
    (10) Develop and maintain current information pertaining to the 
mobilization availability of Ready Reservists.

                     Appendix A to Part 44--Guidance

                       Deputy Secretary of Defense

    The Deputy Secretary of Defense shall adjudicate, before 
mobilization, conflicts between the mobilization manpower needs of the 
civilian sector and the military that the Ready Reserve screening 
process has identified, but has not resolved.

                      Employers of Ready Reservists

                          (a) Federal Employers

    (1) To ensure that Federal employees essential to the continuity of 
the Federal Government are not retained as members of the Ready Reserve, 
the following guidance is provided:
    (i) Conduct annual screening program as provided for by the 
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs.
    (ii) Responses from Federal Agencies shall be reported under 
Interagency Report Control Number 0912-DoD-AN, ``Ready Reservists in the 
Federal Government,'' in accordance with DoD 8910.1-M. \4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 44.4(e).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (iii) Federal Agency heads, or their designees, concerned shall 
designate those positions that are of essential nature to, and within, 
the organization as ``key positions,'' and shall require that they shall 
NOT be filled by Ready Reservists to preclude such positions from being 
vacated during a mobilization. Upon request from Federal Agencies, 
Secretaries of the Military Departments shall verify the essential 
nature of the positions being designated as ``key,'' and shall transfer 
Ready Reservists occupying key positions to the Standby Reserve or the 
Retired Reserve or shall discharge them, as applicable, under 10 U.S.C. 
10149, except as specified in Sec. 44.4 (b).
    (iv) In determining whether or not a position should be designated 
as a ``key position,'' the following questions should be considered by 
the Federal Agency concerned:
    (A) Can the position be filled in a reasonable time after 
mobilization?
    (B) Does the position require technical or managerial skills that 
are possessed uniquely by the incumbent employee?
    (C) Is the position associated directly with defense mobilization?
    (D) Does the position include a mobilization or relocation 
assignment in an Agency having emergency functions, as designated by 
Executive Order 12656?
    (E) Is the position directly associated with industrial or manpower 
mobilization, as designated in Executive Orders 12656 and 12919?
    (F) Are there other factors related to the national defense, health, 
or safety that will make the incumbent of the position unavailable for 
mobilization?
    (2) [Reserved]
    (b) Non-Federal Employers of Ready Reservists. Non-Federal employers 
of Ready Reservists, particularly in the fields of public health and 
safety and defense support industries, are encouraged to adopt personnel 
management procedures designed to preclude conflicts between the 
emergency manpower needs of civilian activities and the military during 
a mobilization. Employers also are

[[Page 290]]

encouraged to use the Federal key position guidelines contained in this 
appendix for making their own key position designations and, when 
applicable, for recommending key employees for removal from the Ready 
Reserve.
    (c) All employers who determine that a Ready Reservist is a key 
employee, in accordance with the guidelines in this appendix, should 
promptly report that determination, using the letter format at the end 
of this appendix, to the applicable Reserve personnel center, requesting 
the employee be removed from the Ready Reserve.

                       Individual Ready Reservists

    (a) Each Ready Reservist who is not a member of the Selected Reserve 
is obligated to notify the Secretary concerned of any change of address, 
marital status, number of dependents, or civilian employment and any 
other change that would prevent a member from meeting mobilization 
standards prescribed by the Military Service concerned (10 U.S.C. 
10205).
    (b) All Ready Reservists shall inform their employers of their 
Reserve military obligation.

and publication of separation program designators (SPDs).


<R05>
Sec. 45.2  Applicability and scope.

    (a) The provisions of this part apply to the Office of the Secretary 
of Defense, the Military Services, the Joint Staff, and the Defense 
Agencies (hereafter referred to as ``DoD Components''). The term 
``Military Services,'' as used here, refers to the Army, Navy, the Air 
Force, the Marine Corps and, by agreement with the Department of 
Transportation, to the Coast Guard.
    (b) Its provisions include procedures on the preparation and 
distribution of DD Forms 214, 214WS, 215 (Appendices A, B, and C) which 
record and report the transfer or separation of military personnel from 
a period of active duty. (NOTE: Computer-generated formats are 
acceptable substitutes provided Assistant Secretary of Defense (Force 
Management and Personnel) approval is obtained.) DD Forms 214 and 215 
(or their substitutes) will provide:
    (1) The Military Services with a source of information relating to 
military personnel for administrative purposes, and for making 
determinations of eligibility for enlistment or reenlistment.
    (2) The Service member with a brief, clear-cut record of the 
member's active service with the Armed Forces at the time of transfer, 
release, or discharge, or when the member changes status or component 
while on active duty.

distribution of all lists of SPDs.


<R05>
Sec. 45.3  Policy and procedures.

    (a) Administrative issuance or reissuance of DD Forms 214 and 215.
    (1) The DD Form 214 will normally be issued by the command from 
which the member was separated. In those instances where a DD Form 214 
was not issued, the Services concerned may establish procedures for 
administrative issuance.
    (2) The DD Form 214, once issued, will not be reissued except:
    (i) When directed by appropriate appellate authority, Executive 
Order, or by the Secretary concerned.
    (ii) When it is determined by the Service concerned that the 
original DD Form 214 cannot be properly corrected by issuance of a DD 
Form 215 or if the correction would require issuance of more than two DD 
Forms 215.
    (iii) When two DD Forms 215 have been issued and an additional 
correction is required.
    (3) Whenever a DD Form 214 is administratively issued or reissued, 
an appropriate entry stating that fact and the date of such action will 
be made in Block 18, Remarks, of the DD Form 214 unless the appellate 
authority, Executive Order, or Secretarial directive specifies 
otherwise.
    (b) The Military Services will ensure that every member (except as 
limited in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and excluding those listed 
in paragraph (c) of this section being separated from the Military 
Services is given a completed DD Form 214 describing relevant data 
regarding the member's service, and the circumstances of termination. DD 
Form 214 may also be issued under other circumstances prescribed by the 
Military Service concerned. A continuation sheet, if required, will be 
bond paper, and will reference: The DD Form 214 being continued; 
information from blocks 1 through 4; the appropriate block(s) being 
continued; the member's signature, date; and the authorizing official's 
signature. DD Forms 214 are not intended to have any legal effect on 
termination of the member's service.
    (1) Release or discharge from active service. (i) The original of DD 
Form 214 showing separation from a period of active service with a 
Military Service, including release from a status that is legally 
determined to be void, will be physically delivered to the separate 
prior to departure from the separation activity on the effective date of 
separation; or on the date authorized travel time commences.
    (A) Copy No. 4, containing the statutory or regulatory authority, 
reentry code, SPD code, and narrative reason

[[Page 292]]

for separation also will be physically delivered to the separatee prior 
to departure, if he/she so requested by initiating Block 30, Member 
Requests Copy 4.
    (B) Remaining copies of DD Form 214 will be distributed on the day 
following the effective date of separation.
    (ii) When separation is effected under emergency conditions which 
preclude physical delivery, or when the recipient departs in advance of 
normal departure time (e.g., on leave in conjunction with retirement; or 
at home awaiting separation for disability), the original DD Form 214 
will be mailed to the recipient on the effective date of separation.
    (iii) If the separation activity is unable to complete all items on 
the DD Form 214, the form will be prepared as completely as possible and 
delivered to the separatee. The separatee will be advised that a DD Form 
215 will be issued by the Military Service concerned when the missing 
information becomes available; and that it will not be necessary for the 
separatee to request a DD Form 215 for such information.
    (iv) If an optical character recognition format is utilized by a 
Military Service, the first carbon copy of the document will be 
physically delivered or mailed to the separatee as prescribed in 
paragraphs (b) (i) through (iii) of this section.
    (2) Release from active duty for training, full-time training duty, 
or active duty for special work. Personnel being separated from a period 
of active duty for training, full-time training duty, or active duty for 
special work will be furnished a DD Form 214 when they have served 90 
days or more, or when required by the Secretary concerned for shorter 
periods. Personnel shall be furnished a DD Form 214 upon separation for 
cause or for physical disability regardless of the length of time served 
on active duty.
    (3) Continuing on active duty. Members who change their status or 
component, as outlined below, while they are serving on active duty will 
be provided a completed DD form 214 upon:
    (i) Discharge for immediate enlistment or reenlistment (optional--at 
the discretion of the Military Services). However, Military Services not 
providing the DD Form 214 will furnish the member a DD Form 256, 
``Honorable Discharge Certificate,'' and will issue instructions 
requiring those military offices which maintain a member's records to 
provide necessary Service data to the member for application to 
appropriate civilian individuals, groups, and governmental agencies. 
Such data will include Service component, entry data and grades.
    (ii) Termination of enlisted status to accept an appointment to 
warrant or commissioned officer grade.
    (iii) Termination of a temporary appointment to accept a permanent 
warrant or commission in the Regular or Reserve components of the Armed 
Forces.
    (iv) Termination of an officer appointment in one of the Military 
Services to accept appointment in another Service.
    (c) DD Form 214 need not be prepared for: (1) Personnel found

    (d) Preparation. The Military Departments will issue instructions 
governing the preparation of DD Form 214, consistent with the following:
    (1) DD Form 214 is an important record of service which must be 
prepared accurately and completely. Any unavoidable corrections and 
changes made in the unshaded areas of the form

[[Page 293]]

during preparation shall be neat, legible and initialed on all copies by 
the authenticating official. The recipient will be informed that making 
any unauthorized change or alteration of the form will render it void.
    (2) Since DD Form 214 is often used by civilian personnel, 
abbreviations should be avoided.
    (3) Copies of DD Form 214 transmitted to various governmental 
agencies shall be legible, especially those provided to the Veterans 
Administration (Department of Veterans Affairs, effective March 15, 
1989, in accordance with section 18(a), Public Law 100-527 and the 
Department of Labor).
    (4) The authority for a member's transfer or discharge will be cited 
by reference to the appropriate Military Service regulation, 
instruction, or manual, followed by the appropriate separation program 
designator on copies 2, 4, 7, and 8 only. A narrative description to 
identify the reason for transfer or separation will not be used on copy 
1.
    (5) To assist the former Service member in employment placement and 
job counseling, formal inservice training courses successfully completed 
during the period covered by the form will be listed in Block 14, 
Military Education; e.g., medical, dental, electronics, supply, 
administration, personnel or heavy equipment operations. Training 
courses for combat skills will not be listed. See 1978 Guide to the 
Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Services for commonly 
accepted course titles and abbreviations.
    (6) For the purpose of reemployment rights (DoD Directive 1205.12) 
\1\) all extensions of service, except those under 10 U.S.C. 972, are 
considered to be at the request and for the convenience of the 
Government. In these cases, Block 18 of DD Form 214 will be annotated to 
indicate ``Extension of service was at the request and for the 
convenience of the Government.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Copies may be obtained if needed, from the U.S. Naval 
Publications and forms Center, Attn: Code 1062, 5801 Tabor Avenue, 
Philadelphia, PA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (7) When one or more of the data items on the DD Form 214 are not 
available and the document is issued to the separatee, the applicable 
block(s) will be annotated ``See Remarks.'' In such cases, Block 18 will 
contain the entry ``DD Form 215 will be issued to provide missing 
information.'' When appropriate, Block 18 will also reflect the amount 
of disability pay, and the inclusive dates of any nonpay/excess leave 
days.
    (8) The authorizing official (E-7, GS-7 or above) will sign the 
original in ink ensuring that the signature is legible on all carbon 
copies. If not, a second signature may be necessary on a subsequent 
carbon copy. The authorized official shall be an E-7, GS-7, or higher 
grade, except that the Service concerned may authorize chiefs of 
installation separation activities (E-5, GS-5, or above) to serve in 
this capacity if designated in writing by the responsible commander and/
or director (0-4, or above).
    (9) The following are the only authorized entries in Block 24, 
Character of Service, as appropriate: ``Honorable,'' ``Under Honorable 
Conditions (General),'' ``Under Other Than Honorable Conditions,'' ``Bad 
Conduct,'' ``Dishonorable,'' or ``Uncharacterized.'' When a discharge 
has been upgraded, the DD Form 214 will be annotated on copies 2 through 
8 in Block 18 to indicate the character of service has been upgraded; 
the date the application for upgrade was made; and the effective date of 
the corrective action.
    (10) The date entered in Block 12.a. shall be the date of enlistment 
for the earliest period of continuous active service for which a DD Form 
214 was not previously issued. For members who have previously 
reenlisted without being issued a DD Form 214, and who are being 
separated with any discharge characterization except ``Honorable,'' the 
following statement shall appear as the first entry in Block 18., 
``Remarks,'' on the DD Form 214: ``CONTINUOUS HONORABLE ACTIVE SERVICE 
FROM (applicable date) UNTIL (applicable date).'' The ``from'' date 
shall be the date of initial entry into active duty, or the first day of 
service for which a DD Form 214 was not previously issued, as 
applicable; the ``until'' date shall be the date before commencement of 
the current enlistment.

Form 214. The document will be used and disposed of in accordance with 
regulations issued by the Military Service concerned.
    (3) DD Form 215. Utilized to correct errors in DD Form 214 
discovered after the original has been delivered and/or distribution of

distribution of DD Form 215 will be identical to the distribution of DD 
Form 214.
    (4) Requests for Copies of DD Form 214 Subsequent to Separation. 
Agencies maintaining a separatee's DD Form 214 will provide a copy only

all items of information completed, and 1 copy with the following items 
deleted from the form: Specific authority and narrative reason for 
separation, reenlistment eligibility code, and separation program 
designator/number.
    (i) In those cases where the member has supplied an authorization to 
provide a copy of the DD Form 214 to another individual or group, the 
copy furnished will not contain the Special Additional Information 
section or, in the

[[Page 295]]

case of DD forms issued prior to July 1, 1979, those items listed in 
paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
    (ii) A copy will be provided to authorized personnel for official 
purposes only.
    (f) Procurement. Arrangements for procurement of DD Forms 214, 214-

of DD Forms 214, 214-ws, and 215 may not be accomplished without prior 
authorization of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Force Management 
and Personnel) (ASD(FM&P)). Requests to add or delete information will 
be coordinated with the other Military Services in writing, prior to 
submission to the ASD(FM&P). If a Military Service uses computer 
capability to generate forms, the items of information may be arranged, 
the size of the information blocks may be increased or decreased, and 
copies 7 and/or 8 may be deleted at the discretion of the Service.


<R05>
Sec. 45.4  Responsibilities.

    (a) The DD Forms 214 and 215 are a source of significant and 
authoritative information used by civilian and governmental agencies to 
validate veteran eligibility for benefits. As such, they are valuable 
forms and, therefore, vulnerable to fraudulent use. Since they are 
sensitive, the forms must be safeguarded at all times. They will be 
transmitted, stored, and destroyed in a manner which will prevent 
unauthorized use. The Military Services will issue instructions 
consistent with the following:
    (1) All DD Forms 214 will be surprinted with a reproducible screen 
tint using appropriate security ink on Blocks 1, 3, 4.a, 4.b, 12, and 18 
through 30. In addition Blocks 1, 3, 5, and 7 of the DD Form 215 will be 
similarly surprinted to make alterations readily discernible. No 
corrections will be permitted in the screened areas.
    (2) All forms will be secured after duty hours.
    (3) All obsolete forms will be destroyed.
    (4) All forms to be discarded, including those which are blank or 
partially completed, and reproduced copies of DD Form 214, will be 
destroyed. No forms will be discarded intact.
    (5) Blank forms given to personnel for educational or instructional 
purposes, and forms maintained for such use, are to be clearly voided in 
an unalterable manner.
    (6) The commander or commanding officer of each unit or activity 
authorized to issue DD Form 214 will appoint, in writing, a commissioned 
officer, warrant officer, enlisted member (grade E-7 or above), or DoD 
civilian (GS-7 or above) who will requisition, control, and issue blank 
DD Forms 214 and 215. The Service concerned may authorize an E-5 or GS-5 
to serve in this capacity.
    (7) The Military Services will monitor the use of DD Form 214 and 
review periodically its issuance to insure compliance with procedures 
for safeguarding.
    (b) The DD Form 214-ws will contain the word ``WORKSHEET'' on the 
body of the form (see Appendix B). This DD Form 214-ws will be treated 
in the same manner as the DD Form 214.
    (c) The Military Services will issue appropriate instructions to 
separation activities stressing the importance of the DD Forms 214 and 
215 in obtaining veterans benefits, reemployment rights, and 
unemployment insurance.
    (d) Standard separation program designator (SPD) codes for officer 
and enlisted personnel developed under the provisions of DoD Instruction 
5000.12 \3\ are published in DoD 5000.12-M.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 45.3(d)(6).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) Requests to add, change, or delete an SPD code shall be 
forwarded by the DoD Component concerned with appropriate justification 
to the Assigned Responsible Agency accountable for evaluating, 
recommending approval of, and maintaining such codes: Department of the 
Navy, Office of The Chief of Naval Operations, (Attention: OP-161), room 
1514, Arlington Annex, Washington, DC 20350-2000.
    (2) Requests to add, change, or delete an SPD code will be submitted 
in accordance with section V., DoD Instruction 5000.12 with prior 
written approval by the ASD (FM&P), or his/her designee.

[[Page 296]]

    (e) All lists of SPD codes, including supplemental lists, published 
by the DoD Components will be stamped ``For Official Use Only'' and will 
not be furnished to any agency or individual outside the Department of 
Defense.
    (1) Appropriate provisions of the Freedom of Information Act will be 
used to deny the release of the lists to the public. An individual being 
separated or discharged is entitled access only to his/her SPD code. It 
is not intended that these codes stigmatize an individual in any manner. 
They are intended for internal use by the Department of Defense in 
collecting data to analyze statistical reporting trends that may, in 
turn, influence changes in separation policy.
    (2) Agencies or individuals who come into the possession of these 
lists are cautioned on their use because a particular list may be 
outdated and not reveal correctly the full circumstances relating to an 
individual's separation or discharge.

<R05>
Sec. 47.1  Purpose.

    This document:
    (a) Revises 32 CFR part 47 and implements Public Law 95-202.
    (b) Directs the Secretary of the Air Force to determine if an 
established group of civilian employees or contract workers provided 
service to the U.S. Armed Forces in a manner considered active military 
service for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits.
    (c) Establishes the DoD Civilian/Military Service Review Board and 
the Advisory Panel.
    (d) Establishes policy, assigns responsibilities, prescribes 
application procedures for groups and individuals, and clarifies the 
factors used to determine active duty (AD) service.


<R05>
Sec. 47.2  Applicability and scope.

    This part:
    (a) Applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the 
Military Departments, and by agreement with the Department of 
Transportation (DoT), the U.S. Coast Guard.
    (b) Applies to any group application considered under Public Law 95-
202 after September 11, 1989 and to any individual who applies for 
discharge documents as a member of a group recognized by the Secretary 
of the Air Force.


<R05>
Sec. 47.3  Definitions.

    Armed conflict. A prolonged period of sustained combat involving 
members of the U.S. Armed Forces against a foreign belligerent. The term 
connotes more than a military engagement of limited duration or for 
limited objectives, and involves a significant use of military and 
civilian forces.
    (a) Examples of armed conflict are World Wars I and II, and the 
Korean and Vietnam Conflicts.
    (b) Examples of military actions that are not armed conflicts are as 
follows:
    (1) The incursion into Lebanon in 1958, and the peacekeeping force 
there in 1983 and 1984.
    (2) The incursions into the Dominican Republic in 1965 and into 
Libya in 1986.
    (3) The intervention into Grenada in 1983.
    Civilian or contractual group. An organization similarly situated to 
the Women's Air Forces Service Pilots (a group of Federal civilian 
employees attached to the U.S. Army Air Force in World War II). Those 
organization members rendered service to the U.S. Armed Forces during a 
period of armed conflict in a capacity that was then considered civilian 
employment with the Armed Forces, or the result of a contract with the 
U.S. Government, to provide direct support to the Armed Forces.
    Recognized group. A group whose service the Secretary of the Air 
Force administratively has determined to have been ``active duty for the 
purposes of all laws administered by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs''; i.e., VA benefits under 38 U.S.C. 101.
    Similarly situated. A civilian or contractual group is similarly 
situated to the Women's Air Forces Service Pilots when it existed as an 
identifiable group at the time the service was being rendered to the 
U.S. Armed Forces during a period of armed conflict. Persons who 
individually provided support through civilian employment or contract, 
but

[[Page 306]]

who were not members of an identifiable group at the time the services 
were rendered, are not ``similarly situated'' to the Women's Air Forces 
Service Pilots of World War II.


<R05>
Sec. 47.4  Policy.

    (a) Eligibility for consideration. To be eligible to apply for 
consideration under Public Law 95-202 and this part, a group must:
    (1) Have been similarly situated to the Women's Air Forces Service 
Pilots of World War II.
    (2) Have rendered service to the United States in what was 
considered civilian employment with the U.S. Armed Forces either through 
formal Civil Service hiring or less formal hiring if the engagement was 
created under the exigencies of war, or as the result of a contract with 
the U.S. Government to provide direct support to the U.S. Armed Forces.
    (3) Have rendered that service during a period of armed conflict.
    (4) Consist of living persons to whom VA benefits can accrue.
    (5) Not have already received benefits from the Federal Government 
for the service in question.
    (b) A determination of AD service that is considered to be 
equivalent to active military service is made on the extent to which the 
group was under the control of the U.S. Armed Forces in support of a 
military operation or mission during an armed conflict. The extent of 
control exerted over the group must be similar to that exerted over 
military personnel and shall be determined by, but not necessarily 
limited to, the following:
    (1) Incidents favoring equivalency--(i) Uniqueness of service. 
Civilian service (civilian employment or contractual service) is a vital 
element of the war-fighting capability of the Armed Forces. Civilian 
service during a period of armed conflict is not necessarily equivalent 
to active military service, even when performed in a combat zone. 
Service must be beyond that generally performed by civilian employees 
and must be occasioned by unique circumstances. For civilian service to 
be recognized under this part, the following factors must be present:
    (A) The group was created or organized by U.S. Government 
authorities to fill a wartime need or, if a group was not created 
specifically for a wartime need, but existed before that time, then its 
wartime mission was of a nature to substantially alter the 
organization's prewar character.
    (B) If the application is based on service in a combat zone, the 
mission of the group in a combat zone must have been substantially 
different from the mission of similar groups not in a combat zone.
    (ii) Organizational authority over the group. The concept of 
military control is reinforced if the military command authority 
determines such things as the structure of the civilian organization, 
the location of the group, the mission and activities of the group, and 
the staffing requirements to include the length of employment and pay 
grades of the members of the group.
    (iii) Integration into the military organization. Integrated 
civilian groups are subject to the regulations, standards, and control 
of the military command authority.
    (A) Examples include the following:
    (1) Exchanging military courtesies.
    (2) Wearing military clothing, insignia, and devices.
    (3) Assimilating the group into the military organizational 
structure.
    (4) Emoluments associated with military personnel; i.e., the use of 
commissaries and exchanges, and membership in military clubs.
    (B) A group fully integrated into the military would give the 
impression that the members of the group were military, except that they 
were paid and accounted for as civilians.
    (C) Integration into the military may lead to an expectation by 
members of the group that the service of the group imminently would be 
recognized as active military service. Such integration acts in favor of 
recognition.
    (iv) Subjection to military discipline. During past armed conflicts, 
U.S. military commanders sometimes restricted the rights or liberties of 
civilian members as if they were military members.
    (A) Examples include the following:
    (1) Placing members under a curfew.
    (2) Requiring members to work extended hours or unusual shifts.

[[Page 307]]

    (3) Changing duty assignments and responsibilities.
    (4) Restricting proximity travel to and from the military 
installation.
    (5) Imposing dress and grooming standards.
    (B) Consequences for noncompliance might include a loss of some 
privilege, dismissal from the group, or trial under military law. Such 
military discipline acts in favor of recognition.
    (v) Subjection to military justice. Military members are subject to 
the military criminal justice system. During times of war, ``persons 
serving with or accompanying an Armed Force in the field'' are subject 
to the military criminal justice code. Those who were serving with the 
U.S. Armed Forces may have been treated as if they were military and 
subjected to court-martial jurisdiction to maintain discipline. Such 
treatment is a factor in favor of recognition.
    (vi) Prohibition against members of the group joining the armed 
forces. Some organizations may have been formed to serve in a military 
capacity to overcome the operation of existing laws or treaty or because 
of a governmentally established policy to retain individuals in the 
group as part of a civilian force. These factors act in favor of 
recognition.
    (vii) Receipt of military training and/or achievement of military 
capability. If a group employed skills or resources that were enhanced 
as the result of military training or equipment designed or issued for 
that purpose, this acts toward recognition.
    (2) Incidents not favoring equivalency--(i) Submission to the U.S. 
Armed Forces for protection. A group that seeks protection and 
assistance from the U.S. Armed Forces and submits to military control 
for its own well-being is not deemed to have provided service to the 
Armed Forces equivalent to AD military service, even though the group 
may have been as follows:
    (A) Armed by the U.S. military for defensive purposes.
    (B) Routed by the U.S. military to avoid the enemy.
    (C) Instructed by the U.S. military for the defense of the group 
when attacked by, or in danger of attack by, the enemy.
    (D) Otherwise submitted themselves to the U.S. military for 
sustenance and protection.
    (ii) Permitted to resign. The ability of members to resign at will 
and without penalty acts against military control. Penalty may be direct 
and severe, such as confinement, or indirect and moderate, such as 
difficult and costly transportation from an overseas location.
    (iii) Prior recognition of group service. Recognition of a group's 
service by agencies of State or local government does not provide 
support in favor of recognition under this part.
    (3) Status of group in international law. In addition to other 
factors, consideration will be given to whether members of the group 
were regarded and treated as civilians, or assimilated to the Armed 
Forces as reflected in treaties, customary international law, judicial 
decisions, and U.S. diplomatic practice.
    (c) Reconsideration. Applications by groups previously denied a 
favorable determination by the Secretary of the Air Force shall be 
reconsidered under this part if the group submits evidence that is new, 
relevant, and substantive. Any request that the DoD Civilian/Military 
Service Review Board established hereunder (see Sec. 47.5(b)) 
determines does not provide new, relevant, and substantive evidence 
shall be returned to the applicant with the reasons for nonacceptance.
    (d) Counsel Representation. Neither the Department of Defense nor 
Department of Transportation shall provide representation by counsel or 
defray the cost of such representation with respect to any matter 
covered by this part.


<R05>
Sec. 47.5  Responsibilities.

Secretary of the Air Force is final. There is no appeal.
    (9) Notify the following persons in writing when a group 
determination is made (if the Secretary of the Air Force disagrees with 
the rationale or recommendations of the board, the Secretary of the Air 
Force shall provide the decision and reasons for it in writing to these 
persons):
    (i) The applicant(s) for the group.

and the implementing documents of the appropriate statutes of the 
Military Department concerned or the DoT and the instructions of the DoD 
Civilian/Military Service Review Board.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Copies may be obtained, if needed, from the U.S. Naval 
Publications and Forms Center, Attn: 1053, 5801 Tabor Avenue, 
Philadelphia, PA 19120.
    \2\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 47.5(c)(4).

connected injuries or disease during the recognized period

[[Page 309]]

of AD service. A DD Form 1300 shall be issued with the equivalent pay 
grade annotated for a member who died during the recognized period of 
service. A DD Form 214 shall not include pay grade, unless the 
Department of Veterans Affairs requests that a grade determination be 
given. Determinations of equivalent grade shall be based on the 
following criteria in order of importance:
    (i) Officially recognized organizational grade or equivalent rank.
    (ii) The corresponding rank for civilian pay grade.
    (iii) If neither of the criteria in paragraphs (c)(7) (i) and (ii) 
of this section, and applies, only one of three grades may be issued; 
i.e., O-1, E-4, or E-1. Selection depends on the nature of the job

                      Subpart A_General Information


<R05>
Sec. 48.101  Purpose.

    The purpose of the Retired Serviceman's Family Protection Plan is to 
permit each member of the uniformed services to elect to receive a 
reduced amount of any retired pay which may be awarded him as a result 
of service in his uniformed service in order to provide an annuity 
payable after his death (while entitled to retired pay) to his widow, 
child, or children, subject to certain limitations specified in the law 
and elaborated in the regulations in this part.

                      Subpart B_Election of Options


<R05>
Sec. 48.201  Options.

    As provided in Sec. 48.203, a member may elect one or more of the 
following annuities. The amount must be specified at time of election, 
and may not be for more than 50 per centum nor less than 12\1/2\ per 
centum of his retired pay, in no case may be less than a $25 monthly 
annuity be elected. If the election is made in terms of dollars, the 
amount may be more than 50 per centum of the retired pay that he would 
receive if he were to retire at the time of election; however, if such 
elected amount exceeds 50 per centum of his retired pay when he does 
retire, it shall be reduced to an amount equal to such 50 per centum. 
Also, if the dollar amount elected is less than 12\1/2\ per centum of 
his retired pay when he does retire, it shall be increased to an amount 
equal to such 12\1/2\ per centum.
    (a) Option 1 is an annuity payable to or on behalf of his widow, the 
annuity to terminate upon her death or remarriage.
    (b) Option 2 is an annuity payable to or on behalf of his surviving 
child or children as defined in Sec. 48.102, the annuity to terminate 
when there ceases to be at least one such surviving child eligible to 
receive the annuity. Each payment under such annuity shall be paid in 
equal shares to or on behalf of the surviving children remaining 
eligible at the time the payment is due. A member who had this option in 
effect on the date of retirement, and who retired on or after November 
1, 1968, may apply to the Secretary concerned to have a child (other 
than a child described in Sec. 48.102(e)(4)) who is at least 18 but 
less than 23 years of age considered not to be an eligible beneficiary 
under this paragraph (b) or Sec. 48.202. Normally such applications 
will be approved.
    (c) Option 3 is an annuity to or on behalf of his widow and 
surviving child or children. Such annuity shall be paid to the widow 
until death or remarriage, and thereafter each payment under such 
annuity shall be paid in equal shares to or on behalf of the surviving 
children remaining eligible at the time the payment is due. A member may 
provide for allocating, during the period of the surviving spouse's 
eligibility, a part of the annuity under this subpart B for payment to 
those of his surviving children who are not children of that spouse. The 
sum allotted will not exceed the equitable share for which such children 
would be eligible after the death of the widow.
    (d) When no eligible beneficiary remains to benefit from the option 
elected, the member's retired pay will be restored (except as provided 
in Sec. 48.604, for certain members retired before Aug. 13, 1968). All 
elections on file on Aug. 13, 1968, for members not entitled to receive 
retired pay will be considered to include the restoration feature with 
attendant cost factors being applied at time of retirement. For the 
purpose of this paragraph, a child (other than a child described in 
Sec. 48.102(e)(4)) who is at least 18 but less than 23 years of age, 
and is not pursuing a course of study as defined in Sec. 48.102(e)(5), 
shall be considered an eligible beneficiary unless an approved 
application by the member pursuant to Sec. 48.201(b) that such a child 
is not to be considered an eligible beneficiary is in effect (for 
members who retire on or after Nov. 1, 1968).

[[Page 313]]


<R05>
Sec. 48.202  Limitation on number of annuities.

    When a member desires to provide both the annuity provided by Option 
1 and Option 2, he may elect amounts that, in total, meet the 
limitations specified in Sec. 48.201. The cost of each annuity, and the 
amount of each annuity shall be determined separately. A member may not 
elect the combination of Options 1 and 3 or Options 2 and 3 in any case. 
The combined amount of the annuities may not be more than 50 per centum 
nor less than 12\1/2\ per centum of his retired pay. In no case may less 
than a $25 per month combined annuity be provided.


<R05>
Sec. 48.203  Election of options.

    (a) A member who has completed less than 19 years of service as 
defined in Sec. 48.102(o) may elect to receive a reduced amount of 
retired pay in order to provide one or more of the annuities as 
specified in Sec. Sec. 48.201 and 48.202, payable after his death while 
entitled to retired pay to or on behalf of his surviving widow, child, 
or children. To be effective, the election by such a member must be 
dated, signed, witnessed, and delivered to appropriate service 
officials, or postmarked not later than midnight on the day in which he 
completes 19 years of service. Such an election will become effective 
immediately upon subsequent retirement. The latest election, change, or 
revocation made in accordance with this subsection will, if otherwise 
valid, be the effective election, unless superseded by a change as 
provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a member 
who fails or declines to make an election before completion of 19 years 
of service may make an election after that time. However, unless the 
election is made at least 2 years prior to the date the member becomes 
entitled to receive retired pay, it will not be effective. The same 
applies to subsequent changes or revocations made prior to retirement.
    (c) If an election, revocation, or change was made prior to August 
13, 1968, the 19-year and 2-year provisions are automatically in effect 
on August 13, 1968, for members who were not entitled to retired pay on 
such date, unless the member applies under Sec. 48.604(d) to remain 
under the provisions of the law prior to August 13, 1968. In this case 
the ``18 years of service'' and ``3 years prior to receipt of retired 
pay'' rules will apply.
    (d) A member retired for physical disability on or after November 1, 
1968 who is awarded retired pay prior to completion of 19 years of 
service may make an election which is subject to the restrictions set 
forth in Sec. 48.507. The election by such member shall be made before 
the first day for which he is entitled to retired pay. Elections made 
under this paragraph prior to November 1, 1968, must be made by the 
member retiring for physical disability prior to completing 18 years.
    (e) If, because of military operations, a member is assigned to an 
isolated station, or is missing, interned in a neutral country, captured 
by a hostile force, or beleaguered or besieged, and for that reason is 
unable to make an election before completing 19 years of service, he may 
make the election within 1 year after he ceases to be assigned to that 
station or returns to the jurisdiction of his service as the case may 
be, and such election shall become effective immediately upon subsequent 
retirement.
    (f) A member to whom retired pay is granted retroactively, and who 
is otherwise eligible to make an election, may make the election within 
90 days after receiving notice that such pay has been granted him.
    (g) Whenever a member is determined to be mentally incompetent by 
medical officers of the uniformed services or of the Veterans 
Administration, or is adjudged mentally incompetent by a court of 
competent jurisdiction and because of such mental incompetency is 
incapable of making any election within the time limitations prescribed 
by the Plan, the Secretary of the Department concerned may make the 
appropriate election on behalf of such member upon request of the 
spouse, or if there be no spouse, by or on behalf of the child or 
children of such member. If such member is subsequently determined to be 
mentally competent by the Veterans Administration or a court of 
competent jurisdiction, he may, within 180 days after such determination 
or

[[Page 314]]

judgment, change or revoke the election made on his behalf. In such a 
case, the change or revocation will be effective on the date of the 
member's request for such change or revocation. Deductions previously 
made shall not be refunded.
    (h) All elections on file on August 13, 1968, for members not 
entitled to receive retired pay shall be subject to the provisions of 
this section unless the member makes the application specified in Sec. 
48.604(d).
    (i) A person who was a former member of the armed forces on November 
1, 1953, and who is granted retired pay after that date, may, at the 
time he is granted that pay, make an election as provided in Sec. 
48.201.


<R05>
Sec. 48.204  Change or revocation of election.

    (a) A change of election is a change in the amount of the annuity or 
annuities under any option, or a change in any option or options 
selected. A revocation is a cancellation of a previous election and 
constitutes a withdrawal from coverage under the Plan.
    (b) A member may change or revoke his election as often as he 
desires prior to the completion of 19 years of service. Such a change or 
revocation must be dated, signed, witnessed, and delivered to 
appropriate service officials, or postmarked not later than midnight on 
the day in which the member completes 19 years of service. The latest 
election, change, or revocation which is submitted in accordance with 
this subsection will be effective at retirement.
    (c) A member who desires to make an election or change or revoke his 
election after he has completed 19 years of service may do so prior to 
his retirement. However, such an election, change or revocation will be 
effective only if at least 2 years elapse between the date of the 
election, change, or revocation and the date of eligibility to receive 
retired pay.
    (d) A revocation will not prohibit the filing of a new election at a 
later date which will become valid under applicable validation 
provisions.
    (e) A member may, on or after November 1, 1968, at any time prior to 
his retirement, change or revoke his election (provided the change does 
not increase the amount of the annuity elected) to reflect a change in 
the marital or dependency status of the member of his family caused by 
death, divorce, annulment, remarriage, or acquisition of a child, if 
such change or revocation is made within 2 years of such change in 
status.
    (f) Notification of a change in family status is not a change of 
election.
    (g) All changes and revocations on file on August 13, 1968, for 
members not entitled to retired pay shall be subject to the provisions 
of this section unless the member makes the application specified in 
Sec. 48.604(d).


<R05>
Sec. 48.205  Election form.

    The form for making election after October 31, 1968, is prescribed 
as Election of Options, Retired Serviceman's Family Protection Plan, DD 
Form 1688. \1\ It will be submitted as directed herein. All copies will 
be signed, and any otherwise complete, signed copy, when properly 
submitted, may be used to substantiate the fact of election, 
modification, revocation, or change in family status.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Filed as part of the original document. Copies may be obtained 
from Military Personnel Office.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 48.206  Information regarding elections.

    (a) All members of the Reserve component who will have accumulated 
sufficient service to be eligible for retired pay at age 60, will be 
counseled on the Plan before reaching their 57th birth dates in order to 
insure that valid elections can be made prior to their 58th birth dates. 
An election, modification, or revocation submitted subsequent to 
attaining age 58 will be valid only if it is made and submitted at least 
2 years prior to the first date for which retired pay is granted.
    (b) It is the responsibility of the department concerned to provide 
election forms and to promulgate information concerning the benefits of 
the Plan to all members so as to allow a timely election.
    (c) Members retiring for physical disability prior to the completion 
of 19

[[Page 315]]

years of service will, prior to retirement, be counseled and furnished 
information concerning the operation of the Plan.


<R04>
                 Subpart C_Designation of Beneficiaries


<R05>
Sec. 48.301  Designation.

    (a) All legal beneficiaries described in Sec. 48.102 must be named 
at the date of retirement pursuant to the option elected. Although a 
member without dependents may make an election, it will not be effective 
unless he has eligible dependents at the time of his retirement.
    (b) When a change in family status occurs prior to retirement which 
would effect a change as provided in Sec. 48.204(e), new DD Form 
1688,<SUP>1</SUP> Election of Options, Retired Servicemen's Family 
Protection Plan, should be filed to evidence such change.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 48.205.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 48.302  Substantiating evidence regarding dependency and age of 
dependents.

    At the time of submitting the election, or prior to retirement, the 
member must indicate his wife's and youngest child birth date as 
applicable to the option elected. At or before the time of his 
retirement, he must submit proof of final dissolution of prior 
marriages, if any, both for himself and his spouse. The age of the 
dependents must be substantiated by a birth certificate or other 
competent evidence. The birth date of a member must be verified by his 
service record. All required substantiating evidence must be at the 
disbursing office which would normally pay the member retired pay or 
retainer pay immediately following retirement so as to permit the 
establishment of accurate pay accounts and to prevent the creation of 
indebtedness or overpayments.


<R05>
Sec. 48.303  Condition affecting entitlement of widow or widower.

    A member may have a different lawful spouse at the time of 
retirement from the lawful spouse he had at the time of election. The 
lawful spouse at the time of retirement is the spouse eligible for an 
annuity at the time of member's death. Divorce of the member will remove 
the former spouse as a prospective annuitant.


<R04>
                   Subpart D_Reduction of Retired Pay


<R05>
Sec. 48.401  Computation of reduction.

    (a) The reduction to be made in the retired pay of a member who has 
made an election shall be computed by the uniformed service concerned in 
each individual case, based upon tables of factors prepared by the Board 
of Actuaries. The computation shall be based upon the applicable table 
in effect on the date of retirement.
    (b) An adjustment may be made in the reduction of retired pay upon 
the finding of an administrative error or a mistake of fact (see Sec. 
48.603).
    (c) If a member elects to be covered by option 3, and on the date he 
is awarded retired pay has no children eligible to receive the annuity, 
or has only a child or children aged 18-22 (other than a child described 
in Sec. 48.102(e)(4) and elects, at retirement, that such child or 
children shall not be considered to be eligible beneficiaries, he shall 
have his costs computed as though he had elected option 1. If he elects 
option 3, and on the date he is awarded retired pay has no wife eligible 
for the annuity, he shall have his costs computed as though he had 
elected option 2.
    (d) If a member elects option 3, and after he becomes entitled to 
retired pay, there is no eligible spouse because of death or divorce, 
upon the retired member's application, no deductions from his retired 
pay shall be made after the last day of the month in which there ceases 
to be an eligible spouse. Children otherwise eligible will continue to 
be eligible for the annuity in event of the member's death. No amounts 
by which the member's retired pay is reduced before that date may be 
refunded to or credited on behalf of that person.
    (e) The amount of reduction in retired pay and the annuity payable 
established for each individual at the time of his retirement shall 
remain unaltered except as provided in Sec. 48.203(g), paragraphs (b) 
and (d) of this

[[Page 316]]

section, and Sec. 48.406, regardless of future pay increases or 
decreases.


<R05>
Sec. 48.402  Effective date of reduction.

    The effective date of reduction in retired pay will be the effective 
date of retirement with pay. The reduction in retired pay will be 
terminated on the date the member ceases to be entitled to retired pay 
or on the first day of the month following that in which there is no 
eligible beneficiary (for exception to this rule see Sec. 48.604).


<R05>
Sec. 48.403  Payment of nonwithheld reduction of retired pay.

    (a) A member of a uniformed service who is entitled to retired pay 
and has made an election shall, during any period in which he is not 
receiving retired pay (including periods of active duty), deposit the 
amount which would have been withheld from his retired pay had he been 
receiving that pay.
    (b) Such deposit will be payable to Treasurer of the United States 
and shall be forwarded monthly to the disbursing office which would 
normally pay the member his retired pay.
    (c) The disbursing office will in all cases inform the member of the 
amount to be deposited and when such deposits are to be made.
    (d) In the event deposits are not made within 30 days of the due 
date, the disbursing office will inform the member concerned that he is 
delinquent from such due date and thereafter his designated 
beneficiaries will not be eligible for the annuity provided under the 
Plan until the arrears have been paid. The notification of delinquency 
will advise the member that 15 additional days have been granted to him 
in which to remit his deposit, and that if the arrears are not deposited 
within that period, the member will be charged interest to include the 
first day of delinquency. In no case will the expiration date of the 15 
days exceed a date later than 45 days from the date the deposit was due. 
The interest will be computed monthly and the rate will be that used in 
computing the cost tables in effect on the date of the member's 
retirement. If such member later becomes in receipt of retired pay, any 
arrears with compound interest will be withheld.


<R05>
Sec. 48.404  Ages to be used.

    Ages to be used for calculating reductions of retired pay will be 
the ages of the member and his eligible dependents on their nearest 
birth dates as of the date of the member's retirement.


<R05>
Sec. 48.405  Action upon removal from temporary disability retired list.

    (a) Any member on the temporary disability retired list established 
pursuant to title 10, United States Code, chapter 61, who has elected to 
receive reduced retired pay in order to provide one or more of the 
annuities specified in the Plan, and who is subsequently removed from 
the list due to any reason other than permanent retirement, shall have 
refunded to him a sum which represents the difference between the amount 
by which his retired pay has been reduced and the cost of an amount of 
term insurance which is equal to the protection provided his dependents 
during the period he was on the temporary disability retired list.
    (b) If the member concerned is returned to active duty, his election 
as previously made will continue or he may change or revoke the election 
as provided in Sec. 48.204.
    (c) Time creditable for the purpose of the two year interval 
required to make a change, revocation or new election valid includes 
service before, during, and after temporary disability retirement. (See 
Sec. Sec. 48.203 and 48.204 and Comptroller Decision B-144158, Dec. 23, 
1960.) Active duty after removal from a temporary disability retired 
list is a necessity in such a case.


<R05>
Sec. 48.406  Withdrawal and reduction of percentage or amount of 
participation.

    A retired member who is participating in the Plan may revoke his 
election and withdraw from participation, or he may reduce the amount of 
the survivor annuity; however, an approved withdrawal or reduction will 
not be effective earlier than the first day of the seventh month 
beginning after the date his application is received by the Finance 
Center controlling his pay record. (For special rules covering 
participating members retired before Aug. 13, 1968, without option 4, 
see Sec. 48.604.)

[[Page 317]]

No application for reduction will be approved which requests a change in 
options. A request to reduce an annuity or to withdraw from the Plan is 
irrevocable, and a retired member who withdraws may never again 
participate in the Plan. Approval of a request for a reduction will not 
be made when such reduction results in an annuity of less than 12\1/2\ 
per centum of the member's retired pay or less than a $25 monthly 
annuity. The new cost, after such reduction in survivor annuity, will be 
computed from the applicable cost table at the time of retirement. No 
amounts by which a member's retired pay is reduced may be refunded to, 
or credited on behalf of, the member by virtue of an application made by 
him under this section.


<R04>
                            Subpart E_Annuity


<R05>
Sec. 48.501  General information.

    Except as provided in Sec. 48.506(a), no annuity payable under the 
Plan shall be assignable, or subject to execution, levy, attachment, 
garnishment, or other legal process. Annuities payable under this Plan 
shall be in addition to any pensions or other payments to which the 
beneficiaries may now or hereafter be entitled under other provisions of 
law (except as provided in Sec. 48.507), and may not be considered as 
income under any law administered by the Veterans Administration, except 
for the purpose of title 38 U.S. Code, section 415(g) and chapter 15.


<R05>
Sec. 48.502  Effective date of annuity.

    All annuities payable under this Plan except those payable to 
beneficiaries described in Sec. 48.102(e)(5) shall accrue from the 
first day of the month in which the retired member dies and shall be due 
and payable not later than the 15th day of each month following that 
month and in equal monthly installments thereafter, except that no 
annuity shall accrue or be paid for the month in which entitlement to 
that annuity terminates.


<R05>
Sec. 48.503  Claims for annuity payments.

    Upon official notification of the death of a retired member who has 
elected under the Plan, the department concerned shall forward to the 
eligible surviving beneficiaries the necessary information and forms (DD 
Form 768. Application for Annuity Under Retired Serviceman's Family 
Protection Plan) for making application for annuity payments. Such 
information shall include the place to which the application should be 
forwarded and to which questions regarding annuity payments should be 
addressed.


<R05>
Sec. 48.504  Payment to children.

    (a) Annuities for a child or children will be paid to the child's 
guardian, or if there is no guardian, to the person(s) who has care, 
custody, and control of the child or children.
    (b) Annuities payable to or on behalf of an eligible child as 
defined in Sec. 48.102(e)(5) accrue as of the first day of the month in 
which--
    (1) The member (upon whose retired pay the annuity is based) dies if 
the eligible child's 18th birthday occurs in the same or a preceding 
month, or
    (2) The 18th birthday of an eligible child occurs if the member 
(upon whose retired pay the annuity is based) died in a preceding month, 
or
    (3) A child first becomes (or again becomes) eligible, if that 
eligible child's 18th birthday and the death of the member (upon whose 
retired pay the annuity is based) both occurred in a preceding month or 
months. An eligible child under this paragraph might become ineligible 
at age 18 and again become eligible by furnishing proof of pursuit of a 
full time course of study or training as enumerated in Sec. 
48.102(e)(5).


<R05>
Sec. 48.505  Establishing eligibility of annuitants.

    (a) Eligibility for the annuity will be established by such evidence 
as may be required by the department concerned.
    (b) If a child as defined in Sec. 48.102(e)(4) is a designated 
annuitant, the department concerned shall require proof that the 
incapacity for self-support existed prior to the child's reaching age 
18. Proof that continued incapacitation exists will be required every 2 
years after the child passes the age of 18 years, except in a case where 
medical prognosis indicates recovery is impossible.
    (c) If a child as defined in Sec. 48.102(e)(5) is a designated 
annuitant, as specified

[[Page 318]]

in Sec. 48.504(b), the department concerned shall require proof from 
the institution at least semiannually that the child is pursuing a full-
time course of training as prescribed. For the purpose of proving 
eligibility, a child is considered to be pursuing a full-time course of 
study or training during an interval between school periods that does 
not exceed 150 days if he has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the 
department concerned that he has a bona fide intention of commencing, 
resuming, or continuing to pursue a full-time course of study or 
training in a recognized educational institution immediately after that 
interval.


<R05>
Sec. 48.506  Recovery of erroneous annuity payments.

    (a) The Secretary of the Department concerned is empowered to use 
any means provided by law to recover amounts of annuities erroneously 
paid to any individual under the Plan. He may authorize such recovery by 
adjustment in subsequent payments to which the individual is entitled.
    (b) There need be no recovery when in the judgment of the Secretary 
of the Department concerned and the Comptroller General of the United 
States, the individual to whom the erroneous payment was made is without 
fault and recovery would be contrary to the purpose of the Plan or would 
be against equity and good conscience.


<R05>
Sec. 48.507  Restriction on participation.

    (a) If a person who has made an election under the Plan retires with 
a physical disability before the completion of 19 years of service and 
then dies in retirement, his widow and eligible children can receive 
monthly survivor annuities only if they are not eligible for Dependency 
and Indemnity Compensation payments from the Veterans Administration. If 
either the widow or children are eligible for dependency and indemnity 
compensation payments, then payment of annuities under the Plan may not 
be made to any member of the family. If the retired member's death was 
not service connected and his widow or children are not eligible for 
payments from the Veterans Administration, they may receive the provided 
annuity payments under the Plan.
    (b) If the beneficiaries on whose behalf the election was made are 
restricted as in paragraph (a) of this section, from receiving 
annuities, the amounts withheld from the elector's retired pay as a 
result of the election will be refunded to the beneficiaries, less the 
amount of any annuity paid, and without interest.
    (c) Upon notification of the death of the member in such a case, the 
department concerned will take the following actions:
    (1) Notify the Central Office of the Veterans Administration of the 
death of the member and request that the department concerned be advised

Sec. 48.604  Transition and protective clauses.

    (a) A retired member who is participating in the Plan without 
inclusion of former option 4, which provided for restoration of retired 
pay when no eligible beneficiary remained in his election, may before 
September 1, 1969, elect to have that option included in his election. 
The election to include such option 4 becomes effective on the first day 
of the month following the month in which that election was made. The 
retired member must on or before the effective date agree to pay to the 
Treasury both the total additional amount to cover the option had it 
been effective when he retired, and the interest which would have 
accrued on the additional amount up to the effective date of the new 
option 4. No such additional amount (except interest) shall accrue for 
months after the first month for which the individual had no eligible 
beneficiary. However, if undue hardship or financial burden would 
result, payments may be made in from 2 to 12 monthly installments when 
the monthly amount involved is $25 or less, or in from 2 to 36 
installments when the monthly amounts involved exceed $25. No amounts by 
which a member's retired pay was reduced may be refunded to, or credited 
on behalf of, the retired member by virtue of an application made by him 
under this section. A retired member who does not make the additional 
election provided under this section within the time limits will not be 
allowed to reduce an annuity or withdraw from participation in the Plan 
as provided by Sec. 48.406.
    (b) Members who have elected and are not yet retired will 
automatically participate under the provisions of Sec. 48.201.

cost tables applicable on the date of the member's retirement.

[[Page 320]]

    (d) Any member who has filed an election, modification, or 
revocation prior to August 13, 1968, may before September 1, 1969, 
submit a written application to the Secretary concerned requesting that 
such election, modification, or revocation remain under the time-of-
election provisions of the law applicable on the date it was filed.

    (ii) A certified copy of the support order.
    (iii) The amount of the monthly support payment. Such amount may

shall be applied toward liquidation of the arrearages.
    (iv) A statement that delinquent support payments are more than 12 
weeks in arrears, if appropriate.
    (v) Sufficient information identifying the member to enable

sufficient time, an attempt shall be made to inform the authorized 
person who sent the notice that it will not be honored unless adequate

    (5) Upon receipt of effective notice of delinquent support payments, 
together with all required supplementary documents and information, the

allotted under this provision, together with any other moneys withheld 
for support from the member, does not exceed:
    (i) Fifty percent of the member's disposable earnings for any month 
in which the member asserts by affidavit or other acceptable evidence 
that he or she is supporting a spouse, dependent child, or both, other

support claim is contested by the authorized person, that authorized 
person may refer this matter to the appropriate court or other authority

in which the member fails to assert by affidavit or other acceptable 
evidence that he or she is supporting a spouse, dependent child, or 
both.
    (iii) Regardless of the limitations above, an additional 5 percent 
of the member's disposable earnings shall be withheld when the notice

more weeks in arrears.

    (6) Advances of pay received by the member before receipt of notice 
(see paragraph (c)(1) of this section) that may be due and payable by 
the member at some future date. Requests for advances received after 
notice for a statutorily required support allotment shall be reduced by 
the amount of the statutorily required support allotment.
    (7) Other amounts required by law to be deducted.
    (d) Notice to member and member's Commanding Officer.
    (1) As soon as possible, but not later than 15 calendar days after 
the date of receipt of notice, the designated official shall send to the 
member, at his or her duty station, written notice:
    (i) That notice has been received from an authorized person, 
including a copy of the documents submitted.
    (ii) Of the maximum limitations provided in 15 U.S.C. 1673, with a

limitation.

documentation as evidence that the information contained in the notice

be provided by the Military Service, if possible, and that the member

notice and other legal documentation served on the designated official.
    (3) The Military Services shall provide the member with the 
following:
    (i) When possible, an in-person consultation with a judge advocate 
or legal officer of the Military Service concerned, to discuss the legal 
and other factors, involved in the member's support obligation and 
failure to make payment.
    (ii) Copies any other documents submitted with the notice.
    (4) The member's commanding officer, or designee, shall confirm in 
writing to the designated official within 30 days of notice that the 
member received a consultation concerning the member's support 
obligation and the consequences of failure to make payments, or when 
appropriate, of the inability to arrange such consultation and the 
status of continuing efforts to fulfill the consultation requirement.
    (5) If, within 30 days of the date of the notice, the member has 
furnished

[[Page 324]]

the designated official affidavits or other documentation showing the 
information in the notice to be in error, the designated official shall 
consider the member's response. The designated official may return to 
the authorized person, without action, the notice for a statutorily 
required support allotment together with the member's affidavit and 
other documentation, if the member submits substantial proof of error, 
such as:
    (i) The support payments are not delinquent.
    (ii) The underlying support order in the notice has been amended, 
superseded, or set aside.
    (e) Payments. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) the 
Secretary of the Military Department concerned, or designee, shall make 
the support allotment by the first end-of-month payday after the 
designated official is notified that the member has had a consultation 
with a judge advocate or legal officer, or that a consultation was not 
possible, but not later than the first end-of-month payday after 30 days 
have elapsed from the date of the notice to the member. The Military 
Services will not be required to vary their normal military allotment 
payment cycle to comply with the notice.
    (2) If several notices are sent with respect to the same member, 
payments shall be satisfied on a first-come, first-served basis within 
the amount limitations in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
    (3) When the member identified in the notice is found not to be 
entitled to money due from or payable by the Military Service, the 
designated official shall return the notice to the authorized person and 
shall advise him or her that no money is due from or payable by the 
Military Service to the named individual. When it appears that amounts 
are exhausted temporarily or otherwise unavailable, the authorized 
person shall be told why, and for how long, any money is unavailable, if 
known. If the member separates from active duty, the authorized person 
shall be informed that the allotment is discontinued.
    (4) Payment of statutorily required allotments shall be enforced 
over other voluntary deductions and allotments when the gross amount of 
pay and allowances is not sufficient to permit all authorized deductions 
and collections.
    (5) The authorized person or allottee shall notify the designated 
official promptly if the operative court order upon which the allotment 
is based is vacated, modified, or set aside. The designated official 
shall also be notified of any events affecting the allottee's 
eligibility to receive the allotment, such as the former spouse's 
remarriage, if a part of the payment is for spousal support, and notice 
of a change in eligibility for child support payments under 
circumstances of death, emancipation, adoption, or attainment of 
majority of a child whose support is provided through the allotment.
    (6) An allotment established under this Directive shall be adjusted 
or discontinued upon notice from the authorized person.
    (7) Neither the Department of Defense, nor any officer or employee 
thereof, shall be liable for any payment made from moneys due from, or 
payable by, the Department of Defense to any individual pursuant to 
notice regular on its face, if such payment is made in accordance with 
this part. If a designated official receives notices based on a support 
order which, on its face, appears to conform to the laws of the 
jurisdiction from which it was issued, the designated official shall not 
be required to ascertain whether the authority that issued the order had 
obtained personal jurisdiction over the member.

receiving the aid, benefit, or service.
    (3) A recipient or DoD Component may not deny a qualified 
handicapped person the opportunity to participate in programs or 
activities that are not separate or different from regular programs or 
activities, even if such separate or different programs and activities 
are permissible under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.
    (4) A recipient or DoD Component may not provide assistance to an 
agency, organization, or person that discriminates on the basis of 
handicap in providing any aid, benefit, or service to beneficiaries of 
the recipient's program or activity.
    (5) A recipient of DoD Component may not deny, on the basis of 
handicap, a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate

basis of handicap;
    (ii) Defeat or substantially impair accomplishment of the objectives 
of the recipient's or DoD Component's program or activity with respect 
to handicapped persons; or
    (iii) Perpetuate discrimination by another recipient if both 
recipients are subject to common administrative control or are agencies 
of the same State.
    (7) In determining the site or location of a facility, a recipient 
or DoD Component may not make selections that:
    (i) Exclude handicapped persons from, deny them the benefits of, or 
otherwise subject them to discrimination under any program or activity 
that receives or benefits from Federal financial assistance; or
    (ii) Defeat or substantially impair, with respect to handicapped 
persons, the accomplishment of the objectives of the program or 
activity.
    (8) Recipients and DoD Components shall administer programs and 
activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of 
qualified handicapped persons.
    (9) Recipients and DoD Components shall take appropriate steps to 
make communications with their applicants, employees, and beneficiaries 
available to persons with impaired vision and hearing.
    (10) This section may not be interpreted to prohibit the exclusion 
of:

[[Page 330]]

    (i) Persons who are not handicapped from benefits, programs, and 
activities limited by Federal statute or Executive order to handicapped 
persons; or
    (ii) One class of handicapped persons from a program or activity 
limited by Federal statute or Executive order to a different class of 
handicapped persons.
    (11) Recipients and DoD Components shall take appropriate steps to 
ensure that no handicapped individual is denied the benefits of, 
excluded from participation in, or otherwise subjected to discrimination 
under any program or activity receiving or benefiting from Federal 
financial assistance disbursed by the Department of Defense or under any 
program or activity conducted by the Department of Defense because of 
the absence of auxiliary aids, such as certified sign-language

providing or administering fringe benefits to employees of the 
recipient, and organizations providing training and apprenticeship 
programs.
    (4) A recipient shall make reasonable accommodation to the known 
physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified handicapped 
applicant or employee unless the recipient can demonstrate that the 
accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its 
program. Reasonable accommodation includes providing ramps, accessible 
restrooms, drinking fountains, interpreters for deaf employees, readers 
for blind employees, amplified telephones, TDDs such as Teletypewriters 
or Telephone Writers (TTYs), and tactile signs on elevators.

ability to perform job-related functions.
    (7) When a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the 
effects of past discrimination or is taking voluntary action to overcome 
the effects of conditions that have resulted in limited participation by 
handicapped persons in its federally assisted program or activity, the 
recipient may invite applicants for employment to indicate

[[Page 331]]

whether and to what extent they are handicapped if:
    (i) The recipient makes clear to the applicants that the information 
is intended for use solely in connection with its remedial action 
obligations or its voluntary affirmative action efforts.
    (ii) The recipient makes clear to the applicants that the 
information is being requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be 
kept confidential as provided in paragraph (b)(9) in this section, that 
refusal to provide it will not subject the applicants to any adverse 
treatment, and that it will be used only in accordance with this part.
    (8) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a recipient from 
conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical 
examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty if:
    (i) All entering employees are subjected to such an examination, 
regardless of handicap.
    (ii) The results of such an examination are used only in accordance 
with this part which prohibits discrimination against a qualified 
handicapped person on the basis of handicap.

records, except that:
    (i) Supervisors and managers may be informed about restrictions on 
the work or duties of handicapped persons and about necessary 
accommodations.
    (ii) First aid and safety personnel may be informed, when 
appropriate, if a handicapping condition might require emergency 
treatment.
    (iii) Government officials investigating compliance with section 
504, Pub. L. 93-112, and this part shall be provided relevant 
information upon request.
    (c) Program accessibility--(1) General requirements. No qualified 
handicapped person shall, because a recipient's or DoD Component's 
facilities are inaccessible to or not usable by handicapped persons, be 
denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise 
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity that 
receives or benefits from Federal financial assistance disbursed by the 
Department of Defense or under any program or activity conducted by the 
Department of Defense.
    (2) Existing facilities. (i) A recipient or DoD Component shall 
operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when 
viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. This does not necessarily require a recipient or 
DoD Component to make each of its existing facilities or every part of 
an existing facility accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. 
For guidance in determining the accessibility of facilities, see chapter 
18 of DoD 4270.1-M, ``Department of Defense Construction Criteria 
Manual,'' June 1, 1978, and Department of the Army, Office of the Chief 
of Engineers, Manual EM 1110-1-103, ``Design for the Physically 
Handicapped,'' October 15, 1976. Inquiries on specific accessibility 
design problems may be addressed to the ASD (MRA&L), or designee.
    (ii) When structural changes are necessary to make programs or 
activities in existing facilities accessible to the exent required by 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (A) Such changes shall be made as soon as practicable, but not later 
than 3 years after the effective date of this part however, if the 
program or activity is a particular mode of transportation (such as a 
subway station) that can be made accessible only through extraordinarily 
expensive structural changes to, or replacement of, existing facilities 
and if other accessible modes of transportation are available, the DoD 
Component concerned may extend this period of time. This extension shall 
be for a reasonable and definite period, which shall be determined after 
consultation with the ASD(MRA&L), or designee.
    (B) The recipient or DoD Component shall develop, with the 
assistance of interested persons or organizations and within a period to 
be established in each DoD Component's guidelines, a transition plan 
setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes.
    (C) The recipient or DoD Component shall make a copy of the 
transition plan available for public inspection. At a minimum, the plan 
shall:

[[Page 332]]

    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's or DoD 
Component's facilities that limit the accessibility of its program or 
activity to handicapped persons.
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible.
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
full program accessibility and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than 1 year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period.
    (4) Indicate the person (last name, first, and middle initial) 
responsible for implementation of the transition plan.
    (iii) A recipient or DoD Component may comply with paragraphs 
(c)(2)(i) and (c)(2)(ii) of this section, through such means as the 
acquisition or redesign of equipment, such as telecommunication or other 
telephonic devices; relocation of classes or other services to 
accessible buildings; assignment of aides to beneficiaries, such as 
readers or certified sign-language interpreters; home visits; delivery 
of health, welfare, or other services at accessible alternate sites; 
alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities in 
conformance with paragraph (c)(3) in this section; or any other method 
that results in making the program or activity of the recipient or DoD 
Component accessible to handicapped persons.
    (iv) A recipient or DoD Component is not required to make structural 
changes in existing facilities when other methods are effective in 
achieving compliance with this section.
    (v) In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements 
of this section, a recipient or DoD Component shall give priority to 
those methods that offer programs and activities to handicapped persons 
in the most integrated setting appropriate with nonhandicapped persons.
    (3) New Construction. New facilities shall be designed and 
constructed to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped 
persons. Alterations to existing facilities shall be designed and 
constructed, to the maximum extent feasible, to be readily accessible to 
and usable by handicapped persons. For guidance in determining the 
accessibility of facilities, see chapter 18 of DoD 4270.1-M and 
Department of the Army, Office of the Chief of Engineers, Manual EM 
1110-1-103. Inquiries about specific accessibility design problems may 
be addressed to the ASD(MRA&L), or designee.
    (4) Historic properties. (i) In the case of historic properties, 
program accessibility shall mean that, when viewed in their entirety, 
programs are readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. 
Because the primary benefit of historic properties is the experience of 
the property itself, DoD Components and recipients shall give priority 
to those methods of achieving program accessibility that make the 
historic property, or portions thereof, physically accessible to 
handicapped persons.
    (ii) Methods of achieving program accessibility include:
    (A) Making physical alterations that give handicapped persons access 
to otherwise inaccessible areas or features of historic properties.
    (B) Using audiovisual materials and devices to depict otherwise 
inaccessible areas or features of historic properties.
    (C) Assigning individuals to guide handicapped persons into or 
through otherwise inaccessible portions of historic properties.
    (D) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (iii) When program accessibility cannot be achieved without causing 
a substantial impairment of significant historic features, the DoD 
Component or recipient may seek a modification or waiver of access 
standards from the ASD (MRA&L), or designee.
    (A) A decision to grant a modification or waiver shall be based on 
consideration of the following:
    (1) Scale of the property, reflecting its ability to absorb 
alterations.
    (2) Use of the property, whether primarily for public or private 
purposes.
    (3) Importance of the historic features of the property to the 
conduct of the program.
    (4) Costs of alterations in comparison to the increase in 
accessibility.
    (B) The ASD(MRA&L), or designee, shall review periodically any 
waiver granted under this paragraph and may

[[Page 333]]

withdraw it if technological advances or other changes warrant.
    (iv) The decision by the ASD(MRA&L), or designee, to grant a 
modification or waiver of access standards is subject to section 106 of 
the National Historic Preservation Act, as amended, and shall be made in 
accordance with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation regulation 
on ``Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties'' (36 CFR part 800). 
When the property is federally owned or when Federal funds may be used 
for alterations, the ASD(MRA&L), or designee, shall obtain the comments 
of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation when required by 
section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and the Advisory 
Council on Historic Preservation regulation on ``Protection of Historic 
and Cultural Properties'' (36 CFR part 800) prior to effectuation of 
structural alterations.
    (v) DoD Component guidelines prepared in accordance with Sec. 56.10 
shall include a listing of all historic properties, including historic 
ships, subject to this part and a plan for compliance with paragraph 
(c)(4) of this section.
    (5) Military museums. (i) In the case of military museums, program 
accessibility shall mean that exhibits, displays, tours, lectures, 
circulating or traveling exhibits, and other programs of military 
museums are accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. Methods of 
meeting this requirement include the following:
    (A) Museum programs may be made accessible to deaf and hearing-
impaired persons by means such as training museum staff, such as 
docents, in sign language; providing qualified sign-language 
interpreters to accompany deaf or hearing-impaired visitors; ensuring 
that clear, concise language is used on all museum signs and display 
labels; providing amplification devices; or providing printed scripts 
for films, videotapes, lectures, or tours. DoD Components are encouraged 
to use ``Museums and Handicapped Students: Guidelines for Educators,'' 
published by the National Air and Space Museum, Smithsonian Institution, 
Washington, DC 20560.
    (B) Museum programs may be made accessible to blind and visually-
impaired persons by means such as providing museum catalogues in a 
large-print edition printed over braille; providing cassette tapes, 
records, or discs for museum tours or exhibits; providing readers to 
accompany blind or vis ually impaired visitors; using large-print and 
braille display cards at exhibits; providing raised-line maps of the 
museum building; using raised-line drawings, reproductions, or models of 
large exhibits to facilitate tactile experiences when touching exhibits 
is prohibited; placing large-print and braille signs to identify 
galleries, elevators, restrooms, and other service areas; and permitting 
guide dogs in all museum facilities.
    (C) Museum programs may be made accessible to other physically 
impaired persons by means such as lowering display cases; spacing 
exhibits to facilitate movement; using ramps in galleries; increasing 
lighting in exhibit areas to facilitate viewing from a distance; 
providing places to sit in exhibit areas; making restrooms accessible; 
using large-print exhibit display cards to facilitate reading from a 
distance; and sensitizing museum staff to consider the needs of 
handicapped visitors when organizing exhibits.
    (ii) DoD Component guidelines developed in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(5) of this section shall identify military museums subject to 
paragraph (c) of this section and shall contain a plan for making museum 
programs accessible to handicapped persons. Technical assistance in the 
preparation and content of these plans may be obtained from the National 
Access Center, 1419 27th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20007 ((202) 333-
1712 or TTY (202) 333-1339). In addition, community organizations that 
serve handicapped persons and handicapped persons themselves shall be 
consulted in the preparation of these plans.
    (d) Reasonable accommodation. (1) A recipient or DoD Component shall 
make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental 
limitations of an otherwise qualified handicapped applicant or employee 
unless the recipient or DoD Component demonstrates to the ASD(MRA&L), or 
designee, that the accommodation would

[[Page 334]]

impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program.
    (2) Reasonable accommodation includes the following:
    (i) Making facilities used by employees readily accessible to and 
usable by handicapped persons.
    (ii) Job restructuring; part-time or modified work schedules; 
acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, such as 
telecommunication or other telephonic instruments; the provision of 
readers or certified sign-language interpreters; and similar actions.
    (3) In determining whether an accommodation would impose an undue 
hardship on the operation of a recipient's or DoD Component's program, 
the ASD(MRA&L), or designee, shall consider the following factors, at a 
minimum:
    (i) The overall size of the recipient's or DoD Component's program 
or activity, such as the number of employees, number and type of 
facilities, and size of budget.
    (ii) The size of the recipient's or DoD Component's operations, 
including the composition and structure of the recipient's or DoD 
Component's workforce.
    (iii) The nature and cost of the accommodation needed.
    (4) A recipient or DoD Component may not deny any employment 
opportunity to a qualified handicapped employee or applicant for 
employment if the basis for the denial is the need to make reasonable 
accommodation to the physical or mental limitations of the employee or 
applicant.

Sec. 56.9  Ensuring compliance with this part in Federal financial 
assistance programs and activities.

    (a) Supplementary guidelines issued by DoD Components. (1) Whenever 
necessary, DoD Components shall publish supplementary guidelines for 
each type of program or activity to which they disburse Federal 
financial assistance within 120 days of the effective date of this part 
or of the effective date of any subsequent statute authorizing Federal 
financial assistance to a new type of program or activity. DoD 
Components shall obtain approval of these supplementary guidelines from 
the ASD(MRA&L), or designee, before issuing them. Prior to their 
issuance, the ASD(MRA&L), or designee, shall submit supplementary 
guidelines prepared pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section to the 
Coordination and Review Section, Civil Rights Division, Department of 
Justice, for review and approval. To the extent that supplementary 
guidelines issued by DoD Components deal with the employment of 
civilians in programs and activities subject to this part the 
ASD(MRA&L), or designee, shall also obtain the approval of the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in accordance with Executive 
Order 12067.
    (2) The ASD(MRA&L), or designee, and DoD Components shall ensure 
that their supplementary guidelines conform to the requirements of this 
part and that they provide:
    (i) A description of the types of programs and activities covered.

    (xiii) Requirements for the recipient to designate a responsible 
official to coordinate the implementation of supplementary guidelines.
    (xiv) Requirements for any other actions or procedures necessary to 
implement this part.
    (3) When the head of a DoD Component determines that it would not be 
appropriate to include on or more of the provisions described in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, in the supplementary guidelines of 
that DoD Component or that it is not necessary to issue such guidelines 
at all, the reasons for such determination shall be stated in writing 
and submitted to the ASD(MRA&L), or designee, for review and approval. 
Once that determination is approved, the DoD Component shall make it 
available to the public upon request.
    (4) The heads of DoD Components, or designees, shall be responsible 
for keeping the supplementary guidelines current and accurate. When a 
DoD Component determines that a program or activity should be added to 
or deleted from the guidelines, the DoD Component shall notify the 
ASD(MRA&L), or designee, in writing.
    (b) Required assurances. (1) DoD Components shall require all 
recipients to file written assurances that their programs or activities 
will be conducted in accordance with this part and supplementary 
guidelines promulgated by DoD Components. If a recipient fails to 
provide an assurance that conforms to the requirements of this section, 
the DoD Component shall attempt to effect compliance pursuant to 
paragraphs (f) through (h) of this section, provided that if assistance 
is due and payable to the recipient based on an application approved 
prior to the effective date of this part the DoD Component shall 
continue the assistance while any proceedings required by paragraphs (n) 
through (v) of this section, are pending.
    (2) DoD Components shall advise each recipient of the required 
elements of the assurance and, with respect to each program or activity, 
of the extent to which those receiving assistance from recipients shall

within 6 months of the effective date of this part or of first receiving 
Federal financial assistance disbursed by the Department of Defense, a 
self-evaluation with the assistance of interested persons, including 
handicapped persons or organizations that represent them. When 
appropriate, DoD Components also shall require recipients to consult at 
least annually with such persons. The ``Department of Health, Education, 
and Welfare Section 504 Technical Assistance Reserve Directory,'' April 
1980, shall be consulted to identify likely sources for consultation. In 
conducting its self-evaluation, each recipient shall:
    (i) Evaluate the effects of its policies and practices with respect 
to its compliance with this part and the applicable DoD Component's 
supplementary guidelines.
    (ii) Modify any policies that do not meet such requirements.

[[Page 336]]

    (iii) Take appropriate remedial steps to eliminate the 
discriminatory effects of any such policies or practices.
    (2) For at least 3 years following the completion of a self-
evaluation required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a recipient 
shall maintain on file, make available for public inspection, and 
provide to the ASD(MRA&L), or designee, upon request:
    (i) A list of the interested persons (last names, first names, and 
middle initials) consulted.
    (ii) A description of areas examined and problems identified, if 
any, with respect to those areas.
    (iii) A description of any modification made and remedial steps 
taken.
    (d) Dissemination of information. (1) Within 90 days of the 
effective date of this part or of first receiving assistance from the 
Department of Defense and on a continuing basis thereafter, each 
recipient shall notify beneficiaries and employees of their rights under 
this part and shall take appropriate steps to notify participants, 
beneficiaries, applicants for employment and employees, including those 
with impaired vision or hearing, and unions or professional 
organizations involved in collective bargaining or professional 
agreements with the recipient that the recipient does not discriminate 
on the basis of handicap in violation of this part. The notification 
shall state, when appropriate, that the recipient does not discriminate 
in admitting or providing access to or treating or employing persons in 
its programs and activities. Such notification may be accomplished by 
posting notices, publishing announcements in newspapers and magazines, 
placing notices in its publications, or distributing memoranda or other 
written communications.
    (2) If a recipient publishes or uses and makes available to 
participants, beneficiaries, applicants for employment, or employees 
recruitment materials or publications containing general information 
about the recipient's programs and activities, it shall include in those 
materials or publications a statement of the policy described in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section. This may be accomplished by including 
appropriate inserts in existing materials and publications or by 
revising and reprinting the materials and publications.
    (3) Understandable materials developed in accordance with this 
section shall be provided to ensure that all beneficiaries and employees 
of the recipient understand the information. In addition, recipients 
shall disseminate appropriate and comprehensive information about formal 
and informal complaint and appeal procedures, including directions on 
how and where to file complaints and to appeal DoD Component decisions.
    (e) Intimidation and interference. Recipients and DoD Components 
shall take reasonable steps to ensure that no person intimidates, 
threatens, coerces, or discriminates against any individual for the 
purpose of retaliating against, interfering with, or discouraging the 
filing of a complaint, furnishing of information, or assisting or 
participating in an investigation, compliance review, hearing, or other 
activity related to the administration of this part.
    (f) Staff responsibilities. All DoD Component determinations of 
recipient compliance with this part shall be subject to reviews by the 
ASD(MRA&L), or designee. When responsibility for approving applications 
for Federal financial assistance disbursed by a DoD Component is 
assigned to regional or area offices of the DoD Component, personnel in 
such offices shall be designated to perform the functions described in 
paragraphs (h) and (o) through (w) of this section.
    (g) Access to records and facilities. Each recipient shall permit 
access to its premises by DoD officials during normal business hours 
when such access is necessary for conducting onsite compliance reviews 
or complaint investigations, and shall allow such officials to 
photograph facilities and to inspect and copy any books, rec ords, 
accounts, and other material relevant to determining the recipient's 
compliance with this part. Information so obtained shall be used only in 
connection with the administration of this part. If the recipient does 
not have the information requested, it shall submit to the DoD Component 
a written report that contains a certification that the information is 
not available and describes the

[[Page 337]]

good-faith efforts made to obtain the information.
    (h) Compliance review. DoD Components shall determine the compliance 
of each recipient with this part as follows: (1) General. Whenever 
possible, DoD Components shall perform compliance reviews in conjunction 
with their review and audit efforts implementing title VI of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964.
    (2) Desk audit application review. Before approving an application 
for Federal financial assistance, the DoD Component concerned shall make 
a written determination as to whether the recipient is in compliance 
with this part, based on a review of the assurance of compliance 
executed by a recipient pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, and 
other data submitted by the recipient. When a determination cannot be 
made from the assurance and other data submitted by the recipient, the 
DoD Component concerned shall require the recipient to submit additional 
information and shall take other steps as necessary to determine the 
recipient's compliance with this part. If this additional information 
demonstrates that the recipient is in compliance with this part, the DoD 
Component shall notify the recipient promptly that it is in compliance.
    (3) Preapproval onsite review. (i) When a desk audit application 
review conducted pursuant to paragraph (h)(2) of this section indicates 
that the recipient might not be in compliance with this part, the DoD 
Component concerned may conduct a preapproval onsite review at the 
recipient's facilities before approving the disbursement of Federal 
financial assistance to the recipient. The DoD Component shall conduct 
such a review:
    (A) When appropriate, if a desk audit application review reveals 
that the recipient's compliance posture is questionable because of a 
history of discrimination complaints, current discrimination complaints, 
a noncompliance determination by another government agency or DoD 
Component, or other indications of possible noncompliance; or
    (B) If Federal financial assistance is requested for construction, 
except under extraordinary circumstances, to determine whether the 
location and design of the project would provide service on a 
nondiscriminatory basis, in conformity with Sec. 56.8(c).
    (ii) Preapproval onsite reviews shall be conducted under DoD 
Component supplementary guidelines and in accordance with the provisions 
of paragraph (h)(4) of this section, concerning postapproval reviews.

    (i) Find the recipient to be in compliance and notify the recipient 
of that finding; or
    (ii) Notify the recipient and the ASD(MRA&L), or designee, of a 
finding of probable noncompliance, pursuant to paragraph (o) of this 
section.
    (i) Filing of complaints against recipients. (1) DoD Components

    (3) DoD Components shall transmit a copy of each complaint filed 
with them to the ASD(MRA&L), or designee, within 10 calendar days after 
its receipt.
    (4) If the information in a complaint is incomplete, the DoD 
Component shall request the complainant to provide the additional 
information required. If the DoD Component does not receive this 
requested information within 30 calendar days of the date of the 
request, the case may be closed and the complainant so notified in 
writing.
    (5) If a complaint concerning a program or activity is filed with a 
DoD Component that does not have jurisdiction over it, the DoD Component 
shall refer the complaint to the ASD(MRA&L), or designee, and advise the 
complainant in writing of such referral. The ASD(MRA&L), or designee, 
then shall refer the complaint to the appropriate DoD Component and so 
notify the complainant in writing.
    (j) Investigation by DoD components. (1) DoD Components shall 
investigate complaints that involve recipients and that meet the 
standards described in paragraph (i) of this section, unless good cause 
for not investigating is stated in a written notification of the 
disposition of the complaint provided to the complainant.
    (2) If an investigation of a complaint is conducted, the DoD

against it, as described in Sec. 56.6(a)(1).
    (2) DoD Components that require or permit complaint investigations 
to be conducted by recipients shall review recipient complaint 
investigations pursuant to paragraphs (k) and (l) of this section.
    (l) Results of investigations. (1) Within 180 days of the receipt of 
a complaint, the DoD Component, recipient, or the ASD(MRA&L), or 
designee, shall give written notification:
    (i) Of the disposition of the complaint to the complainant and, as 
the case may be, to the recipient or DoD Component.
    (ii) To the complainant that within 30 calendar days of receipt of 
the written notification, the complainant may request that the 
ASD(MRA&L), or designee, review the findings in the notification 
pursuant to paragraph (m) of this section.
    (2) If the complaint investigation results in a determination by the 
DoD Component that a recipient is not complying with this part the DoD 
Component shall proceed as prescribed in paragraph (n) through (v) of 
this section. If the DoD Component determines that the recipient is in 
compliance, the

[[Page 339]]

pursuant to paragraph (l)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (3) After reviewing the results of an investigation, the ASD(MRA&L), 
or designee, may:
    (i) Find that no further investigation is necessary and approve the 
results of the investigation;
    (ii) Request further investigation by the DoD Component; or
    (iii) Require the DoD Component to take appropriate corrective 
action.
    (n) Effecting compliance. (1) When a compliance review or complaint 
investigation indicates that a recipient has violated this part, the 
applicable DoD Component's supplementary guidelines, or the assurances 
executed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the responsible DoD 
Component or the ASD(MRA&L), or designee, shall attempt to effect 
compliance in accordance with paragraphs (o) and (p) of this section. 
The inability of a DoD Component to comply with any time frame 
prescribed by this part does not relieve a recipient of the 
responsibility for compliance with this part.
    (2) The DoD Component may require, when necessary to overcome the 
effects of discrimination in violation of this part, a recipient to take 
remedial action:
    (i) With respect to handicapped persons who are no longer 
participants in the recipient's program or activity but who were

toddler, or child of the same chronological age in any of the following 
areas: physical, cognitive, communication, social or emotional, and 
adaptive development as measured using standardized evaluation 
instruments and confirmed by clinical observation and judgment. A child 
classified with a developmental delay before the age of 5 may maintain 
that eligibility classification through the age 8.
    (1) A Significant Discrepancy. The child is experiencing a 
developmental delay as measured by diagnostic instruments and procedures 
of 2 standard deviations below the mean in at least one area, or by a 25 
percent delay in at least one area on assessment instruments that yield 
scores in months, or a developmental delay of 1.5 standard deviations 
below the mean in two or more areas, or by a 20 percent delay on

elements, including the CSC and related services providers, shall ensure 
that assessment materials and evaluation procedures are in compliance 
with the following criteria:
    (i) Selected and administered so as not to be racially or culturally 
discriminatory.
    (ii) Administered in the native language or mode of communication of 
the child, unless it clearly is not possible to do so.
    (iii) Materials and procedures used to assess a child with limited 
English proficiency are selected and administered to ensure that they 
measure the extent to which the child has a disability and needs special 
education, rather than measuring the child's English language skills.
    (iv) Validated for the specific purpose for which they are used or 
intended to be used.
    (v) Administered by trained personnel in compliance with the 
instructions of the testing instrument.
    (vi) Administered such that no single procedure is the sole 
criterion for determining eligibility or an appropriate educational 
program for a child with a disability.
    (vii) Selected to assess specific areas of educational needs and 
strengths and not merely to provide a single general intelligence 
quotient.
    (viii) Administered to a child with impaired sensory, motor, or 
communication skills so that the results reflect accurately a child's 
aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factors the test 
purports to measure, rather than reflecting the child's impaired 
sensory, manual, or speaking skills (unless those skills are the factors 
that the test purports to measure).
    (6) Review of Existing Evaluation Data. As part of an initial 
evaluation (if appropriate) and as part of any reevaluation, the CSC 
shall review existing evaluation data on the child, including:

    (iv) On the basis of that review, and input from the child's 
parents, identify what additional data, if any, are needed to determine:
    (A) Whether the child has a particular category of disability, or in 
the case of a reevaluation of a child, whether the child continues to 
have such a disability.
    (B) The present levels of performance and educational needs of the 
child.
    (C) Whether the child needs special education and related services, 
or in the case of a reevaluation of a child, whether the child continues 
to need special education and related services; and
    (D) Whether any additions or modifications to the special education 
and related services are needed to enable the child to meet the 
measurable annual goals set out in the IEP of the child and to 
participate, as appropriate, in the general curriculum.
    (v) The CSC may conduct its review without a meeting.
    (vi) The CSC shall administer tests and other evaluation materials 
as may be needed to produce the data identified under paragraph B.(2) of

statement of the child's present level of performance.
    (2) Reevaluation for Eligibility. School officials shall reevaluate 
the eligibility of a child with a disability every 3 years, or more 
frequently, if conditions warrant.
    (i) The scope and type of the reevaluation shall be determined 
individually based on a child's performance, behavior, and needs during 
the reevaluation and the review of existing data in accordance with 
paragraph B.(6) of this appendix.
    (ii) The CSC is not required to conduct assessments unless requested 
to do so by the child's parents.
    (iii) If the CSC determines that no additional data are needed to 
determine whether the child continues to be a child with a disability, 
the CSC shall notify the parents of:
    (A) The determination that no additional assessment data are needed 
and the reasons for their determination; and
    (B) The right of the parents to request an assessment to determine 
whether the child continues to be a child with a disability.

    (5) The CSC shall ensure that at least one parent understands the 
special education procedures including the due process procedures 
described in appendix G of this part and the importance of the parent's 
participation in those processes. School officials shall use devices or 
hire interpreters or other intermediaries who might be necessary to 
foster effective communications between the school and the parent about 
the child.
    (6) The CSC shall ensure that all provisions developed for any child 
entitled to an education by the DoD school system are fully implemented 
in DoD schools or in non-DoD schools or facilities including those

continuing eligibility for special education and related services, or to 
prepare or change the child's IEP or to determine or change the child's 
placement.
    (8) In developing each child's IEP, the CSC shall consider the 
strengths of the child and the concerns of the parents for enhancing the 
education of their child.

                      E. Implementation of the IEP

    The CSC shall:
    (1) Obtain parental agreement and signature before implementation of 
the IEP.

[[Page 365]]

    (2) Provide a copy of the child's IEP to the parents.
    (3) Ensure that the IEP is in effect before a child receives special 
education and related services.
    (4) Ensure that the IEP is implemented as soon as possible following 
the meetings described under paragraph D.(2) of this appendix.
    (5) Provide special education and related services, in accordance 
with the IEP. The Department of Defense, the DoD school systems, and DoD 
personnel are not accountable if a child does not achieve the growth 
projected in the annual goals of the IEP, as long as services have been 
provided in accordance with the IEP.
    (6) Ensure that the child's IEP is accessible to each regular 
education teacher, special education teacher, related service provider,

must be provided for the child in accordance with the IEP.
    (7) Review the IEP for each child at least annually in a CSC meeting 
to determine whether the annual goals for the child are being achieved.
    (8) Revise the IEP, as appropriate, to address:
    (i) Any lack of progress toward the annual goals and in the general 
curriculum, where appropriate.
    (ii) The results of any reevaluation.
    (iii) Information about the child provided by the parents.
    (iv) The child's anticipated needs.

                        F. Transferring Students

    (1) When a student transfers to a DoD school with a current IEP from 
a non-DoD school, the CSC shall convene promptly an IEP meeting to 
address eligibility and special education services as described in 
sections C and D of this appendix. The CSC may:
    (i) Accept the child's current IEP by notifying and obtaining 
consent of the parents to use the current IEP and all elements contained 
in it.
    (ii) Initiate a CSC meeting to revise the current IEP, if necessary.
    (iii) Initiate an evaluation of the child, if necessary.
    (2) When a student with a current IEP transfers from one DoD school 
to another, the CSC shall accept the child's eligibility and current IEP 
by notifying and obtaining consent of the parents to use the current IEP 
and all elements contained in it.

                    G. Least Restrictive Environment

    (1) To the maximum extent, a child with a disability should be 
placed with children who are not disabled. Special classes, separate 
schooling, or other removal of a child with a disability from the 
regular education environment shall occur only when the type or severity 
of the disability is such that education in regular classes with the use 
of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.
    (2) A child shall not be placed by the DoD school system in any 
special education program unless the CSC has developed an IEP. If a 
child with a disability is applying for initial admission to a school, 
the child shall enter on the same basis as a child without a disability. 
A child with an IEP, and with the consent of a parent and school 
officials, may receive an initial placement in a special education 
program under procedures listed in section F of this appendix.
    (3) A placement decision requires the following:
    (i) Parent participation in the decision and parent consent to the 
placement before actual placement of the child, except as otherwise 
provided in paragraph H.(2) of this appendix.
    (ii) Delivery of educational instruction and related services in the 
least restrictive environment.
    (iii) The CSC to base placements on the IEP and to review the IEP at 
least annually.
    (iv) The child to participate, to the maximum extent appropriate to 
the needs and abilities of the child, in school activities including 
meals, assemblies, recess periods, and field trips with children who are 
not disabled.
    (v) Consideration of factors affecting the child's well-being, 
including the effects of separation from parents.
    (vi) A child to attend a DoD school that is located as close as 
possible to the residence of the parent who is sponsoring the child's 
attendance. Unless otherwise required by the IEP, the school should be 
the same school that the child would have attended had he or she not 
been disabled.

                              H. Discipline

    (1) All regular disciplinary rules and procedures applicable to 
children attending a DoD school shall apply to children with 
disabilities who violate school rules and regulations or disrupt regular 
classroom activities, subject to the following provisions. School 
personnel may remove a child with a disability from the child's current 
placement (to the extent removal would be applied to children who are 
not disabled):
    (i) On an emergency basis for the duration of the emergency when it 
reasonably appears that the child's behavior may endanger the

[[Page 366]]

health, welfare, or safety of self or any other child, teacher, or 
school personnel.
    (ii) For not more than 10-cumulative school days in a school year 
for any violation of school rules.
    (2) Change of Placement. If a child is removed from his or her 
current placement for more than 10-cumulative school days in a school 
year, it is considered a change of placement.
    (i) Not later than the date on which the decision to make a change 
in placement is made, the school must notify parents of the decision and 
of all procedural safeguards, as described in section B of appendix F of 
this part.
    (ii) Not later than 10 days following the change of placement, the 
CSC must:
    (A) Convene a meeting of the IEP team and other qualified personnel 
to conduct a manifestation determination as described in paragraph H.(5) 
of this appendix and
    (B) Convene an IEP meeting to review the IEP to develop appropriate 
behavioral interventions to address the child's behavior and implement 
those interventions. This review may be conducted at the same meeting 
that is convened under paragraph H.(2)(ii)(A) of this appendix.
    (i) If the child has a behavioral intervention plan, the CSC must 
review the plan and its implementation, and modify the plan and its 
implementation as necessary, to address the behavior.
    (ii) If the child does not have a behavioral intervention plan, the 
CSC must develop an assessment plan to include a functional behavioral 
assessment.
    (iii) As soon as practicable after developing the assessment plan 
and completing the assessments required by the plan, the CSC must 
convene an IEP meeting to develop a behavioral intervention plan to 
address that behavior, and shall implement the plan.
    (3) After a child with a disability has been removed from his or her 
current placement for more than 10-cumulative school days in a school 
year, during any subsequent days of removal the DoD school system must 
provide services to the extent necessary to enable the child to 
appropriately progress in the general curriculum and appropriately 
advance toward achieving the goals set out in the child's IEP.
    (4) Alternative Education Setting (AES). School personnel may order 
a change in placement of a child with a disability in accordance with 
the requirements of paragraph H.(2) of this appendix to an appropriate 
interim AES for the same amount of time that a non-disabled child would 
be subject to discipline, but for not more than 45 days, if:
    (i) The child carries a weapon to school or to a school function 
under the jurisdiction of the DoD school system; or
    (ii) The child knowingly possesses or uses illegal drugs or sells or 
solicits the sale of a controlled substance while at school or at a 
school function under the jurisdiction of a DoD school system.
    (5) Manifestation Determination. The CSC shall determine whether the 
child's behavior is the result of the child's disability by considering 
all relevant information including evaluation results, observation of 
the child, information provided by the parents of the child, and the 
child's IEP and placement.
    (i) Unless all of the following are evident, the CSC must consider 
the child's behavior to be a manifestation of the disability:
    (A) IEP and placement were appropriate and the special education 
services, supplementary aides and services, and behavior intervention 
strategies were provided consistent with the child's IEP and placement;
    (B) The child's disability did not impair his or her ability to 
understand the impact and consequences of the behavior subject to the 
disciplinary action; and
    (C) The child's disability did not impair his or her ability to 
control the behavior subject to disciplinary action.
    (ii) If the CSC determines that the child's behavior was a 
manifestation of the disability, the child is not subject to removal 
from current educational placement as a disciplinary action, except as 
provided for in paragraph H.(1)(i) of this appendix.
    (A) The child's parents shall be notified of the right to have an 
IEP meeting before any changes in the child's placement.
    (B) The CSC shall address the behavior that was the subject of the 
disciplinary action, by:
    (i) Reviewing the child's educational placement to ensure that it is 
appropriate in consideration of the child's behavior.
    (ii) Revising the IEP to include goals, services, and modifications 
that address the behavior subject to disciplinary action, as necessary.
    (iii) If the CSC determines that the child's behavior was not the 
result in whole or part of the disability, relevant disciplinary 
procedures may be applied to the child in the same manner in which it 
would be applied to a child without a disability, except as provided in 
FAPE.

                            I. Parent Appeal

    (1) If the parent disagrees with the manifestation determination or 
with any decision regarding placement, the parent may request a hearing.
    (2) The school system shall arrange for an expedited hearing in 
accordance with appendix G of this part.
    (3) Placement During Appeal. When a parent requests a hearing 
challenging placement in an interim AES, the child shall remain in the 
interim AES pending the decision of the hearing officer or until the 
expiration of the time period provided for in paragraph H.(3) of this 
appendix whichever comes first, unless

[[Page 367]]

the parent and the school system agree otherwise.
    (i) After expiration of the interim AES, during the pendency of any 
proceedings to challenge the proposed change in placement, the child 
shall return and remain in the child's placement prior to the interim 
AES.
    (ii) If the school personnel maintain that it is dangerous for the 
child to return to his or her placement prior to the interim AES, the 
DoD school system may request an expedited hearing.

                      J. Order by a Hearing Officer

    A hearing officer may order a change in the placement of a child 
with a disability to an interim AES for not more than 45 days, if the 
hearing officer:
    (1) Determines that the DoD school system has demonstrated by 
substantial evidence that maintaining the current placement of such 
child is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or to 
others.
    (2) Considers the appropriateness of the child's current placement.
    (3) Considers whether the school system has made reasonable efforts 
to minimize the risk of harm in the child's current placement, including 
the use of supplementary aids and services; and
    (4) Determines that the interim AES meets the requirements of 
section A of this appendix.

      K. Children Not Yet Determined Eligible for Special Education

    Children who have not yet been determined eligible for special 
education and who have violated the disciplinary rules and procedures 
may assert the protections of the IDEA if the DoD school system had 
knowledge that the child had a disability before the behavior occurred.
    (1) The DoD school system is considered to have had knowledge if:
    (i) The parents expressed concern in writing to the school system 
personnel that the child needed special education or related services.
    (ii) The child's behavior or performance indicated a need for 
services.
    (iii) The child's parents requested an evaluation; or
    (iv) The child's teacher or other DoD school system personnel 
expressed concern about the behavior or performance to the CSC, the 
school principal, assistant principal, or district special education 
coordinator.
    (2) If the DoD school system does not have knowledge of a disability 
prior to disciplinary action, the child shall be subject to the regular 
disciplinary rules and procedures.
    (3) If an evaluation were requested during the time the child is 
subjected to disciplinary action, the evaluation shall be expedited. The 
child shall remain in his or her current placement until determined 
eligible for special education or related services.
    (4) The DoD school system is not constrained from reporting crime to 
the appropriate law enforcement authorities and shall ensure that 
special education and disciplinary records are transmitted to the 
appropriate law enforcement and judicial authorities.

  L. Children With Disabilities Who Are Placed in a NON-DoD School or 
                                Facility

    (1) Children with disabilities who are eligible to receive a DoD 
school system education, but are placed in a non-DoD school or facility 
by a DoD school system, shall have all the rights of children with 
disabilities who are enrolled in a DoD school.
    (2) A child with a disability may be placed in a non-DoD school or 
facility only if required by the IEP.
    (3) Placement by DoDDS in a host-nation non-DoD school or facility 
shall be made under the host-nation requirements.
    (4) Placement by DoDDS in a host-nation non-DoD school or facility 
is subject to all treaties, executive agreements, and status of forces 
agreements between the United States and the host nations, and all DoD 
and DoD school system regulations.
    (5) If a DoD school system places a child with a disability in a 
non-DoD school or facility as a means of providing special education and 
related services, the program of that institution, including non-medical 
care and room and board, as prescribed in the child's IEP, must be 
provided at no cost to the child or the child's parents. The DoD school 
system or the responsible DoD Component shall pay the costs in 
accordance with this part.
    (6) DoD school officials shall initiate and conduct a meeting to 
develop an IEP for the child before placement. A representative of the 
non-DoD school or facility should attend the meeting. If the 
representative cannot attend, the DoD school system officials shall 
communicate in other ways to ensure participation including individual 
or conference telephone calls. The IEP must meet the following 
standards:
    (i) Be signed by an authorized DoD school system official before it 
becomes valid.
    (ii) Include a determination that the DoD school system does not 
currently have or cannot reasonably create an educational program 
appropriate to meet the needs of the child with a disability.
    (iii) Include a determination that the non-DoD school or facility 
and its educational program and related services conform to the 
requirements of this part.
    (7) Cost of Tuition for Non-DoD School or Facility. The Department 
of Defense is not authorized to reimburse the costs of special education 
if a parent unilaterally places the

[[Page 368]]

student in a non-DoD school without approval of the cognizant CSC and 
the Superintendent, in coordination with the Director of the DoD school 
system. A valid IEP must document the necessity of the placement in a 
non-DoD school or facility.
    (i) Reimbursement may be required if a hearing officer determines 
that the DoD school system had not made FAPE available in a timely 
manner prior to enrollment in the non-DoD school and that the private 
placement is appropriate.
    (ii) Reimbursement may be reduced or denied if the parents did not 
inform the CSC that the placement determined by the CSC was rejected, 
including a statement of their concerns, and that they intended to place 
a child in a non-DoD school; or if 10 business days (Monday through 
Friday, except for Federal holidays) prior to the parents' removal of 
the child from the school, the parents failed to provide written notice 
to the DoD school system of their rejection of the placement decision 
concerning the child, the reasons for their rejection, and their intent 
to remove the child; or if the CSC informed parents of its intent to 
evaluate the child, but parents did not make the child available.
    (iii) Reimbursement may not be reduced or denied for failure to 
provide the required notice if the parents cannot read and write in 
English; compliance would result in physical or emotional harm to the 
child; the DoD school prevented the parent from providing notice; or the 
parents had not received notice of a requirement to provide required 
notice.

                    M. Confidentiality of the Records

    The DoD school system and EDIS officials shall maintain all student 
records in accordance with DoD Directive 5400.11.

                          N. Dispute Resolution

    A parent, teacher, or other person covered by this part may file a 
written complaint about any aspect of this part that is not a proper 
subject for adjudication by a due process hearing officer, in accordance 
with DSR 2500.11.

      by the Military Medical Departments to DoDDS Students on IEPs

                        A. Evaluation Procedures

    (1) Upon request by a DoDDS CSC, the responsible EDIS shall ensure 
that a qualified medical authority conducts or verifies a medical 
evaluation for use by the CSC in determining the medically related 
disability that results in a child's need for special education and 
related services, and oversees an EDIS evaluation used in determining a 
child's need for related services.
    (i) This medical or related services evaluation, including necessary 
consultation with other medical personnel, shall be supervised by a 
physician or other qualified healthcare provider.
    (ii) This medical evaluation shall include a review of general 
health history, current health assessment, systems evaluation to include 
growth and developmental assessment, and, if pertinent, detailed 
evaluation of gross motor and fine motor adaptive skills, psychological 
status, and visual and audiological capabilities, including details of 
present level of performance in each of these areas affecting the 
student's performance in school.
    (iii) The EDIS-related services evaluation shall be specific to the 
areas addressed in the referral by the CSC.
    (2) EDIS shall provide a summary evaluation report to the CSC that

    (iii) Instruments and techniques used.
    (iv) Evaluation results.
    (v) Descriptions of the child's strengths and limitations.
    (vi) Instructional implications of the findings; and
    (vii) The impact of the child's medical condition(s), if applicable, 
on his or her educational performance.
    (3) If EDIS determines that in order to respond to the CSC referral 
the scope of its assessment and evaluation must be expanded beyond the 
areas specified in the initial parental permission, EDIS must:
    (i) Obtain parental permission for the additional activities.
    (ii) Complete their initial evaluation by the original due date; and
    (iii) Notify the CSC of the additional evaluation activities.
    (4) When additional evaluation information is submitted by EDIS, the 
CSC shall review all data and determine the need for program changes 
and/or the reconsideration of eligibility.
    (5) An EDIS provider shall serve on the CSC when eligibility, 
placement, or requirements for related services that EDIS provides are 
to be determined.
    (6) Related services provided by EDIS, pursuant to an IEP, are

         Appendix G to Part 57--Mediation and Hearing Procedures

                               A. Purpose

    This appendix establishes requirements for the resolution of 
conflicts through mediation and impartial due process hearings. Parents 
of infants, toddlers, and children who are covered by this Part and, as 
the case may be, the cognizant Military Medical Department or the DoD 
school system are afforded impartial mediation and/or impartial due 
process hearings and administrative appeals about the provision of EIS, 
or the identification, evaluation, educational placement of, and the 
FAPE provided to, such children by the Department of Defense, in 
accordance with sections 927 and 1400 of 20 U.S.C. and section 2164 of 
10 U.S.C.

                              B. Mediation

    (1) Mediation may be initiated by either a parent or the Military 
Medical Department concerned or the DoD school system to resolve 
informally a disagreement on any matter relating to the identification, 
evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of a 
FAPE to such child.
    (i) The DoD school system shall participate in mediation involving 
special education and related services.
    (ii) The cognizant Military Medical Department shall participate in 
mediation involving EIS.
    (2) The party initiating mediation must notify the other party to 
the mediation of its request to mediate. The initiating party's request 
must be written, include a written description of the dispute and bear 
the signature of the requesting party. Formal acknowledgement of the 
request for mediation shall occur in a timely manner. The parties may 
jointly request mediation.
    (3) Upon agreement of the parties to mediate a dispute, the Military 
Medical Department or DoD school shall forward a request for a mediator 
to higher headquarters, or request a mediator through the Director, 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA).
    (i) The cognizant DoDDS Area Special Education Coordinator or the 
DDESS District Superintendent shall promptly appoint a mediator. The 
Director, DOHA, through the DoHA Office of Alternate Dispute Resolution 
(ADR), shall maintain a roster of mediators trained in ADR methods, 
knowledgeable in laws and regulations related to special education, and 
available to mediate disputes upon request. When requested, the 
Director, DOHA, through the Office of ADR, shall appoint a mediator 
within 15 business days of receiving the request for a due process 
hearing, unless a party provides written notice to the Director, DOHA 
that the party refuses to participate in mediation.
    (ii) The mediator assigned to a dispute shall not be employed by the 
Military Medical Department or the DoD school system involved, unless 
the parties agree otherwise.
    (4) Unless both parties agree otherwise, mediation shall commence in 
a timely manner after both parties agree to mediation.
    (5) The parents of the infant, toddler or child and 2 
representatives of the EDIS or DoD school may participate in mediation. 
With the consent of both parties, other persons may participate in 
mediation. Either party may recess a mediation session to consult 
advisors, whether or not present, or to consult privately with the 
mediator.
    (6) If the parties resolve the dispute or a portion of the dispute, 
or agree to use another procedure to resolve the dispute, the mediator 
shall ensure that the resolution or agreement is reduced to writing and 
that it is signed and dated by the parties and that a copy is given to 
each party. The resolution or agreement is legally binding upon the 
parties.

[[Page 373]]

    (7) Discussions that occur during the mediation process shall be 
confidential and may not be used as evidence in any subsequent due 
process hearing or civil proceeding. Unless the parties and the mediator 
agree, no person may record a mediation session, nor should any written 
notes be taken from the room by either party. The mediator may require 
the parties to sign a confidentiality pledge before the commencement of 
mediation.
    (8) Parents must be provided an opportunity to meet with appropriate 
EDIS or DoD school system staff in at least one mediation session, if 
they request a due process hearing in accordance with sections A through 
H of this appendix. The parents and the Military Medical Department or 
DoD school system must participate in mediation, unless a party objects 
to mediation.
    (9) Mediation shall not delay hearings or appeals related to the 
dispute. All mediation sessions shall be held in a location that is 
convenient to the parties. The Military Medical Department in mediations 
concerning EIS or the DoD school system in mediations concerning special 
education and related services shall bear the cost of the mediation 
process.
    (10) Any hearing officer or adjudicative body may draw no negative 
inference from the fact that a mediator or a party withdrew from 
mediation or that mediation did not result in settlement of a dispute.

in good standing of the bar of any State, the District of Columbia, or a 
commonwealth, territory or possession of the United States, who are also 
independent of the DoD school system or the Military Medical Department 
concerned in proceedings conducted under this appendix. A parent shall 
have the right to be represented in such proceedings by counsel or by 
persons with special knowledge or training with respect to the 
challenges of individuals with disabilities. The DOHA Department Counsel 
normally shall appear and represent the DoD school system in proceedings 
conducted under this appendix, when such proceedings involve a child age 
3 to 21, inclusive. When an infant or toddler is involved, the Military 
Medical Department responsible under this part for delivering EIS shall

the matter. The parents of an infant or toddler and the Military Medical 
Department concerned shall be the only parties to a hearing conducted 
under this appendix.
    (ii) Should mediation be refused or otherwise fail to resolve the 
issues on the provision of a FAPE to a child with a disability, age 3 to

problem, and a proposed resolution of the problem to the extent known 
and available to the parents at the time.
    (4) The DoD school system may file a written petition for a hearing 
to override a parent's refusal to grant consent for an initial 
evaluation, a reevaluation or an initial educational placement of the 
child. The DoD school system may also file a written petition for a 
hearing to override a parent's refusal to accept an IEP.
    (5) The party seeking the hearing shall submit the petition to the 
Director, DOHA, at P.O. Box 3656, Arlington, Virginia 22203.

[[Page 374]]

The petitioner shall deliver a copy of the petition to the opposing

system, or the military MTF commander, for the Military Medical 
Department), either in person or by first-class mail, postage prepaid. 
Delivery is complete on mailing. When the DoD school system or the 
Military Medical Department petitions for a hearing, it shall inform the 
other parties of the deadline for filing an answer under paragraph D.(6) 
of this appendix and shall provide the other parties with a copy of this 
part.
    (6) An opposing party shall submit an answer to the petition to the

    (10) The purpose of a hearing is to establish the relevant facts 
necessary for the hearing officer to reach a fair and impartial 
determination of the case. Oral and documentary evidence that is 
relevant and material may be received. The technical rules of evidence 
shall be relaxed to permit the development of a full evidentiary record 
with the Federal Rules of Evidence, title 28, United States Code serving

    (11) The hearing officer shall be the presiding officer, with 
judicial powers to manage the proceeding and conduct the hearing. Those 
powers shall include the authority to order an independent evaluation of 
the child at the expense of the DoD school system or the Military 
Medical Department concerned and to call and question witnesses.
    (12) Those normally authorized to attend a hearing shall be the 
parents of the individual with disabilities, the counsel or personal

waiving in writing their privacy rights and those of the individual with 
disabilities who is the subject of the hearing.
    (13) A verbatim transcription of the hearing shall be made in 
written or electronic form and shall become a permanent part of the

party, as provided for in paragraph D.(5) of this appendix in which case 
the time required for such discovery does not count toward the 50 
business days. The hearing officer may grant a specific extension of 
time for good cause either on his or her own motion or at the request of 
either party. Good cause includes the time required for mediation under 
section B of this appendix. If the hearing officer grants an extension 
of time, he or she shall identify the length of the extension and the 
reason for the extension in the record of the proceeding.

                              E. Discovery

    (4) When the hearing officer determines that a person has failed to 
obey an order to testify or to produce evidence, and such failure is in 
knowing and willful disregard of the order, the hearing officer shall so 
certify.
    (5) The party or the hearing officer seeking to compel testimony or 
the production of evidence may, based on the certification provided for 
in paragraph F.(4) of this appendix file an appropriate action in a 
court of competent jurisdiction to compel compliance with the hearing 
officer's order.
    (6) At least 5 business days prior to a hearing, the parties shall 
exchange lists of all documents and materials that each party intends to 
use at the hearing, including all evaluations and reports. Each party

Appeal Board. It shall determine the matter, including the making of 
interlocutory rulings, within 45 business days of receiving timely 
submitted replies under paragraph I.(2) of this appendix.
    (4) The determination of the DOHA Appeal Board shall be a final 
administrative decision and shall be in written form. It shall address 
the issues presented and set forth a rationale for the decision reached. 
A determination denying the appeal of a parent in whole or in part shall 
state that the parent has the right under sections 921-932 and chapter 
33 of title 20, United States Code to bring a civil action on the 
matters in dispute in a district court of the United States of competent 
jurisdiction without regard to the amount in controversy.
    (5) No provision of this part or other DoD guidance may be construed 
as conferring a further right of administrative review. A party must 
exhaust all administrative remedies afforded by this appendix before 
seeking judicial review of a determination made under this appendix.

programs leading to appointment in a professional military specialty 
(including, but not limited to, medical, dental, chaplain, and legal 
and/or judge advocate) shall be disenrolled from the program at the end 
of the academic term in which serologic evidence of HIV-1 infection is 
confirmed. Disenrolled officers shall be administered in accordance with 
Service regulations. Except as specifically prohibited by statute, any 
additional Service obligation incurred by participation in such programs 
shall be waived, and financial assistance received in these programs 
shall not be subject to recoupment. Periods spent by such officers in 
these programs shall be applied fully toward satisfaction of any 
preexisting Service obligation.

all of the Heads of the DoD Components that may have activities located 
in the host nation.
    B. Specific HIV-1 screening requirements may apply to DoD civilian 
employees currently assigned to positions in the host nation, and to 
prospective employees. When applied to prospective employees, HIV-1 
screening shall be considered as a requirement imposed by another nation 
that must be met before the final decision to select the individual for 
a position or before approving temporary duty or detail to the host 
nation. The Secretary of Defense has made no official commitment, for 
positions located in

[[Page 382]]

host nations with HIV-1 screening requirements, to those individuals who 
refuse to cooperate with the screening requirement or to those who 
cooperate and are diagnosed as HIV-1 seropositive.
    C. DoD civilian employees who refuse to cooperate with the screening 
requirement shall be treated, as follows:
    1. Those who volunteered for the assignment, whether permanent or 
temporary, shall be retained in their official position without further 
action and without prejudice to employee benefits, career progression 
opportunities, or other personnel actions to which those employees are 
entitled under applicable law or regulation.
    2. Those who are obligated to accept asssignment to the host nation 
under the terms of an employment agreement, regularly scheduled tour of 
duty, or similar and/or prior obligation may be subjected to an 
appropriate adverse personnel action under the specific terms of the 
employment agreement or other authorities that may apply.
    3. Host-nation screening requirements, which apply to DoD civilian 
employees currently located in that county, also must be observed. 
Appropriate personnel actions may be taken, without prejudice to 
employee rights and privileges, to comply with the requirements.
    D. Individuals who are not employed in the host nation, who accept 
the screening, and who are evaluated as HIV-1 seropositive shall be 
denied the assignment on the basis that evidence of seronegativity is 
required by the host nation. If denied the assignment, such DoD 
employees shall be retained in their current positions without 
prejudice. Appropriate personnel actions may be taken, without prejudice 
to employee rights and privileges, on DoD civilian employees currently 
located in the host nation. In all cases, employees shall be given 
proper counseling and shall retain all the rights and benefits to which 
they are entitled, including accommodations for the handicapped as in 
the ASD(FM&P) Memorandum \1\ ``Information and Guidance on Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)'' January 22, 1988 and FPM Bulletin, 792-42 
\2\ and for employees in the United States (29 U.S.C. 794). Non-DoD 
employees should be referred to appropriate support service 
organizations.

    \1\ See footnote 2 to Sec. 58.4(c).
    \2\ See footnote 2 to Sec. 58.4(c).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    E. Some host nations may not bar entry to HIV-1-seropositive DoD 
civilian employees, but may require reporting of such individuals to 
host-nation authorities. In such cases, DoD civilian employees who are 
evaluated as HIV-1 seropositive shall be informed of the reporting 
requirements. They shall be counseled and given the option of declining 
the assignment and retaining their official positions without prejudice 
or notification to the host nation. If assignment is accepted, the 
requesting authority shall release the HIV-1 seropositive result, as 
required. Employees currently located in the host nation may also 
decline to have seropositive results released. In such cases, they may 
request and shall be granted early return at Government expense or other 
appropriate personnel action without prejudice to employee rights and 
privileges.
    F. A positive confirmatory test by WB must be accomplished on an 
individual if the screening test (ELISA) is positive. A civilian 
employee may not be identified as HIV-1 antibody positive, unless the 
confirmatory test (WB) is positive. The clinical standards in this 
Directive shall be observed during initial and confirmatory testing.
    G. Procedures shall be established by the Heads of the DoD 
Components to protect the confidentiality of test results for all 
individuals, consistent with the ASD(FM&P) Memorandum and DoD Directive 
5400.11.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 58.4(c).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    H. Tests shall be provided by the Heads of the DoD Components at no 
cost to the DoD civilian employees, including applicants.
    I. DoD civilian employees infected with HIV-1 shall be counseled 
appropriately.

   Appendix C to Part 58--Personnel Notification and Epidemiological 
                              Investigation

                        A. Personnel Notification

    1. On notification by a medical health authority of an individual 
with serologic or other laboratory or clinical evidence of HIV-1 
infection, the cognizant military health authority shall undertake 
preventive medicine intervention, including counseling of the individual 
and others at risk of infection, such as his or her sexual contacts (who 
are military healthcare beneficiaries), on transmission of the virus. 
The cognizant military health authority shall coordinate with the Heads 
of the military and civilian blood bank organizations and preventive 
medicine authorities to trace back possible exposure through blood 
transfusion or donation of infected blood (ASD(HA)) Memorandum and refer 
appropriate case-contact information to the appropriate military or 
civilian health authority.
    2. All individuals with serologic evidence of HIV-1 infection who 
are military healthcare beneficiaries shall be counseled by a physician 
or a designated healthcare provider on the significance of a positive 
antibody test. They shall be advised as to the mode of transmission of 
that virus, the

[[Page 383]]

appropriate precautions and personal hygiene measures required to 
minimize transmission through sexual activities and/or intimate contact 
with blood or blood products, and of the need to advise any past sexual 
partners of their infection. Women shall be advised of the risk of 
perinatal transmission during past, current, and future pregnancies. The 
infected individuals shall be informed that they are ineligible to 
donate blood and shall be placed on a permanent donor deferral list.
    3. Service members identified to be at risk shall be counseled and 
tested for serologic evidence of HIV-1 infection. Other DoD 
beneficiaries, such as retirees and family members, identified to be at 
risk shall be informed of their risk and offered serologic testing, 
clinical evaluation, and counseling. The names of individuals identified 
to be at risk who are not eligible for military healthcare shall be 
provided to civilian health authorities in the local area where the 
index case is identified, unless prohibited by the appropriate State or 
host-nation civilian health authority. Such notification shall comply 
with the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a). Anonymity of the HIV-1 index case 
shall be maintained, unless reporting is required by civil authorities.
    4. Blood donors who demonstrate repeatedly reactive ELISA tests for 
HIV-1, but for whom WB or other confirmatory test is negative or 
indeterminate, and who cannot be reentered into the blood donor pool 
shall be appropriately counseled.

                    B. Epidemiological Investigation

    1. Epidemiological investigation shall attempt to determine 
potential contacts of patients who have serologic or other laboratory or 
clinical evidence of HIV-1 infection. The patient shall be informed of 
the importance of case-contact notification to interrupt disease 
transmission and shall be informed that contacts shall be advised or 
their potential exposure to HIV-1. Individuals at risk of infection 
include sexual contacts (male and female); children born to infected 
mothers; recipients of blood, blood products, organs, tissues, or sperm; 
and users of contaminated intravenous drug paraphernalia. Those 
individuals determined to be at risk who are identified and who are 
eligible for healthcare in the military medical system shall be 
notified. Additionally, the Secretaries of the Military Departments 
shall provide for the notification, either through local public health 
authorities or by DoD healthcare professionals, of the spouses of 
Reserve component members found to be HIV-1-infected. Such notifications 
shall comply with the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a). The Secretaries of 
the Military Departments shall designate all spouses (regardless of the 
Service affiliation of the HIV-1-infected Reservist) who are notified 
under this provision to receive serologic testing and counseling on a 
voluntary basis from MTFs under the Secretaries' of the Military 
Departments jurisdiction.
    2. Communicable disease reporting procedures of civil authorities 
shall be followed to the extent consistent with this Directive through 
liaison between the military public health authorities and the 
appropriate local, State, territorial, Federal, or host-nation health 
jurisdiction.

Sec.
59.1 Purpose.
59.2 Applicability.
59.3 Policy.
59.4 Responsibilities.

    Authority: 37 U.S.C. chapter 13.

    Source: 52 FR 34215, Sept. 10, 1987, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 59.1  Purpose.

    This part updates the policies that implement title 37 U.S. Code, 
chapter 13 and govern voluntary allotments of pay and allowances for 
active and retired members.


<R05>
Sec. 59.2  Applicability.

    This part applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the 
Military Departments. The term ``Military Service,'' as used herein, 
refers to the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps.


<R05>
Sec. 59.3  Policy.

    (a) General. (1) The voluntary allotment system is provided 
primarily as a means to assist military members in accommodating their 
personal and family financial responsibilities to the exigencies of 
military service. It is a convenience and privilege not to be exploited 
or abused. To avoid unjustifiable expense to the government, its use 
shall be limited to the purposes outlined in the following paragraphs.
    (2) All existing approved registered allotments of military pay and 
allowances for active duty and retired members that were authorized 
previously by this part at the time registered may be continued as 
approved allotments. However, if any such allotments are

[[Page 384]]

discontinued, they may not be reestablished except as a new allotment in 
accordance with the requirements of this part. Any change in the 
allotment that is initiated by the service member is considered a 
discontinuance, except those that are beyond the control of the service 
member.
    (3) Changes beyond the control of the service member are changes 
that are of an administrative nature dictated by events incidental to 
the purpose of the allotment. Examples of administrative changes that 
are beyond the control of the service member are: name and address 
changes by the payee or amount changes due to contractual obligation 
existing at the time the allotment was executed, such as a mortgage 
payment change because of a variable rate mortgage or changing escrow 
requirements. Although the changes given above do not constitute a 
discontinuance, such administrative changes that adjust the amount of 
the allotment shall be accepted only when communicated by the service 
member on a new allotment request. Discontinuance occurs with any 
mortgage refinancing action.
    (4) A change in allotment initiated by an organizational allottee 
may be accepted when the change is documented properly, is of an 
administrative nature, and does not increase the amount allotted.
    (b) Active Military Service. Voluntary allotments of military pay 
and allowances of service members in active military service shall be 
limited to the following:
    (1) The purchase of U.S. savings bonds.
    (2) The payment of premiums for insurance on the life of the 
allotter, including U.S. Government Life Insurance, National Service 
Life Insurance, Veterans Group Life Insurance, Navy Mutual Aid 
Insurance, Army Mutual Aid Insurance, and commercial life insurance.
    (i) Allotments for insurance on the lives of a spouse or children.
    (ii) Allotments for health, accident, or hospitalization insurance 
or other contracts that, as a secondary or incidental feature, include 
insurance on the life of the service member are not authorized.
    (iii) Requests to initiate commercial life insurance allotments 
shall be processed only after compliance with requirements of 32 CFR 
part 276.
    (3) The repayment of loans to the Navy Relief Society, Army 
Emergency Relief, Air Force Aid Society, and American Red Cross.
    (4) Allotments to a spouse, former spouses, other dependents, and 
relatives who are not designated legally as dependents. The payment of 
such an allotment to a financial institution or association shall not 
deprive a service member of the use of the allotments authorized by 
paragraph (b)(6) of this section.
    (5) The voluntary liquidation of indebtedness to the United States.
    (i) This includes indebtedness incurred by reason of defaulted notes 
insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the 
Veterans Administration (VA); payment of amounts due under the Retired 
Serviceman's Family Protection Plan, in the case of retired service 
members serving on active duty; payment of delinquent Federal income 
taxes; and other indebtedness to any department or agency of the U.S. 
Government, except to the department paying the service member.
    (ii) This includes repayment of debts owed to an organization for 
funds administered on behalf of the U.S. Government and any such debts 
assigned to a collection agency.
    (6) The payment to a financial organization for credit to an account 
of the service member. A financial organization is any bank, savings 
bank, savings and loan association or similar institution, or Federal or 
State chartered credit union. Monies thus credited to the service 
member's account may then be used for any purpose in accordance with the 
desires and direction of the service member. No more than two such 
allotments under this paragraph shall be allowed any service member at 
any one time.
    (7) Repayment of loans obtained for the purchase of a home, 
including a mobile home or house trailer used as a residence by the 
service member. This does not authorize repayment of loans for business 
purposes or for additions or improvements to homes, mobile

[[Page 385]]

homes, or house trailers. Allotments authorized herein are in addition 
to those authorized under paragraph (b)(6) of this section. Only one 
such allotment shall be allowed any service member at any one time.
    (8) Charitable contributions to the following:
    (i) A Combined Federal Campaign, in accordance with DOD Directive 
5035.1, ``Fund-Raising Within the Department of Defense,'' April 7, 
1978, and DOD Instruction 5035.5, ``DoD Combined Federal Campaign-
Overseas Areas (CFC-OA),'' August 23, 1978.
    (ii) Army Emergency Relief, Navy Relief Society, or affiliates of 
the Air Force Assistance Fund.

Veterans Education Account within the periodic and cumulative depository 
limitations specified in DOD Directive 1322.8, ``Voluntary Educational 
Programs for Military Personnel,'' July 23, 1987. Once authorized by the 
service member, the allotments must run a minimum of 12 consecutive 
months, unless the service member suspends participation or disenrolls 
from the program because of personal hardship
    (11) Payment of delinquent State or local income or employment 
taxes.

Insurance, Veterans Group Life Insurance, Navy Mutual Aid Insurance, 
Army Mutual Aid Insurance, and commercial life insurance, subject to the 
limitations prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section.
    (iii) Voluntary liquidation of indebtedness to the United States, 
subject to the limitations prescribed in paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section--
    (iv) Allotments to a spouse, former spouse, and/or children of the 
retired service member having a permanent residence other than that of 
the retired service member.
    (v) Charitable contributions to the Army Emergency Relief, Navy 
Relief Society, or affiliates of the Air Force Assistance Fund.
    (vi) The repayment of loans to the Army Emergency Relief, Navy

retired status, all allotments authorized for active duty service 
members may be continued, except those allotments in paragraph (b) 
(8)(i), (9) and (10) of this section. However, if an allotment continued 
from active duty, but not authorized by paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
is discontinued by the retiree, such an allotment may not be 
reestablished.
    (d) Exclusions and Restrictions. (1) The amount of pay and 
allowances that may be allotted shall exclude amounts required to be 
withheld for taxes, liquidations of indebtedness determined under 
applicable provisions of law to be chargeable against the service 
member's pay account, or required premiums on Servicemen's Group Life

non-Federal organizations, except that each Military Department may 
authorize issuance of forms to the Army Emergency Relief, Navy Relief 
Society, the Air Force Aid Society, and American Red Cross.

requirement for senior enlisted service members and loan repayment 
allotments payable to the Army Emergency Relief, Navy Relief Society, 
the Air Force Aid Society, and American Red Cross.
    (3) Charitable contribution allotment requests by enlisted members 
may be accepted without a witnessing official, when submitted on

    Authority: 10 U.S.C. 131.

    Source: 48 FR 41581, Sept. 16, 1983, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 62b.1  Purpose.

    This part:
    (a) Establishes DoD policy regarding drunk and drugged driving by 
DoD personnel (hereafter referred to as ``intoxicated driving'').
    (b) Assigns responsibility for and explains DoD policy and 
procedures on the establishment and operation of the DoD Intoxicated 
Driving Prevention Program, which is designed to address the problem of 
and increase the awareness and attention given to intoxicated driving by 
DoD personnel.
    (c) Establishes the DoD Intoxicated Driving Prevention Task Force 
(DIDPTF).


<R05>
Sec. 62b.2  Applicability.

    This part applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the 
Military Departments, the Organization of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the 
Unified and Specified Commands, and the Defense Agencies (hereafter 
referred to collectively as ``DoD Components''). The term ``Military 
Services,'' as used herein, refers to the Army, Navy, Air Force, and 
Marine Corps.


<R05>
Sec. 62b.3  Policy.

    (a) Intoxicated driving is incompatible with the maintenance of high 
standards of performance, military discipline, DoD personnel 
reliability, and readiness of military units and supporting activities. 
It is DoD policy to reduce significantly the incidence of intoxicated 
driving within the Department of Defense through a coordinated program 
of education, indentification, law enforcement, and treatment. 
Specifically, the goal of the DoD Intoxicated Driving Prevention Program 
is to reduce the number of fatalities and injuries suffered by DoD 
personnel and the amount of property damage that result from intoxicated 
driving. Persons who engage in intoxicated driving, regardless of the 
geographic location of the incident, have demonstrated a serious 
disregard for the safety of themselves and others. It is appropriate for 
military commanders, in the exercise of their inherent authority, to 
protect the mission of an installation and the safety of persons and 
property therein to restrict driving privileges of persons who engage in 
such actions.
    (b) The Department of Defense shall participate in the national 
effort to

[[Page 387]]

prevent intoxicated driving by maintaining appropriate relationships 
with other governmental agencies and private organizations and shall 
cooperate with responsible civil authorities consistent with statutory 
and regulatory constraints in detecting, identifying, apprehending, 
prosecuting, educating, and counseling intoxicated drivers and in 
reporting cases as required by State laws and applicable Status of 
Forces Agreements.


<R05>
Sec. 62b.4  Procedures.

    (a) Education and training. (1) The Military Services shall provide 
drug and alcohol education that focuses on intoxicated driving for each 
of the following: law enforcement, public information, emergency room, 
and safety personnel. Club managers, bartenders, and waitresses serving 
alcoholic beverages and Class VI or package sales personnel shall 
receive annual refresher training. In addition, leadership curricula at 
all levels (PCO/PXO indoctrination, training for judge advocates and 
military judges, and officer and noncommissioned officer schools) shall 
include specific information and a review of current Military Service 
policy on intoxicated driving.
    (2) Other DoD Components shall provide similar instruction in 
conjunction with the training and education requirements of part 62a of 
this title.
    (3) DoD Components shall cooperate, to the extent feasible and 
permitted by law and regulation, with community leaders and existing 
grassroots organizations that are working to combat intoxicated driving, 
in planning and implementing local education efforts.
    (b) Suspension of driving privileges. Each DoD Component of its 
supporting agency that regulates driving privileges shall establish 
procedures for mandatory suspension of driving privileges on military 
installations and in areas subject to military traffic supervision. They 
shall establish procedures for acquiring arrest reports and other 
official documentation of intoxicated driving incidents consistent with 
applicable laws and regulations. Such procedures shall be sufficiently 
flexible to meet local needs.
    (1) Military personnel and their family members, retired members of 
the Military Services, DoD civilian personnel, and others with 
installation driving privileges may have those driving privileges 
suspended, regardless of the geographic location of an intoxicated 
driving incident.
    (i) Suspension is authorized for non-DoD civilians only with respect 
to incidents occurring on the military installation or in areas subject 
to military traffic supervision.
    (ii) With respect to DoD civilian personnel covered by a negotiated 
agreement, a suspension under this paragraph may be reviewed only to the 
extent required by the negotiated agreement applicable to the affected 
employee. Such matters mandatorily are excluded from DoD Component 
administrative grievance procedures. A grievance under such a procedure 
will not delay imposition of a preliminary or 1-year suspension of 
driving privileges.
    (iii) A notice of suspension will not become effective until 24 
hours after the incident for which a suspension is imposed. However, 
this provision does not preclude appropriate action to prevent an 
intoxicated person from operating a motor vehicle, nor does it affect 
the validity of an earlier suspension imposed on the same individual.
    (iv) A hearing authorized under paragraph (b) (2), (3), or (5) of 
this section, shall be conducted by the installation commander. The 
power to conduct a hearing and make a decision may be delegated only to 
an official whose primary duties are not in the field of law 
enforcement. At a hearing under this paragraph, the individual shall 
have the right to present evidence and witnesses at his or her own 
expense. The individual may be represented by counsel at his or her own 
expense. DoD civilian personnel may have a personal representative 
present in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
    (2) Suspension based upon lawful apprehension. (i) Preliminary 
suspension of driving privileges is mandatory based upon an arrest 
report or other official documentation of the circumstances of an 
apprehension for intoxicated driving.
    (ii) The individual shall be notified in writing of the preliminary 
suspension. The notice shall include the arrest report or other 
documentation and shall

[[Page 388]]

inform the individual that a 1-year suspension can be imposed upon 
conviction, imposition of nonjudicial punishment, or action by civilian 
authorities leading to suspension or revocation of the individual's 
driver's license. The notice shall inform the individual that he or she 
has the right to submit a request within 5 working days to vacate the 
preliminary suspension and that failure to request such a hearing will 
result in continuation of the preliminary suspension.
    (iii) If a hearing has not been requested within 5 working days, the 
preliminary suspension shall be continued until there has been a 
criminal, nonjudicial, or administrative disposition.
    (iv) If the individual requests a hearing to vacate the preliminary 
suspension, it shall be held within 10 working days of the request. If 
the official conducting the hearing determines that the apprehension was 
based upon probable cause, the preliminary suspension shall be 
continued; if not, it shall be vacated. Such determinations are solely 
for purposes of acting on the preliminary suspension and are without 
prejudice to the rights of any party in a subsequent criminal or 
administrative proceeding involving the same or a related incident.
    (v) If the individual is acquitted, the charges are dismissed, or 
there is an equivalent determination in a nonjudicial punishment 
proceeding or civilian administrative action, the preliminary suspension 
shall be vacated.
    (vi) If there is a conviction, nonjudicial punishment, or civil 
suspension or revocation of driving privileges, the suspension shall be 
continued for 1 year from the date of the original preliminary 
suspension. Such action shall be taken only on the basis of an official 
report.
    (3) Suspension for refusal to take a blood alcohol content (BAC) 
test (i) Preliminary suspension of driving privileges is mandatory based 
upon an official report that an individual refused to submit to a 
lawfully requested BAC test.
    (ii) The individual shall be notified of the preliminary suspension 
in writing. The notice shall include the arrest report or other 
documentation and shall inform the individual that a 1-year suspension 
can be imposed after a hearing under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this 
section. The notice also shall inform the individual that he or she has 
the right within 5 working days to submit a request for a hearing to 
validate the preliminary suspension and that the suspension will be for 
1 year if a hearing is not requested.
    (iii) If a hearing is not requested within 5 working days, the 
suspension shall be for 1 year.
    (iv) If the individual requests a hearing to vacate the preliminary 
suspension, it shall be held within 10 working days of the request. The 
hearing shall consider the arrest report or other official 
documentation, information presented by the individual, and such other 
information as the hearing officer may deem appropriate. The official 
conducting the hearing shall consider the following issues: (A) Did the 
official have reasonable grounds to believe that the person had been 
operating or was in actual physical control of, a motor vehicle while 
intoxicated? (B) Was the person lawfully cited or apprehended for an 
intoxicated driving offense? (C) Was the individual lawfully requested 
to submit to a BAC test? (D) Did the person refuse to submit to or fail 
to complete a BAC test required by the law of the jurisdiction in which 
the test was requested? If, in view of these issues, the test was 
lawfully requested, the suspension shall be for 1 year, irrespective of 
the ultimate disposition of the underlying intoxicated driving offense. 
If not, the preliminary suspension shall be vacated. Such determinations 
are solely for purposes of acting on the preliminary suspension and are 
without prejudice to the rights of any party in a subsequent criminal or 
administrative proceeding involving the same or a related incident.
    (4) Suspension upon conviction, nonjudicial punishment, or civilian 
administrative action. (i) Suspension of driving privileges for 1 year 
is mandatory when there has been a conviction, nonjudicial punishment, 
or civilian revocation or suspension of driving privileges for 
intoxicated driving, regardless of any prior administrative 
determination under Sec. 62b.4 (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(5).
    (ii) Such action shall be taken only on the basis of an official 
report.

[[Page 389]]

    (iii) The individual shall be notified in writing of the suspension 
and shall be notified that an exception may be granted only under 
paragraph (b)(6) of this section.
    (iv) The suspension shall be issued by the installation commander. 
This authority may be delegated only to an official whose primary 
responsibilities are not in the field of law enforcement.
    (5) Repeat offenders. (i) Preliminary increase in suspension of 
driving privileges is mandatory based upon an arrest report or other 
official documentation of an individual's driving in violation of a 
suspension imposed under this part or under similar rules previously 
issued by a DoD Component.
    (A) The individual shall be notified in writing of the preliminary 
increase in suspension. The notice shall include the arrest report or 
other documentation of the violation as well as documentation of the 
original suspension and shall inform the individual that his or her 
original suspension can be increased by 2 years after a hearing under 
paragraph (b)(5)(i)(C) of this section. The notice shall inform the 
individual that he or she has the right within 5 working days to submit 
a request for a hearing to vacate the preliminary increase in suspension 
and that the original suspension will be increased by 2 years if such a 
request is not submitted.
    (B) If a hearing has not been requested within 5 working days, the 
original suspension shall be increased by 2 years.
    (C) If the individual requests a hearing to vacate the preliminary 
suspension, it shall be held within 10 working days of the request. The 
hearing shall consider the arrest report or other official 
documentation, information presented by the individual, documentation of 
the original suspension, and such other information as the hearing 
officer may deem appropriate. If the official conducting the hearing 
determines that the allegation of driving in violation of a suspension 
is supported by a preponderance of the evidence, the original suspension 
shall be increased by 2 years. If not, the preliminary increase in 
suspension shall be vacated. Such determinations are without prejudice 
to the rights of any party in a subsequent criminal or administrative 
proceeding involving the same or a related incident.
    (D) If in a subsequent judicial, nonjudicial, or administrative 
proceeding, it is determined that the individual did not violate a 
suspension, the preliminary increase in suspensions shall be vacated.
    (ii) For each subsequent determination within a 5-year period that a 
1-year suspension is authorized under paragraph (b) (2) through (4) of 
this section, driving privileges shall be suspended for 2-years. Such 
period shall be in addition to any suspension perviously imposed. 
Military personnel shall be prohibited from obtaining or using a U.S. 
Government Motor Vehicle Operator's Indentification Card, Standard Form 
(SF) 46, for 6 months for each such incident. A determination whether 
DoD civilian personnel should be prohibited from obtaining or using an 
SE 46 shall be made under Federal Personnel Manual chapter 930 and other 
laws and regulations applicable to civilian personnel. Nothing in this 
paragraph precludes an installation commander from imposing a 
prohibition upon obtaining or using an SF 46 for a first offense or for 
such other reasons as may be authorized under applicable laws and 
regulations.
    (6) Exceptions. (i) Exceptions to the mandatory suspension 
provisions in this part may be granted under regulations by the DoD 
Component concerned on a case-by-case basis. Requests for exceptions 
shall be in writing. Such exceptions may be granted only on the basis 
of:
    (A) Mission requirements;
    (B) Unusual personal or family hardship; or
    (C) In the case of a preliminary suspension following lawful 
apprehension, delays exceeding 90 days in the formal disposition of the 
allegations insofar as such delays are not attributable to the 
individual.
    (ii) With respect to a person who has no reasonably available 
alternate means of transportation to officially assigned duties, a 
limited exception shall be granted for the sole purpose of driving 
directly to and from such duties. This does not authorize a person to 
drive on a military installation if

[[Page 390]]

the person's driver's license is under suspension or revocation by a 
State, Federal, or host country civil court or administrative agency. 
Maximum reliance shall be placed on carpools, public transportation, and 
reasonably available parking facilities adjacent to the installation 
before such a limited exception is granted. Nothing in this provision 
precludes appropriate or other administrative action on the basis of an 
intoxicated driving incident or driving in violation of a previously 
imposed suspension.
    (iii) Exceptions granted under this paragraph shall be reported in 
writing to the next official in the chain of command.
    (7) Overseas commanders with authority to issue driver's licenses 
shall establish procedures for suspension of such licenses for 
intoxicated driving. Such procedures, insofar as the commanders deem 
practicable, shall be similar to the procedures for suspension of 
installation driving privileges prescribed in paragraph (b) (1) through 
(6) of this section.
    (8) Persons whose installation driving privileges are suspended for 
1 year or more under Sec. 62b.4(b) (2), (3), or (4), above, shall 
complete an alcohol or drug safety action program or equivalent alcohol 
education course (minimum of 8 hours) before their installation driving 
privileges may be reinstated.
    (c) Screening. Each DoD Component or its supporting agency shall 
establish procedures for screening military personnel charged with 
intoxicated driving offenses within 7 working days of issuance of notice 
of the preliminary suspension to determine whether a member is dependent 
on alcohol or other drugs. The results of this screening shall be made 
available to the command having jurisdiction over the case before 
adjudication. Information concerning personal alcohol and drug abuse 
provided by a member in response to screening questions may not be used 
against the member in a court-martial or on the issue of 
characterization in an administrative separation proceeding. Nothing in 
this provision precludes introduction of such evidence for other 
administrative purposes or for impeachment or rebuttal purposes in any 
proceeding in which evidence of alcohol or drug abuse (or lack thereof) 
first has been introduced by the member, nor does it preclude 
disciplinary or other action based on independently derived evidence. 
DoD civilian personnel charged with intoxicated driving shall be advised 
of the Civilian Employee Assistance Program or Installation Drug and 
Alcohol Program and the availability of evaluation in accordance with 
Federal Personnel Manual Supplement 792-2. Retired members of the 
Military Services shall be advised of the availability of evaluation and 
treatment programs.
    (d) Notification of State Driver's License Agencies. Each DoD 
Component or its supporting agency shall establish a systematic 
procedure in accordance with part 286a of this title to notify State 
driver's license agencies of DoD personnel whose installation driving 
privileges are suspended for 1 year or more following final adjudication 
of the intoxicated driving offense or upon suspension for refusal to 
submit to a lawful BAC test under paragraph (b) of this section. This 
notification shall include the basis for the suspension and the BAC 
level, if known. Exceptions shall be made only when such a suspension 
was increased for an additional 2 years for driving on an installation 
while installation driving privileges were suspended solely on the basis 
of driving in violation of suspension (see paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section). This notification shall be sent to the State in which the 
driver's license was issued and the State in which the installation is 
located. Sample letter format is provided in appendix 1, and State 
driver's license agencies are listed in Appendix 2. DoD Components shall 
establish a system to exchange intoxicated driving and driving privilege 
suspension data when DoD personnel transfer from one location to another 
to ensure that the receiving installation continues any remaining 
portion of the suspension. This information requirement is exempt from 
formal approval and licensing.
    (e) The Military Services shall include the intoxicated driving 
prevention program as an inspection item of special interest for 
Inspector General or administrative inspections.

[[Page 391]]

    (f) The Military Services shall direct installation commanders to 
assess the availability of drug and alcohol in the vicinity of military 
installations through their Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Boards or 
Control Boards of other appropriate Federal agencies. Whenever the 
availability of alcohol or drugs, or both, at an establishment off-base 
presents a threat to the discipline, health, and welfare of DoD 
personnel, such establishments shall be dealt with as prescribed in the 
``Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Board and Off-Installation Military 
Enforcement Guidance'' (Army Regulation No. 190-24, Marine Corps Order 
No. 162.2A, BUPERS Inst. 1620.4A, Air Force Regulation No. 125.11, 
Commandant Instruction No. 1620.13).
    (g) Cases Involving Death or Serious Injury. (1) To the extent 
permitted by law and consistent with the Uniform Code of Military 
Justice (UCMJ) and the ``Manual for Courts-Martial'' and in accordance 
with trial counsel's judgement of appropriate tactical and ethical 
concerns, consideration shall be given to presenting a victim's impact 
statement (oral or written statement by victims or survivors) before 
sentencing in cases involving intoxicated driving.
    (2) Trial counsel are encouraged to make reasonable efforts to 
ensure that the victim or the victim's family is provided information 
about the progress and disposition of cases processed under the UCMJ.
    (h) DoD Components with field installations shall establish an 
awards and recognition program to recognize successful local 
installation intoxicated driving prevention programs.
    (i) Each DoD Component or its supporting agency is encouraged to 
use, as guidance, ``Report on a National Study of Preliminary Breath 
Test (PBT) and Illegal Per Se Laws'' and ``Interim Report to the Nation 
by the Presidential Commission on Drunk Driving.''

the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Force Management and Personnel) 
(OASD(FM&P)) for validation and prioritization before fill by the 
Military Services. The Services retain the right to disapprove the 
request if no military retiree is available. At least annually, the 
requesting Agency shall verify to the OASD(FM&P) the accuracy of their 
validated requirements and identify any new requirements.
    (d) The Secretaries of the Military Departments, or designees, 
shall:
    (1) Prepare plans and establish procedures for mobilization of 
military retirees in conformance with this part.
    (2) Determine the extent of military retiree mobilization 
requirements based on existing inventories and inventory projections for 
mobilization of qualified Reservists in an active status in the Ready 
Reserve, the Inactive National Guard, or the Standby Reserve.
    (3) Develop procedures for identifying categories I and II retirees 
and conduct screening of retirees using this part for guidance.
    (4) Maintain personnel records and other necessary records for 
military retirees, including date of birth, date of retirement, current 
address, and documentation of military qualifications. Maintain records 
for categories I and II military retirees, including retirees who are 
key employees and their availability for mobilization, civilian 
employment, and physical condition. Data shall be maintained on retired 
Reserve members in accordance with 32 CFR part 114.
    (5) Advise military retirees of their duty to provide the Military 
Services with accurate mailing addresses and any changes in civilian 
employment, military qualifications, availability for service, and 
physical condition.
    (6) Preassign retired members, when determined appropriate and as 
necessary.
    (7) Determine refresher training requirements in accordance with the 
criteria established in Sec. 64.6(a)(8).


<R05>
Sec. 64.6  Procedures.

    (a) Premobilization--(1) Management of military retirees. Military 
retiree management systems should provide for rapid identification of 
retiree location and military skills to expedite reporting of retirees 
to a wide range of assignments and geographic locations in mobilization 
or crisis. As part of the criteria for assignment of individuals to 
specific mobilization billets, the Military Services should consider the 
criticality of the mobilization billet, the skills of the individual, 
and his or her geographic proximity to the place of assignment. To the 
extent possible, military retirees should be given the opportunity to 
volunteer for specific assignments. The Military Departments shall 
develop plans and procedures to identify military retirees excess to 
their needs. The Military Departments, other DoD Components, FEMA, SSS, 
and other Federal Agencies, as appropriate, shall provide a list of 
requirements to the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense 
shall establish priorities for fill once all requirements and excess 
personnel are identified and provide redistribution guidance.
    (2) Requirement validation. The OASD(FM&P) shall review and validate 
each mobilization requirement for a military retiree. The criteria 
considered shall be the structure of the organization, the expanded 
workload requirements in a mobilization environment, current manpower 
authorizations, and existing manpower infrastructures supporting the 
organizations.

[[Page 398]]

    (3) Assignment priority. The priority for use of military retirees 
shall be:
    (i) Use by their own Service.
    (ii) Use by another Service or a Defense Agency.
    (iii) Use by a civilian Federal Department or Agency.
    (iv) Any other approved use.
    (4) Preassignment of categories I and II military retirees. When 
determined appropriate by the Military Service concerned, military 
retirees who physically are qualified maximally should be preassigned in 
peacetime, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to installations or to 
mobilization positions that must be filled within 30 days after 
mobilization. Key employees and category III retirees shall not be 
preassigned involuntarily. Severe hostilities may prevent the 
transmittal of mobilization orders to military retirees. All military 
retirees preassigned to mobilization positions or installations, either 
voluntarily or involuntarily, shall be issued preassignment or 
contingent preassignment orders.
    (5) Category III military retirees. The nature and extent of the 
mobilization of category III retirees shall be determined by each 
Military Service, based on the retiree's military skill and, if 
applicable, the nature and degree of the retiree's disability. Category 
III retirees generally should be assigned to civilian jobs, unless they 
have critical skills or volunteer for specific military jobs. Age or 
disability alone may not be the sole basis for excluding a retiree from 
active Military Service during mobilization.
    (6) Military retirees living overseas. Military retirees who live 
overseas maximally shall be preassigned in peacetime, as determined by 
the Military Service concerned, to meet mobilization augmentation 
requirements at overseas, U.S., or allied military installations or 
activities that are near their places of residence.
    (7) Military retiree information. The development and maintenance of 
current information on the mobilization availability of military 
retirees shall be the responsibility of the Military Services. Such 
information shall include, but not be limited to, date of retirement, 
date of birth, current address, and military qualifications. 
Additionally, the Military Services shall maintain information on the 
availability for mobilization and the physical condition of categories I 
and II military retirees. Indication of physical condition may be from 
certification by the individual military retiree.
    (8) Refresher training. Each Military Service shall determine the 
necessity for, and the frequency of, refresher training of military 
retirees, based on the needs of the Military Service and the specific 
military skill of the military retiree. Emphasis should be on voluntary 
refresher training. Civilian-acquired skills may eliminate the need for 
refresher training.
    (9) Screening of military retirees--(i) Each Military Service shall 
develop procedures for identifying categories I and II retirees, and 
shall conduct screening of retirees using this part and 32 CFR part 44 
as guidance in formulating screening criteria.
    (ii) All military retirees shall be advised to inform their 
employers concerning their liability for recall to active duty in a 
mobilization or national emergency, and, when applicable, the procedures 
for designating their position as a key position.
    (iii) Federal employers annually shall review their employment rolls 
to determine if they employ any military retirees who are filling key 
positions, as defined in Sec. 64.3.
    (iv) Non-Federal employers also are encouraged to use the key 
position guidelines for making their own key position designations and, 
when applicable, for recommending certain military retirees for key 
employees status.
    (v) Key position designation guidelines. In determining whether or 
not a position should be designated as a key position, employers should 
consider the following criteria:
    (A) Can the position be filled in a reasonable time after 
mobilization?
    (B) Does the position require technical or managerial skills that 
are possessed uniquely by the incumbent employee?
    (C) Is the position associated directly with Defense mobilization?
    (D) Does the position include a mobilization or relocation 
assignment in an Agency having emergency functions, as designated by 
E.O. 12656?

[[Page 399]]

    (E) Is the position directly associated with industrial or manpower 
mobilization, as designated in E.O. 10480?
    (F) Are there other factors related to national defense, health, or 
safety that would make the incumbent of the position unavailable for 
mobilization?
    (vi) Employers who determine that a military retiree is filling a 
key position and should not be recalled to active duty in an emergency 
should report that determination to the cognizant military personnel 
center, using the letter format shown in Appendix A to this part. The 
list of Reserve personnel centers to which retiree-recall screening-
determination recommendations shall be forwarded is at Appendix B to 
this part.
    (b) Mobilization--(1) General. The Military Services shall establish 
plans and procedures to use those military retirees who meet specific 
skill and experience requirements to fill mobilization billets, when 
there is not enough active or qualified Reserve manpower available.
    (2) Involuntary order to active duty--(i) Twenty-year active 
military service retirees. The Secretary of a Military Department may 
order any retired Regular member, retired Reserve member who has 
completed at least 20 years of Active Service, or a member of the Fleet 
Reserve or Fleet Marine Corps Reserve to active duty at any time to 
perform duties deemed necessary in the interests of national defense in 
accordance with 10 U.S.C. 675 and 688. Retired Regular members of the 
Coast Guard may be ordered to active duty by the Secretary concerned 
only in time of war or national emergency in accordance with 14 U.S.C. 
331 and 359.
    (ii) Reserve. The Secretary of a Military Department may order any 
other retired member of a Reserve component of a Military Service to 
active duty for the duration of a war or emergency and for 6 months 
thereafter on the basis of required skills, provided:
    (A) War or national emergency has been declared by Congress.
    (B) The Secretary of the Military Department concerned, with the 
approval of the Secretary of Defense, determines there are not enough 
qualified Reserves in an Active status or in the Inactive National 
Guard, under 10 U.S.C. 672(a).
    (3) Graduated Mobilization Response. The Military Services shall 
develop plans and procedures for ordering military retirees to active 
duty in accordance with a schedule that includes pre-, partial, and full 
mobilization requirements.
    (c) Peacetime--(1) General. The Military Departments shall establish 
procedures to order military retirees to active duty during peacetime.
    (2) Voluntary order to active duty--(i) Twenty-year active military 
service retirees. The Secretary of a Military Department may order 
retired Regular members, retired Reserve members who have completed at 
least 20 years of active Military Service, or members of the Fleet 
Reserve or Fleet Marine Corps Reserve to active duty with their consent 
at any time in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 688.
    (ii) Other Reserve retirees. The Secretary of a Military Department 
may order other retired members of a Reserve component to active duty 
with their consent in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 672(d).
    (3) Involuntary order to active duty. The Secretary of a Military 
Department may order any retired Regular member, retired Reserve member 
who has completed at least 20 years of active Military Service, or a 
member of the Fleet Reserve or Fleet Marine Corps Reserve to active duty 
without the member's consent at any time to perform duties deemed 
necessary in the interests of national defense in accordance with 10 
U.S.C. 688. This includes the authority to order a retired member who is 
subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) to active duty to 
facilitate the exercise of court-martial jurisdiction under 10 U.S.C. 
802(a). A retired member may not be involuntarily ordered to active duty 
solely for obtaining court-martial jurisdiction over the member.

Sec. 68.2  Purpose.

    This part:
    (a) Establishes policies and prescribes procedures for the 
Department of Defense (DoD) to make arrangements (as defined in Sec. 
68.5) for the provision of free public education to eligible dependent 
children as authorized by Sec. 68.1 (a), (b), and (c).
    (b) Implements Sec. 68.1 (a), (b), (d), and (e).


<R05>
Sec. 68.3  Applicability and scope.

    This part applies to:
    (a) The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the Military 
Departments, and the Defense Agencies.
    (b) The schools operated by DoD within the Continental United States 
(CONUS), Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Wake Island, Guam, American Samoa, 
the Northern Mariana lslands, and the Virgin Islands.


<R05>
Sec. 68.4  Policy.

    (a) In conformity with Sec. 68.1 (a), (b), and (c), it is DoD 
policy that dependent children of U.S. military personnel and federally 
employed civilian personnel residing on Federal property be educated, 
whenever suitable, in schools operated and controlled by local public 
school systems.
    (b) When it is not suitable for the children of U.S. military 
personnel and federally employed civilian personnel to0attend a locally 
operated public school, the Secretary of Defense, or designee, shall 
make arrangements for the free public education of such children. These 
arrangements may include the establishment of schools within the United 
States and specified possessions.
    (c) The arrangements for such free public education shall be made by 
the Secretary of Defense, or designee, either with a local educational 
agency, or with the Head of a Federal Department or Agency, whichever in 
the judgment of the Secretary, or designee, appears to be more 
applicable. If such an arrangement is made with the Head of a Federal 
Department or Agency, either it must administer the property on which 
the children to be educated reside or, if the local schools are 
unavailable to the children of members of the Armed Forces on active 
duty because of official State or local action and no suitable free 
public education may be provided by a local educational agency, the 
Department or Agency must have jurisdiction over the parents of some or 
all of such children.
    (d) Section 6 School Arrangements are required, to the maximum 
extent practicable, to provide educational programs comparable to those 
being provided by local public educational agencies in comparable 
communities in the State where the Section 6 School Arrangement is 
located. If the Section 6 School Arrangement is outside of CONUS, 
Alaska, or Hawaii, it shall provide, to the maximum extent practicable, 
educational programs that are comparable to the free public education 
provided by the District of Columbia.
    (e) Section 6 School Arrangements operated by DoD under 68.1 (a)l 
(b), and (d) shall comply, except as provided in this paragraph, with 
Sec. 68.1(g). lf the State or other jurisdiction on which a Section 6 
School Arrangement's educational comparability is based has adopted a 
``State plan'' for the implementation of Sec. 68.1(g) that Section 6 
School Arrangement shall provide its handicapped students a free 
appropriate public education, as defined in Sec. 68.1(g). That 
education, except as follows in this paragraph, is consistent with such 
State plan. To satisfy this responsibility, Section 6 School 
Arrangements shall conform to the substantive and procedural provisions 
of Sec. 68.1(g), except for those relating to impartial due process 
hearings in section 1415 of Sec. 68.1(g). The procedures of such 
Section 6 School Arrangements for the identification, assessment, and 
programming of handicapped students in special education and related 
services must conform to the comparable State's regulatory guidelines. 
Complaints with respect to the identification, evaluation or educational 
placement of, or the free appropriate public education provided to, 
students in such a Section 6 School Arrangement who are or may be 
handicapped shall be investigated under enclosure 5 to DoD

[[Page 404]]

Directive 1020.1 \1\ (Sec. 68.1(h)). lf the State on which a Section 6 
School Arrangement's comparability is based has not adopted a State 
plan, the State plan of an adjacent State must be followed. If no 
adjacent State has adopted a State plan, the State plan of another State 
that is similar to the State in which the Section 6 School Arrangement 
is located shall be selected.

    (f) After consultation with the Military Departments, funds shall be 
made available for the operation and maintenance of Section 6 School 
Arrangements, on either a direct or reimbursable basis, to the 
comptroller at the respective military installation. These funds shall 
remain separate and distinct from the funds of the individual Military 
Services.
    (g) Attendance in Section 6 School and Special Arrangements within 
CONUS, Alaska, and Hawaii is limited to eligible dependent children 
under Sec. 68.1(b). Guidance, consistent with Sec. 68.1 (b) and (c) 
for student eligibility for Section 6 School Arrangements located 
outside of CONUS, Alaska, and Hawaii shall be established by the 
Military Department concerned after coordination and approval by the 
General Counsel of the Department of Defense, or designee, and the 
Assistant Secretary of Defense (Force Management and Personnel), or 
designee.
    (h) Where a member of the Armed Forces is transferred or retires and 
the member's family moves after the start of the school year from on-
base (post) housing, the member's children shall be permitted to 
continue in attendance at the Section 6 School Arrangement for the 
remainder of the school year during which the transfer or retirement 
occurred, if the child is residing with a parent or legal guardian or 
another person acting in loco parentis.
    (i) Where a member of the Armed Forces is assigned to an 
installation on which there is a Section 6 School Arrangement and is 
assigned on-base (post) family housing that is expected to be available 
for occupancy and to be occupied within 90 school days from the 
reporting date, the member's children may be permitted to attend the 
school while residing in an area adjacent to such Federal property. 
Transportation for children attending a Section 6 School Arrangement 
under these conditions is the responsibility of the parent.

<R05>
Sec. 69.3  Definitions.

    (a) Arrangements. Actions taken by the Secretary of Defense to 
provide a free public education to dependent children under 10 U.S.C. 
2164 through DoD DDESS arrangements or DoD DDESS special arrangements:
    (1) DDESS arrangement. A school operated by the Department of 
Defense under 10 U.S.C. 2164 and 32 CFR 345 to provide a free public 
education for eligible children.
    (2) DDESS special arrangement. An agreement, under 10 U.S.C. 2164, 
between the Secretary of Defense, or designee, and a local public 
education agency whereby a school or a school system operated by the 
local public education agency provides educational services to eligible 
dependent children of U.S. military personnel and federally employed 
civilian personnel. Arrangements result in partial or total Federal 
funding to the local public education agency for the educational 
services provided.
    (b) Parent. The biological father or mother of a child when parental 
rights have not been legally terminated; a person who, by order of a 
court of competent jurisdiction, has been declared the father or mother 
of a child by adoption; the legal guardian of a child; or a person in 
whose household a child resides, provided that such person stands in 
loco parentis to that child and contributes at least one-half of the

Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution (Art. II, Sec. 2, 
Cl. 2), they may not exercise discretionary governmental authority, such 
as the taking of personnel actions or the establishment of governmental 
policies. This part clarifies the role of school boards in the 
development and oversight of fiscal, personnel, and educational 
policies, procedures, and programs for DoD DDESS arrangements, subject 
to these constitutional limitations.
    (c) The DoD DDESS chain of command for matters relating to school 
arrangements operated under 10 U.S.C. 2164 and 32 CFR part 345 shall be 
from the Director, DoD DDESS, to the Superintendent of each school 
arrangement. The Superintendent will inform the school board of all 
matters affecting the operation of the local school arrangement. Direct 
liaison among the school board, the Director, and the Superintendent is 
authorized for all matters pertaining to the local school arrangement.

conflict in the views of the school board and the Superintendent. When 
such conflicts occur, the Director, DoD DDESS, shall assist the 
Superintendent and the school board in resolving them or direct that 
such actions be discontinued. Such disapprovals must be in writing to 
the school board and the Superintendent concerned and shall state the 
specific supporting reason or reasons.

vacancy in the Superintendent's position after a recruitment has been 
accomplished. The school board shall submit to the Director, DoD DDESS, 
a list of all applicants based on its review of the applications and 
interviews (either in person or telephonically) of the applicants. The 
list of applicants will be accompanied by the recommended choice of the 
school board. The Director will select the Superintendent and will 
submit written notice with justification to the school board if the 
recommendation of the school board is not followed.
    (4) Prepare an annual written on-site review of the Superintendent's 
performance for consideration by the Director, DoD DDESS. The written 
review shall be based on critical elements recommended by the school 
board and Superintendent and approved by the Director, DoD DDESS. The 
school board's review will be an official attachment to the 
Superintendent's appraisal.
    (5) Participate in the development of the school system's budget for

    (viii) Procedures providing for new school board member orientation.
    (ix) Any other matters determined by the school board and the 
superintendent to be necessary.
    (10) Under 10 U.S.C. 2164(b)(4)(B), prepare and submit formal 
appeals to directives and other guidance that in the view of the school 
board adversely impact the operation of the school system either through 
the operation and management of DoD DDESS or a specific DoD DDESS 
arrangement. Written formal appeals with justification and supporting

Formal appeals will be handled expeditiously by all parties to minimize 
any adverse impact on the operation of the DoD DDESS system.
    (d) Ensure school board operating procedures are as follows:
    (1) The school board shall operate from a written agenda at all 
meetings. Matters not placed on the agenda before the start of the 
meeting, but approved by a majority of the school board present, may be 
considered at the ongoing meeting and added to the agenda at that time.
    (2) A majority of the total number of school board members 
authorized shall constitute a quorum.
    (3) School board meetings shall be conducted a minimum of 9 times a 
year. The school board President or designee will provide school board 
members timely notice of all meetings. All regularly scheduled school 
board meetings will be open to the public. Executive session meetings

    (4) The school board shall not be bound in any way by any action or 
statement of an individual member or group of members of the board 
except when such action or statement is approved by a majority of the 
school board members during a school board meeting.
    (5) School board members are eligible for reimbursement for official 
travel in accordance with the DoD Joint Travel Regulations and guidance 
issued by the Director, DoD DDESS.
    (6) School board members may be removed by the ASD (FMP) for 
dereliction of duty, malfeasance, or other grounds for cause shown. The 
school board concerned may recommend such removal with a two-thirds 
majority vote. Before a member may be removed, the member shall be 
afforded due process, to include written notification of the basis for 
the action, review of the evidence or documentation considered by the 
school board, and an opportunity to respond to the allegations.


<R05>
Sec. 69.6  Procedures.

    (a) Composition of school board. (1) The school board shall 
recommend to the Director, DoD DDESS, the number of elected school board 
voting members, which shall be not fewer than 3 and no more than 9, 
depending upon local needs. The members of the school board shall select 
by majority vote of the total number of school board members authorized 
at the beginning of each official school board term, one member to act 
as President and another to act as Vice President. The President and 
Vice President shall each serve for 1 year. The President shall preside 
over school board meetings and provide leadership for related activities 
and functions. The Vice President shall serve in the absence of the 
President. If the position of President is vacated for any reason, the 
Vice President shall be the President until the next regularly scheduled 
school board election. The resulting vacancy in the position of the Vice 
President shall be filled by the majority vote of all members of the 
incumbent board.
    (2) The DoD DDESS Arrangement Superintendent, or designee, shall 
serve as a non-voting observer to all school board meetings. The 
Installation Commander, or designee, shall convey command concerns to 
the school board and the Superintendent and keep the school board and 
the Superintendent informed of changes and other matters within the host 
installation that affect school expenditures or operations.

[[Page 412]]

    (3) School board members may not receive compensation for their 
service on the school board.
    (4) Members of the school board may not have any financial interest 
in any company or organization doing business with the school system. 
Waivers to this restriction may be granted on a case-by-case basis by 
the Director, DoD DDESS, in coordination with the Office of General 
Counsel of the Department of Defense.
    (b) Electorate of the school board. The electorate for each school 
board seat shall be composed of parents of the students attending the 
school. Each member of the electorate shall have one vote.
    (c) Election of school board members. (1) To be elected as a member 
of the school board, an individual must be a resident of the military 
installation in which the DoD DDESS arrangement is located, or in the 
case of candidates for the Antilles Consolidated School System School 
Board, be the parent of an eligible child currently enrolled in the 
school system. Personnel employed by a DoD DDESS arrangement may not 
serve as school board members.
    (2) The board shall determine the term of office for elected 
members, not to exceed 3 years, and the limit on the number of terms, if 
any. If the board fails to set these terms by the first day of the first 
full month of the school year, the terms will be set at 3 years, with a 
maximum of 2 consecutive terms.
    (3) When there is a sufficient number of school board vacancies that 
result in not having a quorum, which is defined as a majority of seats 
authorized, a special election shall be called by the DoD DDESS 
Arrangement Superintendent or designee. A special election is an 
election that is held between the regularly scheduled annual school 
board election. The nomination and election procedures for a special 
election shall be the same as those of regularly scheduled school board 
elections. Individuals elected by special election shall serve until the 
next regularly scheduled school board election. Vacancies may occur due 
to the resignation, death, removal for cause, transfer, or disenrollment 
of a school board member's child(ren) from the DoD DDESS arrangement.
    (4) The board shall determine a schedule for regular elections. 
Parents shall have adequate notice of the time and place of the 
election. The election shall be by secret ballot. All votes must be cast 
in person at the time and place of the election. The candidate(s) 
receiving the greatest number of votes shall be elected as school board 
member(s).
    (5) Each candidate for school board membership must be nominated in 
writing by at least one member of the electorate to be represented by 
the candidate. Votes may be cast at the time of election for write-in 
candidates who have not filed a nomination petition if the write-in 
candidates otherwise are qualified to serve in the positions sought.
    (6) The election process shall provide staggered terms for board 
members; e.g., on the last day of the last month of each year, the term 
for some board members will expire.
    (7) The DoD DDESS Superintendent, in consultation with the school 
board, shall be responsible for developing the plans for nominating 
school board members and conducting the school board election and the 
special election process. The DoD DDESS Superintendent shall announce 
election results within 7 working days of the election.

all discharge review proceedings conducted on or after November 27, 
1982. Sec. 70.10 applies to all complaint proceedings conducted on or 
after September 28, 1982. Final action on complaints shall not be taken 
until September 28, 1982, unless earlier corrective action is requested 
expressly by the applicant (or the applicant's counsel) whose case is 
the subject of the decisional document. If earlier corrective action is 
requested, it shall be taken in accordance with Sec. 70.10.


<R05>
Sec. 70.8  Discharge review procedures.

    (a) Application for review--(1) General. Applications shall be 
submitted to the appropriate DRB on DD Form 293, ``Application for 
Review of Discharge or Separation from the Armed Forces of the United 
States,'' with such other statements, affidavits, or documentation as 
desired. It is to the applicant's advantage to submit such documents 
with the application or within 60 days thereafter in order to permit a 
thorough screening of the case. The DD Form 293 is available at most DoD 
installations and regional offices of the Veterans Administration, or by 
writing to: DA Military Review Boards Agency, Attention: SFBA (Reading 
Room), Room 1E520, The Pentagon, Washington, DC 20310.
    (2) Timing. A motion or request for review must be made within 15 
years after the date of discharge or dismissal.
    (3) Applicant's responsibilities. An applicant may request a change 
in the character of or reason for discharge (or both).
    (i) Character of discharge. Block 7 of DD Form 293 provides an 
applicant an opportunity to request a specific change in character of 
discharge (for example, General Discharge to Honorable Discharge; Other 
than Honorable Discharge to General or Honorable Discharge). Only a 
person separated on or after 1 October 1982 while in an entry level 
status may request a change from Other than Honorable Discharge to Entry 
Level Separation. A request for review from an applicant who does not 
have an Honorable Discharge shall be treated as a request for a change 
to an Honorable Discharge unless the applicant requests a specific 
change to another character of discharge.
    (ii) Reason for discharge. Block 7 of DD Form 293 provides an 
applicant an opportunity to request a specific change in the reason for 
discharge. If an applicant does not request a specific change in the 
reason for discharge, the DRB shall presume that the request for review 
does not involve a request for change in the reason for discharge. Under 
its responsibility to examine the propriety and equity of an applicant's 
discharge, the DRB shall change the reason for discharge if such a 
change is warranted.
    (iii) The applicant must ensure that issues submitted to the DRB are 
consistent with the request for change in discharge set forth in block 7 
of the DD Form 293. If an ambiguity is created by a difference between 
an applicant's issue and the request in block 7, the DRB shall respond 
to the issue in the context of the action requested in block 7. In the 
case of a hearing, the DRB shall attempt to resolve the ambiguity under 
paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
    (4) Request for consideration of specific issues. An applicant may 
request the

[[Page 416]]

DRB to consider specific issues which, in the opinion of the applicant, 
form a basis for changing the character of or reason for discharge, or 
both. In addition to the guidance set forth in this section, applicants 
should consult the other sections in this part (particularly paragraphs 
(c), (d), and (e) of this section and Sec. Sec. 70.9 and 70.10 before 
submitting issues for consideration by the DRB.
    (i) Submission of issues on DD Form 293. Issues must be provided to 
the DRB on DD Form 293 before the DRB closes the review process for 
deliberation.
    (A) Issues must be clear and specific. An issue must be stated 
clearly and specifically in order to enable the DRB to understand the 
nature of the issue and its relationship to the applicant's discharge.
    (B) Separate listing of issues. Each issue submitted by an applicant 
should be listed separately. Submission of a separate statement for each 
issue provides the best means of ensuring that the full import of the 
issue is conveyed to the DRB.
    (C) Use of DD Form 293. DD Form 293 provides applicants with a 
standard format for submitting issues to the DRB, and its use:
    (1) Provides a means for an applicant to set forth clearly and 
specifically those matters that, in the opinion of the applicant, 
provide a basis for changing the discharge;
    (2) Assists the DRB in focusing on those matters considered to be 
important by an applicant;
    (3) Assists the DRB in distinguishing between a matter submitted by 
an applicant in the expectation that it will be treated as a decisional 
issue under paragraph (e) of this section, and those matters submitted 
simply as background or supporting materials;
    (4) Provides the applicant with greater rights in the event that the 
applicant later submits a complaint under Sec. 70.10(d)(1)(iii) 
concerning the decisional document;
    (5) Reduces the potential for disagreement as to the content of an 
applicant's issue.
    (D) Incorporation by reference. If the applicant makes an additional 
written submission, such as a brief, in support of the application, the 
applicant may incorporate by reference specific issues set forth in the 
written submission in accordance with the guidance on DD Form 293. The 
reference shall be specific enough for the DRB to identify clearly the 
matter being submitted as an issue. At a minimum, it shall identify the 
page, paragraph, and sentence incorporated. Because it is to the 
applicant's benefit to bring such issues to the DRB's attention as early 
as possible in the review, applicants who submit a brief are strongly 
urged to set forth all such issues as a separate item at the beginning 
of the brief. If it reasonably appears that the applicant inadvertently 
has failed expressly to incorporate an issue which the applicant clearly 
identifies as an issue to be addressed by the DRB, the DRB shall respond 
to such an issue under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.
    (E) Effective date of the new Form DD 293. With respect to 
applications received before November 27, 1982, the DRB shall consider 
issues clearly and specifically stated in accordance with the rules in 
effect at the time of submission. With respect to applications received 
on or after November 27, 1982, if the applicant submits an obsolete DD 
Form 293, the DRB shall accept the application, but shall provide the 
applicant with a copy of the new form and advise the applicant that it 
will only respond to issues submitted on the new form in accordance with 
this part.
    (ii) Relationship of issues to character of or reason for discharge. 
If the application applies to both character of and reason for 
discharge, the applicant is encouraged, but not required, to identify 
the issue as applying to the character of or reason for discharge (or 
both). Unless the issue is directed at the reason for discharge 
expressly or by necessary implication, the DRB will presume that it 
applies solely to the character of discharge.
    (iii) Relationship of issues to the standards for discharge review. 
The DRB reviews discharges on the basis of issues of propriety and 
equity. The standards used by the DRB are set forth in Sec. 70.9. The 
applicant is encouraged to review those standards before submitting any 
issue upon which the applicant believes a change in discharge should be 
based.

[[Page 417]]

    (A) Issues concerning the equity of the discharge. An issue of 
equity is a matter that involves a determination whether a discharge 
should by changed under the equity standards of Sec. 70.9. This 
includes any issue, submitted by the applicant in accordance with 
paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, that is addressed to the 
discretionary authority of the DRB.
    (B) Issues concerning the propriety of a discharge. An issue of 
propriety is a matter that involves a determination whether a discharge 
should be changed under the propriety standards of Sec. 70.9. This 
includes an applicant's issue, submitted in accordance with paragraph 
(a)(4)(i) of this section, in which the applicant's position is that the 
discharge must be changed because of an error in the discharge 
pertaining to a regulation, statute, constitutional provision, or other 
source of law (including a matter that requires a determination whether, 
under the circumstances of the case, action by military authorities was 
arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion). Although a numerical 
reference to the regulation or other sources of law alleged to have been 
violated is not necessarily required, the context of the regulation or a 
description of the procedures alleged to have been violated normally 
must be set forth in order to inform the DRB adequately of the basis for 
the applicant's position.
    (C) The applicant's identification of an issue. The applicant is 
encouraged, but not required, to identify an issue as pertaining to the 
propriety or the equity to the discharge. This will assist the DRB in 
assessing the relationship of the issue to propriety or equity under 
paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (iv) Citation of matter from decisions. The primary function of the 
DRB involves the exercise of dicretion on a case-by-case basis. See 
Sec. 70.9(b)(3). Applicants are not required to cite prior decisions as 
the basis for a change in discharge. If the applicant wishes to bring 
the DRB's attention to a prior decision as background or illustrative 
material, the citation should be placed in a brief or other supporting 
documents. If, however, it is the applicant's intention to submit an 
issue that sets forth specific principles and facts from a specific 
cited decision, the following requirements apply with respect to 
applications received on or after November 27, 1982.
    (A) The issue must be set forth or expressly incorporated in the 
``Applicant's Issue'' portion of DD Form 293.
    (B) If an applicant's issue cites a prior decision (of the DRB, 
another Board, an agency, or a court), the applicant shall describe the 
specific principles and facts that are contained in the prior decision 
and explain the relevance of cited matter to the applicant's case.
    (C) To ensure timely consideration of principles cited from 
unpublished opinions (including decisions maintained by the Armed Forces 
Discharge Review Board/Corrective Board Reading Room), applicants must 
provide the DRB with copies of such decisions or of the relevant portion 
of the treatise, manual, or similar source in which the principles were 
discussed. At the applicant's request, such materials will be returned.
    (D) If the applicant fails to comply with the requirements in 
paragraphs (a)(4)(iv) (A), (B), and (C), the decisional document shall 
note the defect, and shall respond to the issue without regard to the 
citation.
    (5) Identification by the DRB of issues submitted by an applicant. 
The applicant's issues shall be identified in accordance with this 
section after a review of the materials noted under paragraph (c)(4), is 
made.
    (i) Issues on DD Form 293. The DRB shall consider all items 
submitted as issues by an applicant on DD Form 293 (or incorporated 
therein) in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(i). With respect to 
applications submitted before November 27, 1982, the DRB shall consider 
all issues clearly and specifically stated in accordance with the rules 
in effect at the time of the submission.
    (ii) Amendment of issues. The DRB shall not request or instruct an 
applicant to amend or withdraw any matter submitted by the applicant. 
Any amendment or withdrawal of an issue by an applicant shall be 
confirmed in writing by the applicant. Nothing in this provision:

[[Page 418]]

    (A) Limits the DRB's authority to question an applicant as to the 
meaning of such matter;
    (B) Precludes the DRB from developing decisional issues based upon 
such questions;
    (C) Prevents the applicant from amending or withdrawing such matter 
any time before the DRB closes the review process for deliberation; or
    (D) Prevents the DRB from presenting an applicant with a list of 
proposed decisional issues and written information concerning the right 
of the applicant to add to, amend, or withdraw the applicant's 
submission. The written information will state that the applicant's 
decision to take such action (or decline to do so) will not be used 
against the applicant in the consideration of the case.
    (iii) Additional issues identified during a hearing. The following 
additional procedure shall be used during a hearing in order to promote 
the DRB's understanding of an applicant's presentation. If, before 
closing the case for deliberation, the DRB believes that an applicant 
has presented an issue not listed on DD Form 293, the DRB may so inform 
the applicant, and the applicant may submit the issue in writing or add 
additional written issues at that time. This does not preclude the DRB 
from developing its own decisional issues.
    (6) Notification of possible bar to benefits. Written notification 
shall be made to each applicant whose record indicates a reason for 
discharge that bars receipt of benefits under 38 U.S.C. 3103(a). This 
notification will advise the applicant that separate action by the Board 
for Correction of Military or Naval Records or the Veterans 
Administration may confer eligibility for VA benefits. Regarding the bar 
to benefits based upon the 180 days consecutive unauthorized absence, 
the following applies:
    (i) Such absence must have been included as part of the basis for 
the applicant's discharge under other than honorable conditions.
    (ii) Such absence is computed without regard to the applicant's 
normal or adjusted expiration of term of service.
    (b) Conduct of reviews. (1) Members. As designated by the Secretary 
concerned, the DRB and its panels, if any, shall consist of five 
members. One member of the DRB shall be designated as the president and 
may serve as a presiding officer. Other officers may be designated to 
serve as presiding officers for DRB panels under regulations prescribed 
by the Secretary concerned.
    (2) Locations. Reviews by a DRB will be conducted in the NCR and 
such other locations as designated by the Secretary concerned.
    (3) Types of review. An applicant, upon request, is entitled to:
    (i) Record review. A review of the application, available service 
records, and additional documents (if any) submitted by the applicant.
    (ii) Hearing. A review involving an appearance before the DRB by the 
applicant or counsel or representative (or both).
    (4) Applicant's expenses. Unless otherwise specified by law or 
regulation, expenses incurred by the applicant, witnesses, counsel or 
representative will not be paid by the Department of Defense.
    (5) Withdrawal of application. An applicant shall be permitted to 
withdraw an application without prejudice at any time before the 
scheduled review.
    (6) Failure to appear at a hearing or respond to a scheduling 
notice. (i) Except as otherwise authorized by the Secretary concerned, 
further opportunity for a hearing shall not be made available in the 
following circumstances to an applicant who has requested a hearing:
    (A) When the applicant has been sent a letter containing the month 
and location of a proposed hearing and fails to make a timely response; 
or
    (B) When the applicant, after being notified by letter of the time 
and place of the hearing, fails to appear at the appointed time, either 
in person or by representative, without having made a prior, timely 
request for a continuation, postponement, or withdrawal.
    (ii) In such cases, the applicant shall be deemed to have waived the 
right to a hearing, and the DRB shall complete its review of the 
discharge. Further request for a hearing shall not be granted unless the 
applicant can demonstrate that the failure to appear or respond was due 
to circumstances beyond the applicant's control.

[[Page 419]]

    (7) Continuance and postponements. (i) A continuance of a discharge 
review hearing may be authorized by the president of the DRB or 
presiding officer of the panel concerned, provided that such continuance 
is of reasonable duration and is essential to achieving a full and fair 
hearing. When a proposal for continuance is indefinite, the pending 
application shall be returned to the applicant with the option to 
resubmit when the case is fully ready for review.
    (ii) Postponements of scheduled reviews normally shall not be 
permitted other than for demonstrated good and sufficient reason set 
forth by the applicant in a timely manner, or for the convenience of the 
government.
    (8) Reconsideration. A discharge review shall not be subject to 
reconsideration except:
    (i) When the only previous consideration of the case was on the 
motion of the DRB;
    (ii) When the original discharge review did not involve a hearing 
and a hearing is now desired, and the provisions of paragraph (b)(6) of 
this section do not apply;
    (iii) When changes in discharge policy are announced after an 
earlier review of an applicant's discharge, and the new policy is made 
expressly retroactive;
    (iv) When the DRB determines that policies and procedures under 
which the applicant was discharged differ in material respects from 
policies and procedures currently applicable on a Service-wide basis to 
discharges of the type under consideration, provided that such changes 
in policies or procedures represent a substantial enhancement of the 
rights afforded a respondent in such proceedings;
    (v) When an individual is to be represented by a counsel or 
representative, and was not so represented in any previous consideration 
of the case by the DRB;
    (vi) When the case was not previously considered under uniform 
standards published pursuant to Pub. L. 95-126 and such application is 
made within 15 years after the date of discharge; or
    (vii) On the basis of presentation of new, substantial, relevant 
evidence not available to the applicant at the time of the original 
review. The decision whether evidence offered by an applicant in support 
of a request for reconsideration is in fact new, substantial, relevant, 
and was not available to the applicant at the time of the original 
review will be based on a comparison of such evidence with the evidence 
considered in the previous discharge review. If this comparison shows 
that the evidence submitted would have had a probable effect on matters 
concerning the propriety or equity of the discharge, the request for 
reconsideration shall be granted.
    (9) Availability of records and documents. (i) Before applying for 
discharge review, potential applicants or their designated 
representatives may obtain copies of their military personnel records by 
submitting a General Services Administration Standard Form 180, 
``Request Pertaining to Military Records,'' to the National Personnel 
Records Center (NPRC), 9700 Page Boulevard, St. Louis, MO 62132. Once 
the application for discharge review (DD Form 293) is submitted, an 
applicant's military records are forwarded to the DRBs where they cannot 
be reproduced. Submission of a request for an applicant's military 
records, including a request under the Freedom of Information Act (32 
CFR part 286) or Privacy Act (32 CFR part 286a) after the DD Form 293 
has been submitted, shall result automatically in the temporary 
suspension of processing of the application for discharge review until 
the requested records are sent to an appropriate location for copying, 
are copied, and are returned to the headquarters of the DRB. Processing 
of the application shall then be resumed at whatever stage of the 
discharge review process is practicable. Applicants are encouraged to 
submit any request for their military records before applying for 
discharge review rather than after submitting DD Form 293, to avoid 
delays in processing of applications and scheduling of reviews. 
Applicants and their counsel also may examine their military personnel 
records at the site of their scheduled review before the hearing. DRBs 
shall notify applicants of the dates the records are available for 
examination in their standard scheduling information.

[[Page 420]]

    (ii) If the DRB is not authorized to provide copies of documents 
that are under the cognizance of another government department, office, 
or activity, applications for such information must be made by the 
applicant to the cognizant authority. The DRB shall advise the applicant 
of the mailing address of the government department, office, or activity 
to which the request should be submitted.
    (iii) If the official records relevant to the discharge review are 
not available at the agency having custody of the records, the applicant 
shall be so notified and requested to provide such information and 
documents as may be desired in support of the request for discharge 
review. A period of not less than 30 days shall be allowed for such 
documents to be submitted. At the expiration of this period, the review 
may be conducted with information available to the DRB.
    (iv) A DRB may take steps to obtain additional evidence that is 
relevant to the discharge under consideration beyond that found in the 
official military records or submitted by the applicant, if a review of 
available evidence suggests that it would be incomplete without the 
additional information, or when the applicant presents testimony or 
documents that require additional information to evaluate properly. Such 
information shall be made available to the applicant, upon request, with 
appropriate modifications regarding classified material.
    (A) In any case heard on request of an applicant, the DRB shall 
provide the applicant and counsel or representative, if any, at a 
reasonable time before initiating the decision process, a notice of the 
availability of all regulations and documents to be considered in the 
discharge review, except for documents in the official personnel or 
medical records and any documents submitted by the applicant. The DRB 
shall also notify the applicant or counsel or representative:
    (1) Of the right to examine such documents or to be provided with 
copies of the documents upon request;
    (2) Of the date by which such requests must be received; and
    (3) Of the opportunity to respond within a reasonable period of time 
to be set by the DRB.
    (B) When necessary to acquaint the applicant with the substance of a 
classified document, the classifying authority, on the request of the 
DRB, shall prepare a summary of or an extract from the document, 
deleting all references to sources of information and other matters, the 
disclosure of which, in the opinion of the classifying authority, would 
be detrimental to the national security interests of the United States. 
Should preparation of such summary be deemed impracticable by the 
classifying authority, information from the classified sources shall not 
be considered by the DRB in its review of the case.
    (v) Regulations of a Military Department may be obtained at many 
installations under the jurisdiction of the Military Department 
concerned or by writing to the following address: DA Military Review 
Boards Agency, Attention: SFBA (Reading Room), room 1E520, Washington, 
DC 20310.
    (10) Recorder/Secretary or Assistant. Such a person shall be 
designated to assist in the functioning of each DRB in accordance with 
the procedures prescribed by the Secretary of the Military Department 
concerned.
    (11) Hearings. Hearings (including hearing examinations) that are 
conducted shall recognize the rights of the individual to privacy. 
Accordingly, presence at hearings of individuals other than those 
required shall be limited to persons authorized by the Secretary 
concerned or expressly requested by the applicant, subject to reasonable 
limitations based upon available space. If, in the opinion of the 
presiding officer, the presence of other individuals could be 
prejudicial to the interests of the applicant or the government, 
hearings may be held in closed session.
    (12) Evidence and testimony. (i) The DRB may consider any evidence 
obtained in accordance with this part.
    (ii) Formal rules of evidence shall not be applied in DRB 
proceedings. The presiding officer shall rule on matters

[[Page 421]]

of procedure and shall ensure that reasonable bounds of relevancy and 
materiality are maintained in the taking of evidence and presentation of 
witnesses.
    (iii) Applicants undergoing hearings shall be permitted to make 
sworn or unsworn statements, if they so desire, or to introduce 
witnesses, documents, or other information on their behalf, at no 
expense to the Department of Defense.
    (iv) Applicants may also make oral or written arguments personally 
or through counsel or representatives.
    (v) Applicants who present sworn or unsworn statements and witnesses 
may be questioned by the DRB. All testimony shall be taken under oath or 
affirmation unless the applicant specifically requests to make an 
unsworn statement.
    (vi) There is a presumption of regularity in the conduct of 
governmental affairs. This presumption can be applied in any review 
unless there is substantial credible evidence to rebut the presumption.
    (c) Decision process. (1) The DRB or the DRB panel, as appropriate, 
shall meet in plenary session to review discharges and exercise its 
discretion on a case-by-case basis in applying the standards set forth 
in Sec. 70.9.
    (2) The presiding officer is responsible for the conduct of the 
discharge review. The presiding officer shall convene, recess, and 
adjourn the DRB panel as appropriate and shall maintain an atmosphere of 
dignity and decorum at all times.
    (3) Each DRB member shall act under oath or affirmation requiring 
careful, objective consideration of the application. DRB members are 
responsible for eliciting all facts necessary for a full and fair 
hearing. They shall consider all information presented to them by the 
applicant. In addition, they shall consider available Military Service 
and health records, together with other records that may be in the files 
of the Military Department concerned and relevant to the issues before 
the DRB, and any other evidence obtained in accordance with this part.
    (4) The DRB shall identify and address issues after a review of the 
following material obtained and presented in accordance with this part 
and the implementing instructions of the DRB: Available official 
records, documentary evidence submitted by or on behalf of an applicant, 
presentation of a hearing examination, testimony by or on behalf of an 
applicant, oral or written arguments presented by or on behalf of an 
applicant, and any other relevant evidence.
    (5) If an applicant who has requested a hearing does not respond to 
a notification letter or does not appear for a scheduled hearing, the 
DRB may complete the review on the basis of material previously 
submitted.
    (6) Application of standards. (i) When a DRB determines that an 
applicant's discharge was improper (Sec. 70.9(b)), the DRB will 
determine which reason for discharge should have been assigned based 
upon the facts and circumstances before the discharge authority, 
including the Service regulations governing reasons for discharge at the 
time the applicant was discharged. Unless it is also determined that the 
discharge was inequitable (Sec. 70.9(c)), the provisions as to 
characterization in the regulation under which the applicant should have 
been discharged will be considered in determining whether further relief 
is warranted.
    (ii) When the DRB determines that an applicant's discharge was 
inequitable (see Sec. 70.9(c)), any change will be based on the 
evaluation of the applicant's overall record of service and relevant 
regulations of the Military Service of which the applicant was a member.
    (7) Voting shall be conducted in closed session, a majority of the 
five members' votes constituting the DRB decision. Voting procedures 
shall be prescribed by the Secretary of the Military Department 
concerned.
    (8) Details of closed session deliberations of a DRB are privileged 
information and shall not be divulged.
    (9) There is no requirement for a statement of minority views in the 
event of a split vote. The minority, however, may submit a brief 
statement of its views under procedures established by the Secretary 
concerned.
    (10) DRBs may request advisory opinions from staff officers of their 
Military Departments. These opinions are advisory in nature and are not 
binding

[[Page 422]]

on the DRB in its decision-making process.
    (11) The preliminary determinations required by 38 U.S.C. 3103(e) 
shall be made upon majority vote of the DRB concerned on an expedited 
basis. Such determination shall be based upon the standards set forth in 
Sec. 70.9 of this part.
    (12) The DRB shall: (i) Address items submitted as issues by the 
applicant under paragraph (d) of this section;
    (ii) Address decisional issues under paragraph (e) of this section; 
and
    (iii) Prepare a decisional document in accordance with paragraph (h) 
of this section.
    (d) Response to items submitted as issues by the applicant--(1) 
General guidance. (i) If an issue submitted by an applicant contains two 
or more clearly separate issues, the DRB should respond to each issue 
under the guidance of this paragraph as if it had been set forth 
separately by the applicant.
    (ii) If an applicant uses a ``building block'' approach (that is, 
setting forth a series of conclusions on issues that lead to a single 
conclusion purportedly warranting a change in the applicant's 
discharge), normally there should be a separate response to each issue.
    (iii) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the DRB from making a 
single response to multiple issues when such action would enhance the 
clarity of the decisional document, but such response must reflect an 
adequate response to each separate issue.
    (2) Decisional issues. An item submitted as an issue by an applicant 
in accordance with this part shall be addressed as a decisional issue 
under paragraph (e), in the following circumstances:
    (i) When the DRB decides that a change in discharge should be 
granted, and the DRB bases its decision in whole or in part on the 
applicant's issue; or
    (ii) When the DRB does not provide the applicant with the full 
change in discharge requested, and the decision is based in whole or in 
part on the DRB's disagreement on the merits with an issue submitted by 
the applicant.
    (3) Response to items not addressed as decisional issues. (i) If the 
applicant receives the full change in discharge requested (or a more 
favorable change), that fact shall be noted and the basis shall be 
addressed as a decisional issue. No further response is required to 
other issues submitted by the applicant.
    (ii) If the applicant does not receive the full change in discharge 
requested with respect to either the character of or reason for 
discharge (or both), the DRB shall address the items submitted by the 
applicant under paragraph (e) of this section (decisional issues) unless 
one of the following responses is applicable:
    (A) Duplicate issues. The DRB may state that there is a full 
response to the issue submitted by the applicant under a specified 
decisional issue. This response may be used only when one issue clearly 
duplicates another or the issue clearly requires discussion in 
conjunction with another issue.
    (B) Citations without principles and facts. The DRB may state that 
the applicant's issue, which consists of a citation to a decision 
without setting forth any principles and facts from the decision that 
the applicant states are relevant to the applicant's case, does not 
comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(4)(iv)(A).
    (C) Unclear issues. The DRB may state that it cannot respond to an 
item submitted by the applicant as an issue because the meaning of the 
item is unclear. An issue is unclear if it cannot be understood by a 
reasonable person familiar with the discharge review process after a 
review of the materials considered under paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section.
    (D) Nonspecific issues. The DRB may state that it cannot respond to 
an item submitted by the applicant as an issue because it is not 
specific. A submission is considered not specific if a reasonable person 
familiar with the discharge review process after a review of the 
materials considered under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, cannot 
determine the relationship between the applicant's submission and the 
particular circumstances of the case. This response may be used only if 
the submission is expressed in such general terms that no other response 
is applicable. For example, if the DRB disagrees with the applicant as 
to the relevance of matters set forth in the submission,

[[Page 423]]

the DRB normally will set forth the nature of the disagreement under the 
guidance in paragraph (e) of this section, with respect to decisional 
issues, or it will reject the applicant's position on the basis of 
paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(A) or (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section. If the 
applicant's submission is so general that none of those provisions is 
applicable, then the DRB may state that it cannot respond because the 
item is not specific.
    (e) Decisional issues. (1) General. Under the guidance in this 
section, the decisional document shall discuss the issues that provide a 
basis for the decision whether there should be a change in the character 
of or reason for discharge. In order to enhance clarity, the DRB should 
not address matters other than issues relied upon in the decision or 
raised by the applicant.
    (i) Partial change. When the decision changes a discharge, but does 
not provide the applicant with the full change in discharge requested, 
the decisional document shall address both the issues upon which change 
is granted and the issues upon which the DRB denies the full change 
requested.
    (ii) Relationship of issue to character of or reason for discharge. 
Generally, the decisional document should specify whether a decisional 
issue applies to the character of or reason for discharge (or both), but 
it is not required to do so.
    (iii) Relationship of an issue to propriety or equity. (A) If an 
applicant identifies an issue as pertaining to both propriety and 
equity, the DRB will consider it under both standards.
    (B) If an applicant identifies an issue as pertaining to the 
propriety of the discharge (for example, by citing a propriety standard 
or otherwise claiming that a change in discharge is required as a matter 
of law), the DRB shall consider the issue solely as a matter of 
propriety. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(iii)(D) of this 
section, the DRB is not required to consider such an issue under the 
equity standards.
    (C) If the applicant's issue contends that the DRB is required as a 
matter of law to follow a prior decision by setting forth an issue of 
propriety from the prior decision and describing its relationship to the 
applicant's case, the issue shall be considered under the propriety 
standards and addressed under paragraph (e)(2) or (e)(3) of this 
section.
    (D) If the applicant's issue sets forth principles of equity 
contained in a prior DRB decision, describes the relationship to the 
applicant's case, and contends that the DRB is required as a matter of 
law to follow the prior case, the decisional document shall note that 
the DRB is not bound by its discretionary decisions in prior cases under 
the standards in Sec. 70.9. However, the principles cited by the 
applicant, and the description of the relationship of the principles to 
the applicant's case, shall be considered under the equity standards and 
addressed under paragraph (e)(5) or (e)(6) of this section.
    (E) If the applicant's issue cannot be identified as a matter of 
propriety or equity, the DRB shall address it as an issue of equity.
    (2) Change of discharge: issues of propriety. If a change in the 
discharge is warranted under the propriety standards in Sec. 70.9 the 
decisional document shall state that conclusion and list the errors of 
expressly retroactive changes in policy that provide a basis for the 
conclusion. The decisional document shall cite the facts in the record 
that demonstrate the relevance of the error or change in policy to the 
applicant's case. If the change in discharge does not constitute the 
full change requested by the applicant, the reasons for not granting the 
full change shall be addressed under the guidance in paragraph (e)((3) 
or (e)(6) of this section.
    (3) Denial of the full change requested: issues of propriety. (i) If 
the decision rejects the applicant's position on an issue of propriety, 
or if it is otherwise decided on the basis of an issue of propriety that 
the full change in discharge requested by the applicant is not 
warranted, the decisional document shall note that conclusion.
    (ii) The decisional document shall list reasons for its conclusion 
on each issue of propriety under the following guidance:
    (A) If a reason is based in whole or in part upon a regulation, 
statute, constitutional provision, judicial determination, or other 
source of law, the DRB shall cite the pertinent source of

[[Page 424]]

law and the facts in the record that demonstrate the relevance of the 
source of law to the particular circumstances in the case.
    (B) If a reason is based in whole or in part on a determination as 
to the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an event or circumstance, 
including a factor required by applicable Service regulations to be 
considered for determination of the character of and reason for the 
applicant's discharge, the DRB shall make a finding of fact for each 
such event or circumstance.
    (1) For each such finding, the decisional document shall list the 
specific source of the information relied upon. This may include the 
presumption of regularity in appropriate cases. If the information is 
listed in the service record section of the decisional document, a 
citation is not required.
    (2) If a finding of fact is made after consideration of 
contradictory evidence in the record (including information cited by the 
applicant or otherwise identified by members of the DRB), the decisional 
document shall set forth the conflicting evidence and explain why the 
information relied upon was more persuasive than the information that 
was rejected. If the presumption of regularity is cited as the basis for 
rejecting such information, the decisional document shall set forth the 
basis for relying on the presumption of regularity and explain why the 
contradictory evidence was insufficient to overcome the presumption. In 
an appropriate case, the explanation as to why the contradictory 
evidence was insufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity may 
consist of a statement that the applicant failed to provide sufficient 
corroborating evidence, or that the DRB did not find the applicant's 
testimony to be sufficiently credible to overcome the presumption.
    (C) If the DRB disagrees with the position of the applicant on an 
issue of propriety, the following guidance applies in addition to the 
guidance in paragraphs (e)(3)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section:
    (1) The DRB may reject the applicant's position by explaining why it 
disagrees with the principles set forth in the applicant's issue 
(including principles derived from cases cited by the applicant in 
accordance with paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section).
    (2) The DRB may reject the applicant's position by explaining why 
the principles set forth in the applicant's issue (including principles 
derived from cases cited by the applicant in accordance with paragraph 
(a)(4)(iv) of this section) are not relevant to the applicant's case.
    (3) The DRB may reject an applicant's position by stating that the 
applicant's issue of propriety is not a matter upon which the DRB grants 
a change in discharge, and by providing an explanation for this 
position. When the applicant indicates that the issue is to be 
considered in conjunction with one or more other specified issues, the 
explanation will address all such specified issues.
    (4) The DRB may reject the applicant's position on the grounds that 
other specified factors in the case preclude granting relief, regardless 
of whether the DRB agreed with the applicant's position.
    (5) If the applicant takes the position that the discharge must be 
changed because of an alleged error in a record associated with the 
discharge, and the record has not been corrected by the organization 
with primary responsibility for corrective action, the DRB may respond 
that it will presume the validity of the record in the absence of such 
corrective action. If the organization empowered to correct the record 
is within the Department of Defense, the DRB should provide the 
applicant with a brief description of the procedures for requesting 
correction of the record. If the DRB on its own motion cites this issue 
as a decisional issue on the basis of equity, it shall address the issue 
under paragraph (d)(5) or (d)(6) of this section.
    (6) When an applicant's issue contains a general allegation that a 
certain course of action violated his or her constitutional rights, the 
DRB may respond in appropriate cases by noting that the action was 
consistent with statutory or regulatory authority, and by citing the 
presumption of constitutionality that attaches to statutes and 
regulations. If, on the other hand, the applicant makes a specific 
challenge to the constitutionality of the action by

[[Page 425]]

challenging the application of a statute or regulation in a particular 
set of circumstances, it is not sufficient to respond solely by citing 
the presumption of constitutionality of the statute or regulation when 
the applicant is not challenging the constitutionality of the statute or 
regulation. Instead, the response must address the specific 
circumstances of the case.
    (4) Denial of the full change in discharge requested when propriety 
is not at issue. If the applicant has not submitted an issue of 
propriety and the DRB has not otherwise relied upon an issue of 
propriety to change the discharge, the decisional document shall contain 
a statement to that effect. The DRB is not required to provide any 
further discussion as to the propriety of the discharge.
    (5) Change of discharge: issues of equity. If the DRB concludes that 
a change in the discharge is warranted under the equity standards in 
Sec. 70.9 the decisional document shall list each issue of equity upon 
which this conclusion is based. The DRB shall cite the facts in the 
record that demonstrate the relevance of the issue to the applicant's 
case. If the change in discharge does not constitute the full change 
requested by the applicant, the reasons for not giving the full change 
requested shall be discussed under the guidance in paragraph (e)(6) of 
this section.
    (6) Denial of the full change in discharge requested: issues of 
equity. (i) If the DRB rejects the applicant's position on an issue of 
equity, or if the decision otherwise provides less than the full change 
in discharge requested by the applicant, the decisional document shall 
note that conclusion.
    (ii) The DRB shall list reasons for its conclusion on each issue of 
equity under the following guidance:
    (A) If a reason is based in whole or in part upon a regulation, 
statute, constitutional provision, judicial determination, or other 
source of law, the DRB shall cite the pertinent source of law and the 
facts in the record that demonstrate the relevance of the source of law 
to the exercise of discretion on the issue of equity in the applicant's 
case.
    (B) If a reason is based in whole or in part on a determination as 
to the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an event or circumstance, 
including a factor required by applicable Service regulations to be 
considered for determination of the character of and reason for the 
applicant's discharge, the DRB shall make a finding of fact for each 
such event or circumstance.
    (1) For each such finding, the decisional document shall list the 
specific source of the information relied upon. This may include the 
presumption of regularity in appropriate cases. If the information is 
listed in the service record section of the decisional document, a 
citation is not required.
    (2) If a finding of fact is made after consideration of 
contradictory evidence in the record (including information cited by the 
applicant or otherwise identified by members of the DRB), the decisional 
document shall set forth the conflicting evidence and explain why the 
information relied upon was more persuasive than the information that 
was rejected. If the presumption of regularity is cited as the basis for 
rejecting such information, the decisional document shall set forth the 
basis for relying on the presumption of regularity and explain why the 
contradictory evidence was insufficient to overcome the presumption. In 
an appropriate case, the explanation as to why the contradictory 
evidence was insufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity may 
consist of a statement that the applicant failed to provide sufficient 
corroborating evidence, or that the DRB did not find the applicant's 
testimony to be sufficiently credible to overcome the presumption.
    (C) If the DRB disagrees with the position of the applicant on an 
issue of equity, the following guidance applies in addition to the 
guidance in paragraphs (e)(6)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section:
    (1) The DRB may reject the applicant's position by explaining why it 
disagrees with the principles set forth in the applicant's issue 
(including principles derived from cases cited by the applicant in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section).
    (2) The DRB may reject the applicant's position by explaining why 
the principles set forth in the applicant's issue (including principles 
derived from

[[Page 426]]

cases cited by the applicant) are not relevant to the applicant's case.
    (3) The DRB may reject an applicant's position by explaining why the 
applicant's issue is not a matter upon which the DRB grants a change in 
discharge as a matter of equity. When the applicant indicates that the 
issue is to be considered in conjunction with other specified issues, 
the explanation will address all such specified issues.
    (4) The DRB may reject the applicant's position on the grounds that 
other specified factors in the case preclude granting relief, regardless 
of whether the DRB agreed with the applicant's position.
    (5) If the applicant takes the position that the discharge should be 
changed as a matter of equity because of an alleged error in a record 
associated with the discharge, and the record has not been corrected by 
the organization with primary responsibility for corrective action, the 
DRB may respond that it will presume the validity of the record in the 
absence of such corrective action. However, the DRB will consider 
whether it should exercise its equitable powers to change the discharge 
on the basis of the alleged error. If it declines to do so, it shall 
explain why the applicant's position did not provide a sufficient basis 
for the change in the discharge requested by the applicant.
    (D) When the DRB concludes that aggravating factors outweigh 
mitigating factors, the DRB must set forth reasons such as the 
seriousness of the offense, specific circumstances surrounding the 
offense, number of offenses, lack of mitigating circumstances, or 
similar factors. The DRB is not required, however, to explain why it 
relied on any such factors unless the applicability or weight of such a 
factor is expressly raised as an issue by the applicant.
    (E) If the applicant has not submitted any issues and the DRB has 
not otherwise relied upon an issue of equity for a change in discharge, 
the decisional document shall contain a statement to that effect, and 
shall note that the major factors upon which the discharge was based are 
set forth in the service record portion of the decisional document.
    (f) The recommendation of the DRB President--(1) General. The 
president of the DRB may forward cases for consideration by the 
Secretarial Reviewing Authority (SRA) under rules established by the 
Secretary concerned. There is no requirement that the President submit a 
recommendation when a case is forwarded to the SRA. If the president 
makes a recommendation with respect to the character of or reason for 
discharge, however, the recommendation shall be prepared under the 
guidance in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
    (2) Format for recommendation. If a recommendation is provided, it 
shall contain the president's views whether there should be a change in 
the character of or reason for discharge (or both). If the president 
recommends such a change, the particular change to be made shall be 
specified. The recommendation shall set forth the president's position 
on decisional issues and issues submitted by the applicant under the 
following guidance:
    (i) Adoption of the DRB's decisional document. The recommendation 
may state that the president has adopted the decisional document 
prepared by the majority. The president shall ensure that the decisional 
document meets the requirements of this section.
    (ii) Adoption of the specific statements from the majority. If the 
President adopts the views of the majority only in part, the 
recommendation shall cite the specific matter adopted from the majority. 
If the president modifies a statement submitted by the majority, the 
recommendation shall set forth the modification.
    (iii) Response to issues not included in matter adopted from the 
majority. The recommendation shall set forth the following if not 
adopted in whole or in part from the majority:
    (A) The issues on which the president's recommendation is based. 
Each such decisional issue shall be addressed by the president under 
paragraph (e) of this section,
    (B) The president's response to items submitted as issues by the 
applicant under paragraph (d) of this section.
    (C) Reasons for rejecting the conclusions of the majority with 
respect to decisional issues which, if resolved in

[[Page 427]]

the applicant's favor, would have resulted in greater relief for the 
applicant than that afforded by the president's recommendation. Suh 
issues shall be addressed under the principles in paragraph (e) of this 
section.
    (g) Secretarial reviewing authority (SRA)--(1) Review by the SRA. 
The Secretarial Reviewing Authority (SRA) is the Secretary concerned or 
the official to whom Secretary's discharge review authority has been 
delegated.
    (i) The SRA may review the following types of cases before issuance 
of the final notification of a decision:
    (A) Any specific case in which the SRA has an interest.
    (B) Any specific case that the president of the DRB believes is of 
significant interest to the SRA.
    (ii) Cases reviewed by the SRA shall be considered under the 
standards set forth in Sec. 70.9.
    (2) Processing the decisional document. (i) The decisional document 
shall be transmitted by the DRB president under paragraph (e) of this 
section.
    (ii) The following guidance applies to cases that have been 
forwarded to the SRA except for cases reviewed on the DRB's own motion 
without the participation of the applicant or the applicant's counsel:
    (A) The applicant and counsel or representative, if any, shall be 
provided with a copy of the proposed decisional document, including the 
DRB president's recommendation to the SRA, if any. Classified 
information shall be summarized.
    (B) The applicant shall be provided with a reasonable period of 
time, but not less than 25 days, to submit to the SRA a rebuttal. An 
issue in rebuttal consists of a clear and specific statement by the 
applicant in support of or in opposition to the statements of the DRB or 
DRB president on decisional issues and other clear and specific issues 
that were submitted by the applicant in accordance with paragraph 
(a)(4)(i) of this section. The rebuttal shall be based solely on matters 
in the record before when the DRB closed the case for deliberation or in 
the president's recommendation.
    (3) Review of the decisional document. If corrections in the 
decisional document are required, the decisional document shall be 
returned to the DRB for corrective action. The corrected decisional 
document shall be sent to the applicant (and counsel, if any), but a 
further opportunity for rebuttal is not required unless the correction 
produces a different result or includes a substantial change in the 
discussion by the DRB (or DRB president) of the issues raised by the 
majority or the applicant.
    (4) The Addendum of the SRA. The decision of the SRA shall be in 
writing and shall be appended as an addendum to the decisional document 
under the guidance in this subsection.
    (i) The SRA's decision. The addendum shall set forth the SRA's 
decision whether there will be a change in the character of or reason 
for discharge (or both); if the SRA concludes that a change is 
warranted, the particular change to be made shall be specified. If the 
SRA adopts the decision recommended by the DRB or the DRB president, the 
decisional document shall contain a reference to the matter adopted.
    (ii) Discussion of issues. In support of the SRA's decision, the 
addendum shall set forth the SRA's position on decisional issues, items 
submitted as issues by an applicant in accordance with paragraph 
(a)(4)(i) of this section, and issues raised by the DRB and the DRB 
president in accordance with the following guidance:
    (A) Adoption of the DRB president's recommendation. The addendum may 
state that the SRA has adopted the DRB president's recommendation.
    (B) Adoption of the DRB's proposed decisional document. The addendum 
may state that the SRA has adopted the proposed decisional document 
prepared by the DRB.
    (C) Adoption of specific statements from the majority or the DRB 
president. If the SRA adopts the views of the DRB or the DRB president 
only in part, the addendum shall cite the specific statements adopted. 
If the SRA modifies a statement submitted by the DRB or the DRB 
president, the addendum shall set forth the modification.
    (D) Response to issues not included in matter adopted from the DRB 
or the DRB president. The addendum shall set forth the following if not 
adopted in whole or

[[Page 428]]

in part from the DRB or the DRB president:
    (1) A list of the issues on which the SRA's decision is based. Each 
such decisional issue shall be addressed by the SRA under paragraph (e) 
of this section. This includes reasons for rejecting the conclusion of 
the DRB or the DRB president with respect to decisional issues which, if 
resolved in the applicant's favor, would have resulted in change to the 
discharge more favorable to the applicant than that afforded by the 
SRA's decision. Such issues shall be addressed under the principles in 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) The SRA's response to items submitted as issues by the applicant 
under paragraph (d) of this section.
    (iii) Response to the rebuttal. (A) If the SRA grants the full 
change in discharge requested by the applicant (or a more favorable 
change), that fact shall be noted, the decisional issues shall be 
addressed under paragraph (e) of this section, and no further response 
to the rebuttal is required.
    (B) If the SRA does not grant the full change in discharge requested 
by the applicant (or a more favorable change), the addendum shall list 
each issue in rebuttal submitted by an applicant in accordance with this 
section, and shall set forth the response of the SRA under the following 
guidance:
    (1) If the SRA rejects an issue in rebuttal, the SRA may respond in 
accordance with the principles in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) If the matter adopted by the SRA provides a basis for the SRA's 
rejection of the rebuttal material, the SRA may note that fact and cite 
the specific matter adopted that responds to the issue in rebuttal.
    (3) If the matter submitted by the applicant does not meet the 
requirements for rebuttal material in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this 
section.
    (iv) Index entries. Appropriate index entries shall be prepared for 
the SRA's actions for matters that are not adopted from the DRB's 
proposed decisional document.

    (k) Final disposition of the Record of Proceedings. The original 
record of proceedings and all appendices thereto shall in all cases be 
incorporated in the Military Service record of the applicant and the 
Military Service record shall be returned to the custody of the 
appropriate records holding facility. If a portion of the original 
record of the proceedings cannot be stored with the Military Service 
record, the Military Service record shall contain a notation as to the 
place where the record is stored. Other copies shall be filed and 
disposed of in accordance with appropriate Military Service regulations.
    (l) Availability of Discharge Review Board documents for inspection 
and copying. (1) A copy of the decisional document prepared in 
accordance with paragraph (d) of this section shall be made available 
for public inspection and copying promptly after a notice of final 
decision is sent to the applicant.
    (2) To prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, 
identifying details of the applicant and other persons will be deleted 
from documents made available for public inspection and copying.
    (i) Names, addresses, social security numbers, and Military Service 
numbers must be deleted. Written justification shall be made for all 
other deletions and shall be available for public inspection.
    (ii) Each DRB shall ensure that there is a means for relating a 
decisional document number to the name of the applicant to permit 
retrieval of the applicant's records when required in processing a 
complaint under Sec. 70.10.
    (3) Any other privileged or classified material contained in or 
appended to any documents required by this part to be furnished the 
applicant and counsel or representative or made available for public 
inspection and copying may be deleted therefrom only if a written 
statement of the basis for the deletions is provided the applicant and 
counsel or representative and made available for public inspection. It 
is not intended that the statement be so detailed as to reveal the 
nature of the withheld material.
    (4) DRB documents made available for public inspection and copying 
shall be located in the Armed Forces Discharge Review/Correction Board 
Reading Room. The documents shall be indexed in a usable and concise 
form so as to enable the public, and those who represent applicants 
before the DRBs, to isolate from all these decisions that are indexed, 
those cases that may be similar to an applicant's case and that indicate 
the circumstances under or reasons for (or both) which the DRB or the 
Secretary concerned granted or denied relief.
    (i) The reading file index shall include, in addition to any other 
items determined by the DRB, the case number, the date, character of, 
reason and authority for the discharge. It shall also include the 
decisions of the DRB and reviewing authority, if any, and the issues 
addressed in the statement of findings, conclusions, and reasons.
    (ii) The index shall be maintained at selected permanent locations 
throughout the United States. This ensures reasonable availability to 
applicants at least 30 days before a traveling panel review. A list of 
these locations shall be published in the Federal Register by the 
Department of the Army. The index shall also be made available at sites 
selected for traveling panels or hearing examinations for such periods 
as the DRB or a hearing examiner is present and in operation. An 
applicant who has requested a traveling panel review or a hearing 
examination shall be advised in the notice of such review of the 
permanent index locations.
    (iii) The Armed Forces Discharge Review/Correction Board Reading 
Room shall publish indexes quarterly for all DRBs. All DRBs shall be 
responsible for timely submission to the Reading Room of individual case 
information required for update of the indexes. In addition, all DRBs 
shall be responsible for submission of new index categories based upon 
published changes in policy, procedures, or standards. These indexes 
shall be available for public inspection or purchase (or both) at the 
Reading Room. When the DRB has accepted an application, information 
concerning the availability of the index shall be provided in the DRB's 
response to the application.
    (iv) Copies of decisional documents will be provided to individuals 
or organizations outside the NCR in response

[[Page 431]]

to written requests for such documents. Although the Reading Room shall 
try to make timely responses to such requests, certain factors such as 
the length of a request, the volume of other pending requests, and the 
impact of other responsibilities of the staff assigned to such duties 
may cause some delays. A fee may be charged for such documents under 
appropriate DoD and Department of the Army directives and regulations. 
The manual that accompanies the index of decisions shall notify the 
public that if an applicant indicates that a review is scheduled for a 
specific date, an effort will be made to provide requested decisional 
documents before that date. The individual or organization will be 
advised if that cannot be accomplished.
    (v) Correspondence relating to matters under the cognizance of the 
Reading Room (including requests for purchase of indexes) shall be 
addressed to: DA Military Review Boards Agency, Attention: SFBA (Reading 
Room), Room 1E520, The Pentagon, Washington, DC 20310.
    (m) Privacy Act information. Information protected under the Privacy 
Act is involved in the discharge review functions. The provisions of 
part 286a of this title shall be observed throughout the processing of a 
request for review of discharge or dismissal.
    (n) Information requirement. Each Military Department shall provide 
the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Military Personnel and Force 
Management) DASD (MP&FM), Office of the ASD (MRA&L), with a semiannual 
report of discharge review actions in accordance with Sec. 70.11.

<R05>
Sec. 70.9  Discharge review standards.

    (a) Objective of review. The objective of a discharge review is to 
examine the propriety and equity of the applicant's discharge and to 
effect changes, if necessary. The standards of review and the underlying 
factors that aid in determining whether the standards are met shall be 
historically consistent with criteria for determining honorable service. 
No factors shall be established that require automatic change or denial 
of a change in discharge. Neither a DRB nor the Secretary of the 
Military Department concerned shall be bound by any methodology of 
weighting of the factors in reaching a determination. In each case, the 
DRB or the Secretary of the Military Department concerned shall give 
full, fair, and impartial considerations to all applicable factors 
before reaching a decision. An applicant may not rceive a less favorable 
discharge than that issued at the time of separation. This does not 
preclude correction of clerical errors.
    (b) Propriety. (1) A discharge shall be deemed proper unless, in the 
course of discharge review, it is determined that:
    (i) There exists an error of fact, law, procedure, or discretion 
associated with the discharge at the time of issuance; and that the 
rights of the applicant were prejudiced thereby (such error shall 
constitute prejudicial error if there is substantial doubt that the 
discharge would have remained the same if the error had not been made); 
or
    (ii) A change in policy by the Military Service of which the 
applicant was a member, made expressly retroactive to the type of 
discharge under consideration, requires a change in the discharge.
    (2) When a record associated with the discharge at the time of 
issuance involves a matter in which the primary responsibility for 
corrective action rests with another organization (for example, another 
Board, agency, or court), the DRB will recognize an error only to the 
extent that the error has been corrected by the organization with 
primary responsibility for correcting the record.
    (3) The primary function of the DRB is to exercise its discretion on 
issues of equity by reviewing the individual merits of each application 
on a case-by-case basis. Prior decisions in which the DRB exercised its 
discretion to change a discharge based on issues of equity (including 
the factors cited in such decisions or the weight given to factors in 
such decisions) do not bind the DRB in its review of subsequent cases 
because no two cases present the same issues of equity.

[[Page 432]]

    (4) The following applies to applicants who received less than fully 
Honorable administrative discharges because of their civilian misconduct 
while in an inactive reserve component and who were discharged or had 
their discharge reviewed on or after April 20, 1971: the DRB shall 
either recharacterize the discharge to Honorable without any additional 
proceedings or additional proceedings shall be conducted in accordance 
with the Court's Order of December 3, 1981, in Wood v. Secretary of 
Defense to determine whether proper grounds exist for the issuance of a 
less than Honorable discharge, taking into account that;
    (i) An Other than Honorable (formerly undesirable) Discharge for an 
inactive reservist can only be based upon civilian misconduct found to 
have affected directly the performance of military duties;
    (ii) A General Discharge for an inactive reservist can only be based 
upon civilian misconduct found to have had an adverse impact on the 
overall effectiveness of the military, including military morale and 
efficiency.
    (c) Equity. A discharge shall be deemed to be equitable unless:
    (1) In the course of a discharge review, it is determined that the 
policies and procedures under which the applicant was discharged differ 
in material respects from policies and procedures currently applicable 
on a Service-wide basis to discharges of the type under consideration 
provided that:
    (i) Current policies or procedures represent a substantial 
enhancement of the rights afforded a respondent in such proceedings; and
    (ii) There is substantial doubt that the applicant would have 
received the same discharge if relevant current policies and procedures 
had been available to the applicant at the time of the discharge 
proceedings under consideration.
    (2) At the time of issuance, the discharge was inconsistent with 
standards of discipline in the Military Service of which the applicant 
was a member.
    (3) In the course of a discharge review, it is determined that 
relief is warranted based upon consideration of the applicant's service 
record and other evidence presented to the DRB viewed in conjunction 
with the factors listed in this section and the regulations under which 
the applicant was discharged, even though the discharge was determined 
to have been otherwise equitable and proper at the time of issuance. 
Areas of consideration include, but are not limited to:
    (i) Quality of service, as evidenced by factors such as:
    (A) Service history, including date of enlistment, period of 
enlistment, highest rank achieved, conduct or efficiency ratings 
(numerical or narrative);
    (B) Awards and decorations;
    (C) Letters of commendation or reprimand;
    (D) Combat service;
    (E) Wounds received in action;
    (F) Records of promotions and demotions;
    (G) Level of responsibility at which the applicant served;
    (H) Other acts of merit that may not have resulted in a formal 
recognition through an award or commendation;
    (I) Length of service during the service period which is the subject 
of the discharge review;
    (J) Prior military service and type of discharge received or 
outstanding postservice conduct to the extent that such matters provide 
a basis for a more thorough understanding of the performance of the 
applicant during the period of service which is the subject of the 
discharge review;
    (K) Convictions by court-martial;
    (L) Records of nonjudicial punishment;
    (M) Convictions by civil authorities while a member of the Service, 
reflected in the discharge proceedings or otherwise noted in military 
service records;
    (N) Records of periods of unauthorized absence;
    (O) Records relating to a discharge instead of court-martial.
    (ii) Capability to serve, as evidenced by factors such as:
    (A) Total capabilities. This includes an evaluation of matters, such 
as age, educational level, and aptitude scores. Consideration may also 
be given whether the individual met normal military standards of 
acceptability for military service and similar indicators

[[Page 433]]

of an individual's ability to serve satisfactorily, as well as ability 
to adjust to military service.
    (B) Family and Personal Problems. This includes matters in 
extenuation or mitigation of the reason for discharge that may have 
affected the applicant's ability to serve satisfactorily.
    (C) Arbitrary or capricious action. This includes actions by 
individuals in authority that constitute a clear abuse of such authority 
and that, although not amounting to prejudicial error, may have 
contributed to the decision to discharge or to the characterization of 
service.
    (D) Discrimination. This includes unauthorized acts as documented by 
records or other evidence.

Sec. 70.10  Complaints concerning decisional documents and index entries.

    (a) General. (1) The procedures in this section--are established for 
the sole purpose of ensuring that decisional documents and index entries 
issued by the DRBs of the Military Departments comply with the 
decisional document and index entry principles of this part.
    (2) This section may be modified or supplemented by the DASD(MP&FM).
    (3) The following persons may submit complaints:
    (i) A former member of the Armed Forces (or the former member's 
counsel) with respect to the decisional document issued in the former 
member's own case; and
    (ii) A former member of the Armed Forces (or the former member's 
counsel) who states that correction of the decisional document will 
assist the former member in preparing for an administrative or judicial 
proceeding in which the former member's own discharge will be at issue.
    (4) The Department of Defense is committed to processing of 
complaints within the priorities and processing goals set forth in 
paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section. This commitment, however, is 
conditioned upon reasonable use of the complaint process under the 
following considerations. The DRBs were established for the benefit of 
former members of the Armed Forces. The complaint process can aid such 
persons most effectively if it is used by former members of the Armed 
Forces when necessary to obtain correction of their own decisional 
documents or to prepare for discharge reviews. If a substantial number 
of complaints submitted by others interferes with the ability of the 
DRBs to process applications for discharge review in a timely fashion, 
the Department of Defense will adjust the processing goals to ensure 
that the system operates to the primary advantage of applicants.
    (5) The DASD(MP&FM) is the final authority with respect to action on 
such correspondence.
    (b) The Joint Service Review Activity (JSRA). A three member JSRA 
consisting of one judge advocate from each Military Department shall 
advise the DASD(MP&FM). The operations of the JSRA shall be coordinated 
by a full-time administrative director, who shall serve as recorder 
during meetings of the JSRA. The members and the administrative director 
shall serve at the direction of the DASD(MP&FM).
    (c) Classification and control of correspondence--(1) Address of the 
JSRA. Correspondence with the OSD concerning decisional documents or 
index entries issued by the DRBs shall be addressed as follows: Joint 
Service Review Activity, OASD(MRA&L) (MP&FM), Washington, DC 20301.
    (2) Docketing. All such correspondence shall be controlled by the 
administrative director through the use of a uniform docketing 
procedure.
    (3) Classification. Correspondence shall be reviewed by the 
administrative director and categorized either as a complaint or an 
inquiry in accordance with the following:
    (i) Complaints. A complaint is any correspondence in which it is 
alleged that a decisional document issued by a DRB or SRA contains a 
specifically identified violation of the Stipulation of Dismissal, 
Settlement Agreement, or related Orders in the Urban Law case or the 
decisional document or index entry principles of this Directive. A 
complainant who alleges error with respect to a decisional document 
issued to another person is encouraged to set forth specifically the 
grounds for determining that a reasonable person familiar with the 
discharge review process

[[Page 434]]

cannot understand the basis for the decision. See paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B) 
of this section.
    (ii) Inquiries. An inquiry is any correspondence other than a 
complaint.
    (d) Review of complaints. (1) Guidance. The following guidance 
applies to review of complaints:
    (i) Standards. Complaints shall be considered under the following 
standards:
    (A) The applicant's case. A complaint by an applicant with respect 
to the decisional document issued in the applicant's own discharge 
review shall be considered under the Stipulation of Dismissal in the 
Urban Law case and other decisional document requirements applicable at 
the time the document was issued, including those contained in the 
Settlement Agreement and related Orders, subject to any limitations set 
forth therein with respect to dates of applicability. If the authority 
empowered to take corrective action has a reasonable doubt whether a 
decisional document meets applicable requirements of the Urban Law case 
or other applicable rules, the complaint shall be resolved in the 
applicant's favor.
    (B) Other cases. With respect to all other complaints, the standard 
shall be whether a reasonable person familiar with the discharge review 
process can understand the basis for the decision, including the 
disposition of issues raised by the applicant. This standard is designed 
to ensure that the complaint process is not burdened with the need to 
correct minor errors in the preparation of decisional documents.
    (ii) Use of DD Form 293. With respect to any decisional document 
issued on or after November 27, 1982, a complaint alleging failure of 
the DRB to address adequately matter not submitted on DD Form 293 or 
expressly incorporated therein will be resolved in the complainant's 
favor only if the failure to address the issue was arbitrary, 
capricious, or an abuse of discretion.
    (iii) Scope of review. When a complaint concerns a specific issue in 
the applicant's own discharge review, the complaint review process shall 
involve a review of all the evidence that was before the DRB or SRA, 
including the testimony and written submissions of the applicant, to 
determine whether the issue was submitted, and if so, whether it was 
addressed adequately with respect to the Stipulation of Dismissal, 
Settlement Agreement, or related Orders in the Urban Law case and other 
applicable provisions of this Directive. With respect to all other 
complaints about specific issues, the complaint review process may be 
based solely on the decisional document, except when the complainant 
demonstrates that facts present in the review in question raise a 
reasonable likelihood of a violation of applicable provisions of the 
Stipulation of Dismissal and a reasonable person, familiar with the 
discharge review process, could resolve the complaint only after a 
review of the evidence that was before the DRB.
    (iv) Allegations pertaining to an applicant's submission. The 
following additional requirements apply to complaints about modification 
of an applicant's issue or the failure to list or address an applicant's 
issue:
    (A) When the complaint is submitted by the applicant, and the record 
of the hearing is ambiguous on the question whether there was a meeting 
of minds between the applicant and the DRB as to modification or 
omission of the issue, the ambiguity will be resolved in favor of the 
applicant.
    (B) When the complaint is submitted by a person other than the 
applicant, it must set forth facts (other than the mere omission or 
modification of an issue) demonstrating a reasonable likelihood that the 
issue was omitted or modified without the applicant's consent.
    (C) When the complaint is rejected on the basis of the presumption 
of regularity, the response to the complaint must be set forth the 
reasons why the evidence submitted by the complainant was not sufficient 
to overcome the presumption.
    (D) With respect to decisional documents issued on or after the 
effective date of the amendments to Sec. 70.8, any change in wording of 
an applicant's issue which is effected in violation of the principles 
set forth in Sec. 70.8(a)(5)(iii) constitutes an error requiring 
corrective action. With respect to a decisional document issued before

[[Page 435]]

that date, corrective action will be taken only when there has been a 
complaint by the applicant or counsel with respect to the applicant's 
own decisional document and it is determined that the wording was 
changed or the issue was omitted without the applicant's consent.
    (E) If there are references in the decisional document to matters 
not raised by the applicant and not otherwise relied upon in the 
decision, there is no requirement under the Urban Law case that such 
matters be accompanied by a statement of findings, conclusions, or 
reasons. For example, when the DRB discusses an aspect of the service 
record not raised as an issue by the applicant, and the issue is not a 
basis for the DRB's decision, the DRB is not required to discuss the 
reasons for declining to list that aspect of the service record as an 
issue.
    (v) Guidance as to other types of complaints. The following guidance 
governs other specified types of complaints:
    (A) The Stipulation of Dismissal requires only that those facts that 
are essential to the decision be listed in the decisional document. The 
requirement for listing specified facts from the military record was not 
established until March 29, 1978, in 32 CFR part 70 Decisional documents 
issued prior to that date are sufficient if they meet the requirements 
of the Stipulation.
    (B) When an applicant submits a brief that contains material in 
support of a proposed conclusion on an issue, the DRB is not required to 
address each aspect of the supporting material in the brief. However, 
the decisional document should permit the applicant to understand the 
DRB's position on the issue and provide reviewing authorities with an 
explanation that is sufficient to permit review of the DRB's decision. 
When an applicant submits specific issues and later makes a statement 
before the DRB that contains matter in support of that issue, it is not 
necessary to list such supporting matter as a separate issue.
    (C) For all decisional documents issued before November 27, 1982, 
failure to respond to an issue raised by an applicant constitutes error 
unless it reasonably may be inferred from the record that the DRB 
response relied on one of the exceptions listed in Sec. 70.8(d)(3)(ii); 
(e)(3)(ii)(C) (3) through (4) and (e)(6)(ii)(C) (3) through (4). If the 
decisional document supports a basis for not addressing an issue raised 
by the applicant (for example, if it is apparent that resolving the 
issue in the applicant's favor would not warrant an upgrade), there is 
no requirement in the Stipulation of Dismissal that the decisional 
document explain why the DRB did not address the issue. With respect to 
decisional documents issued on or after November 27, 1982, a response 
shall be prepared in accordance with the decisional document principles 
set forth in Sec. 70.8.
    (D) When a case is reviewed upon request of an applicant, and the 
DRB upgrades the discharge to ``General,'' the DRB must provide reasons 
why it did not upgrade to ``Honorable'' unless the applicant expressly 
requests lesser relief. This requirement applies to all requests for 
corrective action submitted by an applicant with respect to his or her 
decisional document. In all other cases, this requirement applies to 
decisional documents issued on or after November 9, 1978. When the DRB 
upgrades to General, its explanation for not upgrading to Honorable may 
consist of reference to adverse matter from the applicant's military 
record. When a discharge is upgraded to General in a review on the DRB's 
own motion, there is no requirement to explain why the discharge was not 
upgraded to Honorable.
    (E) There is no requirement under the Stipulation of Dismissal to 
provide reasons for uncontested findings. The foregoing applies to 
decisional documents issued before November 27, 1982. With respect to 
decisional documents issued on or after that date, the following 
guidance applies with respect to an uncontested issue of fact that forms 
the basis for a grant or denial of a change in discharge: the decisional 
document shall list the specific source of information relied upon in 
reaching the conclusion, except when the information is listed in the 
portion of the decisional document that summarizes the service record.

[[Page 436]]

    (F) The requirements of Sec. 70.8(e)(3) (ii)(B)(2) and (e)(6) 
(ii)(B)(2) with respect to explaining use of the presumption of 
regularity apply only to decisional documents issued on or after 
November 27, 1982. When a complaint concerning a decisional document 
issued before that date addresses the adequacy of the DRB's use of the 
presumption of regularity, or words having a similar import, corrective 
action will be required only if a reasonable person familiar with the 
discharge review process can not understand the basis for relying on the 
presumption.
    (G) When the DRB balances mitigrating factors against aggravating 
factors as the reason for a conclusion, the Stipulation of Dismissal 
does not require the statement of reasons to set forth the specific 
factors that were balanced if such factors are otherwise apparent on the 
fact of the decisional document. The foregoing applies to decisional 
documents prepared before November 27, 1982. With respect to decisional 
documents prepared after that date, the statements addressing decisional 
issues in such a case will list or refer to the factors supporting the 
conclusion in accordance with Sec. 70.8(e)(6)(ii).
    (vi) Documents that were the subject of a prior complaint. The 
following applies to a complaint concerning a decisional document that 
has been the subject of prior complaints:
    (A) If the complaint concerns a decisional document that was the 
subject of a prior complaint in which action was completed, the 
complainant will be informed of the substance and disposition of the 
prior complaint, and will be further informed that no additional action 
will be taken unless the complainant within 30 days demonstrates that 
the prior disposition did not produce a decisional document that 
comports with the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) of this 
section.
    (B) If the complaint concerns a decisional document that is the 
subject of a pending complaint, the complainant will be informed that he 
or she will be provided with the results of the pending complaint.
    (C) These limitations do not apply to the initial complaint 
submitted on or after the effective date of the amendments to this 
section by an applicant with respect to his or her own decisional 
document.
    (2) Duties of the administrative director. The administrative 
director shall take the following actions:
    (i) Acknowledge receipt of the complaint;
    (ii) Assign a docket number and note the date of receipt; and
    (iii) Forward the complaint to the Military Department concerned, 
except that the case may be forwarded directly to the DASD (MP&FM) when 
the administrative director makes an initial determination that 
corrective action is not required.
    (3) Administrative processing. The following guidance applies to 
administrative processing of complaints:
    (i) Complaints normally shall be processed on a first-in/first-out 
basis, subject to the availability of records, pending discharge review 
actions, and the following priorities:
    (A) The first priority category consists of cases in which (1) there 
is a pending discharge review and the complainant is the applicant; and 
(2) the complainant sets forth the relevance of the complaint to the 
complainant's pending discharge review application.
    (B) The second priority category consists of requests for correction 
of the decisional document in the complainant's own discharge review 
case.
    (C) The third priority category consists of complaints submitted by 
former members of the Armed Forces (or their counsel) who state that the 
complaint is submitted to assist the former member's submission of an 
application for review.
    (D) The fourth priority category consists of other complaints in 
which the complainant demonstrates that correction of the decisional 
document will substantially enhance the ability of applicants to present 
a significant issue to the DRBs.
    (E) The fifth priority category consists of all other cases.
    (ii) Complainants who request consideration in a priority category 
shall set forth in the complaint the facts that give rise to the claim 
of placement in

[[Page 437]]

the requested category. If the complaint is relevent to a pending 
discharge review in which the complainant is applicant or counsel, the 
scheduled date of the review should be specified.
    (iii) The administrative director is responsible for monitoring 
compliance with the following processing goals:
    (A) The administrative director normally shall forward 
correspondence to the Military Department concerned within 3 days after 
the date of receipt specified in the docket number. Correspondence 
forwarded directly to the DASD(MP&FM) under paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of 
this section, normally shall be transmitted within 7 days after the date 
of receipt.
    (B) The Military Department normally shall request the necessary 
records within 5 working days after the date of receipt from the 
administrative director. The Military Department normally shall complete 
action under paragraph (d)(4) of this section within 45 days after 
receipt of all necessary records. If action by the Military Department 
is required under paragraph (d)(9) of this section, normally it shall be 
completed within 45 days after action is taken by the DASD(MP&FM).
    (C) The JSRA normally shall complete action under paragraph (d)(7) 
of this section at the first monthly meeting held during any period 
commencing 10 days after the administrative director receives the action 
of the Military Department under paragraph (d)(5) of this section.
    (D) The DASD(MP&FM) normally shall complete action under paragraph 
(d)(8) of this section within 30 days after action is taken by the JSRA 
under paragraph (d)(7) of this section or by the administrative director 
under paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (E) If action is not completed within the overall processing goals 
specified in this paragraph, the complainant shall be notified of the 
reason for the delay by the administrative director and shall be 
provided with an approximate date for completion of the action.
    (iv) If the complaints are submitted in any 30 day period with 
respect to more than 50 decisional documents, the administrative 
director shall adjust the processing goals in light of the number of 
complaints and discharge review applications pending before the DRBs.
    (v) At the end of each month, the administrative director shall send 
each Military Department a list of complaints, if any, in which action 
has not been completed within 60 days of the docket date. The Military 
Department shall inform the administrative director of the status of 
each case.
    (4) Review of complaints by the Military Departments. The Military 
Department shall review the complaint under the following guidance:
    (i) Rejection of complaint. If the Military Department determines 
that all the allegations contained in the complaint are not specific or 
have no merit, it shall address the allegations using the format at 
attachment 1 (Review of Complaint).
    (ii) Partial agreement. If the Military Department determines that 
some of the allegations contained in the complaint are not specific or 
have no merit and that some of the allegations contained in the 
complaint have merit, it shall address the allegations using the format 
at attachment 1 and its DRB shall take appropriate corrective action in 
accordance with paragraph (d)(4)(v) of this section.
    (iii) Full agreement. If the Military Department determines that all 
of the allegations contained in the complaint have merit, its DRB shall 
take appropriate corrective action in accordance with paragraph 
(d)(4)(v) of this section.
    (iv) Other defects. If, during the course of its review, the 
Military Department notes any other defects in the decisional document 
or index entries (under the applicable requirements of the Urban Law 
case or under this part) the DRB shall take appropriate corrective 
action under paragraph (d)(4)(v) of this section. This does not 
establish a requirement for the Military Department to review a 
complaint for any purpose other than to determine whether the 
allegations contained in the complaint are specific and have merit; 
rather, it simply provides a format for the Military Department to 
address other defects noted during the course of processing the 
complaint.

[[Page 438]]

    (v) Appropriate corrective action. The following procedures govern 
appropriate corrective action:
    (A) If a complaint concerns the decisional document in the 
complainant's own discharge review case, appropriate corrective action 
consists of amending the decisional document or providing the 
complainant with an opportunity for a new discharge review. An amended 
decisional document will be provided if the applicant requests that form 
of corrective action.
    (B) If a complaint concerns a decisional document involving an 
initial record review under the Special Discharge Review Program or the 
Pub. L. 95-126 rereview program, appropriate corrective action consists 
of (1) amending the decisional document; or (2) notifying the applicant 
and counsel, if any, of the opportunity to obtain a priority review 
using the letter providing at attachment 6. When the DRB takes 
corrective action under this provision by amending a decisional 
document, it shall notify the applicant and counsel, if any, of the 
opportunity to request a de novo review under the Special Discharge 
Review Program or under Pub. L. 95-126 rereview program, as appropriate.
    (C) When corrective action is taken with respect to a decisional 
document in cases prepared under Pub. L. 95-126 the DRB must address 
issues previously raised by the DRB or the applicant during review of 
the same case during the SDRP only insofar as required by the following 
guidance:
    (1) When the DRB bases its decision upon issues previously 
considered during the SDRP, the new decisional document under Pub. L. 
95-126 must address those issues;
    (2) If, during consideration of the case under Pub. L. 95-126 the 
applicant presents issues previously considered during the SDRP, the new 
decisional document must address those issues; and
    (3) If a decisional document concerning an initial record review 
under Pub. L. 95-126 is otherwise defective and corrective action is 
taken after a request by the applicant for a priority review in response 
to the letter at attachment 6, the new decisional document shall address 
all issues previously raised by the applicant during the SDRP.
    (D) Except for cases falling under paragraph (d)(4)(v)(B) of this 
section, if a complaint concerns a decisional document in which the 
applicant received an Honorable Discharge and the full relief requested, 
if any, with respect to the reason for discharge, appropriate corrective 
action consists of amending the decisional document.
    (E) In all other cases, appropriate corrective action consists of 
amending the decisional document or providing the applicant with the 
opportunity for a new review, except that an amended decisional document 
will be provided when the complainant expressly requests that form of 
corrective action.
    (vi) Amended decisional documents. One that reflects a determination 
by a DRB panel (or the SRA) as to what the DRB panel (or SRA) that 
prepared the defective decisional document would have entered on the 
decisional document to support its decision in this case.
    (A) The action of the amending authority does not necessarily 
reflect substantive agreement with the decision of the original DRB 
panel (or SRA) on the merits of the case.
    (B) A corrected decisional document created by amending a decisional 
document in response to a complaint will be based upon the complete 
record before the DRB (or the SRA) at the time of the original defective 
statement was issued, including, if available, a transcript, tape 
recording, videotape or other record of a hearing, if any. The new 
decisional document will be indexed under categories relevant to the new 
statements.
    (C) When an amended decisional document is required under paragraphs 
(d)(4)(v)(A) and (d)(4)(v)(D) of this section and the necessary records 
cannot be located, a notation to that effect will be made on the 
decisional document, and the applicant and counsel, if any, will be 
afforded an opportunity for a new review, and the complainant will be 
informed of the action.
    (D) When an amended decisional document is requested under paragraph 
(d)(4)(v)(C) and the necessary records cannot be located, a notation to 
that effect will be made on the decisional

[[Page 439]]

document, and the complainant will be informed that the situation 
precludes further action.
    (vii) Time limit for requesting a new review. An applicant who is 
afforded an opportunity to request a new review may do so within 45 
days.
    (viii) Interim notification. When the Military Department determines 
that some or all of the allegations contained in the complaint are not 
specific or have no merit but its DRB takes corrective action under 
paragraph (d)(4)(ii) or (d)(4)(iv) of this section, the DRB's 
notification to the applicant and counsel, if any, and to the 
complainant, if other than the applicant or counsel, should include the 
following or similar wording: ``This is in partial response to (your)/
(a) complaint to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense 
(Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and Logistics) dated -------- concerning --
------ Discharge Review Board decisional document --------. A final 
response to (your)/(the) complaint, which has been returned to the 
Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Reserve Affairs, 
and Logistics) for further review, will be provided to you in the near 
future.''
    (ix) Final notification. When the Discharge Review Board takes 
corrective action under paragraphs (d)(4)(iii) and (d)(9) of this 
section -------- its notification to the applicant and counsel, if any, 
and to the complainant, if other than the applicant or counsel, should 
include the following or similar wording: ``This is in response to 
(your)/(a) complaint to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense 
(Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and Logistics) dated -------- concerning --
------ Discharge Review Board decisional document --------.
    (5) Transmittal to the administrative director. The Military 
Department shall return the complaint to the administrative Director 
with a copy of the decisional document and, when applicable, any of the 
following documents:
    (i) The ``Review of Complaint.''
    (ii) A copy of the amendment to the decisional document and the 
accompanying transmittal letter or letters to the applicant and counsel, 
if any, and to the complainant, if other than the applicant or counsel.
    (iii) A copy of the notification to the applicant and counsel, if 
any, of the opportunity to request a new review, and a copy of the 
notification to the complainant, if other than the applicant or counsel, 
that the applicant has been authorized a new review.
    (6) Review by the administrative director. The administrative 
director shall review the complaint and accompanying documents to ensure 
the following:
    (i) If the Military Department determined that any of the 
allegations contained in the complaint are not specific or have no 
merit, the JSRA shall review the complaint and accompanying documents. 
The JSRA shall address the allegations using the format at attachment 2 
(Review of and Recommended Action on Complaint) and shall note any other 
defects in the decisional document or index entries not previously noted 
by the Military Department. This does not establish a requirement for 
the JSRA to review such complaints for any purpose other than to address 
the allegations contained in the complaint; rather, it simply provides a 
format for the JSRA to address other defects noted in the course of 
processing the complaint.
    (ii) If the Military Department determined that all of the 
allegations contained in the complaint have merit and its DRB amended 
the decisional document, the amended decisional document shall be 
subject to review by the JSRA on a sample basis each quarter using the 
format at attachment 3 (Review of any Recommendation on Amended 
Decisional Document).
    (iii) If the Military Department determined that all of the 
allegations contained in the complaint have merit and its DRB notified 
the applicant and counsel, if any, of the opportunity to request a new 
review, review of such corrective action is not required.
    (7) Review by the JSRA. The JSRA shall meet for the purpose of 
conducting the reviews required in paragraphs (d)(6)(i), (d)(6)(ii), and 
(d)(9)(iii)(A) of this section. The Administrative director shall call 
meetings once a month, if necessary, or more frequently depending upon 
the number of matters before the JSRA.

[[Page 440]]

Matters before the JSRA shall be presented to the members by the 
recorder. Each member shall have one vote in determining matters before 
the JSRA, a majority vote of the members determining all matters. 
Determinations of the JSRA shall be reported to the DASD(MP&FM) as JSRA 
recommendations using the prescribed format. If a JSRA recommendation is 
not unanimous, the minority member may prepare a separate recommendation 
for consideration by the DASD(MP&FM) using the same format. 
Alternatively, the minority member may indicate ``dissent'' next to his 
signature on the JSRA recommendation.
    (8) Review by the DASD(MP&FM). The DASD(MP&FM) shall review all 
recommendations of the JSRA and the administrative director as follows:
    (i) The DASD(MP&FM) shall review complaints using the format at 
Attachment 4 (Review of and Action on Complaint). The DASD(MP&FM) is the 
final authority in determining whether the allegations contained in a 
complaint are specific and have merit. If the DASD(MP&FM) determines 
that no further action by the Military Department is warranted, the 
complainant and the Military Department shall be so informed. If the 
DASD(MP&FM) determines that further action by the Military Department is 
required, the Military Department shall be directed to ensure that 
appropriate corrective action is taken by its DRB and the complainant 
shall be provided an appropriate interim response.
    (ii) The DASD(MP&FM) shall review amended decisional documents using 
the format at attachment 5 (Review of and Action on Amended Decisional 
Document). The DASD(MP&FM) is the final authority in determining whether 
an amended decisional document complies with applicable requirements of 
the Urban Law case and, when applicable, this Directive. If the 
DASD(MP&FM) determines that no further corrective action by the Military 
Department is warranted, the Military Department shall be so informed. 
If the DASD(MP&FM) determines that further corrective action by the 
Military Department is required, the Military Department shall be 
directed to ensure that appropriate corrective action is taken by its 
DRB.
    (iii) It is noted that any violation of applicable requirements of 
the Urban Law case is also a violation of this part. However, certain 
requirements under this part are not requirements under the Urban Law 
case. If the allegations contained in a complaint are determined to have 
merit or if an amended decisional document is determined to be defective 
on the basis of one of these additional requirements under this part the 
DASD(MP&FM) determination shall reflect this fact.
    (9) Further action by the Military Department. (i) With respect to a 
determination by the DASD (MP&FM) that further action by the Military 
Department is required, its DRB shall take appropriate corrective action 
in accordance with paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
    (ii) The Military Department shall provide the administrative 
director with the following documents when relevant to corrective action 
taken in accordance with paragraph (d)(4) of this section:
    (A) A copy of the amendment to the decisional document and the 
accompanying transmittal letter or letters to the applicant and counsel, 
if any, and to the complainant, if other than the applicant or counsel.
    (B) A copy of the notification to the applicant and counsel, if any, 
of the opportunity to request a new review, and a copy of the 
notification to the complainant, if other than the applicant or counsel, 
that the applicant has been authorized a new review.
    (iii) The administrative director shall review the documents 
relevant to corrective action taken in accordance with paragraph (d)(4) 
of this section, and ensure the following:
    (A) If the DRB amended the decisional document, the amended 
decisional document shall be subject to review by the JSRA on a sample 
basis each quarter using the format at attachment 3 (Review of and 
Recommended Action on Amended Decisional Document).
    (B) If the DRB notified the applicant and counsel, if any, of the 
opportunity to request a new review, review of such corrective action is 
not required.

[[Page 441]]

    (10) Documents required by the JSRA or DASD (MP&FM). Upon request, 
the Military Department shall provide the administrative director with 
other documents required by the JSRA or the DASD (MP&FM) in the conduct 
of their reviews.
    (e) Responses to inquiries. The following procedures shall be used 
in processing inquiries:
    (1) The administrative director shall assign a docket number to the 
inquiry.
    (2) The administrative director shall forward the inquiry to the 
Military Department concerned.
    (3) The Military Department shall prepare a response to the inquiry 
and provide the administrative director with a copy of the response.
    (4) The Military Department's response shall include the following 
or similar wording: ``This is in response to your inquiry to the Office 
of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and 
Logistics) dated -------- concerning --------.
    (f) Indexing. The DRB concerned shall reindex all amended decisional 
documents and shall provide copies of the amendments to the decisional 
documents to the Armed Forces Discharge Review/Correction Board Reading 
Room.
    (g) Disposition of documents. The administrative director is 
responsible for the disposition of all Military Department, DRB, JSRA, 
and DASD (MP&FM) documents relevant to processing complaints and 
inquiries.
    (h) Referral by the General Counsel, Department of Defense. The 
Stipulation of Dismissal permits Urban Law plaintiffs to submit 
complaints to the General Counsel, DoD, for comment. The General 
Counsel, DoD, may refer such complaints to the Military Department 
concerned or to the JSRA for initial comment.
    (i) Decisional document and index entry principles. The DASD (MP&FM) 
shall identify significant principles concerning the preparation of 
decisional documents and index entries as derived from decisions under 
this section and other opinions of the Office of General Counsel, DoD. 
This review shall be completed not later than October 1 and April 1 of 
each year, or more frequently if deemed appropriate by the DASD (MP&FM). 
The significant principles identified in the review shall be coordinated 
as proposed as amendments to the sections of this part.
    (j) Implementation of amendments. The following governs the 
processing of any correspondence that is docketed prior to the effective 
date of amendments to this section except as otherwise provided in such 
amendments:
    (1) Any further action on the correspondence shall be taken in 
accordance with the amendments; and
    (2) No revision of any action taken prior to the effective date of 
such amendments is required.

\1\ This review may be made based upon the decisional document without
  reference to the underlying discharge review record except as follows:
  if there is an allegation that a specific contention made by the
  applicant to the DRB was not addressed by the DRB. In such a case, the
  complaint review process shall involve a review of all the evidence
  that was before the DRB, including the testimony and written
  submissions of the applicant, to determine whether the contention was
  made, and if so, whether it was addressed adequately with respect to
  the Stipulation of Dismissal and, when applicable, DoD Directive
  1332.28.
This review may be based upon the decisional document without reference
  to the regulation governing the discharge in question except as
  follows: if there is a specific complaint that the DRB failed to
  address a specific factor required by applicable regulations to be
  considered for determination of the character of and reason for the
  discharge in question [where such factors are a basis for denial of
  any of the relief requested by the applicant]. (The material in
  brackets pertains only to discharge reviews conducted on or before

Remarks:

                              Attachment 7

Dear ------:
    It has been determined that the decisional document issued in your 
case by the (Army) (Navy) (Air Force) Discharge Review Board

[[Page 445]]

during the (Special Discharge Review Program) (rereview program under 
Pub. L. No. 95-126) should be reissued to improve the clarity of the 
statement of findings, conclusions, and reasons for the decision in your 
case.
    In order to obtain a new decisional document you may elect one of 
the following options to receive a new review under the (Special 
Discharge Review Program) (rereview program mandated by Pub. L. No. 95-
126):
    1. You may request a new review, including a personal appearance 
hearing if you so desire, by responding on or before the suspense date 
noted at the top of this letter. Taking this action will provide you 
with a priority review before all other classes of cases.
    2. You may request correction of the original decisional document 
issued to you by responding on or before the suspense date noted at the 
top of this letter. After you receive a corrected decisional document, 
you will be entitled to request a new review, including a personal 
appearance hearing if you so desire. If you request correction of the 
original decisional document, you will not receive priority processing 
in terms of correcting your decisional document or providing you with a 
new review; instead, your case will be handled in accordance with 
standard processing procedures, which may mean a delay of several months 
or more.
    If you do not respond by the suspense date noted at the top of this 
letter, no action will be taken. If you subsequently submit a complaint 
about this decisional document, it will be processed in accordance with 
standard procedures.
    To ensure prompt and accurate processing of your request, please 
fill out the form below, cut it off at the dotted line, and return it to 
the Discharge Review Board of the Military Department in which you 
served at the address listed at the top of this letter.
Check only one:
    [ ] I request a new review of my case on a priority basis. I am 
requesting this priority review rather than requesting correction of the 
decisional document previously issued to me. I have enclosed DD Form 293 
as an application for my new review.
    [ ] I request correction of the decisional document previously 
issued to me. I understand that this does not entitle me to priority 
action in correcting my decisional document. I also understand that I 
will be able to obtain a further review of my case upon my request after 
receiving the corrected decisional document, but that such a review will 
not be held on a priority basis.

the DoD dependents schools.
    (l) Space-available. Pupil accommodations that may be made available 
in DoD dependents schools if the Director, DoDDS, or designee,

resources to permit the enrollment of nonspace-required students.


<R05>
Sec. 71.4  Policy.

    (a) It is the policy of the Department of Defense:
    (1) That, while overseas, DoD dependent students may be enrolled in 
DoD dependents schools or approved non-DoD dependents schools, or may 
take correspondence courses at U.S. Government expenses, under the 
conditions prescribed in Sec. 71.5.
    (2) To allow the enrollment of other minor dependents in DoD 
dependents schools, provided that space is available and that tuition is

Sec. 71.5  Eligibility requirements.

    Students may be enrolled in the DoD dependents schools pursuant to 
paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, and in that priority, and 
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.
    (a) Space-required, tuition-free. (1) Command-sponsored DoD 
dependent students shall, upon the request of their DoD sponsor, be 
enrolled in DoD dependents schools on a space-required, tuition-free 
basis. However, costs for the education of minor dependents of DoD 
sponsors working for the DoD Security Assistance Program shall be paid 
from DoD Security Assistance Program funds.
    (2) If, as determined by the Director, DoD Dependents Schools 
(DoDDS), or designee, no DoD dependents school is available within the 
commuting area, command-sponsored DoD dependent students are eligible 
for education in approved non-DoD dependents schools at U.S. Government 
expense, usually in that same foreign country, or in DoD dependents 
schools with dormitories, or through correspondence courses at U.S. 
Government expense.
    (3) DoD dependent students may be provided education in approved 
non-DoD dependents schools or may receive correspondence courses at U.S. 
Government expense only at locations where DoD dependents schools are 
not available or are operating at maximum capacity. Only those non-DoD 
dependents schools with programs considered satisfactory by the 
Director, DoDDS, or designee, shall be approved to provide education at 
U.S. Government expense to DoD dependent students. In all cases, the 
payment of tuition in approved non-DoD dependents schools by the U.S. 
Government is limited to those DoD dependent students who are authorized 
transportation at U.S. Government expense to or from an overseas area, 
if their DoD sponsor is military, and to those DoD dependent students 
whose DoD sponsor, if civilian, is eligible for a living quarters 
allowance, as authorized by the Department of State Standardized 
Regulations and DoD 1400.25-M.
    (4) If adequate housing is available within the commuting area of a 
DoD dependents school and an appropriate educational program is 
available at that school, tuition will not be authorized for the 
attendance of DoD dependent students in an approved non-DoD

[[Page 448]]

dependents school in that same locality, except as authorized in 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section. DoD dependent students who currently 
are enrolled in an approved non-DoD dependents school and who would be 
adversely affected by this limitation may, at the discretion of the 
Director, DoDDS, or designee, be authorized to continue in attendance in 
that approved non-DoD dependents school through the 1984-85 school year, 
or until the rotation of the DoD sponsor out of the command, whichever 
is earlier.
    (5) Approved non-DoD dependents schools that are available free of 
charge and that offer instructional programs in English should be used, 
if feasible, before contracting for education in approved non-DoD 
dependents schools that charge tuition.
    (6) If no DoD dependents school within the commuting area of a 
handicapped DoD dependent student is able to provide an appropriate 
education to that student, DoDDS may place the student in another DoD 
dependents school. If no appropriate DoD dependents school is reasonably 
available, DoDDS then may place the student at U.S. Government expense 
in an approved non-DoD dependents school overseas. DoDDS may place a 
handicapped DoD dependent student in an approved non-DoD dependents 
school in the United States only if no appropriate school is reasonably 
available overseas. DoDDS may not place a non-DoD dependent student in a 
non-DoD dependents school at U.S. Government expense.
    (7) DoD dependent students who are the dependents of a DoD sponsor 
who is detained by a foreign power or is declared missing in action or 
otherwise unlawfully detained may remain in a DoD dependents school, or 
in an approved non-DoD dependents school, at U.S. Government expense for 
as long as the detention or missing status exists, subject to the 
approval of the Director, DoDDS, or designee.
    (8) DoD dependent students who are authorized attendance in a DoD 
dependents school or an approved non-DoD dependents school may complete 
the current school year if the DoD sponsor is transferred, dies, or 
retires during the school year, but subsequently shall lose their 
eligibility to attend, except on a space-available, tutition-free basis 
in a DoD dependents school as prescribed in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section.
    (9) If DoD dependent students are authorized to accompany their DoD 
sponsor to the country of the sponsor's assignment, such dependent 
students ordinarily will not be entitled to space-required, tuition-free 
education in a DoD dependents school in a different overseas country or 
to education in a non-DoD dependents school at U.S. Government expense 
in that different country. Any exceptions to this policy must be 
approved by the Director, DoDDS, or designee.
    (b) Space-available, tuition-paying (federally connected). Under 
section 1404(c) of the ``Defense Dependents' Education Act of 1978'', if 
the Director, DoDDS, or designee, determines that space is available, 
consistent with the local military commander's policy concerning access 
to the installation and agreements with the host nation, other minor 
dependents in the categories specified in this subsection may be 
enrolled in a DoD dependents school upon payment of tuition. The amount 
of tuition shall be determined by the Director, DoDDS, or designee, and 
may not be less than the rate necessary to cover the average cost of 
enrollment of children in the DoD dependents schools. Clarification on 
how tuition rates are determined is contained in DoD Directive 4000.19 
and DoD Instruction 7230.7. Minor dependents in this category may be 
enrolled in the following priority:
    (1) Minor dependents of other U.S. Government agency employees 
stationed overseas.
    (2) Minor dependents of U.S. citizens who have executed contracts or 
who are employed by parent organizations that have executed contracts or 
other agreements with the Department of Defense when the applicable 
contract or agreement authorizes dependent education on a tuition basis 
in the DoD dependents schools. A copy of the document authorizing 
attendance shall be presented to the appropriate DoD dependents school 
official at the time of enrollment. Examples of individuals whose minor 
dependents are covered by this paragraph include:

[[Page 449]]

    (i) Nonappropriated fund instrumentalities (universal annual) 
employees.
    (ii) Defense contractor personnel.
    (iii) United Services Organizations, Inc., personnel.
    (iv) American Red Cross personnel.
    (3) Minor dependents of host-nation or third-country national 
military or civilian personnel accompanying or serving with the Military 
Services overseas, when recommended by the major overseas commander and 
when approved by the Director, DoDDS, or designee.
    (4) Minor dependents of other sponsors who are serving the national 
defense interest, as determined by the Director, DoDDS, or designee.
    (c) Space-available, tuition-free. Under section 1404(c) of the 
``Defense Dependents' Education Act of 1978'', the following classes of 
DoD dependent students may be enrolled, in the priority given below, in 
DoD dependents schools on a space-available, tuition-free basis:
    (1) Minor dependents of military DoD sponsors who are stationed in 
overseas areas to which their dependents are not authorized 
transportation at U.S. Government expense or minor dependents of 
civilian DoD sponsors who are not entitled to a living quarters 
allowance as authorized by the Department of State Standardized 
Regulations and DoD 1400.25-M, when the sponsors elect to transport 
these dependents at their own expense to overseas areas in which the 
sponsors are stationed (noncommand-sponsored dependents). If at any time 
during a DoD sponsor's overseas assignment that sponsor's minor 
noncommand-sponsored dependents become command-sponsored or the sponsor 
acquires minor, command-sponsored dependents, those dependents shall be 
authorized ``space-required, tuition-free'' status.
    (2) DoD dependent students who are dependents of DoD sponsors who 
die while intitled to compensation or active duty pay at the time of the 
sponsor's death, provided that the surviving spouse either was residing 
in an overseas area when the sponsor died or has been a citizen of a 
foreign country and returns to that country. The DoD dependent student 
must be enrolled in a DoD dependents school either within 1 year of the 
DoD sponsor's death or, if the dependent is below school age when the 
sponsor dies, within 1 year of the dependent's becoming eligible to 
enroll.
    (3) Noncommand-sponsored DoD dependents who are enrolled in a DoD 
dependents school may remain in a DoD dependents school if their sponsor 
is declared missing in action or otherwise unlawfully detained for as 
long as the detention or missing status exists, subject to the approval 
of the Director, DoDDS, or designee.
    (d) Space-available, tuition-paying (nonfederally connected). Under 
section 1404(c) of the ``Defense Dependents' Education Act of 1978'', 
the following minor dependents may be enrolled in a DoD dependents 
school upon payment of tuition if the Director, DoDDS, or designee, 
determines that space is available:
    (1) Dependents of U.S. citizens residing in overseas areas, 
including dependents of retired personnel, or of deceased personnel not 
covered in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (2) Dependents of foreign nationals, when there is no objection from 
the host nation and when such inclusion does not displace or prevent 
inclusion of U.S. citizen-sponsored minor dependents seeking admission 
on the same basis at the same time.
    (e) Education in the Republic of Panama. Eligibility requirements 
for education in the Republic of Panama are prescribed in Sec. 71.7.

Sec. 73.1  Purpose.

    This part: (a) Establishes training simulator and device 
development, acquisition, and utilization policy implementing Assistant 
Secretary of Defense memorandum dated October 5, 1984 in accordance with 
DoD Directive 5000.1,\1\ DoD Instruction 500.2,\1\ DoD Directive 
5000.3,\1\ DoD Directive 5000.39,\1\ DoD Directive 5000.19,\1\ DoD

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Provides guidance for establishing Service policy for training 
simulators and devices.
    (c) Authorizes the Department of Defense to use training simulators 
and devices to make training systems more effective and to help maintain 
military readiness. Emphasizes the relationship between the system(s) 
supported and the training system and supports the requirements for 
coincident development and concurrency between the system(s) supported 
and the training system. A systematically developed training system with 
appropriate training simulators, devices, and embedded training 
capability cost-effectively provides training for any given weapon or 
support system. Properly used, such training simulators and devices 
facilitate: training that might be impractical or unsafe if done with 
actual systems or equipment; concentrated practice in selected normal 
and emergency actions; the training of operators and maintainers to 
diagnose and address possible equipment faults; enhanced proficiency 
despite shortages of equipment, space, ranges, or time; control of life-
cycle training costs; and reducing systems required in maintenance 
training.
    (d) Emphasizes that training simulators and devices are integral 
parts of an overall training system. Those training systems without 
training simulators or devices specifically are excluded from this part.


<R05>
Sec. 73.2  Applicability and scope.

    (a) This part applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense 
(OSD) and the Military Departments, including their National Guard and 
Reserve components. The term ``Military Services,'' as used herein, 
refers to the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and the National 
Guard and Reserve components.
    (b) This part shall not be construed to usurp management 
prerogatives or responsibilities of the Military Departments or their 
Guard or Reserve Components.
    (c) For reporting purposes supporting acquisition review for 
training simulators or devices supporting a major system or comprising 
nonsystem training equipment, the dollar thresholds shall be those 
established in DoD 7110.1-M, part II.
    (d) When the Secretary of Defense designates any training simulator 
or device as being of significant interest based on criteria other than 
cost, the Military Service concerned shall provide the documentation 
required by this part.
    (e) The policies of this part shall be followed regardless of the 
cost of the training simulators or devices.
    (f) In accordance with the responsibilities in E.O. 12344, the 
Department of Energy (DoE) has cognizance over the development of 
training systems and devices used in the training of naval nuclear 
propulsion plant operators. Such systems and devices are not covered by 
this Directive, but are coordinated separately with DoE.


<R05>
Sec. 73.3  Definitions.

    Embedded training. Training using operational equipment that 
involves simulating or stimulating of equipment performance.
    Non-system training device. A training simulator or device not 
supporting a single, specific, parent defense system.
    Training simulator and/or device. Hardware and software designed or 
modified exclusively for training purposes involving simulation or 
stimulation in

[[Page 453]]

its construction or operation to demonstrate or illustrate a concept or 
simulate an operational circumstance or environment. Under this part, 
training simulators and devices are considered part of an overall 
training system that may or may not be identified as part of a parent 
defense system. Under this part, the term training device shall apply to 
training simulators and devices.
    Training system. A systematically developed curriculum including, 
but not necessarily limited to, courseware; classroom aids; training 
simulators and devices; operational equipment; embedded training 
capability; and personnel to operate, maintain, or employ a system. The 
training system includes all necessary elements of logistic support.


<R05>
Sec. 73.4  Policy.

    (a) General. (1) It is DoD policy to optimize the operational 
readiness of the total forces by effecting the development and 
acquisition of training devices, in accordance with DoD Directive 
5000.1. The requirement for development and acquisition of training 
devices shall be based on a Military Service's training requirements 
analysis process. The analysis shall define the training need, determine 
whether existing training devices shall satisfy the training 
requirement, and evaluate the benefits and tradeoffs of potential 
alternative training solutions. This process shall consider how 
recommended training devices shall function in the National Guard and 
Reserve environment and how they shall meet any unique National Guard 
and Reserve training needs.
    (2) All training devices supporting and unique to a major system 
acquisition should be documented and reviewed with the parent major 
system. Major system training devices shall be identified in the 
acquisition process in the Integrated Program Summary (IPS), in 
accordance with DoD Instruction 5000.2. Those training devices that are 
not included in a major system acquisition should be identified and 
justified in relation to a specific training program or course. The 
Military Services shall ensure that all development, procurement, 
operation, and support costs are programmed and funded.
    (3) These policies do not imply that a training system, simulator, 
or device must be procured from the prime contractor for the defense 
system being supported.
    (4) The acquisition of a training system that supports a new defense 
system or equipment shall be assigned the same priority as that of the 
parent system or equipment.
    (5) Those training devices dedicated to defense systems or equipment 
should be available in time for the fielding of the parent system.
    (6) These policies and the guidelines to implement them apply to 
acquisition funds from advanced development through procurement.
    (7) Joint-Services acquisition of common training devices should be 
fully considered in each Military Service's training analysis and 
planning.
    (b) Development planning guidelines. (1) Once a training device 
requirement has been established, the training device program must be 
described and documented in a Military Service's approved development 
plan (DP) or equivalent before development of the training device may 
proceed.
    (2) The DP, which documents the Military Service's training 
requirement, must integrate the proposed, specific training device 
hardware or software system being developed and acquired with the 
training system for which it is intended.
    (3) The DP shall address the following items as data become 
available:
    (i) Assessment of Training need and expected benefit from the 
training device(s).
    (ii) Description of the training device(s).
    (iii) Acquisition and modification schedule.
    (iv) Ability of the training devices to maintain or improve safety.
    (v) Course and training estimates including projected student flows 
and loads, requirements for instructors and other staff, location of 
training facilities, and other training requirements.
    (c) Acquisition guidelines. (1) Training device alternatives 
including, but not limited to, trainers, general versus specific 
devices, real equipment versus

[[Page 454]]

simulated equipment, and embedded training capability should be 
evaluated by the Military Service concerned. Where applicable, economic 
analyses of alternatives should be conducted in accordance with the 
methods and assumptions in DoD Instruction 7041.3. The evaluation of 
each alternative should consider as appropriate:
    (i) Life-cycle use versus costs.
    (ii) Trade-off with requirements for munitions, if applicable.
    (iii) Capability of the training device(s) to accommodate changes 
made to the parent defense systems based on data on minimum and maximum 
changes made over the life cycle of similar defense systems.
    (iv) Student load and curriculum changes or field application 
training changes anticipated during the life cycle.
    (2) When military specification equipment is not required to meet 
performance needs, commercial practices and equipment should be used to 
contain initial procurement and follow-on support costs. Commercially 
available training programs also deserve serious consideration.
    (3) Specifications should cover training functions, performance 
levels, and required proficiency.
    (d) Training effectiveness evaluation guidelines. Analysis of 
training capability and potential should focus on data based on actual 
experience.


<R05>

Sec. 75.1  Purpose.

    This part updates uniform Department of Defense procedures governing 
conscientious objectors and processing requests for discharge based on 
conscientious objection.


<R05>
Sec. 75.2  Applicability and scope.

    The provisions of this part apply to the military departments and 
govern the personnel of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps and 
all Reserve components thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 75.3  Definitions.

    (a) Conscientious objection--General. A firm, fixed and sincere 
objection to participation in war in any form or the bearing of arms, by 
reason of religious training and belief.
    (1) Class 1-O conscientious objector. A member, who, by reason of 
conscientious objection, sincerely objects to participation of any kind 
in war in any form.
    (2) Class 1-A-O conscientious objector. A member who, by reason of 
conscientious objection, sincerely objects to participation as a 
combatant in war in any form, but whose convictions are such as to 
permit military service in a noncombatant status.

Unless otherwise specified, the term ``conscientious objector'' includes 
both 1-O and 1-A-O conscientious objectors.
    (b) Religious training and belief. Belief in an external power or 
being or deeply held moral or ethical belief, to which all else is 
subordinate or upon which all else is ultimately dependent, and which 
has the power or force to affect moral well-being. The external power or 
being need not be of an orthodox deity, but may be a sincere and 
meaningful belief which occupies in the life of its possessor a place 
parallel to that filled by the God of another, or, in the case of deeply 
held moral or ethical beliefs, a belief held with the strength and 
devotion of traditional religious conviction. The term ``religious 
training and belief'' may include solely moral or ethical beliefs even 
though the applicant himself may not characterize these beliefs as 
``religious'' in the traditional sense, or may expressly characterize 
them as not religious. The term ``religious training and belief'' does 
not include a belief which rests solely upon considerations of policy, 
pragmatism, expediency, or political views.
    (c) Noncombatant service or noncombatant duties (1-A-O) (used 
interchangeably herein). (1) Service in any unit of the Armed Forces 
which is unarmed at all times.
    (2) Service in the medical department of any of the Armed Forces, 
wherever performed.
    (3) Any other assignment the primary function of which does not 
require the use of arms in combat provided that such other assignment is 
acceptable to the individual concerned and does not require him to bear 
arms or to be trained in their use.
    (4) Service aboard an armed ship or aircraft or in a combat zone 
shall not be considered to be combatant duty unless the individual 
concerned is personally and directly involved in the operation of 
weapons.
    (d) Noncombatant training. Any training which is not concerned with 
the study, use or handling of arms or weapons.


<R05>
Sec. 75.4  Policy.

    (a) Administrative discharge prior to the completion of an obligated 
term of

[[Page 457]]

service is discretionary with the military service concerned, based on a 
judgment of the facts and circumstances in the case. However, insofar as 
may be consistent with the effectiveness and efficiency of the military 
services, a request for classification as a conscientious objector and 
relief from or restriction of military duties in consequence thereof 
will be approved to the extent practicable and equitable within the 
following limitations:
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, no 
member of the Armed Forces who possessed conscientious objection beliefs 
before entering military service is eligible for classification as a 
conscientious objector if
    (i) (a) Such beliefs satisfied the requirements for classification 
as a conscientious objector pursuant to section 6(j) of the Universal 
Military Training and Service Act, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 456(j)) 
and other provisions of law, and (b) he failed to request classification 
as a conscientious objector by the Selective Service System; or
    (ii) (a) He requested classification as a conscientious objector 
before entering military service, and (b) such request was denied on the 
merits by the Selective Service System, and (c) his request for 
classification as a conscientious objector is based upon essentially the 
same grounds, or supported by essentially the same evidence, as the 
request which was denied by the Selective Service System.
    (2) Nothing contained in this part renders ineligible for 
classification as a conscientious objector a member of the Armed Forces 
who possessed conscientious objector beliefs before entering military 
service if (i) such beliefs crystalized after receipt of an induction 
notice; and (ii) he could not request classification as a conscientious 
objector by the Selective Service System because of Selective Service 
System regulations prohibiting the submission of such requests after 
receipt of induction notice.
    (b) Because of the personal and subjective nature of conscientious 
objection, the existence, honesty, and sincerity of asserted 
conscientious objection beliefs cannot be routinely ascertained by 
applying inflexible objective standards and measurements on an ``across-
the-board'' basis. Requests for discharge or assignment to noncombatant 
training or service based on conscientious objection will, therefore, be 
handled on an individual basis with final determination made at the 
headquarters of the military service concerned in accordance with the 
facts and circumstances in the particular case and the policy and 
procedures set forth herein.


<R05>
Sec. 75.5  Criteria.

    General. The criteria set forth herein provide policy and guidance 
in considering applications for separation or for assignment to 
noncombatant training and service based on conscientious objection.
    (a) Consistent with the national policy to recognize the claims of 
bona fide conscientious objectors in the military service, an 
application for classification as a conscientious objector may be 
approved (subject to the limitations of Sec. 75.4(a)) for any 
individual:
    (1) Who is conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any 
form;
    (2) Whose opposition is founded on religious training and beliefs; 
and
    (3) Whose position is sincere and deeply held.
    (b) War in any form: The clause ``war in any form'' should be 
interpreted in the following manner:
    (1) An individual who desires to choose the war in which he will 
participate is not a conscientious objector under the law. His objection 
must be to all wars rather than a specific war;
    (2) A belief in a theocratic or spiritual war between the powers of 
good and evil does not constitute a willingness to participate in 
``war'' within the meaning of this part.
    (c) Religious training and belief: (1) In order to find that an 
applicant's moral and ethical beliefs are against participation in war 
in any form and are held with the strength of traditional religious 
convictions, the applicant must show that these moral and ethical 
convictions, once acquired, have directed his life in the way 
traditional religious convictions of equal strength, depth and duration 
have directed the lives of those whose beliefs

[[Page 458]]

are clearly found in traditional religious convictions. In other words, 
the belief upon which conscientious objection is based must be the 
primary controlling force in the applicant's life.
    (2) A primary factor to be considered is the sincerity with which 
the belief is held. Great care must be exercised in seeking to determine 
whether asserted beliefs are honestly and genuinely held. Sincerity is 
determined by an impartial evaluation of the applicant's thinking and 
living in its totality, past and present. Care must be exercised in 
determining the integrity of belief and the consistency of application. 
Information presented by the claimant should be sufficient to convince 
that the claimant's personal history reveals views and actions strong 
enough to demonstrate that expediency or avoidance of military service 
is not the basis of his claim.
    (i) Therefore, in evaluating applications the conduct of applicants, 
in particular their outward manifestation of the beliefs asserted, will 
be carefully examined and given substantial weight.
    (ii) Relevant factors that should be considered in determining an 
applicant's claim of conscientious objection include: Training in the 
home and church; general demeanor and pattern of conduct; participation 
in religious activities; whether ethical or moral convictions were 
gained through training, study, contemplation, or other activity 
comparable in rigor and dedication to the processes by which traditional 
religious convictions are formulated; credibility of the applicant; and 
credibility of persons supporting the claim.
    (iii) Particular care must be exercised not to deny the existence of 
bona fide beliefs simply because those beliefs are incompatible with 
one's own.
    (a) Church membership or adherence to particular theological tenets 
are not required to warrant separation or assignment to noncombatant 
training and service for conscientious objectors.
    (b) Mere affiliation with a church or other group which advocates 
conscientious objection as a tenet of its creed is not necessarily 
determinative of an applicant's position or belief.
    (c) Conversely, affiliation with a church or group which does not 
teach conscientious objection does not necessarily rule out adherence to 
conscientious objection beliefs in any given case.
    (d) Where an applicant is or has been a member of a church, 
religious organization, or religious sect, and where his claim of 
conscientious objection is related to such membership, inquiry may 
properly be made as to the fact of membership, and the teaching of the 
church, religious organization, or religious sect, as well as the 
applicant's religious activity. However, the fact that the applicant may 
disagree with, or not subscribe to, some of the tenets of his church 
does not necessarily discredit his claim. The personal convictions of 
each individual will be controlling so long as they derive from his 
moral, ethical or religious beliefs.
    (e) Moreover, an applicant who is otherwise eligible for 
conscientious objector status may not be denied that status simply 
because his conscientious objection influences his views concerning the 
Nation's domestic or foreign policies. The task is to decide whether the 
beliefs professed are sincerely held, and whether they govern the 
claimant's actions in both word and deed.
    (d) The burden of establishing a claim of conscientious objection as 
a ground for separation or assignment to noncombatant training and 
service is on the applicant. To this end, he must establish by clear and 
convincing evidence: (1) That the nature or basis of his claim comes 
within the definition of and criteria prescribed herein for 
conscientious objection, and (2) that his belief in connection therewith 
is honest, sincere and deeply held. The claimant has the burden of 
determining and setting forth the exact nature of his request, i.e., 
whether for separation based on conscientious objection (1-O) or for 
assignment to noncombatant training and service based on conscientious 
objection (1-A-O).
    (e) An applicant claiming 1-O status shall not be granted 1-A-O 
status as a compromise.
    (f) Persons who were classified 1-A-O by Selective Service prior to 
induction shall upon induction be transferred to a training center, or 
station, for recruit training, and shall be subject to

[[Page 459]]

noncombatant service or training. They will be required to sign and date 
a statement as set forth in the form in Sec. 75.11. Thereafter, upon 
completion of recruit training, they shall be assigned to noncombatant 
duty. They may be transferred to the medical corps, or a medical 
department or unit for further training, provided they meet the 
requirements therefor. Such persons when assigned to medical units will 
not be allowed to avoid the important or hazardous duties which are part 
of the responsibility of all members of the medical organization. Any 
person who does not meet the requirements for this training, who fails 
to complete the prescribed course of instruction, or who otherwise 
cannot be assigned to this duty will be assigned to other noncombatant 
duties.
    (g) Commanders at levels directed by the service headquarters are 
authorized to return to an applicant, without action, any second or 
subsequent application that is based upon essentially the same grounds, 
or supported by essentially the same evidence, as a previous application 
disapproved by the military service concerned.
    (h) The provisions of this part will not be used to effect the 
administrative separation of individuals who do not qualify as 
conscientious objectors, or in lieu of administrative separation 
procedures such as those provided for unsuitability or unfitness or as 
otherwise set forth in part 41 of this title. Individuals determined not 
qualified for conscientious objector status, but the separation of whom 
would otherwise appear to be in the best interest of the Armed Forces, 
should be considered for administrative separation under the provisions 
of part 41 of this title. Under no circumstances will administrative 
separation of these individuals be effected pursuant to this part.
    (i) Nothing in this part prevents the administrative elimination, 
pursuant to law and regulations of the military department concerned, of 
any officer whose classification as a 1-A-O conscientious objector 
results in substandard performance of duty or other cause for 
elimination.


<R05>
Sec. 75.6  Procedure.

    (a) A member of the Armed Forces who seeks either separation or 
assignment to noncombatant duties by reason of conscientious objection 
will submit an application therefor. The applicant will indicate whether 
he is seeking a discharge or assignment to noncombatant duties and will 
include the following terms:
    (1) The personal information required by Sec. 75.9.
    (2) Any other items which the applicant desires to submit in support 
of his case.
    (b) Prior to processing the application of the individual, he will 
be (1) advised of the specific provisions of section 3103 of title 38, 
United States Code \1\ regarding the possible effects of discharge as a 
conscientious objector who refuses to perform military duty or refused 
to wear the uniform or otherwise to comply with lawful orders of 
competent military authority, and (2) required to execute the statement 
in Sec. 75.10.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 38 U.S.C. 3103 provides, in pertinent part, that the discharge 
of any person on the grounds that he was a conscientious objector who 
refused to perform military duty or refused to wear the uniform or 
otherwise to comply with lawful orders of competent military authority, 
shall bar all rights (except government insurance) of such persons under 
law administered by the Veterans' Administration based upon the period 
of service from which discharged or dismissed. The only exception is in 
cases in which it is established, to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator, that the member was insane.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) The applicant shall be personally interviewed by a chaplain who 
shall submit a written opinion as to the nature and basis of the 
applicant's claim, and as to the applicant's sincerity and depth of 
conviction. The chaplain's report shall include the reasons for his 
conclusions. In addition, the applicant will be interviewed by a 
psychiatrist (or by a medical officer if a psychiatrist is not 
reasonably available) who shall submit a written report of psychiatric 
evaluation indicating the presence or absence of any psychiatric 
disorder which would warrant treatment or disposition through medical 
channels, or such character or personality disorder as to warrant 
recommendation

[[Page 460]]

for appropriate administrative action. This opinion and report will 
become part of the case file. If the applicant refuses to participate or 
is uncooperative or unresponsive in the course of the interview, this 
fact will be included in the statement and report filed by the chaplain 
and psychiatrist or medical officer.
    (d) Commanders at levels directed by the Service Headquarters will 
appoint an officer in the grade of O-3 or higher to investigate the 
applicant's claim. The officer so appointed will not be an individual in 
the chain of command of the applicant. If the applicant is a 
commissioned officer, the investigating officer must be senior in both 
temporary and permanent grades to the applicant.
    (1) Upon appointment, the investigating officer will review the 
applicable service regulations which implement this part. During the 
course of his investigation, the investigating officer will obtain all 
necessary legal advice from the local Staff Judge Advocate or legal 
officer.
    (2) The investigating officer will conduct a hearing on the 
application. The purpose of the hearing is: To afford the applicant an 
opportunity to present evidence he desires in support of his 
application; to enable the investigating officer to ascertain and 
assemble all relevant facts; to create a comprehensive record; and to 
facilitate an informed recommendation by the investigating officer and 
an informed decision on the merits by higher authority. In this regard, 
any failure or refusal of the applicant to submit to questioning under 
oath or affirmation before the investigating officer may be considered 
by the officer making his recommendation and evaluation of the 
applicant's claim. If the applicant fails to appear at the hearing 
without good cause, the investigating officer may proceed in his absence 
and the applicant will be deemed to have waived his appearance.
    (i) If the applicant desires, he shall be entitled to be represented 
by counsel, at his own expense, who shall be permitted to be present at 
the hearings, assist the applicant in the presentation of his case, and 
examine all items in the file.
    (ii) The hearing will be informal in character and will not be 
governed by the rules of evidence employed by courts-martial except that 
all oral testimony presented shall be under oath or affirmation. Any 
relevant evidence may be received. Statements obtained from persons not 
present at the hearing need not be made under oath or affirmation. The 
hearing is not an adversary proceeding.
    (iii) The applicant may submit any additional evidence that he 
desires (including sworn or unsworn statements) and present any 
witnesses in his own behalf, but he shall be responsible for securing 
their attendance. The installation or local commander will render all 
reasonable assistance in making available military members of his 
command requested by the applicant as witnesses. Further, the applicant 
will be permitted to question any other witnesses who appear and to 
examine all items in the file.
    (iv) A verbatim record of the hearing is not required. If the 
applicant desires such a record and agrees to provide it at his own 
expense, he may do so. If he elects to provide such a record, he shall 
make a copy thereof available to the investigating officer, at no 
expense to the Government, at the conclusion of the hearing. In the 
absence of a verbatim record, the investigating officer will summarize 
the testimony of witnesses and permit the applicant or his counsel to 
examine the summaries and note for the record their differences with the 
investigating officer's summary. Copies of statements and other 
documents received in evidence will be made a part of the hearing 
record.
    (3) At the conclusion of the investigation, the investigating 
officer will prepare a written report which will contain the following:
    (i) A statement as to whether the applicant appeared, whether he was 
accompanied by counsel, and, if so, the latter's identity, and whether 
the nature and purpose of the hearing were explained to the applicant 
and understood by him.
    (ii) Any documents, statements and other material received during 
the investigation.
    (iii) Summaries of the testimony of the witnesses presented (or a 
verbatim

[[Page 461]]

record of the testimony if such record was made).
    (iv) A statement of the investigating officer's conclusions as to 
the underlying basis of the applicant's conscientious objection and the 
sincerity of the applicant's beliefs, including his reasons for such 
conclusions.
    (v) Subject to Sec. 75.5(e), the investigating officer's 
recommendations for disposition of the case, including his reasons 
therefor. The actions recommended will be limited to the following:
    (a) Denial of any classification as a conscientious objector; or
    (b) Classification as 1-A-O conscientious objector; or
    (c) Classification as 1-O conscientious objector.
    (vi) The investigating officer's report, along with the individual's 
application, all interviews with chaplains or doctors, evidence received 
as a result of the investigating officer's hearing, and any other items 
submitted by the applicant in support of his case will constitute the 
record. The investigating officer's conclusions and recommended 
disposition will be based on the entire record and not merely on the 
evidence produced at the hearings. A copy of the record will be 
furnished to the applicant at the time it is forwarded to the commander 
who appointed the investigating officer, and the applicant will be 
informed that he has the right to submit a rebuttal to the report within 
the time prescribed by the military service concerned.
    (e) The record of the case will be forwarded to the headquarters of 
the officer who appointed the investigating officer where it shall be 
reviewed for completeness and legal sufficiency. If necessary, the case 
may be returned to the investigating office for further investigation. 
When the record is complete, the authority who appointed the 
investigating officer shall forward it with his personal recommendation 
for disposition, and the reasons therefor, through the appropriate chain 
of command to headquarters of the military service concerned.
    (f) The headquarters of the military service concerned will make a 
final decision based on the entire record. Any additional information 
other than the official service record of the applicant considered by 
the headquarters of the military service concerned which is adverse to 
the applicant, and which the applicant has not had an opportunity to 
comment upon or refute, will be made a part of the record and the 
applicant shall be given an opportunity to comment upon or refute the 
material before a final decision is made. The reasons for an adverse 
decision will be made a part of the record and will be provided to the 
individual.
    (g) Processing of applications need not be abated by the 
unauthorized absence of the applicant subsequent to the initiation of 
the application, or by the institution of disciplinary action or 
administrative separation proceedings against him. However, an applicant 
whose request for classification as a conscientious objector has been 
approved will not be discharged until all disciplinary action has been 
resolved.
    (h) To the extent practicable under the circumstances, during the 
period applications are being processed and until a decision is made by 
the headquarters of the service concerned, every effort will be made to 
assign applicants to duties within the command to which they are 
assigned which will conflict as little as possible with their asserted 
beliefs. However, members desiring to file application who are on orders 
for reassignment may be required by the military service concerned to 
submit applications at their next permanent duty station. During the 
period applications are being processed, applicants will be expected to 
conform to the normal requirements of military service and to perform 
satisfactorily such duties to which they are assigned. Applicants may be 
disciplined for violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice while 
awaiting action on their applications.


<R05>
Sec. 75.7  Action after decision.

    (a) Applicants requesting discharge who are determined to be 1-O 
conscientious objectors by the headquarters of the service concerned 
will be discharged for the convenience of the Government with entry in 
personnel records and discharge papers that the reason for separation is 
conscientious objection. The type of discharge issued

[[Page 462]]

will be governed by the applicant's general military record and the 
pertinent provisions of part 41 of this title. The Director of the 
Selective Service System will be promptly notified of the discharge of 
those who have served less than one hundred and eighty (180) days in the 
Armed Forces. Pending separation, the applicant will continue to be 
assigned duties providing the minimum practicable conflict with his 
professed beliefs and will be expected to conform to the normal 
requirements of military service and to perform satisfactorily such 
duties to which he is assigned. Applicants may be disciplined for 
violations under the Uniform Code of Military Justice while awaiting 
discharge.
    (b) Applicants requesting assignment to noncombatant duties who are 
determined to be class 1-A-O conscientious objectors by the military 
department shall be (1) assigned to noncombatant duty as defined in 
Sec. 75.3, or (2) discharged from military service or released from 
active duty, at the discretion of the military department. Each 
applicant will be required to execute the statement in Sec. 75.11.
    (c) Persons who are assigned to noncombatant duties, and persons who 
are assigned to normal military duties by reason of disapproval of their 
applications, will be expected to conform to the normal requirements of 
military service and to perform satisfactorily such duties to which they 
are assigned. Violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice by 
these members will be treated as in any other situation.


<R05>
Sec. 75.8  Claims of erroneous induction.

    (a) This section applies to any individual who claims that he is a 
conscientious objector and was either erroneously inducted, or 
erroneously assigned to combatant training or duty, for any of the 
following reasons:
    (1) Although determined to be a conscientious objector by a local 
board or appellate agency of the Selective Service System, his records 
failed to reflect classification as such.
    (2) He was denied a significant procedural right in the 
classification process by the Selective Service System.
    (3) Despite actual classification as a conscientious objector 
properly reflected in his records, he was nevertheless erroneously 
inducted, or assigned to combatant training or duty.

Claims based on alleged erroneous determinations made on the merits of 
the case by the Selective Service System are not covered by this 
section. (See Sec. 75.4.)
    (b) Claims covered by paragraph (a) of this section will be referred 
to the Selective Service System without delay for investigation and 
ascertainment of the facts. Communication will be transmitted to the 
National Headquarters, Selective Service System, Washington, DC 20435.
    (1) If the Selective Service System advises that induction was in 
fact erroneous under paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(3) of this section, the 
claimant will be separated or assigned to noncombatant duties depending 
upon whether he was classified 1-O or 1-A-O.
    (2) If the Selective Service System advises that there was in fact a 
denial of a right or a significant procedural error in the evaluation of 
a claim under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the induction will be 
considered erroneous and the individual discharged.
    (3) If the Selective Service System advises that any claim under 
paragraph (a) of this section is unfounded or makes a final 
determination adverse to any claim, the claimant will be so informed and 
returned to general duty.
    (c) Pending investigation and resolution of all claims covered by 
this section, a claimant will be assigned to duties which conflict as 
little as practicable with his asserted beliefs, insofar as is 
consistent with the effectiveness and efficiency of the military forces.


<R05>
Sec. 75.9  Required information to be supplied by applicants for discharge 
or noncombatant service.

    Each person seeking release from active service from the Armed 
Forces, or assignment to noncombatant duties, as a conscientious 
objector, will provide the information indicated below as the minimum 
required for consideration of his request. This in no way bars the 
military departments from requiring such additional information as they 
desire. The individual may submit such other information as desired.

[[Page 463]]

    (a) General information concerning applicant. (1) Full name.
    (2) Military serial number; and social security account number.

    (12) When the applicant has served less than one hundred and eighty 
(180) days in the military service, a statement by him as to whether he 
is willing to perform work under the selective service civilian work

<R05>
Sec. 75.10  Statement (counseling concerning Veterans Administration 
benefits).

    I have been advised of the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3103 concerning 
possible nonentitlement to benefits administered by the Veterans 
Administration due to discharge from the military service as a 
conscientious objector under certain conditions. I understand that a 
discharge as a conscientious objector, who refused to perform military 
duty or otherwise to comply with lawful orders of competent military 
authority, shall bar all rights, based upon the period of service from 
which discharged, under any laws administered by the Veterans 
Administration except my legal entitlement (if any) to any war risks, 
government (converted) or National Service Life Insurance.


<R05>
Sec. 75.11  Statement (counseling concerning designation as conscientious 
objector).

    I have been counseled concerning designation as a conscientious 
objector. Based on my religious training and belief, I consider myself 
to be a conscientious objector within the meaning of the statute and 
regulations governing conscientious objectors and am conscientiously 
opposed to participation in combatant training and service. I request 
assignment to noncombatant duties for the remainder of my term of 
service. I fully understand that on expiration of my current term of 
service I am not eligible for voluntary enlistment, reenlistment, or 
active service in the Armed Forces.

<R05>
Sec. 78.1  Purpose.

    Under 10 U.S.C. 1045, this part provides implementing guidance for 
voluntary State tax withholding from the retired pay of uniformed 
Service members.


<R05>
Sec. 78.2  Applicability and scope.

    (a) This part applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the 
Military Departments, the Coast Guard (under agreement with the 
Department of Transportation), the Public Health Service (PHS) (under 
agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services and the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (under agreement 
with the Department of Commerce). The term ``Uniformed Services,'' as 
used herein, refers to the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast 
Guard, commissioned corps of the PHS, and the Commissioned corps of the 
NOAA.
    (b) It covers members retired from the regular and reserve 
components of the Uniformed Services who are receiving retired pay.


<R05>
Sec. 78.3  Definitions.

    (a) Income tax. Any form of tax under a State statute where the 
collection of that tax either imposes on employers generally the duty of 
withholding sums from the compensation of employees and making returns 
of such sums to the State, or grants employers generally the authority 
to withhold sums from the compensation of employees if any employee 
voluntarily elects to have such sum withheld. And, the duty to withhold 
generally is imposed, or the authority to withhold generally is granted, 
with respect to the compensation of employees who are residents of such 
State.
    (b) Member. A person originally appointed or enlisted in, or 
conscripted into, a Uniformed Service who has retired from the regular 
or reserve component of the Uniformed Service concerned.
    (c) Retired pay. Pay and benefits received by a member based on 
conditions of the retirement law, pay grade, years of service, date of 
retirement, transfer to the Fleet Reserve or Fleet Marine Corps Reserve, 
or disability. It also is known as retainer pay.
    (d) State. Any State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, and any territory or possession of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 78.4  Policy.

    (a) It is the policy of the Uniformed Services to accept written 
requests from members for voluntary income tax withholding from retired 
pay when the Department of Defense has an agreement for such withholding 
with the State named in the request.
    (b) The Department of Defense shall enter into an agreement for the 
voluntary withholding of State income taxes from retired pay with any 
State within 120 days of a request for agreement from the proper State 
official. The agreement shall provide that the Uniformed Services shall 
withhold State income tax from the monthly retired pay of any member who 
voluntarily requests such withholding in writing.


<R05>
Sec. 78.5  Procedures.

    (a) The Uniformed Services shall comply with the payment 
requirements of the state, city, or county tax laws. Therefore, the 
payment requirements (biweekly, monthly, or quarterly) of the state, 
city, or county tax laws currently in effect will be observed by the 
Uniformed Services. However, payment will not be made more frequently 
than required by the state, city, or county, or more frequently than the 
payroll is paid by the Uniformed Services. Payment procedures shall 
conform, to the extent practicable, to the usual fiscal practices of the 
Uniformed Services.
    (b) A member may request that the State designated for withholding 
be changed and that the subsequent withholdings be remitted as amended. 
A member may revoke his or her request for withholding at any time. Any 
request for a change in the State designated or any revocation is 
effective on the first day of the month after the month in which the 
request or revocation is processed by the Uniformed Service concerned, 
but in no event later than on the first day of the second month 
beginning after the day on which the request or revocation is received 
by the Uniformed Service concerned.

[[Page 476]]

    (c) A member may have in effect at any time only one request for 
withholding under this part. A member may not have more than two such 
requests in effect during any one calendar year.
    (d) The agreements with States may not impose more burdensome 
requirements on the United States than on employers generally or subject 
the United States, or any member, to a penalty or liability because of 
such agreements.
    (e) The Uniformed Services shall perform the services under this 
part without accepting payment from States for such services.
    (f) The Uniformed Services may honor a retiree's request for refund 
until a payment has been made to the State. After that, the retiree may 
seek a refund of any State tax overpayment by filing the appropriate 
State tax form with the State that received the voluntary withholding 
payments. The Uniformed Services may honor a retiree's request for 
refund until a payment has been made to the State. State refunds will be 
in accordance with State income tax policy and procedures.
    (g) A member may request voluntary tax withholding by writing the 
retired pay office of his or her Uniformed Service. The request shall 
include: The member's full name, social security number, the fixed 
amount to be withheld monthly from retired pay, the State designated to 
receive the withholding, and the member's current residence address. The 
request shall be signed by the member, or in the case of incompetence, 
his or her guardian or trustee. The amount of the request for State tax 
withholding must be an even dollar amount, not less than $10 or less 
than the State's minimum withholding amount, if higher. The Uniformed 
Services' retired pay office addresses are given as follows:
    (1) Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Attn: DFAS/PRR/CL, 1240 
East Ninth Street, Cleveland, OH 44199-2055.
    (2) Coast Guard: Commanding Officer (RPB), U.S. Coast Guard Human 
Resources Service and Information Center, 444 S. E. Quincy Street,

    (4) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Commanding 
Officer (RPB), U.S. Coast Guard Human Resources Service and Information 
Center, 444 S. E. Quincy Street, Topeka, KS 66683-3591.
    (h) If a member's retired pay is not sufficient to satisfy a 
member's request for a voluntary State tax, then the withholding will 
cease. A member may initiate a new request when such member's retired 
pay is restored in an amount sufficient to satisfy the withholding 
request.
    (i) A State requesting an agreement for the voluntary withholding of 
State tax from the retired pay of members of the Uniformed Services 
shall indicate, in writing, its agreement to be bound by the provisions 
of this part. If the State proposes an agreement that varies from the 
Standard Agreement, the State shall indicate which provisions of the 
Standard Agreement are not acceptable and propose substitute provisions. 
The letter shall be addressed to the Director, Defense Finance and 
Accounting Service, 1931 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22240. 
To be effective, the letter must be signed by a State official 
authorized to bind the State under an agreement for tax withholding. 
Copies of applicable State laws that authorize employers to withhold 
State income tax and authorize the official to bind the State under an 
agreement for tax withholding shall be enclosed with the letter. The 
letter also shall indicate the title and address of the official whom 
the Uniformed Services may contact to obtain information necessary for 
implementing withholding.
    (j) Within 120 days of the receipt of a letter from a State, the 
Director, Defense Finance and Accounting Service, or designee, will 
notify the State, in writing, that DoD has either entered into the 
Standard Agreement or that an agreement cannot be entered into with the 
State and the reasons for that determination.

    This part:
    (a) Applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Military 
Departments, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Joint 
Staff, the Unified and Specified Commands, the Inspector General of the 
Department of Defense, the Defense Agencies, and the DoD Field Agencies 
(hereafter referred to collectively as ``the DoD Components'').
    (b) Encompasses infants, toddlers, preschool children, and children 
receiving or entitled to receive early intervention services or special 
educational instruction from the DoD on installations with Section 6 
School Arrangements, and the parents of those individuals with

<R05>
Sec. 80.3  Definitions.

    (a) Assistive technology device. Any item, piece of equipment, or 
product system, whether acquired commercially or off the shelf, 
modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve 
functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities.
    (b) Assistive technology service. Any service that directly assists 
an individual with a disability in the selection, acquisition, or use of 
an assistive technology device. This term includes:
    (1) Evaluating the needs of an individual with a disability, 
including a functional evaluation of the individual in the individual's 
customary environment.
    (2) Purchasing, leasing, or otherwise providing for the acquisition 
of assistive technology devices by individuals with disabilities.
    (3) Selecting designing, fitting, customizing, adapting, applying, 
maintaining, repairing, or replacing of assistive technology devices.
    (4) Coordinating and using other therapies, interventions, or 
services with assistive technology devices, such as those associated 
with existing educational and rehabilitative plans and programs.

[[Page 479]]

    (5) Training or technical assistance for an individual with 
disabilities, or, where appropriate, the family of an individual with 
disabilities.
    (6) Training or technical assistance for professionals (including 
individuals providing educational rehabilitative services), employers, 
or other individuals who provide services to, employ, or are otherwise 
substantially involved in the major life functions of an individual with 
a disability.
    (c) Attention deficit disorder (ADD). As used to define students, 
encompasses attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and attention 
deficit disorder without hyperactivity. The essential features of this 
disorder are developmentally inappropriate degrees of inattention, 
impulsiveness, and hyperactivity.
    (1) A diagnosis of ADD may be made only after the child is evaluated 
by appropriate medical personnel, and evaluation procedures set forth in 
this part (appendix B to this part) are followed.
    (2) A diagnosis of ADD, in and of itself, does not mean that a child 
requires special education; it is possible that a child diagnosed with 
ADD, as the only finding, can have his or her educational needs met 
within the regular education setting.
    (3) For a child with ADD to be eligible for special education, the 
Case Study Committee, with assistance from the medical personnel 
conducting the evaluation, must then make a determination that the ADD 
is a chronic or acute health problem that results in limited alertness, 
which adversely affects educational performance. Children with ADD who 
are eligible for special education and medically related services will 
qualify for services under ``Other Health Impaired'' as described in 
Criterion A, paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
    (d) Autism. A developmental disability significantly affecting 
verbal and non-verbal communication and social interaction generally 
evident before age 3 that adversely affects educational performance. 
Characteristics of autism include irregularities and impairments in 
communication, engagement in repetitive activities and stereotyped 
movements, resistance to environmental change or change in daily 
routines, and unusual responses to sensory experiences. The term does 
not include children with characteristics of the disability of serious 
emotional disturbance.
    (e) Case Study Committee (CSC). A school-based committee that 
determines a child's eligibility for special education, develops and 
reviews a child's individualized education program (IEP), and determines 
appropriate placement in the least restrictive environment. A CSC is 
uniquely composed for each child. Participants on a CSC must include:
    (1) The designated representative of the Section 6 School 
Arrangement, who is qualified to supervise the provision of special 
education. Such representative may not be the child's special education 
teacher.
    (2) One, or more, of the child's regular education teachers, if 
appropriate.
    (3) A special education teacher.
    (4) One, or both, of the child's parents.
    (5) The child, if appropriate.
    (6) A member of the evaluation team or another person knowledgeable 
about the evaluation procedures used with the child.
    (7) Other individuals, at the discretion of the parent or the 
Section 6 School Arrangement, who may have pertinent information.
    (f) Child-find. The ongoing process used by the Military Services 
and a Section 6 School Arrangement to seek and identify children (from 
birth to 21 years of age) who show indications that they might be in 
need of early intervention services or special education and related 
services. Child-find activities include the dissemination of information 
to the public and identification, screening, and referral procedures.
    (g) Children with disabilities ages 5-21 (inclusive). Those children 
ages 5-21 years (inclusive), evaluated in accordance with this part, who 
are in need of special education as determined by a CSC and who have not 
been graduated from a high school or who have not completed the 
requirements for a General Education Diploma. The terms ``child'' and 
``student'' may also be used to refer to this population. The student 
must be determined eligible

[[Page 480]]

under one of the following four categories:
    (1) Criterion A. The educational performance of the student is 
adversely affected, as determined by the CSC, by a physical impairment; 
visual impairment including blindness; hearing impairment including 
deafness; orthopedic impairment; or other health impairment, including 
ADD, when the condition is a chronic or acute health problem that 
results in limited alertness; autism; and traumatic brain injury 
requiring environmental and/or academic modifications.
    (2) Criterion B. A student who manifests a psychoemotional condition 
that is the primary cause of educational difficulties; a student who 
exhibits maladaptive behavior to a marked degree and over a long period 
of time that interferes with skill attainment, classroom functioning or 
performance, social-emotional condition, and who as a result requires 
special education. The term does not usually include a student whose 
difficulties are primarily the result of:
    (i) Intellectual deficit;
    (ii) Sensory or physical impairment;
    (iii) Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;
    (iv) Antisocial behavior;
    (v) Parent-child or family problems;

disorder.
    (3) Criterion C. The educational performance of the student is 
adversely affected, as determined by the CSC, by a speech and/or 
language impairment.
    (4) Criterion D. The measured academic achievement of the student in 
math, reading, or language is determined by the CSC to be adversely 
affected by underlying disabilities (including mental retardation and 
specific learning disability) including either an intellectual deficit 
or an information processing deficit.
    (5) Criterion E. A child, 0-5 inclusive, whose functioning level as 
determined by the CSC, is developmentally delayed and would qualify for 
special education and related services as determined by this regulation.
    (h) Consent. This term means that:
    (1) The parent of an infant, toddler, child, or preschool child with 
a disability has been fully informed, in his or her native language, or 
in another mode of communication, of all information relevant to the 
activity for which permission is sought.
    (2) The parent understands and agrees in writing to the 
implementation of the activity for which his or her permission is 
sought. The writing must describe that activity, list the child's 
records that will be released and to whom, and acknowledge that the 
parent understands consent is voluntary and may be prospectively revoked 
at any time.
    (3) The parent of an infant, toddler, preschool child or child must 
consent to the release of records. The request for permission must 
describe that activity, list each individual's records that will be 
released and to whom, and acknowledge that the parent understands that 
consent is voluntary and may be prospectively revoked at any time.
    (4) The written consent of a parent of an infant or toddler with a 
disability is necessary for implementation of early intervention 
services described in the individualized family service plan (IFSP). If 
such parent does not provide consent with respect to a particular early 
intervention service, then the early intervention services for which 
consent is obtained shall be provided.
    (i) Deaf. A hearing loss or deficit so severe that the child is 
impaired in processing linguistic information through hearing, with or 
without amplification, to the extent that his or her educational 
performance is adversely affected.
    (j) Deaf-blind. Concomitant hearing and visual impairments, the 
combination of which causes such severe communication and other 
developmental and educational problems that they cannot be accommodated 
in special education programs solely for children with deafness or 
children with blindness.

    g. During the pending of any proceeding under appendix C to this 
part, unless the Military Department concerned and the parent(s) 
otherwise agree, the infant or toddler shall continue to receive the 
early intervention services currently being provided, or, if applying 
for initial services, shall receive the services not in dispute.

   Appendix B to Part 80--Procedures for Special Educational Programs 
 (Including Related Services) for Preschool Children and Children with 
                   Disabilities (3-21 years Inclusive)

                     A. Identification and Screening

    1. Each Section 6 School Arrangement shall locate, identify, and, 
with the consent of a parent of each preschool child or child, evaluate 
all preschool children or children who are receiving or are entitled to 
receive an education from Section 6 School Arrangements and who may need 
special education and/or related services.
    2. Each Section 6 School Arrangement shall:
    a. Provide screening, through the review of incoming records and the 
use of basic skills tests in reading, language arts, and mathematics, to 
determine whether a preschool child or child may be in need of special 
education and related services.
    b. Analyze school health data for those preschool children and 
children who demonstrate possible disabling conditions. Such data shall 
include:
    (1) Results of formal hearing, vision, speech, and language tests.
    (2) Reports from medical practitioners.
    (3) Reports from other appropriate professional health personnel as 
may be necessary, under this part, to aid in identifying possible 
disabling conditions.
    c. Analyze other pertinent information, including suspensions, 
exclusions, other disciplinary actions, and withdrawals, compiled and 
maintained by Section 6 School Arrangements that may aid in identifying 
possible disabling conditions.
    3. Each Section 6 School Arrangement, in cooperation with cognizant 
authorities at the installation on which the Section 6 School 
Arrangement is located, shall conduct ongoing child-find activities that 
are designed to identify all infants, toddlers, preschool children, and 
children with possible disabling conditions who reside on the 
installation or who otherwise either are entitled, or will be entitled, 
to receive services under this part.
    a. If an element of the Section 6 School Arrangement, a qualified 
professional authorized to provide related services, a parent, or other 
individual believes that an infant, toddler, preschool child or child 
has a possible disabling condition, that individual shall be referred to 
the appropriate CSC or early intervention coordinator.
    b. A Section 6 School Arrangement CSC shall work in cooperation with 
the Military Departments in identifying infants, toddlers, preschool 
children and children with disabilities (birth to 21 years inclusive).

                        B. Evaluation Procedures

    1. Each CSC will provide a full and comprehensive diagnostic 
evaluation of special educational, and related service needs to any 
preschool child or child who is receiving, or entitled to receive, 
educational instruction from a Section 6 School Arrangement, operated by 
the Department of Defense under Directive 1342.21, and who is referred 
to a CSC for a possible disability. The evaluation will be conducted 
before any action is taken on the development of the IEP or placement in 
a special education program.
    2. Assessment materials, evaluation procedures, and tests shall be:
    a. Racially and culturally nondiscriminatory.
    b. Administered in the native language or mode of communication of 
the preschool child or child unless it clearly is not feasible to do so.
    c. Validated for the specific purpose for which they are used or 
intended to be used.
    d. Administered by qualified personnel, such as a special educator, 
school psychologist, speech therapist, or a reading specialist, in 
conformity with the instructions provided by the producers of the 
testing device.
    e. Administered in a manner so that no single procedure is the sole 
criterion for determining eligibility and an appropriate educational 
program for a disabled preschool child or child.
    f. selected to assess specific areas of educational strengths and 
needs, not merely to provide a single general intelligence quotient.
    3. The evaluation shall be conducted by a multidisciplinary team and 
shall include a teacher or other specialist with knowledge in the areas 
of the suspected disability.

[[Page 494]]

    4. The preschool child or child shall be evaluated in all areas 
related to the suspected disability. When necessary, the evaluation 
shall include:
    a. The current level of academic functioning, to include general 
intelligence.
    b. Visual and auditory acuity.
    c. Social and emotional status, to include social functioning within 
the educational environment and within the family.
    d. Current physical status, including perceptual and motor 
abilities.
    e. Vocational transitional assessment (for children ages 14-21 years 
(inclusive)).
    5. The appropriate CSC shall met as soon as possible after the 
preschool child's or child's formal evaluation to determine whether he 
or she is in need of special education and related services. The 
preschool child's or child's parents shall be invited to the meeting and 
afforded the opportunity to participate in such a meeting.
    6. The school CSC shall issue a written report that contains:
    a. A review of the formal and informal diagnostic evaluation 
findings of the multidisciplinary team.
    b. A summary of information from the parents, the preschool child or 
child, or other persons having significant previous contact with the 
preschool child or child.
    c. A description of the preschool child's or child's current 
academic progress, including a statement of his or her learning style.
    d. A description of the nature and severity of the preschool child's 
or child's disability(ies).
    7. A preschool child or child with a disability shall receive an 
individual comprehensive diagnostic evaluation every 3 years, or more 
frequently if conditions warrant, or if the preschool child's or child's 
parent, teacher, or related service provider requests an evaluation. The 
scope and nature of the reevaluation shall be determined individually, 
based upon the preschool child's or child's performance, behavior, and 
needs when the reevaluation is conducted, and be used to update or 
revise the IEP.

                C. Individualized Education Program (IEP)

    1. Section 6 School Arrangements shall ensure that an IEP is 
developed and implemented for each preschool child or child with a 
disability enrolled in a Section 6 School Arrangement or placed on 
another institution by a Section 6 School Arrangement CSC under this 
part.
    2. Each IEP shall include:
    a. A statement of the preschool child's or child's present levels of 
educational performance.
    b. A statement of annual goals, including short-term instructional 
objectives.
    c. A statement of the specific special educational services and 
related services to be provided to the preschool child or child 
(including the frequency, number of times per week/month and intensity, 
amount of times each day) and the extent to which the preschool child or 
child may be able to participate in regular educational programs.
    d. The projected anticipated date for the initiation and the 
anticipated length of such activities and services.
    e. Appropriate objective criteria and evaluation procedures and 
schedules for determining, on an annual basis, whether educational goals 
and objectives are being achieved.
    f. A statement of the needed transition services for the child 
beginning no later than age 16 and annually thereafter (and when 
determined appropriate for the child, beginning at age 14 or younger) 
including, when appropriate, a statement of DoD Component 
responsibilities before the child leaves the school setting.
    3. Each preschool child or child with a disability shall be provided 
the opportunity to participate, with adaptations when appropriate, in 
the regular physical education program available to students without 
disabilities unless:
    a. The preschool child or child with a disability is enrolled full-
time in a separate facility; or
    b. The preschool child or child with a disability needs specially 
designed physical education, as prescribed in his or her IEP.
    4. If specially designed physical education services are prescribed 
in the IEP of a preschool child or child with a disability, the Section 
6 School Arrangement shall provide such education directly, or shall 
make arrangements for the services to be provided through a non-Section 
6 School Arrangement or another facility.
    5. Section 6 School Arrangements shall ensure that a preschool child 
or child with a disability, enrolled by a CSC in a separate facility, 
receives appropriate, physical education in compliance with this part.
    6. The IEP for each preschool child or child with a disability shall 
be developed and reviewed at least annually in meetings that include the 
following participants:
    a. The designated representative of the Section 6 School 
Arrangement, who is qualified to supervise the provision of special 
education. Such representative may not be the preschool child's or 
child's special education teacher.
    b. One, or more, of the preschool child's or child's regular 
education teachers, if appropriate.
    c. The preschool child's or child's special education teacher or 
teachers.
    d. One, or both, of the preschool child's or child's parents.
    e. The child, if appropriate.
    f. For a preschool child or child with a disability who has been 
evaluated, a member of the evaluation team or another person

[[Page 495]]

knowledgeable about the evaluation procedures used with that student and 
familiar with the results of the evaluation.
    g. Other individuals, at the reasonable discretion of the parent(s) 
or the school.
    7. Section 6 School Arrangements shall:
    2a. Ensure that an IEP meeting is held, normally within 10 working 
days, following a determination by the appropriate CSC that the 
preschool child or child is eligible to receive special education and/or 
related services.
    b. Address the needs of a preschool child or child with a current 
IEP who transfers from a school operated by the DoD in accordance with 
32 CFR part \1\ or from a Section 6 School Arrangement to a Section 6 
School Arrangement, by:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Copies of DoD Directive 1342.6 may be obtained, at cost, from 
the National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, 
Springfield, VA 22161.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1)Implementing the current IEP; or
    (2) Revising the current IEP with the consent of a parent; or
    (3) Initiating, with the consent of a parent, an evaluation of the 
preschool child or child, while continuing to provide appropriate 
services through a current IEP; or
    (4) Initiating, with the consent of the parent, an evaluation of the 
preschool child or child without the provision of the services in the 
current IEP; or
    (5) Initiating mediation, and if necessary, due process procedures.
    c. Afford the preschool child's or child's parent(s) the opportunity 
to participate in every IEP or CSC meeting about their preschool child 
or child by:
    (1) Providing the parent(s) adequate written notice of the purpose, 
time, and place of the meeting.
    (2) Attempting to schedule the meeting at a mutually agreeable time 
and place.
    8. If neither parent can attend the meeting, other methods to 
promote participation by a parent, such as telephone conservations and 
letters, shall be used.
    9. A meeting may be conducted without a parent in attendance if the 
Section 6 School Arrangement is unable to secure the attendance of the 
parent. In this case, the Section 6 School Arrangement must have written 
records of its attempts to arrange a mutually acceptable time and place.
    10. If the parent(s) attends the IEP meeting, the Section 6 School 
Arrangement shall take necessary action to ensure that at least one of 
the parents understands the proceedings at the meeting, including 
providing an interpreter for a parent who is deaf or whose native 
language is other than English.
    11. The section 6 School Arrangement shall give a parent a copy of 
the preschool child's IEP.
    12. Section 6 School Arrangements shall provide special education 
and related services, in accordance with an IEP, provided that the 
Department of Defense, its constituent elements, and its personnel, are 
not accountable if a preschool child or child does not achieve the 
growth projected in the IEP.
    13. Section 6 School Arrangements shall ensure that an IEP is 
developed and implemented for each preschool child or child with a 
disability whom the CSC places in a non-Section 6 School or other 
facility.

        D. Placement Procedures and Least Restrictive Environment

    1. The placement of a preschool child or child in any special 
education program by the Section 6 School Arrangement shall be made only 
under an IEP and after a determination has been made that such student 
has a disability and needs special education and/or related services.
    2. The Section 6 School Arrangement CSC shall identify the special 
education and related services to be provided under the IEP.
    3. A placement decision may not be implemented without the consent 
of a parent of the preschool child or child, except as otherwise 
provided in accordance with this part.
    4. The placement decision must be designed to educate a preschool 
child or child with a disability in the least restrictive environment so 
that such student is educated to the maximum extent appropriate with 
students who do not have disabilities. Special classes, separate 
schooling, or other removal of preschool children or children with 
disabilities from the regular educational environment shall occur only 
when the nature or severity of the disability is such that the preschool 
child or child with disabilities cannot be educated satisfactorily in 
the regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services, 
including related services.
    5. Each educational placement for a preschool child or child with a 
disability shall be:
    a. Determined at least annually by the appropriate CSC.
    b. Based on the preschool child or child's IEP.
    c. Located as close as possible to the residence of the parent who 
is sponsoring the preschool child or child for attendance in a Section 6 
School Arrangement.
    d. Designed to assign the preschool child or child to the school 
such student would attend if he or she were not a student with a 
disability, unless the IEP requires some other arrangement.
    e. Predicated on the consideration of all factors affecting the 
preschool child's or child's well-being, including the effects of 
separation from parent(s).
    f. To the maximum extent appropriate, designed so that the preschool 
child or child participates in school activities, including

[[Page 496]]

meals and recess periods, with students who do not have a disability.

      E. Children With Disabilities Placed in Non-Section 6 School 
                              Arrangements

    1. Before a Section 6 School Arrangement CSC, with the concurrence 
of the Section 6 School Arrangement Superintendent concerned, places a 
preschool child or child with a disability in a non-Section 6 School or 
facility, the Section 6 School CSC shall conduct a meeting in accordance 
with this part to initiate the development of an IEP for such student.
    2. Preschool children and children with disabilities eligible to 
receive instruction in Section 6 School Arrangements who are referred to 
another school or facility by the Section 6 School CSC have all the 
rights of students with disabilities who are attending the Section 6 
School Arrangement.
    a. If a Section 6 School Arrangement CSC places a preschool child or 
child with a disability in a non-Section 6 School Arrangement or 
facility as a means of providing special education and related services, 
the program of that facility, including nonmedical care, room, and 
board, as set forth in the student's IEP, must be at no cost to the 
student or the student's parents.
    b. A Section 6 School Arrangement CSC may place a preschool child or 
child with a disability in a non-Section 6 School Arrangement or 
facility only if required by an IEP. An IEP for a student placed in a 
non-Section 6 School is not valid until signed by the Section 6 School 
Arrangement Superintendent, or designee, who must have participated in 
the IEP meeting. The IEP shall include determinations that:
    (1) The Section 6 School Arrangement does not currently have, and 
cannot reasonably create, an educational program appropriate to meet the 
needs of the student with a disability.
    (2) The non-Section 6 School Arrangement or facility and its 
educational program conform to this part.
    3. A Section 6 School Arrangement is not responsible for the cost of 
a non-Section 6 School Arrangement placement when placement is made 
unilaterally, without the approval of the cognizant CSC and the 
Superintendent, unless it is directed by a hearing officer under 
appendix C of this part or a court of competent jurisdiction.

                        F. Procedural Safeguards

    1. Parents shall be given written notice before the Section 6 School 
Arrangement CSC proposes to initiate or change, or refuses to initiate 
or change, either the identification, evaluation, or educational 
placement of a preschool child or child receiving, or entitled to 
receive, special education and related services from a Section 6 School 
Arrangement, or the provision of a free appropriate public education by 
the Section 6 School Arrangement to the child. The notice shall fully 
inform a parent of the procedural rights conferred by this part and 
shall be given in the parent's native language, unless it clearly is not 
feasible to do so.
    2. The consent of a parent of a preschool child or child with a 
disability or suspected of having a disability shall be obtained before 
any:
    a. Initiation of formal evaluation procedures;
    b. Initial special educational placement; or
    c. Change in educational placement.
    3. If a parent refuses consent to any formal evaluation or initial 
placement in a special education program, the Section 6 School 
Arrangement Superintendent may initiate an impartial due process 
hearing, as provided in appendix C of this part to show why an 
evaluation or placement in a special education program should occur 
without such consent. If the hearing officer sustains the Section 6 
School Arrangement CSC position in the impartial due process hearing, 
the appropriate CSC may evaluate or provide special education and 
related services to the preschool child or child without the consent of 
a parent, subject to the parent's due process rights.
    4. A parent is entitled to an independent evaluation of his or her 
preschool child or child at the Section 6 School Arrangement's expense, 
if the parent disagrees with the findings of an evaluation of the 
student conducted by the school and the parent successfully challenges 
the evaluation in an impartial due process hearing.
    a. If an independent evaluation is provided at the expense of a 
Section 6 School Arrangement, it must meet the following criteria:
    (1) Conform to the requirements of this part.
    (2) Be conducted, when possible, within the area where the preschool 
child or child resides.
    (3) Meet applicable DoD standards governing persons qualified to 
conduct an evaluation.
    b. If the final decision rendered in an impartial due process 
hearing sustains the evaluation of the Section 6 School Arrangement CSC, 
the parent has the right to an independent evaluation, but not at the 
expense of the Department of Defense or any DoD Component.
    5. The parents of a preschool child or child with a disability shall 
be afforded an opportunity to inspect and review all relevant 
educational records concerning the identification, evaluation, and 
educational placement of such student, and the provision of a free 
appropriate public education to him or her.
    6. Upon complaint presented in a written petition, the parent of a 
preschool child or

[[Page 497]]

child with a disability or the Section 6 School System shall have the 
opportunity for an impartial due process hearing provided by the 
Department of Defense as prescribed by appendix C of this part.
    7. During the pendency of any impartial due process hearing or 
judicial proceeding on the identification, evaluation, or educational 
placement of a preschool child or child with a disability receiving an 
education from a Section 6 School Arrangement or the provision of a free 
appropriate public education to such a student, unless the Section 6 
School Arrangement and a parent of the student agree otherwise, the 
student shall remain in his or her present educational placement, 
subject to the disciplinary procedures prescribed in this part.
    8. If a preschool child or child with a disability, without a 
current IEP, who is entitled to receive educational instruction from a 
Section 6 School Arrangement is applying for initial admission to a 
Section 6 School Arrangement, that student shall enter that Arrangement 
on the same basis as a student without a disability.
    9. The parent of a preschool child or child with a disability or a 
Section 6 School Arrangement employee may file a written communication 
with the Section 6 School Arrangement Superintendent about possible 
general violations of this part or Pub. L. 101-476, as amended. Such 
communications will not be treated as complaints under appendix C of 
this part.

                       G. Disciplinary Procedures

    1. All regular disciplinary rules and procedures applicable to 
students receiving educational instruction in the Section 6 School 
Arrangements shall apply to preschool children and children with 
disabilities who violate school rules and regulations or disrupt regular 
classroom activities, subject to the provisions of this section.
    2. The appropriate CSC shall determine whether the conduct of a 
preschool child or child with a disability is the result of that 
disability before the long-term suspension (10 consecutive or cumulative 
days during the school year) or the expulsion of that student.
    3. If the CSC determines that the conduct of such a preschool child 
or child with a disability results in whole or part from his or her 
disability, that student may not be subject to any regular disciplinary 
rules and procedures; and
    a. The student's parent shall be notified in accordance with this 
part of the right to have an IEP meeting before any change in the 
student's special education placement. (A termination of the student's 
education for more than 10 days, either cumulative or consecutive, 
constitutes a change of placement.)
    b. The Section 6 School Arrangement CSC or another authorized school 
official shall ensure that an IEP meeting is held to determine the 
appropriate educational placement for the student in consideration of 
his or her conduct before the tenth cumulative day of the student's 
suspension or an expulsion.
    4. A preschool child or child with a disability shall neither be 
suspended for more than 10 days nor expelled, and his or her educational 
placement shall not otherwise be changed for disciplinary reasons, 
unless in accordance with this section, except that:
    a. This section shall be applicable only to preschool children and 
children determined to have a disability under this part.
    b. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the emergency suspension 
of any preschool child or child with a disability who endangers or 
reasonable appears to endanger the health, welfare, or safety of himself 
or herself, or any other student, teacher, or school personnel, provided 
that:
    (1) The appropriate Section 6 School Arrangement CSC shall 
immediately meet to determine whether the preschool child's or child's 
conduct results from his or her disability and what change in special 
education placement is appropriate for that student.
    (2) The child's parent(s) shall be notified immediately of the 
student's suspension and of the time, purpose, and location of the CSC 
meeting and their right to attend the meeting.
    (3) A component is included in the IEP that addresses the behavioral 
needs of the student.
    (4) The suspension of the student is only effective for the duration 
of the emergency.

                Appendix C to Part 80--Hearing Procedures

                               A. Purpose

    This appendix establishes adjudicative requirements whereby the 
parents of infants, toddlers, preschool children, and children who are 
covered by this part and, as the case may be, the cognizant Military 
Department or Section 6 School System are afforded impartial due process 
hearings and administrative appeals on the early intervention services 
or identification, evaluation, and educational placement of, and the 
free appropriate public education provided to, such children by the 
Department of Defense, in accordance with Pub. L. 101-476, as amended, 
20 U.S.C. sec. 1401 et seq.; Pub. L. 81-874, sec. 6, as amended, 20 
U.S.C. sec. 241; Pub. L. 97-35, sec. 505(c), 20 U.S.C. sec. 241 note; 
and Pub. L. 102-119, sec. 23, 20 U.S.C. sec. 241(a).

                            B. Administration

    1. The Directorate for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) shall have administrative responsibility for the proceedings 
authorized by this appendix.

[[Page 498]]

    2. This appendix shall be administered to ensure that the findings, 
judgments, and determinations made are prompt, fair, and impartial.
    3. Impartial hearing officers, who shall be DOHA Administrative 
Judges, shall be appointed by the Director, DOHA, and shall be attorneys 
who are independent of the Section 6 School System or the Military 
Department concerned in proceedings conducted under this appendix. A 
parent shall have the right to be represented in such proceedings, at no 
cost to the government, by counsel and by persons with special knowledge 
or training with respect to the problems of individuals with 
disabilities. DOHA Department Counsel normally shall appear and 
represent the Section 6 School System in proceedings conducted under 
this appendix, when such proceedings involve a preschool child or child. 
When an infant or toddler is involved, the Military Department 
responsible under this part for delivering early intervention services 
shall either provide its own counsel or request counsel from DOHA.

                              C. Mediation

    1. Mediation can be initiated by either a parent or, as appropriate, 
the Military Department concerned or the Section 6 School System to 
resolve informally a disagreement on the early intervention services for 
an infant or toddler or the identification, evaluation, educational 
placement of, or the free appropriate public education provided to, a 
preschool child or child. The cognizant Military Department, rather than 
the Section 6 School System, shall participate in mediation involving 
early intervention services. Mediation shall consist of, but not be 
limited to, an informal discussion of the differences between the 
parties in an effort to resolve those differences. The parents and the 
appropriate school or Military Department officials may attend mediation 
sessions.
    2. Mediation must be conducted, attempted, or refused in writing by 
a parent of the infant, toddler, preschool child or child whose early 
intervention or special education services (including related services) 
are at issue before a request for, or initiation of, a hearing 
authorized by this appendix. Any request by the Section 6 School System 
or Military Department for a hearing under this appendix shall state how 
this requirement has been satisfied. No stigma may be attached to the 
refusal of a parent to mediate or to an unsuccessful attempt to mediate.

                        D. Practice and Procedure

                               1. Hearing

    a. Should mediation be refused or otherwise fail to resolve the 
issues on the provision of early intervention services or a free, 
appropriate public education to a disabled infant, toddler, preschool 
child or child or the identification, evaluation, or educational 
placement of such an individual, the parent or either the school 
principal, on behalf of the Section 6 School System, or the military 
medical treatment facility commander, on behalf of the Military 
Department having jurisdiction over the infant or toddler, may request 
and shall receive a hearing before a hearing officer to resolve the 
matter. The parents of an infant, toddler, preschool child or child and 
the Section 6 School System or Military Department concerned shall be 
the only parties to a hearing conducted under this appendix.
    b. The party seeking the hearing shall submit a written request, in 
the form of a petition, setting forth the facts, issues, and proposed 
relief, to the Director, DOHA. The petitioner shall deliver a copy of 
the petition to the opposing party (that is, the parent or the school 
principal, on behalf of the Section 6 School System, or the military 
medical treatment facility commander, on behalf of the Military 
Department), either in person or by first-class mail, postage prepaid. 
Delivery is complete upon mailing. When the Section 6 School System or 
Military Department petitions for a hearing, it shall inform the other 
parties of the deadline for filing an answer under paragraph D.1.c. of 
this appendix, and shall provide the other parties with a copy of this 
part.
    c. An opposing party shall submit an answer to the petition to the 
Director, DOHA, with a copy to the petitioner, within 15 calendar days 
of receipt of the petition. The answer shall be as full and complete as 
possible, addressing the issues, facts, and proposed relief. The 
submission of the answer is complete upon mailing.
    d. Within 10 calendar days after receiving the petition, the 
Director, DOHA, shall assign a hearing officer, who then shall have 
jurisdiction over the resulting proceedings. The Director, DOHA, shall 
forward all pleadings to the hearing officer.
    e. The questions for adjudication shall be based on the petition and 
the answer, provided that a party may amend a pleading if the amendment 
is filed with the hearing officer and is received by the other parties 
at least 5 calendar days before the hearing.
    f. The Director, DOHA, shall arrange for the time and place of the 
hearing, and shall provide administrative support. Such arrangements 
shall be reasonably convenient to the parties.
    g. The purpose of a hearing is to establish the relevant facts 
necessary for the hearing officer to reach a fair and impartial 
determination of the case. Oral and documentary evidence that is 
relevant and material may be received. The technical rules of evidence 
shall be relaxed to permit the development of a full evidentiary record, 
with the Federal

[[Page 499]]

administrative decision and shall be in written form. It shall address 
the issues presented and set forth a rationale for the decision reached. 
A determination denying the appeal of a parent in whole or in part shall 
state that the parent has the right under Pub. L. 101-476, as amended, 
to bring a civil action on the matters in dispute in a district court of 
the United States without regard to the amount in controversy.
    5. No provision of this part or other DoD guidance may be construed

Sec. 85.3  Definitions.

    Health Promotion. Any combination of health education and related 
organizational, social, economic or health care interventions designed 
to facilitate behavioral and environmental alterations that will improve 
or protect health. It includes those activities intended to support and 
influence individuals in managing their own health through lifestyle 
decisions and selfcare. Operationally, health promotion includes smoking 
prevention and cessation, physical fitness, nutrition, stress 
management, alcohol and drug abuse prevention, and early identification 
of hypertension.

populations to establish and maintain dietary habits contributing to 
good health, disease prevention, and weight control. Weight control 
involves both nutrition and exercise, and is addressed in part in DoD

desire assistance in accordance with the provisions of 32 CFR parts 62a 
and 62 and DoD Instruction 1010.6 \3\ Additionally, alcohol and drug 
abuse prevention programs shall include the following elements.

<R05>
Sec. 86.6  Procedures.

    The records of all existing employees and applicants for positions 
in child care services are reviewed by the Component designee according 
to the procedures prescribed in appendix A to this part.

   Appendix A to Part 86--Criminal History Background Check Procedures

    This appendix establishes the procedures for conducting criminal 
history background checks on existing and newly hired individuals 
required by Public Law 101-647, section 231 and Public Law 102-190, 
section 1094. Background checks are required for all civilian providers 
involved in child care services who have regular contact with children. 
The categories of providers include current and prospective individuals 
hired with APF and NAFI funds for education, treatment or healthcare, 
child care or youth activities, and individuals employed under contract 
involved in the provision of child care services.

[[Page 511]]

In addition to the mandates of Public Law 102-190, section 1094, the 
Department of Defense requires that military members (except healthcare 
personnel), foster or respite care providers, FCC providers and family 
members, and specified volunteers shall have checks specified in this 
part.

                          A. Conducting Checks

    Component designees shall notify existing and newly hired 
individuals and contractors of the requirement for a review of personnel 
and security records to include an FBI fingerprint check and SCHR checks 
of residences listed on employment and security applications.
    1. Fingerprint Check. Law enforcement personnel shall forward 
completed forms through channels to the Office of Personnel Management 
(OPM) or Defense Investigative Service (DIS) for processing of FBI 
fingerprint forms.
    2. State Criminal History Repository (SCHR) Check. DoD Installation-
level personnel offices, in collaboration with law enforcement and 
security personnel, shall process State criminal history background 
checks for employment and shall ordinarily communicate in writing with 
each State identified in appendix B to part 86, providing full 
identifying information on each applicant and request confirmation that 
the individual has not been convicted in that State of a sex crime, an 
offense involving a child victim, a drug felony, or a violent crime. The 
DoD Component Heads may establish alternate procedures for conducting 
SCHR checks; e.g., a computerized, written, or telephonic check. The DoD 
Components are not required to wait longer than 60 days from the date of 
the request for a response from the SCHR personnel before taking action 
on a particular application. Authorities will depend on FBI fingerprint 
check validation if States do not respond.
    3. Installation Record Checks (IRC). Consists of a local record 
check on an individual for a minimum of 2 years before the date of the 
application. This record check shall include, at a minimum, police (base 
and/or military police, security office, criminal investigators, or 
local law enforcement) local files checks, Drug and Alcohol Program, 
Family Housing, Medical Treatment Facility for Family Advocacy Program 
Service Central Registry records and mental health records, and any 
other record checks as appropriate to the extent permitted by law. A 
Service DCII may be conducted. The IRC shall be conducted by DoD 
Component personnel at the installation level. An IRC will be completed 
on individuals with a DoD affiliation such as living or working on an 
installation or is active duty member or family member. Individuals 
without DoD affiliation have no installation system of records to check 
and an IRC is not completed. Upon favorable completion of the IRC, an 
individual may be selected and provide child care services under line of 
sight supervision until the required background checks are completed.

                              B. Applicants

                  1. Appropriated Fund (APF) Applicants

    a. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the DoD 
Components shall process APF applicants using currently established 
procedures for completing background checks described in 32 CFR part 
310. APF applicants must complete a SF-171, ``Application for Federal 
Employment,'' and attach an SF-87, ``Fingerprint Chart,'' completed by a 
law enforcement officer; and an SF-85P, ``Questionnaire for Public Trust 
Positions'' (Annotate Block ``B'' with code 03), for conduct of a NACI. 
The package shall be forwarded to the OPM.
    b. The DoD Components shall assign responsibility for conducting the 
criminal history background checks through the SCHR to personnel offices 
working with law enforcement or investigative agencies. They shall 
conduct checks in all States that an employee or prospective employee 
lists as current and former residences in an employment or security 
application. It is deemed unnecessary to conduct checks before 18 years 
of age because juvenile records are unavailable. If no response is 
received from the State(s) within 60 days, determinations based upon the 
FBI report may be made. Responses received after this determination has 
been made must be provided to the determining authority.
    c. Under Public Law 102-190, section 1094, the DoD Components may 
employ an individual pending completion of successful background checks 
described in Public Law 101-647, section 231. If an individual is so 
employed, at all times while children are in the care of that 
individual, he or she must be within sight and under the supervision of 
an individual whose background checks have been completed, with no 
derogatory reports.
    d. Once it is clear that no derogatory information exists, line of 
sight supervision is terminated by the designee. If a derogatory report 
exists, Component personnel procedures shall prescribe appropriate 
action consistent with the criteria contained in this part.

       2. Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFI) Applicants

    a. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the DoD 
Components shall process NAFI applicants following established 
procedures for completing background checks. NAFI applicants must 
complete a DD Form 398-2 ``Department of Defense National Agency 
Questionnaire,'' with reason for request identified as OTHER and 
annotated as

[[Page 512]]

CHILD CARE, and FD Form 258, ``FBI Applicant Fingerprint Card.'' 
Fingerprints shall be taken by the local law enforcement organization 
personnel and together with the DD Form 398-2 shall be forwarded to: 
Defense Investigative Service, Personnel Investigations Center, P.O. Box 
1083, Baltimore, MD 21203-1083.
    b. The DoD Components shall follow the procedures in the FPM, 
Chapter 731 and 736 and in paragraph B.1.b.,c., and d. of this appendix 
to obtain fingerprints for the FBI, conduct criminal history background 
checks through the SCHR, and maintain employment of individuals pending 
the successful completion of the background checks.

                 3. Foreign National Employees Overseas

    Foreigh national employees overseas, while not expressly included 
within the law, are subject to the following record checks or those 
equivalent in scope to checks conducted on U.S. citizens:
    a. Host-government law enforcement and security agency checks at the 
city, State (province), and national level, whenever permissible by the 
laws of the host government.
    b. Defense Central Investigative Index (DCII).
    c. FBI checks (when information exists regarding residence by the 
individual in the United States for 1 year or more since age 18).
    d. When permissible by the laws of the host government, host-
government checks are requested directly by the employing Service or 
agency. As an alternative, the DoD Components may request that overseas 
Military Service investigative elements obtain appropriate host-
government checks. Where host-nations' arrangements preclude comparable 
criminal history checks, foreign nationals will not be eligible for 
employment in child care services.

                         4. Temporary Employees

    This category includes summer hires, student interns, and NAFI 
flexible category employees. Background checks for these individuals are 
processed according to funding source; i.e., for APF employees (to OPM) 
or NAFI employees (to DIS). Installation designated points of contact 
shall notify applicants of report disposition.

                         5. Healthcare Personnel

    This category includes civilian personnel involved in the delivery 
of healthcare. Within the context of such medical care, line of sight 
supervision must be viewed through the prism of existing medical quality 
assurance, clinical privileging, and licensure directives, which require 
pre-employment screens, enhanced surveillance of new employees, and 
ongoing monitoring of the performance of all healthcare providers. These 
programs are inherent to both quality medical care and patient safety 
and are adequate and equivalent mechanisms for the sight and supervision 
requirements in paragraph B.1.c. and d. of this appendix. It should be 
noted that these quality assurance programs are not sufficient in and of 
themselves under Public Law 101-647, section 231. Therefore, the 
required FBI fingerprint check and the SCHR check must be completed as 
expeditiously as possible.

                          C. Current Employees

    All currently employed individuals covered by this part shall have 
the FBI fingerprint and criminal history background check as described 
in Public Law 101-647, section 231. If the results of such checks, to 
include the SCHR, cannot be confirmed through an examination of 
available local records, action shall be initiated in accordance with 
paragraph B.1. of this appendix for APF employees and paragraph B.2. of 
this appendix for NAFI employees, and with paragraph D. of this appendix 
for individuals employed under contract. The SCHR checks are conducted 
in all cases in accordance with paragraph A.2. of this appendix. For the 
purposes of this part, no IRC is required for individuals employed 
before June 1991.

                    D. Government Contract Employees

    1. Sponsoring activities are responsible for ensuring that the 
requirements in this part are included in the statement of work for all 
child care programs to be contracted. The contracting officer is 
responsible for performing any action necessary to verify that services 
provided by the contractor conform to contract quality requirements. 
Component designees for requiring activities shall ensure that the 
statement of work, at a minimum:
    a. States that the contractor must ensure its employees have proper 
criminal history background checks as outlined in this part.
    b. States that actual checks are performed by the Government.
    c. Includes procedures that the contractor must follow to obtain 
checks for its employees; for example, identify the office where 
employees report for processing, identify proper forms to be completed, 
etc. Also, identify the DoD Component for billing purposes, and identify 
the appropriate security point of contact or installation commander as 
the authorized recipient of background check results.
    d. States that employees may be permitted to work before completion 
of background checks, provided the employee is within sight of an 
individual who has successfully completed a background check.
    e. States that employees have the right to obtain a copy of the 
background check report, whom they should contact for the copy

[[Page 513]]

and whom to contact for procedures to challenge the accuracy and 
completeness of the information in the report.
    f. Requires that contractor employees who have previously received a 
background check must provide proof of the check or obtain a new one.
    2. Requirements for child care services must be submitted to the 
contracting officer sufficiently in advance of the required performance 
start date to provide time for obtaining background checks. Sponsoring 
activities' designees shall coordinate with the contracting officer as 
soon as possible after a requirement for child care services becomes 
known.
    3. Procedures for obtaining responses for background checks are the 
same as those for NAFI employees and response to derogatory information 
will occur through the appropriate designee and contractor. An IRC will 
be performed if the individual is a military member or family member, or 
has worked or lived on a military installation within 5 years.

                           E. Other Providers

    Criminal history background checks with the FBI and the States are 
not required. Duplication of previous background checks are not required 
for personnel where official records demonstrate that an adequate check 
has already been conducted. This category includes the following:
    1. Military Members. These are active duty individuals (other than 
healthcare personnel) who seek to provide child care services as part of 
a normal duty assignment or are involved during off-duty hours. For 
these members an IRC and a current security clearance meet the 
requirements of this part. In the absence of a current security 
clearance, a name check of the DCII must be conducted. When military 
members are employed in an APF or a NAFI position they will abide by 
background check requirements listed in paragraphs B.1. and B.2. of this 
appendix.
    2. Foster and Respite Care Providers and Family Members. These are 
individuals who seek to provide foster care or respite child care within 
Government-owned or -leased quarters. The care provider, all other 
adults, and each child, age 12 and older, residing within the 
applicant's household must receive an IRC. In addition, the Component 
designee must also obtain a name check of the DCII on all adults.
    FCC Providers and Family Members. These are individuals who seek 
licensing to provide child care within government-owned or -leased 
quarters. The care provider, all other adults, and each child, age 12 
and older, residing within the applicant's household receive an IRC. In 
addition, the Component designee must obtain a name check of the DCII on 
all adults.
    4. Specified Volunteers. Installation commanders shall designate 
those positions that are determined to be ``specified.'' Individuals 
working in specified volunteer positions will have an IRC check because 
of the nature of their work in child care services. The opportunity for 
contact may be extensive, frequent, or over a period of time. They 
include, but are not limited to, positions involving extensive 
interaction alone, extended travel, and/or overnight activities with 
children. An IRC is required for volunteers who are active-duty, a 
family member, or a DoD civilian overseas. A volunteer is allowed to 
work upon completion of a favorable IRC. Background checks are not 
required for volunteers whose services will be of shorter duration than 
is required to perform the background checks and who are under line of 
sight supervision by an individual who has successfully completed a 
background check. The Components are required to provide additional 
implementing guidance.

                  F. Employment Application Requirement

    Public Law 101-647, section 231 requires that each application for 
employment shall include a question asking whether the individual has 
ever been arrested for or charged with a crime involving a child, and, 
if so, requires a description of the disposition of the arrest or 
charge. The forms identified in paragraphs B.1.a. and B.2.a. of this 
appendix are signed by the applicant under penalty of perjury, with the 
applicable Federal punishment for perjury stated on the respective 
forms.
    1. An applicant's signature indicates an understanding of the 
employer's obligation to require a record check as a condition of 
employment. Information on background checks shall be maintained in 
accordance with applicable Component implementing regulations.
    2. Payment for the conduct of any criminal history background check 
is the responsibility of the requesting Service or agency.
    3. The results of the background check are forwarded to the 
Component designee at the sending installation for appropriate action. A 
derogatory report would include, but not be limited to, the following 
applicable crimes: Any charge or conviction for a sex crime, an offense 
involving a child victim, a substance abuse felony, or a violent crime.
    4. The hiring authority or designee is responsible for notifying the 
individual of a derogatory report. The individual may obtain a copy of 
the criminal history report and has the right to challenge the accuracy 
and completeness of any information contained in the report through the 
Privacy Program described in 32 CFR part 310. The individual may provide 
information concerning positive mitigating factors for any adverse 
information presented.

[[Page 514]]

    5. Employees whose criminal history background checks result in 
nonselection for employment or service shall be informed by the 
Component designee of the right to an administrative appeal under 32 CFR 
part 310. The individual may appeal with a specific request such as 
amendments to the records or request to file statement disagreeing with 
information in the record. If the employee's request for record 
information is refused, the individual is informed of his or her right 
to an administrative appeal. As appropriate, Component designees shall 
inform individuals of other avenues available to resolve matters of 
concern such as an administrative or negotiated grievance procedures. If 
the employee remains dissatisfied, he or she may seek a review. The 
Department of Defense recognizes the privacy interests and rights of all 
applicants and employees, and its own responsibility in ensuring a safe 
and secure environment for children within DoD activities or private 
organizations on DoD installations.

                        G. Record Re-Verification

    This procedure consists of an IRC and a DCII name check and is 
required by the Component designee at a minimum every 5 years for all 
employees providing child care services and covers the time period since 
the completion of the last background check. NAFI employees who change 
duty stations will complete a new investigation when considered for 
employment. A new investigation is required by the Department of Defense 
if a break in service results in a time-lapse of more than 2 years. FCC, 
foster care and respite care providers, and their family members will 
complete an IRC annually.

                             H. Supervision

    Refers to temporary responsibility for children in child care 
services, and relates to oversight for temporary or permanent authority 
to exercise direction and control by an individual over an individual 
whose required background checks have been initiated but not completed. 
Use of video equipment is acceptable provided it is monitored by an 
individual who has successfully completed a background check. 
Supervision procedures pending completion of background checks for 
healthcare personnel suggest that the Surgeons General shall require 
close clinical supervision and full compliance with existing DoD 
Directives, Instructions, and other guidance (issued by the Department 
of Defense and the Military Department concerned) on quality assurance, 
risk management, licensure, employee orientation, and credentials 
certification. These policies rely on process and judgment, and meet the 
intent of the ``direct sight supervision'' provision, affording local 
commanders a flexible and reasonable alternative.
I. Programs. Requirements cover all DoD-operated activities and private 
          organizations on DoD installations and include, but are not 
          limited to:
    1. Child Development Programs.
    a. Child development centers, part-day preschools, and enrichment 
programs.
    b. Family child care.
    c. Contracted Services, whether personal or non-personal services.
    2. Youth Programs.
    3. Dependents Schools operated by the Department of Defense.
    4. Medical treatment facilities.
    5. Other contracted services.
    6. Private organizations on DoD installations.
    7. Volunteer activities.

                       J. Background Check Matrix

    This identifies the requirements of this part for background checks 
by category of personnel. These checks are initiated through the 
personnel offices in collaboration with law enforcement and security 
personnel. (Reminder: An IRC may only be completed on an individual who 
is a military member or family member, or who lives or works on a 
military installation.)
    1. Appropriated Fund (APF) Employees. FBI, SCHR, and IRC. (SF-171, 
SF-87, and SF-85P).
    2. Non-appropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFI) Employees. FBI, 
SCHR, and IRC. (DD Form 398-2 and FD Form 258).

    4. Temporary Employees. FBI, SCHR, and IRC.
    5. Current Employees. FBI and SCHR.
    6. Government Contract Employees. FBI, SCHR, and IRC.
    7. Other Providers.
    a. Military Members. Military members will have an IRC and, if no 
current security clearance exists, a name check of the DCII. Checks are 
not required for military healthcare personnel.
    b. Foster and Respite Care Providers and Family Members (age 12 and 
older). IRC and Service DCII (for adults).
    c. Family Child Care Providers and Family Members (age 12 and

 Appendix B to Part 86--Criteria For Criminal History Background Check 
                            Disqualification

    The ultimate decision to determine how to use information obtained 
from the criminal history background checks in selection for positions 
involving the care, treatment, supervision, or education of children 
must incorporate a common sense decision based upon all known facts. 
Adverse information is

[[Page 515]]

evaluated by the DoD Component Head or designee who is qualified at the 
appropriate level of command in interpreting criminal history background 
checks. All information of record both favorable and unfavorable will be 
assessed in terms of its relevance, recentness, and seriousness. 
Likewise, positive mitigating factors should be considered. Final 
suitability decisions shall be made by that commander or designee. 
Criteria that will result in disqualification of an applicant require 
careful screening of the data and include, but are not limited to, the 
following:

                   A. Mandatory Disqualifying Criteria

    Any conviction for a sexual offense, a drug felony, a violent crime, 
or a criminal offense involving a child or children.

                        B. Discretionary Criteria

    1. Acts that may tend to indicate poor judgment, unreliability, or 
untrustworthiness in working with children.
    2. Any behavior; illness; or mental, physical, or emotional 
condition that in the opinion of a competent medical authority may cause 
a defect in judgment or reliability.
    3. Offenses involving assault, battery, or other abuse of a victim, 
regardless of age of the victim.
    4. Evidence or documentation of substance abuse dependency.
    5. Illegal or improper use, possession, or addiction to any 
controlled or psychoactive substances, narcotic, cannibas, or other 
dangerous drug.
    6. Sexual acts, conduct, or behavior that, because of the 
circumstances in which they occur, may indicate untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of judgment, or irresponsibility in working with 
children.
    7. A wide range of offenses such as arson, homicide, robbery, fraud, 
or any offense involving possession or use of a firearm.
    8. Evidence that the individual is a fugitive from justice.
    9. Evidence that the individual is an illegal alien who is not 
entitled to accept gainful employment for a position.
    10. A finding of negligence in a mishap causing death or serious 
injury to a child or dependent person entrusted to their care.

                      C. Suitability Considerations

    In making a determination of suitability, the evaluator shall 
consider the following additional factors to the extent that these 
examples are considered pertinent to the individual case:
    1. The kind of position for which the individual is applying or 
employed.
    2. The nature and seriousness of the conduct.
    3. The recentness of the conduct.
    4. The age of the individual at the time of the conduct.
    5. The circumstances surrounding the conduct.
    6. Contributing social or environmental conditions.
    7. The absence or presence of rehabilitation or efforts toward 
rehabilitation.
    8. The nexus of the arrests in regard to the job to be performed.

                              D. Questions

    1. All applications, for each of the categories of individuals 
identified in Sec. 86.3, will include the following questions: ``Have 
you ever been arrested for or charged with a crime involving a child? 
Have you ever been asked to resign because of or been decertified for a 
sexual offense? And, if so, ``provide a description of the case 
disposition.'' For FCC, foster care, and respite care providers, this 
question is asked of the applicant regarding all adults, and all 
children 12 years and older, who reside in the household.
    2. All applications shall state that the form is being signed under 
penalty of perjury. In addition, a false statement rendered by an 
employee may result in adverse action up to and including removal from 
Federal service.
    3. Evaluation of criminal history background checks is made and 
monitored by qualified personnel at the appropriate level designated by 
the Component. Final suitability decisions are made by the designee.

                Appendix C to Part 86--State Information

    All SCHR checks should be accompanied by the following: 1. State 
form, if required. If no State form is required, the request should be

accordance with Public Law 101-647. The request must include full 
identifying information, such as: Name, date of birth, social security 
number, complete addresses, etc.
    2. Fingerprint set if required. Some State laws require a 
fingerprint set either on a State form or forms used by the agency.

and sustainment throughout a Service members's active service in the 
Armed Forces, and ends when the Service member returns to the civilian 
sector.

another transition site will require the Service member to travel a long 
distance and incur significant expense.
    (e) [Reserved]
    (f) When being discharged, released from active duty, or retiring 
(hereafter referred to as ``separating Service members''), Service 
members and their families bear primary responsibility for their 
successful transition into the civilian sector.
    (g) Spouses shall be encouraged to participate in transition 
planning and counseling to the maximum extent possible.
    (h) Enhanced transition programs shall be established for Service 
members and their families who are overseas to help alleviate the

<R05>
Sec. 93.4  Policy.

    Official information that is not classified, privileged, or 
otherwise protected from public disclosure, should generally be made 
reasonably available for use in Federal and State courts and by other 
governmental bodies.


<R05>
Sec. 93.5  Procedures.

    (a) Release of official information in litigation. NSA personnel 
shall not produce, disclose, release, comment upon, or testify 
concerning any official information during litigation without the prior 
written approval of the GC. In exigent circumstances, the GC may issue 
oral approval, but a record of such approval will be made and retained 
in the OGC. NSA personnel shall not provide, with or without 
compensation, opinion or expert testimony concerning official NSA 
information, subjects, or activities, except on behalf of the United 
States or a party represented by the Department of Justice (DoJ). Upon a 
showing by the requester of exceptional need or unique circumstances and 
that the anticipated testimony will not be adverse to the interests of 
the NSA or the United States, the GC may, in writing, grant special 
authorization for NSA personnel to appear and testify at no expense to 
the United States. Official information may be released in litigation 
only in compliance with the following procedures.
    (1) If official information is sought, through testimony or 
otherwise, by a litigation demand, the individual seeking such release 
or testimony must set forth, in writing and with as much specificity as 
possible, the nature and relevance of the official information sought. 
Subject to paragraph (a)(5) of this section, NSA personnel may only 
produce, disclose, release, comment upon or testify concerning those 
matters that were specified in writing and approved by the GC.
    (2) Whenever a litigation demand is made upon NSA personnel for 
official information or for testimony concerning such information, the 
person upon whom the demand was made shall immediately notify the OGC. 
After consultation and coordination with the DoJ, if required, the GC 
shall determine whether the individual is required to comply with the 
demand and shall notify the requester or the court or other authority of 
that determination.
    (3) If a litigation demand requires a response before instructions 
from the GC are received, the GC shall furnish the requester or the 
court or other authority with a copy of Sec. 93.1(a) and this part 93. 
The GC shall also inform the requester or the court or other authority 
that the demand is being reviewed, and seek a stay of the demand pending 
a final determination.
    (4) If a court or other authority declines to stay the demand in 
response to action taken pursuant to paragraph 3 of this section, or if 
such court or other authority orders that the demand must be complied 
with notwithstanding the final decision of the GC, the NSA personnel 
upon whom the demand was made shall notify the GC of such ruling or 
order. If the GC determines that no further legal review of or challenge 
to the ruling or order will be sought, the affected NSA personnel shall 
comply with the demand or order. If directed by the GC, however, the 
affected NSA personnel must decline to provide the information.\3\ The 
NSA personnel shall state the following to the Court:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951) 
wherein the Supreme Court held that a government employee could not be 
held in contempt for following an agency regulation requiring agency 
approval before producing government information in response to a court 
order.

    ``I must respectfully advise the Court that under instructions given 
to me by the General Counsel of the National Security Agency, in 
accordance with Department of Defense Directive 5405.2 and NSA 
Regulation 10-62, I must respectfully decline to [produce/disclose] that 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
information.''

    (5) In the event NSA personnel receive a litigation demand for 
official information originated by another U.S. Government component, 
the GC shall forward the appropriate portions of the request to the 
other component. The GC shall notify the requester, court, or other 
authority of the transfer, unless

[[Page 523]]

such notice would itself disclose classified information.
    (b) Acceptance of service of process. The following are mandatory 
procedures for accepting service of process for NSA personnel sued or 
summoned in their official capacities, and for attempting service of 
process on NSA premises.
    (1) Service on NSA or on NSA personnel in their official capacities. 
Sec. 93.1(d) requires service of process on the NSA or NSA personnel 
sued or summoned in their official capacity to be made by serving the 
United States Attorney for the district in which the action is brought, 
and by sending copies of the summons and complaint by registered or 
certified mail to the Attorney General of the United States and to the 
NSA or such NSA personnel. Only the GC or an NSA attorney is authorized 
to accept the copies of the summons and complaint sent to the NSA or NSA 
personnel pursuant to Sec. 93.1(d). Acceptance of the copies of the 
summons and complaint by the GC or an NSA attorney does not constitute 
an admission or waiver with respect to the validity of the service of 
process or of the jurisdiction of the court or other body. Such copies 
shall be sent by registered or certified mail to: General Counsel, 
National Security Agency, 9800 Savage Road, Fort George G. Meade, MD 
20755-6000. The envelope shall be conspicuously marked ``Copy of Summons 
and Complaint Enclosed.'' Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section, no other person may accept the copies of the summons and 
complaint for NSA or NSA personnel sued or summoned in their official 
capacities, including the sued or summoned NSA personnel, without the 
prior express authorization of the GC.
    (i) Parties who wish to deliver, instead of sending by registered or 
certified mail, the copies of the service of process to NSA or to NSA 
personnel sued or summoned in their official capacities, will comply 
with the procedures for service of process on NSA premises in paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (ii) Litigants may attempt to serve process upon NSA personnel in 
their official capacities at their residences or other places. Because 
NSA personnel are not authorized to accept such service of process, such 
service is not effective under Sec. 93.1(d). NSA personnel should 
refuse to accept service. However, NSA personnel may find it difficult 
to determine whether they are being sued or summoned in their private or 
official capacity. Therefore, NSA personnel shall notify the OGC as soon 
as possible if they receive any summons or complaint that appears to 
relate to actions in connection with their official duties so that the 
GC can determine the scope of service.
    (2) Service upon NSA personnel in their individual capacities on NSA 
premises. Service of process is not a function of NSA. An NSA attorney 
will not accept service of process for NSA personnel sued or summoned in 
their individual capacities, nor will NSA personnel be required to 
accept service of process on NSA premises. Acceptance of such service of 
process in a person's individual capacity is the individual's 
responsibility. NSA does, however, encourage cooperation with the courts 
and with judicial officials.
    (i) When the NSA person works at NSA Headquarters at Fort George G. 
Meade, Maryland, the process server should first telephone the OGC on 
(301) 688-6054, and attempt to schedule a time for the NSA person to 
accept process. If the NSA person's affiliation with NSA is not 
classified, the NSA attorney will communicate with the NSA person and 
serve as the contact point for the person and the process server. If the 
person consents to accept service of process, the NSA attorney will 
arrange a convenient time for the process server to come to NSA, and 
will notify the Security Duty Officer of the arrangement.
    (ii) A process server who arrives at NSA during duty hours without 
first having contacted the OGC, will be referred to the Visitor Control 
Center (VCC) at Operations Building 2A. The VCC will contact the OGC. If 
an NSA attorney is not available, the process server will be referred to 
the Security Duty Officer, who will act in accordance with Office of 
Security (M5) procedures approved by the GC. Service of process will not 
be accepted during non-duty hours unless prior arrangements have been 
made by the OGC. For

[[Page 524]]

purposes of this part, duty hours at NSA Headquarters are 0800 to 1700, 
Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays. A process server who 
arrives at NSA during non-duty hours without having made arrangements 
through the OGC to do so will be told to call the OGC during duty hours 
to arrange to serve process.
    (iii) Upon being notified that a process server is at the VCC, an 
NSA attorney will review the service of process and determine whether 
the NSA person is being sued or summoned in his official or individual 
capacity. (If the person is being sued or summoned in his or her 
official capacity, the NSA attorney will accept service of process by 
noting on the return of service form that ``service is accepted in 
official capacity only.'') If the person is being sued or summoned in 
his or her individual capacity, the NSA attorney will contact that 
person to see if that person will consent to accept service.
    (3) Procedures at field activities. Chiefs of NSA field activities 
may accept copies of service of process for themselves or NSA personnel 
assigned to their field component who are sued or summoned in their 
official capacities. Field Chiefs or their designees will accept by 
noting on the return of service form that ``service is accepted in 
official capacity only.'' The matter will then immediately be referred 
to the GC. Additionally, Field Chiefs will establish procedures at the 
field site, including a provision for liaison with local judge 
advocates, to ensure that service of process on persons in their 
individual capacities is accomplished in accordance with local law, 
relevant treaties, and Status of Forces Agreements. Such procedures must 
be approved by the GC. Field Chiefs will designate a point of contact to 
conduct liaison with the OGC.
    (4) No individual will confirm or deny that the person sued or 
summoned is affiliated with NSA until a NSA attorney or the Field Chief 
has ascertained that the individual's relationship with NSA is not 
classified. If the NSA person's association with NSA is classified, 
service of process will not be accepted. In such a case, the GC must be 
immediately informed. The GC will then contact the DoJ for guidance.
    (5) Suits in Foreign Courts. If any NSA person is sued or summoned 
in a foreign court, that person, or the cognizant Field Chief, will 
immediately telefax a copy of the service of process to the OGC. Such 
person will not complete any return of service forms unless advised 
otherwise by an NSA attorney. OGC will coordinate with the DoJ to 
determine whether service is effective and whether the NSA person is 
entitled to be represented at Government expense pursuant to Sec. 
93.1(f).


<R05>
Sec. 93.6  Fees.

    Consistent with the guidelines in Sec. 93.1(e), NSA may charge 
reasonable fees to parties seeking, by request or demand, official 
information not otherwise available under the Freedom of Information 
Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Such fees are calculated to reimburse the Government 
for the expense of providing such information, and may include:
    (a) The costs of time expended by NSA employees to process and 
respond to the request or demand;
    (b) Attorney time for reviewing the request or demand and any 
information located in response thereto, and for related legal work in 
connection with the request or demand; and
    (c) Expenses generated by materials and equipment used to search 
for, produce, and copy the responsive information.


<R05>
Sec. 93.7  Responsibilities.

    (a) The General Counsel. The GC is responsible for overseeing NSA 
compliance with Sec. 93.1(a) and this part 93, and for consulting with 
DoJ when appropriate. In response to a litigation demand requesting 
official information or the testimony of NSA personnel as witnesses, the 
GC will coordinate NSA action to determine whether official information 
may be released and whether NSA personnel may be interviewed, contacted, 
or used as witnesses. The GC will determine what, if any, conditions 
will be imposed upon such release, interview, contact, or testimony. In 
most cases, an NSA attorney will be present when NSA personnel are 
interviewed or testify concerning official information. The GC may 
delegate these authorities.

[[Page 525]]

    (b) The Deputy Director for Plans and Policy (DDPP). The DDPP will 
assit the GC, upon request, in identifying and coordinating with NSA 
components that have cognizance over official information requested in a 
litigation demand. Additionally, the DDPP will advise the GC on the 
classified status of official information, and, when necessary, assist 
in declassifying, redacting, substituting, or summarizing official 
information for use in litigation. The DDPP may require the assistance 
of other Key Component Chiefs.
    (c) Chiefs of Key Components and Field Activities. Chiefs of Key 
Components and Field Activities shall ensure that their personnel are 
informed of the contents of this part 93, particularly of the 
requirements to consult with the OGC prior to responding to any 
litigation demand, and to inform the OGC whenever they receive service 
of process that is not clearly in their individual capacities. Field 
Chiefs will notify the OGC of the persons they designate under Sec. 
93.5(b)(3).
    (d) The Deputy Director for Administration (DDA). Within 60 days of 
the date of this part, the DDA shall submit to the GC for approval 
procedures for the attempted delivery of service of process during duty 
hours when an attorney of the OGC is not available.

<R05>
Sec. 94.1  Purpose.

    This part prescribes uniform procedures acceptable to the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service of the Department of Justice, to 
(a) facilitate the naturalization of aliens who have served honorably in 
the Armed Forces of the United States and to (b) militarily certify 
alien dependents seeking naturalization under the provisions of 
Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, as amended, sections 319(b) and 
323(c) (8 U.S.C. 1430(b) and 1434(c)); and furnishes policy guidance to 
the Secretaries of the Military Departments governing discharge or 
release from active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States of 
permanent-residence aliens who desire to be naturalized as U.S. citizens 
under the provisions of Act of June 27, 1952, section 328 (66 Stat. 
249); 8 U.S.C. 1439.


<R05>
Sec. 94.2  Applicability.

    The provisions of this part apply to the Military Departments.


<R05>
Sec. 94.3  Definitions.

    (a) Permanent-residence alien is an alien admitted into the United 
States under an immigration visa for permanent residence; or an alien, 
who, after admission without an immigrant visa, has had his status 
adjusted to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
    (b) Armed Forces of the United States denotes collectively all 
components of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard.


<R05>
Sec. 94.4  Policy and procedures.

    (a) Naturalization of an alien who has served honorably in the Armed 
Forces of the United States at any time. (1) Under the provisions of Act 
of June 27, 1952, section 328 (66 Stat. 249); 8 U.S.C. 1439, an alien 
who has served in the Armed Forces of the United States for a period(s) 
totaling three (3) years may be naturalized if he:
    (i) Has been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent 
residence;
    (ii) Was separated from the military service under honorable 
conditions;
    (iii) Files a petition while still in the military service, or 
within six (6) months after the termination of such service; and
    (iv) Can comply in all other respects with the Immigration and 
Nationality Act of 1952, except that (a) no period of

[[Page 526]]

residence or specified period of physical presence in the United States 
or the State in which the petition for naturalization is filed is 
required, and (b) residence within the jurisdiction of the court is not 
required.
    (2) The prescribed 3-year period may be satisfied by a combination 
of active duty and inactive duty in a reserve status.
    (3) An alien member desiring to fulfill naturalization requirements 
through military service shall not be separated prior to completion of 
three (3) full years of active duty unless:
    (i) His performance or conduct does not justify retention, in which 
case he shall be separated in accordance with the provisions of part 41 
of this subchapter and chapter 47, title 10, United States Code (Uniform 
Code of Military Justice), as appropriate; or
    (ii) He is to be transferred to inactive duty in a reserve component 
in order to:
    (a) Complete a reserve obligation under the provisions of part 50 of 
this subchapter, or
    (b) Attend a recognized institution of learning under the early 
release program, as provided in DoD Instruction 1332.15, ``Early Release 
of Military Enlisted Personnel for College or Vocational/Technical 
School Enrollment,'' January 26, 1970. \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Filed as part of original. Copies available from the U.S. Naval 
Publications and Forms Center, 5801 Tabor Avenue, Philadelphia, PA. 
19120, Attention: Code 300.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (4) Caution shall be exercised to ensure that an alien's affiliation 
with the Armed Forces of the United States, whether on active duty or on 
inactive duty in a reserve status, is not terminated even for a few days 
short of the 3-year statutory period, since failure to comply with the 
exact 3-year requirement of Act of June 27, 1952, section 328 (66 Stat. 
249); 8 U.S.C. 1439 will automatically preclude a favorable 
determination by the Immigration and Naturalization Service on any 
petition for naturalization based on an alien's military service.
    (5) During a period of hostilities, as designated by the President 
of the United States, the expeditious naturalization provisions outlined 
in paragraph (b) of this section, will take precedence over the 
foregoing.
    (b) Naturalization of an alien who has served in the Armed Forces of 
the United States during a period of hostilities as designated by the 
President of the United States. (1) Under the provisions of Immigration 
and Nationality Act of 1952, as amended, section 329 (8 U.S.C. 1440), an 
alien who serves honorably on active duty in the Armed Forces of the 
United States during the period beginning February 28, 1961, and ending 
on a date designated by the President, by Executive order, as the date 
of termination of the Vietnam hostilities, or during any future period 
which President, by Executive order, shall designate as a period in 
which the Armed Forces of the United States are or were engaged in 
military operations involving armed conflict with a hostile foreign 
force, and who is otherwise eligible, may be naturalized whether or not 
he has been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent 
residence, if the member was inducted, enlisted, or reenlisted in the 
United States (inclusive of Puerto Rico, Guam, Virgin Islands, Canal 
Zone, American Samoa, or Swains Island).
    (i) The induction, enlistment, or reenlistment in the United States 
or its stated possessions must actually be in these land areas, in 
ports, harbors, bays, enclosed sea areas along their routes, or within a 
marginal belt of the sea extending from the coastline outward three (3) 
geographical miles.
    (ii) Enlistment or reenlistment aboard a ship on the high seas or in 
foreign waters does not meet the requirements of Immigration and 
Nationality Act of 1952, as amended, section 329 (8 U.S.C. 1440). In 
such instances, the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section may 
apply.
    (2) Each Military Department will establish procedures containing 
the provisions outlined in paragraphs (b)(2) (i) and (ii) of this 
section. In addition, each qualifying alien shall be advised of the 
liberalized naturalization provisions of the Immigration and Nationality 
Act of 1952, as amended, section 329 (8 U.S.C. 1440), i.e., that the 
usual

[[Page 527]]

naturalization requirements concerning age, residence, physical 
presence, court jurisdiction and waiting periods are not applicable, and 
will be given appropriate assistance in processing his naturalization 
application in consonance with procedures contained in ``Naturalization 
Requirements and General Information,'' published by the U.S. Department 
of Justice (Form N-17).
    (i) Military basic training and orientation programs will include 
advice and assistance to interested aliens in completing and submitting 
the application and other forms required to initiate naturalization 
proceedings.
    (ii) In addition, applicants should be advised that:
    (a) Under the laws of certain foreign countries, military service in 
the Armed Forces of the United States may result in the loss of their 
native country citizenship but this same service may make them eligible 
for U.S. citizenship.
    (b) Their eligibility for naturalization, based upon the honorable 
service in an active duty status prescribed in the Immigration and 
Nationality Act of 1952, as amended, section 329 (8 U.S.C. 1440) will be 
retained, even though they apply for naturalization after their return 
to the United States following the termination or completion of their 
overseas assignment, or after their honorable discharge from the Armed 
Forces of the United States.
    (c) If they are stationed at a base in the continental United 
States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, or the Virgin Islands, they 
should apply for citizenship only if they expect to be stationed at the 
base for at least 60 days following application. Unless the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service has at least 60 days in which to complete the 
case, there is no assurance that it can be completed before the 
applicant is transferred, since the processing procedures outlined below 
take time and are not entirely within the control of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service.
    (1) Every naturalization application must be processed when received 
by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Special arrangements have 
been made to expedite the processing of petitions of alien members of 
the Armed Forces.
    (2) After processing, the alien applicant and two citizen witnesses 
must personally appear for examination by an officer of the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service in connection with the filing of a petition 
for naturalization in court.
    (3) Finally, the applicant must appear in person before the 
naturalization court on a date set by the court so that he may be 
admitted to citizenship.
    (d) If the alien member is scheduled for overseas assignment where 
naturalization courts are not available, he should apply for 
naturalization on the earliest possible date but no later than 60 days 
before departure for overseas assignment. No assurance that processing 
will be completed before the applicant's departure for overseas will be 
given by the Immigration and Naturalization Service unless it has 60 
days to complete the matter.
    (1) An alien serviceman who is serving overseas and has submitted or 
submits the required naturalization application and forms to the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service may not be granted ordinary 
leave, or Rest and Recuperation (R&R) leave (where authorized in 
overseas areas) for naturalization purposes, unless a written 
notification from the Immigration and Naturalization Service has been 
received by the serviceman informing him that the processing of his 
application has been completed, and requesting him to appear with two 
U.S. citizen witnesses before a representative of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service at a designated location for the purpose of 
completing the naturalization.
    (2) If possible, an applicant granted leave for such purposes should 
advise the Immigration and Naturalization Service when he expects to 
arrive in the leave area and, in any event, should contact the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service office immediately upon arrival 
in the area. Every effort will be made to complete the naturalization 
within the leave period.
    (c) Naturalization of alien spouses and/or alien adopted children of 
military and civilian personnel ordered overseas. Alien spouses and/or 
alien adopted children of military and civilian personnel of

[[Page 528]]

the Department of Defense who are authorized to accompany or join their 
sponsors overseas and who wish to obtain U.S. citizenship prior to 
departure will be given maximum assistance by commanders of military 
installations.
    (1) DD Form 1278, ``Certificate of Overseas Assignment to Support 
Application to File Petition for Naturalization,'' \2\ will be issued to 
alien dependents by military commanders at the times indicated below in 
order that the alien may file such certificate with the nearest 
Immigration and Naturalization Service Office to initiate naturalization 
proceedings. Only DD Form 1278 will be accepted by the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. Military commanders will not issue memoranda or 
letters of any kind in lieu thereof.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Filed as part of original. Copies may be obtained from 
Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) When dependents are authorized automatic concurrent travel, DD 
Form 1278 will be issued not earlier than 90 days prior to the 
dependents' schedule date of travel.
    (ii) When advance application for concurrent travel is required, DD 
Form 1278 will be issued after approval is received and not earlier than 
90 days prior to the dependents' scheduled date of departure.
    (iii) When concurrent travel is not authorized, DD Form 1278 will be 
issued after authorization for dependents' movement is received and not 
earlier than 90 days prior to the dependents' scheduled date of travel.
    (2) Upon receipt of DD Form 1278, the alien will file this form, 
together with the application for petition for naturalization, 
Immigration and Naturalization Form N-400 (adult) or N-402 (child) as 
appropriate, if not previously filed, with the nearest office of the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service. The application must be 
accompanied by:
    (i) Three identical photographs.
    (ii) Form FD-358, Applicant Fingerprint Card, and
    (iii) Form G-325, Biographic Information.
    (3) Further processing of the application for citizenship is as 
prescribed by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
    (4) Upon completion of the naturalization process, immediate 
application for passport should be made, in order that it can be issued 
prior to scheduled departure of the dependent for overseas.


<R05>
Sec. 94.5  Forms required.

    The following forms required for naturalization purposes may be

    (b) The Secretaries of the Military Departments shall develop and 
prepare uniform implementing regulations concerning acquisition, review, 
and safeguarding of criminal history record information by recruiting 
elements to conform with section 520a of title 10 U.S. Code, policies 
stated herein and shall include in the regulations procedures on 
obtaining and reviewing criminal history record information for 
recruitment purposes and for assignment of personnel to special 
programs.
    (c) The Director, Defense Investigative Service, shall ensure that 
the acquisition of all available criminal history record information, or 
criminal history record information provided to the DIS by other 
government agencies, is safeguarded in accordance with existing laws or 
DoD regulatory documents to ensure protection of the privacy of the 
enlistment applicant on whom the record exists.


<R05>
Sec. 96.6  Procedures.

    (a) Under section 520a of title 10 U.S. Code, recruiters are 
authorized to request and receive criminal history record information 
from the criminal justice system.
    (b) The Military Services shall obtain criminal history record 
information on enlistment applicants from the criminal justice system 
and from the DIS and shall review this information to determine whether 
applicants are acceptable for enlistment and for assignment to special 
programs. Recruiters shall request such information in each instance by 
addressing their requests to the criminal justice system not

[[Page 530]]

later than 90 days after each application for enlistment is made.
    (c) The Military Services shall ensure the confidentiality of 
criminal history record information obtained for recruiting purposes. 
Personnel who have access to this information may not disclose it except 
for the purposes for which obtained (10 U.S.C. 520a).
    (d) The DIS shall provide additional background information to the 
Military Services as needed to determine the suitability of applicants 
for enlistment and for participation in special programs. This 
additional background information shall be provided by Entrance National 
Agency Checks (ENTNACs) and other investigations as directed by DoD 
5200.2-R.

enforceable at law against the United States or the Department of 
Defense.


<R05>
Sec. 97.3  Definitions.

    (a) Demand. Subpoena, order, or other demand of a court of competent 
jurisdiction, or other specific authority, for the production, 
disclosure, or release of official DoD information or for the appearance 
and testimony of DoD personnel as witnesses.
    (b) DoD personnel. Present and former U.S. military personnel; 
Service Academy cadets and midshipmen; and present and former civilian 
employees of any Component of the Department of Defense, including 
nonappropriated fund activity employees; non-U.S. nationals who perform 
services overseas, under the provisions of status of forces agreements, 
for the U.S. Armed Forces; and other specific individuals hired through 
contractual agreements by or on behalf of the Department of Defense.
    (c) Litigation. All pretrial, trial, and post-trial stages of all 
existing or reasonably anticipated judicial or administrative actions, 
hearings, investigations, or similar proceedings before civilian courts, 
commissions, boards (including the Armed Services Board of Contract 
Appeals), or other tribunals, foreign and domestic. This term includes 
responses to discovery requests, depositions, and other pretrial 
proceedings, as well as responses to formal or informal requests by 
attorneys or others in situations involving litigation.
    (d) Official information. All information of any kind, however 
stored, that is in the custody and control of the Department of Defense, 
relates to information in the custody and control of the Department, or 
was acquired by DoD personnel as part of their official duties or 
because of their official status within the Department while such 
personnel were employed by or on behalf of the Department or on active 
duty with the U.S. Armed Forces.


<R05>
Sec. 97.4  Policy.

    It is DoD policy that official information should generally be made 
reasonably available for use in Federal and State courts and by other 
governmental bodies unless the information is classified, privileged, or 
otherwise protected from public disclosure.


<R05>
Sec. 97.5  Responsibilities.

    (a) The General Counsel, Department of Defense, shall provide 
general policy and procedural guidance by the issuance of supplemental 
instructions or specific orders concerning the release of official DoD 
information in litigation and the testimony of DoD personnel as 
witnesses during litigation.
    (b) The Heads of DoD Components shall issue appropriate regulations 
to implement this Directive and to identify official information that is 
involved in litigation.


<R05>
Sec. 97.6  Procedures.

    (a) Authority to act. (1) In response to a litigation request or 
demand for official DoD information or the testimony of DoD personnel as 
witnesses, the General Counsels of DoD, Navy, and the Defense Agencies; 
the Judge Advocates General of the Military Departments; and the Chief 
Legal Advisors to the JCS and the Unified and Specified Commands, with 
regard to their respective Components, are authorized--after consulting 
and coordinating with the appropriate Department of Justice litigation 
attorneys, as required--to determine whether official information may be 
released in litigation; whether DoD personnel assigned to or affiliated 
with the Component may be interviewed, contacted, or used as witnesses 
concerning official DoD information or as expert witnesses; and what, if 
any, conditions will be imposed upon such release, interview, contact, 
or testimony. Delegation of this authority, to include the authority to 
invoke appropriate claims of privilege before any tribunal, is 
permitted.
    (2) In the event that a DoD Component receives a litigation request 
or demand for official information originated by another Component, the 
receiving Component shall forward the appropriate portions of the 
request or demand to the originating Component for action in accordance 
with this Directive. The receiving Component shall also notify the 
requestor, court, or other authority of its transfer of the request or 
demand.

[[Page 532]]

    (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) (1) and (2) of 
this section, the General Counsel, DoD, in litigation involving 
terrorism, espionage, nuclear weapons, intelligence means or sources, or 
otherwise as deemed necessary, may notify Components that General 
Counsel, DoD, will assume primary responsibility for coordinating all 
litigation requests and demands for official DoD information or 
testimony of DoD personnel, or both; consulting with the Department of 
Justice, as required; and taking final action on such requests and 
demands.
    (b) Factors to consider. In deciding whether to authorize the 
release of official DoD information or the testimony of DoD personnel 
concerning official information (hereafter referred to as ``the 
disclosure'') pursuant to paragraph (a), DoD officials should consider 
the following types of factors:
    (1) Whether the request or demand is unduly burdensome or otherwise 
inappropriate under the applicable court rules;
    (2) Whether the disclosure, including release in camera, is 
appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the case or matter in 
which the request or demand arose;
    (3) Whether the disclosure would violate a statute, executive order, 
regulation, or directive;
    (4) Whether the disclosure, including release in camera, is 
appropriate or necessary under the relevant substantive law concerning 
privilege;
    (5) Whether the disclosure, except when in camera and necessary to 
assert a claim of privilege, would reveal information properly 
classified pursuant to DoD 5200.1-R, ``Information Security Program 
Regulation,'' August 1982; unclassified technical data withheld from 
public release pursuant to DoD Directive 5230.25, ``Withholding of 
Unclassified Technical Data from Public Disclosure,'' November 6, 1984; 
or other matters exempt from unrestricted disclosure; and,
    (6) Whether disclosure would interfere with ongoing enforcement 
proceedings, compromise constitutional rights, reveal the identity of an 
intelligence source or confidential informant, disclose trade secrets or 
similarly confidential commercial or financial information, or otherwise 
be inappropriate under the circumstances.
    (c) Decisions on litigation requests and demands. (1) Subject to 
paragraph (c)(5) of this section, DoD personnel shall not, in response 
to a litigation request or demand, produce, disclose, release, comment 
upon, or testify concerning any official DoD information without the 
prior written approval of the appropriate DoD official designated in 
Sec. 97.6(a). Oral approval may be granted, but a record of such 
approval will be made and retained in accordance with the applicable 
implementing regulations.
    (2) If official DoD information is sought, through testimony or 
otherwise, by a litigation request or demand, the individual seeking 
such release or testimony must set forth, in writing and with as much 
specificity as possible, the nature and relevance of the official 
information sought. Subject to paragraph (c)(5), DoD personnel may only 
produce, disclose, release, comment upon, or testify concerning those 
matters that were specified in writing and properly approved by the 
appropriate DoD official designated in paragraph (a) of this section. 
See United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951).
    (3) Whenever a litigation request or demand is made upon DoD 
personnel for official DoD information or for testimony concerning such 
information, the personnel upon whom the request or demand was made 
shall immediately notify the appropriate DoD official designated in 
Sec. 97.6(a) for the Component to which the individual contacted is or, 
for former personnel, was last assigned. In appropriate cases, the 
responsible DoD official shall thereupon notify the Department of 
Justice of the request or demand. After due consultation and 
coordination with the Department of Justice, as required, the DoD 
official shall determine whether the individual is required to comply 
with the request or demand and shall notify the requestor or the court 
or other authority of the determination reached.
    (4) If, after DoD personnel have received a litigation request or 
demand and have in turn notified the appropriate DoD official in 
accordance with

[[Page 533]]

paragraph (c)(3) of this section , a response to the request or demand 
is required before instructions from the responsible official are 
received, the responsible official designated in paragraph (a) shall 
furnish the requestor or the court or other authority with a copy of 
this directive and applicable implementing regulations, inform the 
requestor or the court or other authority that the request or demand is 
being reviewed, and seek a stay of the request or demand pending a final 
determination by the Component concerned.
    (5) If a court of competent jurisdiction or other appropriate 
authority declines to stay the effect of the request or demand in 
response to action taken pursuant to Sec. 97.6(c)(4), or if such court 
or other authority orders that the request or demand must be complied 
with notwithstanding the final decision of the appropriate DoD official, 
the DoD personnel upon whom the request or demand was made shall notify 
the responsible DoD official of such ruling or order. If the DoD 
official determines that no further legal review of or challenge to the 
court's order or ruling will be sought, the affected DoD personnel shall 
comply with the request, demand, or order. If directed by the 
appropriate DoD official, however, the affected DoD personnel shall 
respectfully decline to comply with the demand. See United States ex 
rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951).
    (d) Fees. Consistent with the guidelines in DoD Instruction 7230.7, 
``User Charges,'' January 29, 1985, the appropriate officials designated 
in Sec. 97.6(a) are authorized to charge reasonable fees, as 
established by regulation and to the extent not prohibited by law, to 
parties seeking, by request or demand, official DoD information not 
otherwise available under DoD 5400.7-R, ``DoD Freedom of Information Act 
Program,'' March 24, 1980. Such fees, in amounts calculated to reimburse 
the government for the expense of providing such information, may 
include the costs of time expended by DoD employees to process and 
respond to the request or demand; attorney time for reviewing the requst 
or demand and any information located in response thereto and for 
related legal work in connection with the request or demand; and 
expenses generated by materials and equipment used to search for, 
produce, and copy the responsive information. See Oppenheimer Fund, Inc. 
v. Sanders, 437 U.S. 340 (1978).
    (e) Expert or opinion testimony. DoD personnel shall not provide, 
with or without compensation, opinion or expert testimony concerning 
official DoD information, subjects, or activities, except on behalf of 
the United States or a party represented by the Department of Justice. 
Upon a showing by the requestor of exceptional need or unique 
circumstances and that the anticipated testimony will not be adverse to 
the interests of the Department of Defense or the United States, the 
appropriate DoD official designated in paragraph (a) of this section 
may, in writing, grant special authorization for DoD personnel to appear 
and testify at no expense to the United States. If, despite the final 
determination of the responsible DoD official, a court of competent 
jurisdiction or other appropriate authority, orders the appearance and 
expert or opinion testimony of DoD personnel, the personnel shall notify 
the responsible DoD official of such order. If the DoD official 
determines that no further legal review of or challenge to the court's 
order will be sought, the affected DoD personnel shall comply with the 
order. If directed by the appropriate DoD official, however, the 
affected DoD personnel shall respectfully decline to comply with the 
demand. See United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951).

    (i) Transferred to the IRR for the balance of their current 
enlistment contract or service agreement with a tentative 
characterization of service, normally under other than honorable 
conditions, when the Military Department concerned has determined that 
the individual still has a potential for useful service under conditions 
of full mobilization; or
    (ii) Discharged for unsatisfactory performance under 32 CFR part 41 
when the Military Department concerned has determined that the 
individual has no further potential for useful service under conditions 
of full mobilization.
    (3) When a member of the Selected Reserve is identified as an 
unsatisfactory participant and considered a possible candidate for 
involuntary transfer to the IRR or for discharge, a board of officers 
shall be convened, as required

[[Page 537]]

by 10 U.S.C. 1163 to consider the circumstances and recommend 
appropriate action.
    (4) When an individual is transferred to the IRR as a result of an 
approved board recommendation, no further board action shall be required 
before discharge if the individual fails to take affirmative action in 
an effort to upgrade the tentative characterization of service.
    (5) Members of the IRR who have not fulfilled their statutory 
military service obligation under 10 U.S.C. 651 were enlisted or 
appointed under any program that provided that the obligation could be 
fulfilled by service in the IRR only, and whose participation in such a 
program has not been satisfactory may be:
    (i) Retained in the IRR for the duration of their statutory military 
service obligation with a tentative characterization of service, 
normally under other than honorable conditions, when the Military 
Department concerned has determined that the individual still possesses 
the potential for useful service under conditions of full mobilization; 
or
    (ii) Discharged for unsatisfactory performance under 32 CFR part 41, 
when the Military Department concerned has determined that the 
individual has no potential for useful service under conditions of full 
mobilization.
    (6) When a member of the IRR, whose enlistment or appointment 
provided that the service concerned could be performed entirely in the 
IRR (as opposed to the Selected Reserve), is identified as an 
unsatisfactory participant, a board of officers shall be convened as 
required by 10 U.S.C. 1163 to consider the circumstances and recommend 
appropriate action. When an individual is retained as a result of an 
approved board action, no further board action shall be required before 
discharge if the individual fails to take affirmative action in an 
effort to upgrade the tentative characterization of service.
    (7) Individuals assigned to the Selected Reserve who are ordered to 
active duty under 10 U.S.C. 673a or to active duty for training under 
the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 270 may be returned to their previous unit 
of assignment or transferred to the IRR upon the completion of the 
active duty or active duty for training. When necessary, the 
individual's term of enlistment or service agreement may be extended to 
permit completion of the designated period of active duty or active duty 
for training in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 270(b) and 673(b).
    (8) Individuals who are transferred or assigned to the IRR who have 
a tentative characterization of service of less than honorable because 
of unsatisfactory participation in the Ready Reserve shall be discharged 
at the end of their statutory military service obligation or their 
period of enlistment or service agreement, whichever is later with such 
characterization unless the individuals have taken affirmative action to 
upgrade the tentative characterization of service. Affirmative actions 
may include, but are not limited to, rejoining a unit of the Selected 
Reserve and participating satisfactorily for a period of 12 months, or 
volunteering for and completing a tour of active duty for training of 
not less than 45 days. When necessary, the individual's term of 
enlistment or service agreement may be extended to complete the 
affirmative action and qualify for a more favorable characterization of 
service.
    (9) When members of the Selected Reserve are ordered to active duty, 
active duty for training, or transferred to the IRR because of 
unsatisfactory participation, copies of their orders should be furnished 
to the individuals through personal contact by a member of the command 
and a written acknowledgment of receipt obtained. When such efforts are 
unsuccessful, the orders shall be mailed to the individual.
    (i) Orders mailed to such members shall be sent by Certified Mail 
(Return Receipt Requested), and a Receipt for Certified Mail (PS Form 
3800) obtained. In addition, the individual who mails the orders shall 
prepare a Sworn Affidavit of Service by Mail (format at enclosure) that 
shall be inserted, together with the PS Form 3800, in the member's 
personnel file.
    (ii) Notification shall be made through the mailing of orders to the 
member's most recent mailing address.

[[Page 538]]

    (iii) Provided the orders were properly mailed to the most recent 
address furnished by the member, absence of proof of delivery does not 
change the fact that the member was properly ordered to report for 
active duty, active duty for training, or transferred to the IRR, as 
appropriate.
    (iv) Individuals ordered to active duty who fail to report shall 
have their names entered into the National Crime Information Center of 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation within 30 days following their 
reporting date and appropriate screening by the Deserter Information 
Point concerned.
    (10) Orders affecting members of the IRR that involve active duty 
for training required by the terms of their enlistment or service 
agreement may be handled by mail in the manner prescribed in paragraph 
(a)(9)(i) of this section.
    (11) Each member of the IRR must keep the organization of assignment 
informed of:
    (i) His/her accurate and current mailing address;
    (ii) Any change of address, marital status, number of dependents, 
and civilian employment; and
    (iii) Any change in physical condition that would prevent the member 
from meeting the physical or mental standards prescribed by 10 U.S.C. 
652 and part 44 of this title.
    (12) Individuals involuntarily ordered to active duty or active duty 
for training under provisions of this part may be delayed as prescribed 
by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned.
    (13) Individuals whose involuntary order to active duty would result 
in extreme community or personal hardship may, upon their request, be 
transferred to the Standby Reserve, the Retired Reserve, or discharged, 
as appropriate, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 673a(c) and part 44 of this 
title.
    (b) Exceptions. As exceptions to the criteria in paragraph (a) of 
this section, members of the Ready Reserve who do not or are unable to 
participate for any of the following reasons shall be processed as 
indicated:
    (1) Members of the Selected Reserve who are unable to participate in 
a unit of the Selected Reserve by reason of an action taken by the 
Military Department concerned, such as unit inactivation or relocation, 
to the effect that they now reside beyond a reasonable commuting 
distance (as defined in Sec. 100.6(e)) of a Reserve unit, shall be 
assigned to the IRR until they are able to join or be assigned to 
another unit, or complete their statutory military service obligation.
    (2) Members of the Selected Reserve who change their residence:
    (i) May lose their unit position. However, they will be transferred 
to another paid-drill unit with the same Reserve component if possible 
or be given 90 days after departing from their original unit to locate 
and join another unit. At the new unit, they will fill an existing 
vacancy or be assigned as a temporary overstrength within the 
congressionally authorized standard-years (defined in Sec. 100.6(f)) or 
funds under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section.
    (ii) May locate position vacancies that require different 
specialties than the ones they now possess. Therefore, the Secretary of 
the Military Department concerned may provide for the retaining of these 
individuals (with their consent) by ordering them to active duty for 
training to acquire the necessary specialties.
    (iii) Must be accepted in a Reserve unit by their parent Military 
Department regardless of vacancies, subject to the following conditions:
    (A) The losing unit certifies that the reservist's performance of 
service has been satisfactory.
    (B) The reservist's specialty is usable in the unit, the member can 
be retrained by on-the-job training, or the member is willing to be 
retrained as outlined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (iv) Are authorized to transfer to another Reserve component under 
the provisions of DoD Directive 1205.51, ``Transfer of Persons Between 
Reserve Components of the Armed Forces,'' June 25, 1959, when the 
conditions outlined in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) apply.
    (3) If members of the Selected Reserve who change their residents 
fail to join another unit within a period of 90

[[Page 539]]

days, and at least 1 unit of their component is within a reasonable 
commuting distance, as such distance is defined in Sec. 100.6(e) they 
shall be processed in accordance with Sec. 100.5(a) unless they are 
considered eligible to be handled as ``exceptions'' under policies 
outlined in paragraph (b) (5) through (8) of this section.
    (4) If members of the Selected Reserve who change their residences 
locate in an area where they reside beyond a reasonable commuting 
distance, as such distance is defined in Sec. 100.6(e) of a paid-drill 
unit of the same Reserve component, they shall be assigned to the IRR of 
their service until they are able to transfer to a paid-drill unit of 
another Reserve component; or complete their statutory military service 
obligation.
    (5) Members of the Ready Reserve who are preparing for, or are 
engaged in, critical civilian occupations will be screened in accordance 
with 32 CFR part 44.
    (6) Individuals who are preparing for the ministry in a recognized 
theological or divinity school may participate voluntarily in the Ready 
Reserve. However, under 10 U.S.C. 685, such individuals may not be 
required to do so. Members who do not wish to participate shall be 
transferred to the Standby Reserve. If such training is terminated 
before graduation, the member may be transferred back to the Ready 
Reserve. A member eligible for assignment to the Standby Reserve under 
the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 268(b), 270, 510, 511, 593, 597, 651, 652, 
672, 673, 673a, 673b, 685, and 1163 who voluntarily remains assigned to 
the Selected Reserve and participates in the training required, waives 
any right to request delay to exemption from any later mobilization on 
the basis of preparation for the ministry.
    (7) Individuals who are enrolled in a course of graduate study in 
one of the health professions shall be screened in accordance with DoD 
Directive 1200.141, ``Reservists Who Are Engaged in Graduate Study or 
Training in Certain Health Progressions,'' July 30, 1969.
    (8) Individuals who incur a bona fide, temporary nonmilitary 
obligation requiring overseas residency outside the United States, or 
religious missionary obligation shall be processed in accordance with 32 
CFR art 103.
    (9) Nothing in this part shall be construed as limiting the right of 
the individual to voluntarily request transfer to the Standby Reserve or 
to the Retired Reserve, or discharge from the Reserve components when 
such action is authorized by regulations of the Military Department 
concerned.
    (10) Nothing in this part shall be construed as precluding action 
against a member of the Ready Reserve, either by court-martial or review 
by a board of officers convened by an authority designated by the 
Secretary of the Military Department concerned, when such action might 
otherwise be warranted under 10 U.S.C. 268(b), 270, 510, 511, 593, 597, 
651, 652, 672, 673, 673a, 673b, 685, and 1163 and the regulations of the 
Military Department concerned.

duty or who, under the policy and regulations of the Military Services 
concerned, were credited with having served 2 years of active duty will 
not be required to perform duty as described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) (A) 
and (B) of this section unless such members:
    (i) Enlisted under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 511(b) or (d) thereby

the Secretary concerned, or designee, may waive this requirement in 
those cases where involuntary retention would not be in the best 
interest of the Service.
    (iii) Filled a vacancy in the Selected Reserve that otherwise cannot 
be filled, following a diligent recruiting effort by the Secretary 
concerned.
    (iv) Executed a separate written agreement incurring an obligation

wounded while on active duty in hostile areas, will not be required to 
perform duty involuntarily (as described paragraph (a) (1)(i)(A) and (2) 
of this section. However, these members may be required to participate 
or serve on active duty for no more than 30 days each year, unless 
otherwise specifically prescribed by the Secretary of Defense.

[[Page 542]]

    (ii) Members, who enlisted under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 511(b)

    (5) Exclusion. Notwithstanding the exclusion of the member enlisted 
under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 511(b) or (d), from the policies set 
forth in paragraph (a) (3) and (4) of this section, the Secretaries of 
the Military Departments may, with the approval of the Secretary of

performing the duty described in Sec. 101.5(a), depending upon the 
particular needs of the Military Department concerned.


<R05>
Sec. 101.6  Criteria for satisfactory performance.

    Within the general policy outlined in Sec. 101.5(a), the minimum 
amount of annual training prescribed by the Secretaries of the Military 
Departments concerned will be no less than the training required to 
maintain the proficiency of the unit and the skill of the individual. In 
establishing annual training requirements under this policy, the 
Secretaries:
    (a) May grant exceptions under circumstances outlined below for 
individuals who are subject to the training requirements set forth in 
Sec. 101.5(a)(1) and (2):
    (1) To the degree that it is consistent with military requirements, 
the personal circumstances of an individual may be considered in 
assigning him/her to a training category prescribed in 32 CFR part 102, 
except as otherwise provided by 32 CFR part 100.
    (2) Members who have performed a minimum initial tour of extended 
active duty, as prescribed by the Military Departments concerned may be 
placed in Category I (no training) as defined in 32 CFR part 102, when 
the Secretary of the Military Department concerned determines that no 
training for mobilization requirement exists because of
    (i) Changes in military skills required;
    (ii) The degree of military skill held; or
    (iii) Compatibility of the member's civilian occupation with his/her 
military skill.
    (b) May grant exceptions regarding absences after considering the 
member's manner of performance of prescribed training duty under the 
provisions of Sec. 101.5(a)(1) and provided that the absences not so 
excepted do not exceed 10% of scheduled drills or training periods.
    (c) Shall require members to: (1) Meet the standards of satisfactory 
performance of training duty set forth in Sec. 101.6(b); or (2) 
participate satisfactorily in an officer training program. The placement 
of such members in the Standby Reserve as a result of the screening 
process prescribed in 32 CFR part 44, will continue to constitute 
satisfactory performance of service.


<R05>
Sec. 101.7  Compliance measures.

    Under the provisions of 32 CFR part 100, members of the Ready 
Reserve who fail to meet the criteria for satisfactory performance, as 
set forth in Sec. 101.6, may be:
    (a) Ordered to active duty; or
    (b) Ordered to active duty for training; or
    (c) Transferred to, or retained in the Individual Ready Reserve with 
a tentative characterization of service, normally under other than 
honorable conditions; or
    (d) Discharged for unsatisfactory participation under the provisions 
of 32 CFR part 41, when the Military Department concerned has determined 
that the individual has no potential for useful service under conditions 
of full mobilization.


<R05>
Sec. 101.8  Reserve training in sovereign foreign nations.

    (a) The Secretaries of the Military Departments may authorize the 
conduct of scheduled drills or training periods, correspondence courses, 
and such other active or inactive duty training as they consider 
appropriate for members of the Reserve components who may be temporarily 
residing in sovereign foreign nations which permit the United States to 
maintain troops

[[Page 543]]

of the Active Forces (other than Military Advisory Assistance Group or 
attached personnel) within their boundaries.
    (b) Prior to authorizing such training, the Secretaries of the 
Military Departments will instruct the attaches representing their 
respective Departments to inform the U.S. Ambassador and the appropriate 
officials of the foreign government of the intent to conduct such 
training. If the foreign government objects, the Secretaries of the 
Military Departments will furnish all the facts and their 
recommendations to the Secretary of Defense.
    (c) This policy does not prohibit the conduct of inactive duty 
training, such as correspondence courses, in those sovereign foreign 
countries in which the United States does not maintain Active Forces and 
where an agreement exists between the United States and the sovereign 
foreign nation concerned for the conduct of such training.
    (d) This policy does not prohibit for a limited duration the 
augmentation of Defense Attache Offices by attache reservists 
(mobilization augmentees or mobilization designees) during periods of 
local emergencies or for short-term (less than 30 days) training 
periods, provided the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section are 
respected. Attache reservists who are available, possess the expertise 
required, and reside temporarily in foreign countries, shall be utilized 
to the maximum extent to augment Defense Attache Offices before the 
continental United States-based attache reservists are utilized.

the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a Service in the Department 
of the Navy. The term ``Military Services'' refers to the Army, the 
Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, and the Coast Guard.


<R05>
Sec. 104.3  Definitions.

    Critical mission. An operational mission that requires the skills or 
resources available in a Reserve component or components.

[[Page 544]]

    Critical requirement. A requirement in which the incumbent possesses 
unique knowledge, extensive experience, and specialty skill training to 
successfully fulfill the duties or responsibilities in support of the 
mission, operation or exercise. Also, a requirement in which the 
incumbent must gain the necessary experience to qualify for key senior 
leadership positions within his or her Reserve component.
    Escalator position. This is established by the principle that the 
returning Service member is entitled to the position of civilian 
employment that he or she would have attained had he or she remained 
continuously employed by that civilian employer. This may be a position 
of greater or lesser responsibilities, to include a layoff status, when 
compared to the employees of the same seniority and status employed by 
the company.
    Impossible or unreasonable. For the purpose of determining when 
providing advance notice of uniformed service to an employer is 
impossible or unreasonable, the unavailability of an employer or 
employer representative to whom notification can be given, an order by 
competent military authority to report for uniformed service within 
forty-eight hours of notification, or other circumstances that the 
Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs may 
determine are impossible or unreasonable are sufficient justification 
for not providing advance notice of pending uniformed service to an 
employer.
    Military necessity. For the purpose of determining when providing 
advance notice of uniformed service is not required, a mission, 
operation, exercise or requirement that is classified, or a pending or 
ongoing mission, operation, exercise or requirement that may be 
compromised or otherwise adversely affected by public knowledge is 
sufficient justification for not providing advance notice to an 
employer.
    Non-career service. The period of active uniformed service required 
to complete the initial uniformed service obligation; a period of active 
duty or full-time National Guard duty that is for a specified purpose 
and duration with no expressed or implied commitment for continued 
active duty; or participation in a Reserve component as a member of the 
Ready Reserve performing annual training, active duty for training or 
inactive duty training. Continuous or repeated active uniformed service 
or full-time National Guard duty that results in eligibility for a 
regular retirement from the Armed Forces is not considered non-career 
service.
    Officer. For determining those Service officials authorized to 
provide advance notice to a civilian employer of pending uniformed 
service by a Service member or an individual who has applied for 
uniformed service, an officer shall include all commissioned officers, 
warrant officers, and non-commissioned officers authorized by the 
Secretary concerned to act in this capacity.
    Uniformed service. Performance of duty on a voluntary or involuntary 
basis in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps or the 
Coast Guard, including their Reserve components, when the Service member 
is engaged in active duty, active duty for special work, active duty for 
training, initial active duty for training, inactive duty training, 
annual training or full-time National Guard duty, and, for purposes of 
this part, a period for which a person is absent from a position of 
employment for the purpose of an examination to determine the fitness of 
the person to perform such duty.


<R05>
Sec. 104.4  Policy.

    It is DoD policy to support non-career service by taking appropriate 
actions to inform and assist uniformed Service members and former 
Service members who are covered by the provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 
43, and individuals who apply for uniformed service of their rights, 
benefits, and obligations under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 43. Such actions 
include:
    (a) Advising non-career Service members and individuals who apply 
for uniformed service of their employment and reemployment rights and 
benefits provided in 38 U.S.C. chapter 43, as implemented by this part, 
and the obligations they must meet to exercise those rights.
    (b) Providing assistance to Service members, former Service members 
and

[[Page 545]]

individuals who apply for uniformed service in exercising employment and 
reemployment rights and benefits.
    (c) Providing assistance to civilian employers of non-career Service 
members in addressing issues involving uniformed service as it relates 
to civilian employment or reemployment.
    (d) Considering requests from civilian employers of members of the 
National Guard and Reserve to adjust a Service member's scheduled 
absence from civilian employment because of uniformed service or make 
other accommodations to such requests, when it is reasonable to do so.
    (e) Documenting periods of uniformed service that are exempt from a 
Service member's cumulative 5-year absence from civilian employment to 
perform uniformed service as provided in 38 U.S.C. chapter 43 and 
implemented by this part.
    (f) Providing, at the Service member's request, necessary 
documentation concerning a period or periods of service, or providing a 
written statement that such documentation is not available, that will 
assist the Service member in establishing civilian reemployment rights, 
benefits and obligations.


<R05>
Sec. 104.5  Responsibilities.

<R05>
Sec. 104.6  Procedures.

    The Secretaries of the Military Departments and the Commandant of 
the Coast Guard shall:
    (a) Inform individuals who apply for uniformed service and members 
of a Reserve component who perform or participate on a voluntary or 
involuntary basis in active duty, active duty

[[Page 546]]

for special work, initial active duty for training, active duty for 
training, inactive duty training, annual training and full-time National 
Guard duty, of their employment and reemployment rights, benefits, and 
obligations as provided under 38 U.S.C. chapter 43 and described in 
Appendix A of this part. Other appropriate materials may be used to 
supplement the information contained in Appendix A of this part.
    (1) Persons who apply for uniformed service shall be advised that 
DoD strongly encourages applicants to provide advance notice in writing 
to their civilian employers of pending uniformed service or any absence 
for the purpose of an examination to determine the person's fitness to 
perform uniformed service. Providing written advance notice is 
preferable to verbal advance notice since it is easier to establish that 
this basic prerequisite to retaining reemployment rights was fulfilled. 
Regardless of the means of providing advance notice, whether verbal or 
written, it should be provided as early as practicable.
    (2) Annually and whenever called to duty for a contingency 
operation, advise Service members who are participating in a Reserve 
component of:
    (i) The requirement to provide advance written or verbal notice to 
their civilian employers for each period of military training, active 
and inactive duty, or full-time National Guard duty.
    (A) Reserve component members shall be advised that DoD strongly 
encourages that they provide advance notice to their civilian employers 
in writing for each period of pending uniformed service. Providing 
written advance notice is preferable to verbal advance notice since it 
easily establishes that this prerequisite to retaining reemployment 
rights was fulfilled.
    (B) Regardless of the means of providing advance notice, whether 
written or verbal, it should be provided as early as practicable. DoD 
strongly recommends that advance notice to civilian employers be 
provided at least 30 days prior to departure for uniformed service when 
it is feasible to do so.
    (C) The advance notice requirement can be met by providing the 
employer with a copy of the unit annual training schedule or preparing a 
standardized letter. The sample employer notification letter in Appendix 
B of this part may be used for this purpose.
    (ii) The 5-year cumulative limit on absences from their civilian 
employment due to uniformed service and exemptions to that limit.
    (iii) The requirements for reporting or submitting application to 
return to their position of civilian employment.
    (iv) Their general reemployment rights and benefits.
    (v) The option for continuing employer provided health care, if the 
employer provides such a benefit.
    (vi) The opportunity to use accrued leave in order to perform 
uniformed service.
    (vii) Who they may contact to obtain assistance with employment and 
reemployment questions and problems.
    (b) Inform Service members who are covered by the provisions of 38 
U.S.C. Chapter 43, upon completion of an extended period of active duty 
and before separation from active duty of their employment and 
reemployment rights, benefits, and obligations as provided under 38 
U.S.C. Chapter 43. This shall, as a minimum, include notification and 
reporting requirements for returning to employment with their civilian 
employer. While Appendix A of this part provides the necessary 
information to satisfy this requirement, other appropriate materials may 
be used to supplement this information.
    (c) Issue orders that span the entire period of service when 
ordering a member of the National Guard or Reserve to active duty for a 
mission or requirement. Order modifications shall be initiated, as 
required, to ensure continuous active duty should the period required to 
complete the mission or requirement change.
    (d) Document the length of a Service member's initial period of 
military service obligation performed on active duty.
    (e) Determine and certify in writing those additional training 
requirements not already exempt for the 5-year cumulative service limit 
which are necessary for the professional development, or skill training 
or retraining for members of the National Guard or Reserve. Once the 
Secretary concerned certifies those training requirements,

[[Page 547]]

performance of uniformed service to complete a certified training 
requirement is exempt from the 5-year cumulative service limit.
    (f) Determine those periods of active duty when a Service member is 
ordered to, or retained on, active duty (other than for training) under 
any provision of law because of a war or national emergency declared by 
the President or Congress. If the purpose of the order to, or retention 
on, active duty is for the direct or indirect support of the war or 
national emergency, then the orders of the Service member should be so 
annotated, since that period of service is exempt from the 5-year 
cumulative service limit established in 38 U.S.C. Chapter 43.
    (g) Determine those periods of active duty performed by a member of 
the National Guard or Reserve that are designated by the Secretary 
concerned as a critical mission or critical requirement, and for that 
reason are exempt form the 5-year cumulative service limit. The 
authority for determining what constitutes a critical mission or 
requirement shall not be delegated below the Assistant Secretary level 
or the Commandant of the Coast Guard. The designation of a critical 
requirement to gain the necessary experience to qualify for key senior 
leadership positions shall be used judiciously, and the necessary 
experience and projected key leadership positions fully documented. This 
authority shall not be used to grant exemptions to avoid the cumulative 
5-year service limit established by 38 U.S.C. Chapter 43 or to extend 
individuals in repeated statutory tours. The Assistant Secretary of 
Defense for Reserve Affairs shall be notified in writing of all 
occasions in which a Service member is granted more than one exemption 
for a critical requirement when the additional exemption(s) extend the 
Service member beyond the 5-year cumulative service limit established in 
38 U.S.C. Chapter 43.
    (h) When appropriate, ensure that orders to active duty or orders 
retaining members on active duty specify the statutory or Secretarial 
authority for those orders when such authority meets one or more of the 
exemptions from the 5-year cumulative service limit provided in 38 
U.S.C. Chapter 43. If circumstances arise that prevent placing this 
authority on the orders, the authority shall be included in a separation 
document and retained in the Service member's personnel file.
    (i) Ensure that appropriate documents verifying any period of 
service exempt from the 5-year cumulative service limit are place in the 
Service member's personnel record or other appropriate record.
    (j) Document those circumstances that prevent a Service member from 
providing advance notification of uniformed service to a civilian 
employer because of military necessity or when advance notification is 
otherwise impossible or unreasonable, as defined in Sec. 104.3.
    (k) Designate those officers, as defined in Sec. 104.3, who are 
authorized by the Secretary concerned to provide advance notification of 
service to a civilian employer on behalf of a Service member or 
applicant for uniformed service.
    (l) Provide documentation, upon request from a Service member or 
former Service member, that may be used to satisfy the Service member's 
entitlement to statutory reemployment rights and benefits. Appropriate 
documentation may include, as necessary:
    (1) The inclusive dates of the initial period of military service 
obligation performed on active duty.
    (2) Any period of service during which a Service member was required 
to serve because he or she was unable to obtain a release from active 
duty though no fault of the Service member.
    (3) The cumulative length of all periods of active duty performed.
    (4) The authority under which a Service member was ordered to active 
duty when such service was exempt from the 5-year cumulative service 
limit.
    (5) The date the Service member was last released from active duty, 
active duty for special work, initial active duty for training, active 
duty for training, inactive duty training, annual training or full-time 
National Guard duty. This documentation establishes the timeliness of 
reporting to, or submitting application to return to, a position of 
civilian employment.
    (6) Whether service requirements prevent providing a civilian 
employer

[[Page 548]]

with advance notification of pending service.
    (7) That the Service member's entitlement to reemployment benefits 
has not been terminated because of the character of service as provided 
in 38 U.S.C. 4304.
    (8) When appropriate, a statement that sufficient documentation does 
not exist.
    (m) Establish a central point of contact at a headquarters or 
regional command who can render assistance to active duty Service 
members and applicants for uniformed service about employment and 
reemployment rights, benefits and obligations.
    (n) Establish points of contact in each Reserve component 
headquarters or Reserve regional command, and each National Guard State 
headquarters who can render assistance to:
    (1) Members of the National Guard or Reserve about employment and 
reemployment rights, benefits and obligations.
    (2) Employers of National Guard and Reserve members about duty or 
training requirements arising from a member's uniformed service or 
service obligation.
    (o) A designated Reserve component representative shall consider, 
and accommodate when it does not conflict with military requirements, a 
request from a civilian employer of a National Guard and Reserve member 
to adjust a Service member's absence from civilian employment due to 
uniformed service when such service has an adverse impact on the 
employer. The representative may make arrangements other than adjusting 
the period of absence to accommodate such a request when it serves the 
best interest of the military and is reasonable to do so.

  Appendix A to Part 104--Civilian Employment and Reemployment Rights, 
  Benefits and Obligations for Applicants for, and Service Members and 
            Former Service Members of the Uniformed Services

                          A. Scope of Coverage

    1. The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act 
(USERRA) which is codified in 38 U.S.C. Chapter 43 provides protection 
to anyone absent from a position of civilian employment because of 
uniformed service if:
    a. Advance written or verbal notice was given to the civilian 
employer.
    (1) Advance notice is not required if precluded by military 
necessity, or is otherwise unreasonable or impossible.
    (2) DoD strongly encourages Service members and or applicants for 
service to provide advance notice to their civilian employer in writing 
for each period of pending uniformed service. Providing written advance 
notice is preferable to verbal advance notice since it easily 
establishes that this prerequisite to retaining reemployment rights was 
fulfilled. Regardless of the means of providing advance notice, whether 
written or verbal, it should be provided as early as practicable. Also, 
DoD strongly recommends that Reserve component members provide advance 
notice to their civilian employers at least 30 days in advance when it 
is feasible to do so. The advance notice requirement can be met by 
providing the employer with a copy of the unit annual training schedule 
or preparing a standardized letter. The sample employer notification 
letter in Appendix B of this part may be used for this purpose;
    b. The cumulative length of absences does not exceed 5 years;
    c. The individual reports to, or submits an application for 
reemployment, within the specified period based on duration of services 
as described in section D of this Appendix; and,
    d. The person's character of service was not disqualifying as 
described in paragraphs A.2.d. and e. of this appendix.
    2. A civilian employer is not required to reemploy a person if:
    a. The civilian employment was for a brief, non-recurrent period and 
there was no reasonable expectation that the employment would continue 
indefinitely or for a significant period.
    b. The employer's circumstances have so changed as to make 
reemployment impossible or unreasonable.
    c. The reemployment imposes an undue hardship on the employer in the 
case of an individual who:
    (1) Has incurred a service connected disability; or,
    (2) Is not qualified for the escalator position or the position last 
held, and cannot become qualified for any other position of lesser 
status and pay after a reasonable effort by the employer to qualify the 
person for such positions.
    d. The Service member or former Service member was separated from a 
uniformed service with a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge, or 
separated from a uniformed service under other than honorable 
conditions.
    e. An officer dismissed from any Armed Force or dropped from the 
rolls of any

[[Page 549]]

Armed Force as prescribed under 10 U.S.C. 1161.
    f. The cumulative length of service exceeds five years and no 
portion of the cumulative five years of uniformed service falls within 
the exceptions described in section C. of this Appendix.
    g. An employer asserting that he or she is not required to reemploy 
an individual because the employment was for a brief, non-recurrent 
period, or reemployment is impossible or unreasonable, or reemployment 
imposes an undue hardship on the employer, that employer has the burden 
of proving his or her assertion.
    3. Entitlement to protection under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 43 does not 
depend on the timing, frequency, and duration of training or uniformed 
service.

       B. Prohibition Against Discrimination and Acts of Reprisal

    1. A person who is a member of, applies to be a member of, has 
performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform service 
in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment, 
reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any employment 
benefit by an employer on the basis of that membership, an application 
for membership, performance of service, or an obligation for service in 
the uniformed services.
    2. A person, including a non-Service member, shall not be subject to 
employment discrimination or any adverse employment action because he or 
she has taken an action to enforce a protection afforded a Service 
member, has testified or made a statement in or in connection with any 
proceeding concerning employment and reemployment rights of a service 
member, has assisted or participated in an investigation, or has 
otherwise exercised any right provided by 38 U.S.C. Chapter 43.
    3. An employer shall be considered to have engaged in an act of 
discrimination if an individual's membership, application for 
membership, service, application for service, or obligation for service 
in the uniformed services is a motivating factor in the employer's 
action, unless the employer can prove that the action would have been 
taken in the absence of such membership, application for membership, 
performance of service, application for service or obligation.

       C. Exceptions to the Maximum Period of Service for Coverage

    In order to retain reemployment rights and benefits provided by 38 
U.S.C. Chapter 43, the cumulative length of absences from the same 
employer cannot exceed 5 years. Not counted toward this limit is:
    1. Service beyond 5 years if required to complete an initial service 
obligation;
    2. Service during which an individual was unable to obtain release 
orders before the expiration of the 5-year cumulative service limit 
through no fault of his or her own;
    3. Inactive duty training; annual training; ordered to active duty 
for unsatisfactory participation; active duty by National Guardsmen for 
encampments, maneuvers, field operations or coastal defense; or to 
fulfill additional training requirements, as determined by the Secretary 
concerned, for professional skill development, or to complete skill 
training or retraining;
    4. Involuntary order or call to active duty, or retention on active 
duty;
    5. Ordered to or retained on active duty during a war or national 
emergency declared by the President or Congress;
    6. Ordered to active duty in support of an operational mission for 
which personnel have been involuntarily called to active duty;
    7. Performing service in support of a critical mission or 
requirement, as determined by the Secretary concerned;
    8. Performing service in the National Guard when ordered to active 
duty by the President to suppress an insurrection or rebellion, repel an 
invasion, or execute laws of the United States; and,
    9. Voluntary recall to active duty of retired regular Coast Guard 
officers or retired enlisted Coast Guard members.

                    D. Applications for Reemployment

    1. For service of 30 days or less, or for an absence for an 
examination to determine the individual's fitness to perform uniformed 
service, the Service member or applicant must report to work not later 
than the beginning of the first full regularly scheduled work period on 
the first full calendar day following the completion of service or the 
examination, after allowing for an eight hour rest period following safe 
transportation to his or her residence.
    2. For service of 31 days or more but less that 181 days, the 
Service member must submit an application for reemployment not later 
than 14 days after completion of service, or by the next full calendar 
day when submitting an application within the 14 day limit was 
impossible or unreasonable through no fault of the Service member.
    3. For service of 181 days or more, the Service member must submit 
an application for reemployment not later than 90 days after the 
completion of service.
    4. If hospitalized or convalescing from an illness or injury 
incurred or aggravated during service, the Service member must, at the 
end of the period necessary for recovery, follow the same procedures, 
based on length of service, as described in sections D.1. through D.3. 
of this appendix. The period of hospitalization or convalescence may not 
normally exceed 2 years.

[[Page 550]]

    5. Anyone who fails to report or apply for reemployment within the 
specified period shall not automatically forfeit entitlement to 
reemployment rights and benefits, but is subject to the rules of 
conduct, established policies, general practices of the employer 
pertaining to explanations and discipline because of an absence from 
scheduled work.

                      E. Documentation Upon Return

    1. If service is for 31 days or more, a Service member must provide 
documentation, upon request from the employer, that establishes:
    a. He or she made application to return to work within the 
prescribed time period;
    b. He or she has not exceeded the 5-year cumulative service limit; 
and
    c. His or her reemployment rights were not terminated because of 
character of service as described in paragraphs A.2.d. and e. of this 
appendix.
    2. Failure to provide documentation cannot serve as a basis for 
denying reemployment to the Service member, former Service member, or 
applicant if documentation does not exist or is not readily available at 
the time of the employer's request. However, if after reemployment, 
documentation becomes available that establishes that the Service member 
or former Service member does not meet one or more of the requirements 
contained in section E.1. of this appendix, the employer may immediately 
terminate the employment.

             F. Position To Which Entitled Upon Reemployment

    1. Reemployment position for service of 90 days or less:
    a. The position the person would have attained if continuously 
employed (the ``escalator'' position) and if qualified to perform the 
duties; or,
    b. The position in which the person was employed in when he or she 
departed for uniformed service, but only if the person is not qualified 
to perform the duties of the escalator position, despite the employer's 
reasonable efforts to qualify the person for the escalator position.
    2. Reemployment position for service of 91 days or more:
    a. The escalator position, or a position of like seniority, status 
and pay, the duties of which the person is qualified to perform; or,
    b. The position in which the person was employed in when he or she 
departed for uniformed service or a position of like seniority, status 
and pay, the duties of which the person is qualified to perform, but 
only if the person is not qualified to perform the duties of the 
escalator position after the employer has made a reasonable effort to 
qualify the person for the escalator position.
    3. If a person cannot become qualified, after reasonable efforts by 
the employer to qualify the person, for either the escalator position or 
the position formerly occupied by the employee as provided in sections 
F.1. and F.2. of this appendix, for any reason (other than disability), 
the person must be employed in any other position of lesser status and 
pay that the person is qualified to perform, with full seniority.

                G. Position To Which Entitled if Disabled

    If a person who is disabled because of service cannot (after 
reasonable efforts by the employer to accommodate the disability) be 
employed in the escalator position, he or she must be reemployed:
    1. In any other position that is equivalent to the escalator 
position in terms of seniority, status, and pay that the person is 
qualified or can become qualified to perform with reasonable efforts by 
the employer; or,
    2. In a position, consistent with the person's disability, that is 
the nearest approximation to the position in terms of seniority, status, 
and pay to the escalator or equivalent position.

                H. Reemployment by the Federal Government

    1. A person who was employed by a Federal Executive Agency when he 
or she departed for uniformed service must be reemployed using the same 
order of priorities as prescribed in sections F. and G. of this appendix 
as appropriate. If the Director of OPM determines that the Federal 
Executive Agency that employed the person no longer exists and the 
functions have not been transferred to another Federal Executive Agency, 
or it is impossible or unreasonable for the agency to reemploy the 
person, the Director of OPM shall identify a position of like seniority, 
status, and pay at another Federal Executive Agency that satisfies the 
reemployment criteria established for private sector employers, sections 
F. and G. of this appendix, and for which the person is qualified and 
ensure that the person is offered such position.
    2. If a person was employed by the Judicial Branch or the 
Legislative Branch of the Federal Government when he or she departed for 
uniformed service, and the employer determines that it is impossible or 
unreasonable to reemploy the person, the Director of OPM shall, upon 
application by the person, ensure that an offer of employment in a 
Federal Executive Agency is made.
    3. If the Adjutant General of a State determines that it is 
impossible or unreasonable to reemploy a person who was employed as a 
National Guard technician, the Director of OPM shall, upon application 
by the person, ensure that an offer of employment in a Federal Executive 
Agency is made.

[[Page 551]]

               I. Reemployment by Certain Federal Agencies

    1. The heads of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central 
Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National 
Imagery and Mapping Agency, the National Security Agency, and, as 
determined by the President, any Executive Agency or unit thereof, the 
principal function of which is to conduct foreign intelligence or 
counterintelligence activities, shall prescribe procedures for 
reemployment rights for their agency that are similar to those 
prescribed for private and other Federal agencies.
    2. If an appropriate officer of an agency referred to in subsection 
I.1. of this appendix determines that reemployment of a person who was 
an employee of that agency when he or she departed for uniformed service 
is impossible or unreasonable, the agency shall notify the person and 
the Director of OPM. The Director of OPM shall, upon application by that 
person, ensure that the person is offered employment in a position in a 
Federal Executive Agency.

                     J. General Rights and Benefits

    1. A person who is reemployed under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 43 is entitled 
to the seniority, and other rights and benefits determined by seniority 
that the person had upon commencing uniformed service, and any 
additional seniority, and rights and benefits he or she would have 
attained if continuously employed.
    2. A person who is absent by reason of uniformed service shall be 
deemed to be on furlough or leave of absence from his or her civilian 
employer and is entitled to such other rights and benefits not 
determined by seniority as generally provided by the employer to 
employees on furlough or leave of absence having similar seniority, 
status and pay who are also on furlough or leave of absence, as provided 
under a contract, policy, agreement, practice or plan in effect during 
the Service member's absence because of uniformed service.
    3. The individual may be required to pay the employee cost, if any, 
of any funded benefit continued to the same extent other employees on 
furlough or leave of absence are required to pay.

                     K. Loss of Rights and Benefits

    If, after being advised by his or her employer of the specific 
rights and benefits to be lost, a Service member, former Service member 
or applicant of uniformed service knowingly provided written notice of 
intent not to seek reemployment after completion of uniformed service, 
he or she is no longer entitled to any non-seniority based rights and 
benefits. This includes all non-seniority based rights and benefits 
provided under any contract, plan, agreement, or policy in effect at the 
time of entry into uniformed service or established while performing 
such service, and are generally provided by the employer to employees 
having similar seniority, status and pay who are on furlough or leave of 
absence.

                           L. Retention Rights

    A person who is reemployed following uniformed service cannot be 
discharged from employment, except for cause:
    1. Within 1 year after the date of reemployment if that person's 
service was 181 days or more; or,
    2. Within 180 days after the date of reemployment if such service 
was 31 days or more but less than 181 days.

                            M. Accrued Leave

    During any period of uniformed service, a person may, upon request, 
use any vacation, annual leave, or similar leave with pay accrued before 
the commencement of that period of service.

                             N. Health Plans

    An employer who provides employee health plan coverage, including 
group health plans, must allow the Service member to elect to continue 
personal coverage, and coverage for his or her dependents under the 
following circumstances:
    1. The maximum period of coverage of a person and the person's 
dependents under such an election shall be the lesser of:
    a. The 18 month period beginning on the date on which the person's 
absence begins; or
    b. The day after the date on which the person was required to apply 
for or return to a position or employment as specified in section D. of 
this appendix, and fails to do so.
    2. A person who elects to continue health plan coverage may be 
required to pay up to 102 percent of the full premium under the plan, 
except a person on active duty for 30 days or less cannot be required to 
pay more than the employee's share, if any, for the coverage.
    3. An exclusion or waiting period may not be imposed in connection 
with the reinstatement of coverage upon reemployment if one would not 
have been imposed had coverage not been terminated because of service. 
However, an exclusion or waiting period may be imposed for coverage of 
any illness or injury determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to 
have been incurred in, or aggravated during, the performance of 
uniformed service.

                    O. Employee Pension Benefit Plans

    1. This section applies to individuals whose pension benefits are 
not provided by the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) or the 
Civil Service Retirement System

[[Page 552]]

(CSRS), or a right provided under any Federal or State law governing 
pension benefits for governmental employees.
    2. A person reemployed after uniformed service shall be treated as 
if no break in service occurred with the employer(s) maintaining the 
employee's pension benefit plan. Each period of uniformed service, upon 
reemployment, shall be deemed to constitute service with the employer(s) 
for the purpose of determining the nonforfeitability of accrued benefits 
and accrual of benefits.
    3. An employer reemploying a Service member or former Service member 
under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 43 is liable to the plan for funding any 
obligation attributable to the employer of the employee's pension 
benefit plan that would have been paid to the plan on behalf of that 
employee but for his or her absence during a period of uniformed 
service.
    4. Upon reemployment, a person has three times the period of 
military service, but not to exceed five years after reemployment, 
within which to contribute the amount he or she would have contributed 
to the pension benefit plan if he or she had not been absent for 
uniformed service. He or she is entitled to accrued benefits of the 
pension plan that are contingent on the making of, or are derived from, 
employee contributions or elective deferrals only to the extent the 
person makes payment to the plan.

             P. Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS)

    1. Federal employees enrolled in FERS who are reemployed with the 
Government are allowed to make up contributions to the Thrift Savings 
Fund over a period specified by the employee. However, the makeup period 
may not be shorter than two times nor longer than four times the period 
of absence for uniformed service.
    2. Employees covered by the FERS are entitled to have contributions 
made to the Thrift Savings Fund on their behalf by the employing agency 
for their period of absence in an amount equal to one percent of the 
employee's basic pay. If an employee covered by FERS makes 
contributions, the employing agency must make matching contributions on 
the employee's behalf.
    3. The employee shall be credited with a period of civilian service 
equal to the period of uniformed service, and the employee may elect, 
for certain purposes, to have his or her separation treated as if it had 
never occurred.
    4. This benefit applies to any employee whose release from uniformed 
service, discharge from hospitalization, or other similar event make him 
or her eligible to seek reemployment under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 43 on or 
after August 2, 1990.
    5. Additional information about Thrift Saving Plan (TSP) benefits is 
available in TSP Bulletins 95-13 and 95-20. A fact sheet is included in 
TSP Bulletin 95-20 which describes benefits and procedures for eligible 
employees. Eligible employees should contact their personnel office for 
information and assistance.

                Q. Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS)

    1. Employees covered by CSRS may make up contributions to the TSP, 
as in section P.1. of this appendix. However, no employer contributions 
are made to the TSP account of CSRS employees.
    2. This benefit applies to any employee whose release from uniformed 
service, discharge from hospitalization, or other similar event makes 
him or her eligible to seek reemployment under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 43 on 
or after August 2, 1990.
    3. Additional information about TSP benefits is available in TSP 
Bulletins 95-13 and 95-20. A fact sheet is included in TSP Bulletin 95-
20 which describes benefits and procedures for eligible employees. 
Eligible employees should contact their personnel office for information 
and assistance.

                      R. Information and Assistance

    Information and informal assistance concerning civilian employment 
and reemployment is available through the National Committee for 
Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (NCESGR). NCESGR 
representatives can be contacted by calling 1-800-336-4590.

                    S. Assistance in Asserting Claims

    1. A person may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor if an 
employer, including any Federal Executive Agency or OPM, has failed or 
refused, or is about to fail or refuse, to comply with employment or 
reemployment rights and benefits. The complaint must be in writing, and 
include the name and address of the employer, and a summary of the 
allegation(s).
    2. The Secretary of Labor shall investigate each complaint and, if 
it is determined that the allegation(s) occurred, make reasonable 
efforts to ensure compliance. If these efforts are unsuccessful, the 
Secretary of Labor shall notify the complainant of the results and 
advise the complainant of his or her entitlement to pursue enforcement.
    3. The Secretary of Labor shall, upon request, provide technical 
assistance to a claimant and, when appropriate, to the claimant's 
employer.

                             T. Enforcement

    1. State or Private Employers.
    a. A person may request that the Secretary of Labor refer a 
complaint to the Department of Justice. If the Department of Justice is 
reasonably satisfied that the person is entitled to the rights or 
benefits sought, the

[[Page 553]]

Department of Justice may appear on behalf of, and act as attorney for, 
the complainant, and commence an action for appropriate relief, or the 
individual may commence an action on his or her own behalf in the 
appropriate Federal district court.
    b. The district court hearing the complaint can require the employer 
to:
    (1) Comply with the law;
    (2) Compensate the person for any loss of wages or benefits 
suffered; and
    (3) If the court determines that the employer willfully failed to 
comply with the law, pay the person an amount equal to the amount of 
lost wages or benefits as liquidated damages.
    c. A person may file a private suit against an employer without the 
Secretary of Labor's assistance if he or she:
    (1) Has chosen not to seek the Secretary's assistance;
    (2) Has chosen not to request that the Secretary refer the complaint 
to the Department of Justice; or
    (3) Has refused the Department of Justice's representation of his or 
her complaint.
    d. No fees or court costs shall be charged or taxed against any 
person filing a claim. The court may award the person who prevails 
reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation 
expenses.
    2. Federal Government as the Employer.
    a. The same general enforcement procedures established for private 
employers are applied to Federal Executive Agencies as an employer; 
however, if unable to resolve the complaint, the Secretary of Labor 
shall refer the complaint to the Office of Special Counsel, which shall 
represent the individual in a hearing before the Merit Systems 
Protection Board if reasonably satisfied that the individual is entitled 
to the rights and benefits sought. The claimant also has the option of 
directly filing a complaint with the Merit Systems Protection Board on 
his or her own behalf.
    b. A person who is adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order 
or decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board may petition the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to review the 
final order or decision.
    3. Federal Intelligence Agency as the Employer. An individual 
employed by a Federal Intelligence Agency listed in subparagraph I.1. of 
this appendix, may submit a claim to the inspector general of the 
agency.

   Appendix B to Part 104--Sample Employer Notification of Uniformed

107.1 Purpose.
107.2 Applicability and scope.
107.3 Definitions.

Enclosure 1 to Part 107--Table of Authorized Compensation Rates

    Authority: 10 U.S.C. 1091; Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 
part 37.

    Source: 50 FR 11693, Mar. 25, 1985, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 107.1  Purpose.

    This part establishes policy under 10 U.S.C. 1091, ``Contracts For 
Direct Health Care Providers,'' and assigns responsibility for 
implementing the authority for personal services contracts for direct 
health care providers.


<R05>
Sec. 107.2  Applicability and scope.

    (a) This part applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense 
(OSD) and the Military Departments.
    (b) It applies only to personal services contracts awarded under 10 
U.S.C. 1091 for direct health care providers.


<R05>
Sec. 107.3  Definitions.

    (a) Personal Services Contract. A contract that, by its express 
terms or as administered, makes the contractor personnel appear, in 
effect, to be government employees.
    (b) Direct Health Care Providers. Health services personnel who 
participate in clinical patient care and services. This does not include 
personnel whose duties are primarily administrative or clerical, nor 
personnel who provide maintenance or security services.


<R05>
Sec. 107.4  Policy.

    (a) It is the policy of the Department of Defense that when in-house 
sources are insufficient to support the medical mission of the Military 
Departments, personal services contracts under 10 U.S.C. 1091 may be 
executed.
    (b) It is the purpose of personal services contracts to facilitate 
mission accomplishment, maximize beneficiary access to military MTFs, 
maintain readiness capability, reduce use of the Civilian Health and 
Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), and enhance quality 
of care by promoting the continuity of the patient/provider 
relationship.
    (c) Personal services contractors shall be subject to the same 
quality assurance, credentialing processes, and other standards as those 
required of military health care providers. In addition, providers, 
other than para-professionals, must be licensed in accordance with State 
or host country requirements to perform the contract services.
    (d) In establishing lines of authority and accountability, DoD 
supervisors may direct the activities of personal services contractors 
on the same basis as DoD employees. However, the rights, benefits, and 
compensation of personal services contractors shall be determined solely 
in accordance with the personal service contract.
    (e) Requests for personal services contracts contemplating 
reimbursement at the maximum rate of basic pay and allowances under 10 
U.S.C. 1091 shall be approved at the major command level. The 0-6 grade 
shall be used sparingly and subsequently will be subject to review.


<R05>
Sec. 107.5  Procedures.

    (a) Each contract under 10 U.S.C. 1091 with an individual or with an 
entity, such as a professional corporation or partnership, for the 
personal services of an individual must contain language specifically 
acknowledging the individual as a personal services contractor whose 
performance is subject to supervision and direction by designated 
officials of the Department of Defense.
    (b) The appearance of an employer-employee relationship created by 
the DoD supervision of a personal services contractor will normally 
support a limited recognition of the contractor as equal in status to a 
DoD employee in disposing of personal injury claims arising out of the 
contractor's performance. Personal injury claims alleging negligence by 
the contractor within the scope of his or her contract performance, 
therefore, will be processed as claims alleging negligence by DoD 
military or civil service personnel.

[[Page 556]]

    (c) Compensation for personal services contractors under 10 U.S.C. 
1091 shall be within the limits established in the Table of Authorized 
Compensation Rates (see enclosure 1). Prorated compensation based upon 
hourly, daily, or weekly rates may be awarded when a contractor's 
services are not required on a full-time basis. In all cases, however, a 
contractor may be compensated only for periods of time actually devoted 
to the delivery of services required by the contract.
    (d) Contracts for personal services entered into shall be awarded 
and administered pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR), part 37 and DoD and departmental supplementary 
contracting provisions.


<R05>
Sec. 107.6  Responsibilities.

    (a) The Military Departments shall be responsible for the management 
of the direct health care provider contracting program, ensuring that 
effective means of obtaining adequate quality care is achieved in 
compliance with the FAR, part 37. The portion of the Military Department 
regulations ensuring that compensation provided for a particular type of 
service is based on objective criteria and is not susceptible to 
individual favoritism shall be stressed.
    (b) The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health 
Affairs) (OASD(HA)) shall be responsible for monitoring the personal 
services contracting program.

    (a) Classification of institutions hosting Senior ROTC Units. 
Educational institutions hosting senior ROTC units maintained by the 
Military Departments shall be classified as essentially military or 
civilian colleges or universities.
    (1) The classification MC shall be assigned to units established in:
    (i) Essentially military colleges or universities that, for purposes 
of qualifying as an MC under 50 U.S.C. App. 456(a)(1):
    (A) Confer baccalaureate or graduate degrees.
    (B) Require a course in military training throughout the 
undergraduate course for all qualified undergraduate students.
    (C) Organize their military students as a corps of cadets under 
constantly maintained military discipline.
    (D) Require all members of the corps, including those nonmembers 
enrolled in the ROTC, to be habitually in uniform when on campus.

students' character by means of military training and the regulation of 
their conduct in accordance with the principles of military discipline.
    (F) In general, meet military standards similar to those maintained 
at the Military Service academies.
    (ii) The designation ``all qualified undergraduate students,'' under 
paragraph (a)(i)(B) of this section means all physically fit students 
except:
    (A) Female students who waive their right to participate as provided 
by Pub. L. 95-485, section 809.
    (B) Foreign nationals.
    (C) Students who are not liable for induction by virtue of having

    (D) Students who are pursuing special undergraduate courses beyond 4 
years after completing the required military training.
    (E) Certain categories of students who are excused specifically by 
administrative decision and approved by the ROTC unit commander.
    (2) The classification CC shall be assigned when units are

on an essentially military basis, but that confer baccalaureate or 
graduate degrees.
    (3) The classification MJC shall be assigned when ROTC units are 
established at essentially military schools

[[Page 558]]

that provide junior college or junior college and high school 
instruction, but DO NOT confer baccalaureate degrees. Those units shall 
meet all other requirements of an MC. (See Pub. L. 88-647).
    (b) Qualifying for the special rate of commutation. (1) To qualify 
for payment at the special rate of commutation instead of uniforms, an 
institution classified MC or CC shall meet in addition to paragraphs (a) 
(1), or (2), respectively the requirements below. An institution 
classified an MJC shall meet, in addition to paragraph (a)(1) (except 
paragraphs (a)(1)(i) (A) and (B)), the requirements below:
    (i) Organize and maintain within their undergradute student bodies a 
self-contained corps of cadets.
    (ii) Require all members of the corps of cadets to be in appropriate 
uniform at all times while on the campus.
    (iii) House all members of the corps of cadets in barracks separate 
from nonmembers.
    (iv) Require all members of the corps of cadets to be under 
constantly maintained military discipline on a 24-hours-per-day, 7-days-
per-week basis.
    (v) Require all physically qualified members of the above corps of 
cadets to be enrolled in the basic course of ROTC, except:
    (A) Female students who waive their right to participate as provided 
by Pub. L. 95-485.
    (B) Foreign nationals.
    (C) Students who are not liable for induction by virtue of having 
completed honorably active training and service.
    (D) Certain categories of students are excused specifically by 
administrative decisions.
    (E) Other students whose enrollment is prevented by provisions or 
appropriate regulations of a Military Department.
    (2) MCs, CCs, or MJCs may be paid the special rate of commutation 
only for those members of the corps of cadets meeting the requirements 
set forth in paragraph (b)(1), who are enrolled in ROTC. The 
requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) (iii) and (iv), may be waived for 
married students, graduate students, and day students who are not housed 
with the corps of cadets. Day students are those ROTC cadets who are 
authorized by university officials to reside off campus within a 
reasonable commuting distance to the university.
    (3) Institutions designated as MCs may enroll into the ROTC, of the 
appropriate Military Service, those students who, for various reasons, 
are not required to be members of the corps of cadets. These 
institutions shall receive, for such student only, the standard 
commutation rate. The special rate shall be authorized for eligible 
females who elect to participate as enrolled senior ROTC cadets, 
provided that the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) (ii), (iii), and 
(iv) are met or unless these requirements are waived under the 
provisions of paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(E).
    (c) Subsistence allowance and commutation rates--(1) Subsistence 
allowances. Payment that is made by the Military Departments instead of 
rations to each contract cadet enrolled in the advanced course and for 
each scholarship cadet enrolled in the basic or advanced course.

Payments are as prescribed in the DoD Military Pay and Allowances 
Entitlements Manual, part 8, chapter 4. The following rates are 
established for payment of subsistence allowance:
    (i) Except when on summer fiel training or practice cruises, when 
subsistence in kind is furnished, or when otherwise on active duty, the 
subsistence allowance for each enrolled member of the advanced training 
program in the senior ROTC shall be $100 per month for not more than a 
total of 20 months.
    (ii) Except when on summer field training or practice cruises, when 
subsistence in kind is furnished, the subsistence allowance for each 
cadet or midshipman appointed under the financial assistance program for 
specially selected members, under the provisions of Pub. L. 88-647, 
shall be $100 per month for not more than a total of 20 months during 
the basic course training program and $100 per month for not more than a 
total of 20 months during the advanced course training program unless 
the individual has been authorized extended entitlements under the 
provisions of Pub. L. 98-94. The $100 per month subsistence may be 
authorized for not more than a total of 30 months

[[Page 559]]

during the advanced course training program when an extended financial 
assistance entitlement is approved by the Military Service Secretary of 
the Military Department concerned.
    (2) Commutation instead of uniforms. Commutation is payment made by 
the Military Departments to an institution instead of the issue of 
uniforms to ROTC cadets in accordance with Pub. L. 88-647. Certain MCs, 
CCs, and MJCs that maintain senior ROTC units may elect to receive 
commutation instead of Government clothing. In such instances, the 
commutation rate shall include not only the uniform, but the 
procurement, receipt, storage, maintenance, and issue of the uniform as 
outlined in paragraph (c)(2)(xi), and shown in Appendix B.
    (i) The Military Departments shall develop the commutation rates and 
establish procedures for their review on an annual basis. The review 
shall be scheduled during May so that the current unit price list 
disseminated by the DLA during the previous December of each year can be 
used to develop the commutation rates and made available to institutions 
for use at the beginning of the fall term. The commutation payment shall 
be made to the institutions based on the number of students enrolled and 
in attendance for at least 60 consecutive days.
    (ii) Commutation rates for uniforms shall be based on the latest 
approved items of clothing for each climatic zone and computed using the 
formulas listed in Appendix B. Appendices C, D, and E are examples of 
the application of the various formulas to determine the amounts that 
can be paid to qualifying institutions.
    (iii) Standard commutation rates for the basic course (first 2 
years) of the senior ROTC shall be payable in the indicated amount on an 
annual basis not to exceed 2 years to CCs that offer Military Science 
(MS) I and II or equivalent. The rates shall be paid after cadets have 
been enrolled 60 days.
    (iv) Standard rates for the advanced course cover the 2-year period 
that each member is enrolled in advanced course training in the senior 
ROTC (Appendix D). These rates shall be paid after cadets have been 
enrolled for 60 days in the advanced course. Commutation funds for camp 
uniforms, if paid, shall be in addition to payments for the advanced 
course.
    (v) Special rates of commutation shall be paid for students enrolled 
at MCs, CCs, or MJCs fulfilling the requirements of paragraph (b).
    (vi) Special rates of commutation shall be identical for all the 
Military Services for those qualifying institutions defined in paragraph 
(b). These rates shall be three times the highest standard rate 
submitted by sex and course from the Military Departments for climatic 
zones 1 or 2. Each Military Department shall submit special rate 
estimates for zones 1 and 2 to the Assistant Secretary of Defense 
(ASD(FM&P), or designee, not later than July 1. The special rates shall 
be announced by the ASD(FM&P), or designee, not later than August 1 of 
each year.
    (vii) Special rates of commutation for students enrolled in the 
basic course (MS I and II or equivalent) of MCs, CCs, and MJCs shall be 
paid on an annual basis not to exceed 2 years. Special rates for 
students enrolled in the advanced course (MS III and IV or equivalent) 
of MCs, CCs, or MJCs shall be paid for the 2-year period that each 
member is enrolled in the advanced course.
    (viii) Commutation for the basic course and the advanced course 
shall be paid based on Appendices C and D, respectively.
    (ix) One-half of the special commutation rate shall be paid to the 
institution for those students enrolled in the second year of the 
advanced course for whom the institution previously has not received 
commutation.
    (x) The standard rates shown in Appendix E for summer field training 
are not subject to the special commutation rate adjustment.
    (xi) Commutation of uniform funds may be expended to support ONLY 
the following activities:
    (A) Procurement, receipt, storage, and issue expenses not to exceed 
10 percent of the cost for standard uniform items in quantities as 
prescribed by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned, or 
distinctive uniforms and insignia as prescribed by those institutions 
that meet the requirements of

[[Page 560]]

paragraph (b). Marking up or raising the price of that paid by an 
institution when items are purchased from military inventories is not 
authorized.
    (B) Alteration and maintenance of the uniform, which is defined as 
laundry, dry cleaning, renovation, alterations and sizing, not to exceed 
$10 per uniform.
    (C) Salary payments to the property custodian for custody of 
uniforms purchased with commutation funds. Such custodial fees shall not 
exceed the specified percent of the commutation funds received against 
the actual enrollments in each course listed below for the immediate 
past academic year:
    (1) 15 percent of basic course.
    (2) 5 percent of advance course.
    (3) 5 percent of field training (when applicable).
    (D) Purchase of hazard insurance to protect uniform inventory 
against loss.
    (xii) Unexpended commutation of uniform funds is the balance 
remaining after all commitments or obligations relating to the immediate 
past academic year and the amount of retained uniform commutation funds 
(see paragraph (c)(2)(xii)(A)) have been deducted. The unexpended 
balance shall be computed as of July 1 each year. Commitments or 
obligations relating to new year procurement, maintenance, or other 
allowable activities may not be charged against the unexpended balance. 
As an exception, the unexpended balance may be used for paying bills for 
procurements of past academic years that are submitted AFTER the cutoff 
date of the report required by paragraph (c)(2)(xii)(C).
    (A) The amount of unexpended uniform commutation funds an 
institution may retain from 1 academic year to the next for continued 
financing of the uniform program is the greater of $3500 or 20 percent 
of the uniform entitlement for the immediate past academic year.
    (B) Accumulated funds that exceed this limitation shall be returned 
to the Military Services.
    (C) As of July 1 of each year, a uniform commutation report DD Form 
2340, ``Annual Report on Uniform Commutation Fund'' shall be completed 
by the institution receiving commutation funds and submitted to the 
appropriate authority for each Military Service by July 31.
    (1) The uniform commutation report shall include a detailed list of 
expenditures, total funds available for the immediate past academic 
year, including the unexpended balance from the last report, an 
explanation of any monetary adjustments and errors, the balance of funds 
on hand, and the amount being refunded to the appropriate Military 
Service as the unexpended balance, if any. The report shall be 
coordinated with ROTC unit commanders and signed by the appropriate 
institutional official who maintains records of the receipt of funds.
    (2) All records on the receipt and expenditure of commutation funds 
shall be subject to periodic audit and inspection. Institution officials 
shall be responsive to recommendations made.
    (d) Inspection. Inspections shall be conducted when an ROTC unit is 
initially established at an institution that does not already host 
another Military Service ROTC unit. Inspections shall ensure that only 
those institutions that meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) or 
(3), are awarded the MC or MJC classification and only those awarded MC, 
CC, and MJC classifications that meet the additional requirements of 
paragraph (b) shall be authorized the special rate of commutation 
instead of uniforms. Inspections of established units at MCs, CCs, and 
MJCs shall be conducted on an exception basis.
    (1) The Secretaries of Military Departments shall prescribe specific 
inspection procedures applicable to ROTC units of their respective 
Military Services.
    (2) When discrepancies are noted at institutions, their 
classifications shall be subject to review for resolution or withdrawal 
by the Secretaries of the Military Department concerned. In the instance 
of withdrawal of classification, the appropriate Military Service's 
review of, and final notification to, the institution shall be within 30 
days of the date the discrepancy was noted.

    The climate zones listed above are to be used as a guide to 
determine clothing requirements for a specific detachment. Wind chill 
equivalent temperatures can vary widely for areas within close proximity 
to each other due to variations in wind velocity and elevation. 
Detachment commanders may request a zone change by submitting evidence 
to the Major Command of the appropriate Military Service that the wind 
chill equivalent temperature for the coldest month has been within the 
limits of the requested zone classification for the past 3 consecutive 
years.

 Attachment to Appendix A to Part 110--Climatic Zones Used to Determine 
                Rates of Commutation Allowance (Formula)

    The Standard and special commutation rates are based on the latest 
approved items of clothing for each climatic zone. The zones are:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Zone                          Temperature range
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1........................................  32 degrees Fahrenheit and
                                            above.
2........................................  Below 32 degrees Fahrenheit.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To determine the appropriate zone for each ROTC detachment, use the 
table below. Enter the appropriate dry bulb temperature at the top and 
read down. Find the wind velocity on the left and read across. The 
intersection of the two lines provides the equivalent temperature. For 
example, a combination of 20 degrees Fahrenheit and a 10 mile-per-hour 
wind has a wind chill equivalent temperature of 3 degrees Fahrenheit. 
The wind chill equivalent temperature is based on the average monthly 
temperature and wind of the coldest month for each of the past 3 
consecutive years.

the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, and the Coast 
Guard.
    (b) The provisions of this part do not apply to:
    (1) Indebtedness of a member of the Military Services to the Federal 
Government.
    (2) Processing of indebtedness claims to enforce judgments against 
military members for alimony or child support.

<R05>
Sec. 112.3  Definitions.

    (a) Absence. A member's lack of an ``appearance,'' at any stage of 
the judicial process, as evidenced by failing to physically attend court 
proceedings; failing to be represented at court proceedings by counsel 
of the member's choosing; or failing to timely respond to pleadings, 
orders, or motions.
    (b) Court. A court of competent jurisdiction within any State, 
territory, or possession of the United States.
    (c) Debt collector. An agency or agent engaged in the collection of 
debts described under 15 U.S.C. 1601 note and 1692-1692o (``Fair Debt 
Collection Practices Act'').
    (d) Exigencies of military duty. A military assignment or missing-
essential duty that, because of its urgency, importance, duration 
location, or isolation, necessitates the absence of a member of the 
Military Services from appearance at a judicial proceeding or prevents 
the member from being able to respond to a notice of application for an 
involuntary allotment. Exigency of military duty is normally presumed 
during periods of war, national emergency, or when the member is 
deployed.
    (e) Judgment. A final judgment must be a valid, enforceable order or 
decree, by a court from which no appeal may be taken, or from which no 
appeal has been taken within the time allowed, or from which an appeal 
has been taken and finally decided. The judgment must award a sum 
certain amount and specify that the amount is to be paid by an 
individual who, at the time of application for the involuntary 
allotment, is a member of the Military Services.
    (f) Just financial obligations. A legal debt acknowledged by the 
military member in which there is no reasonable dispute as to the facts 
or the law; or one reduced to judgment that conforms to the Soldiers' 
and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, as amended (50 U.S.C. appendix 
sections 501-591).
    (g) Member of the military services. Any member of the Regular Army, 
Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard, and any member of a 
Reserve component of the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps or Coast 
Guard (including the Army National Guard of the United States and the 
Air National Guard of the United States) on active duty pursuant to 10 
U.S.C. 672, for a period in excess of 180 days at the time an 
application for involuntary allotment is received by the Director, DFAS, 
or Commanding Officer, Coast Guard Pay and Personnel Center. The 
following shall not be considered members:
    (1) Retired personnel, including those placed on the temporary or 
permanent disabled retired list; and
    (2) Personnel in a prisoner of war or missing in action status, as 
determined by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned.


<R05>
Sec. 112.4  Policy.

    (a) Members of the Military Services are expected to pay their just 
financial obligations in a proper and timely manner. A Service member's 
failure to pay a just financial obligation may result in disciplinary 
action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (10 U.S.C. 801-940) or 
a claim pursuant to Article 139 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice 
(10 U.S.C. 939). Except as

[[Page 564]]

stated in this section, and in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this 
section, the Department of Defense Components have no legal authority to 
require members to pay a private debt or to divert any part of their pay 
for satisfaction of a private debt.
    (1) Legal process instituted in civil courts to enforce judgments 
against military personnel for the payment of alimony or child support 
shall be acted on in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 651-665, and Part 7, 
Chapter 7, Section B. of Department of Defense 7000.14-R \1\, Volume 7, 
Part A.

    \1\ Copies may be obtained, at cost, from the National Technical 
Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Involuntary allotments under 5 U.S.C. 5520a(k) shall be 
established in accordance with this part.
    (b) Whenever possible, indebtedness disputes should be resolved 
through amicable means. Claimants may contact military members by having 
correspondence forwarded through the military locator services for an 
appropriate fee, as provided under DoD Instruction 7230.7.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 112.4(a)(1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) The following general policies apply to processing of debt 
complaints (not involuntary allotments):
    (1) Debt complaints meeting the requirements of this part, and 
procedures established by the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and 
Readiness), as required by 32 CFR part 113, shall receive prompt 
processing assistance from commanders.
    (2) Assistance in indebtedness matters shall not be extended to 
those creditors:
    (i) Who have not made a bona fide effort to collect the debt 
directly from the military member;
    (ii) Whose claims are patently false and misleading; or
    (iii) Whose claims are obviously exorbitant;
    (3) Some States have enacted laws that prohibit creditors from 
contacting a debtor's employer about indebtedness or communicating facts 
on indebtedness to an employer unless certain conditions are met. The 
conditions that must be met to remove this prohibition are generally 
such things as reduction of a debt to judgment or obtaining written 
permission of the debtor.
    (i) At Department of Defense installations in States having such 
laws, the processing of debt complaints shall not be extended to those 
creditors who are in violation of the State law. Commanders may advise 
creditors that this rule has been established because it is the general 
policy of the Military Services to comply with State law when that law 
does not infringe upon significant military interests.
    (ii) The rule in Sec. 112.4(c)(3)(i) shall govern even though a 
creditor is not licensed to do business in the State where the debtor is 
located. A similar practice shall be started in any State enacting a 
similar law regarding debt collection.
    (4) Under 15 U.S.C. 1601 note and 1692-1692o (``Fair Debt Collection 
Practices Act''), contact by a debt collector with third parties, such 
as commanding officers, for aiding debt collection is prohibited without 
a court order, or the debtor's prior consent given directly to the debt 
collector. Creditors are generally exempt from this requirement, but 
only when they collect on this own behalf.
    (d) The following general policies apply to processing of 
involuntary allotments under 5 U.S.C. 5520a(k).
    (1) In those cases in which the indebtedness of a military member 
has been reduced to a judgment, an application for an involuntary 
allotment from the pay of the member may be made under procedures 
prescribed by the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness). 
Such procedures shall provide the exclusive remedy available under 5 
U.S.C. 5520a(k).
    (2) An involuntary allotment from a member's pay shall not be 
started in any indebtedness case in which:
    (i) Exigencies of military duty caused the absence of the member 
from the judicial proceeding at which the judgment was rendered; or
    (ii) There has not been compliance with the procedural requirements 
of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, 50 U.S.C. 
appendix sections 501-591.

[[Page 565]]


<R05>

involuntary allotment against the pay of a member of the Military 
Services.
    (iii) Acts as the Department of Defense Executive Agent for 
Department of Defense forms necessary to process involuntary allotments.

involuntary allotments from the pay of members of the Military Services. 
This includes designating those commanders, or other officials who may 
act in the absence of the commander, who shall be responsible for 
determining whether a member's absence from a judicial proceeding was 
caused by exigencies of military duty, and establishing appeal 
procedures regarding such determinations.
    (2) Require commanders to counsel members to pay their just debts, 
including complying, as appropriate, with court orders and judgments for 
the payment of alimony or child support.
    (3) Emphasize prompt command action to assist with the processing of 
involuntary allotment applications.
    (e) The Chief, Office of Personnel and Training, for the Coast Guard 
shall:
    (1) Establish, as necessary, procedures supplemental to those 
promulgated by the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness) 
to administer and process involuntary allotments from the pay of members 
of the Military Services; this includes the authority to promulgate 
forms necessary for the efficient administration and processing of 
involuntary allotments.
    (2) Ensure that the Commanding Officer, Coast Guard Pay and 
Personnel Center:
    (i) Implements procedures established by the Under Secretary of 
Defense (Personnel and Readiness) and Chief, Office of Personnel and 
Training.
    (ii) Considers whether the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act 
of 1940, as amended (50 U.S.C. appendix sections 501-591), has been 
complied with under 5 U.S.C. 5520a(k) prior to establishing an 
involuntary allotment against the pay of a member of the Military 
Services.
    (iii) Acts as the Coast Guard Executive Agent for forms necessary to 
process involuntary allotments.

    (e) Proper and Timely Manner. A manner that under the circumstances 
does not reflect discredit on the Military Service.


<R05>
Sec. 113.4  Policy.

    (a) It is DoD policy under 32 CFR part 112 that procedures be 
established for the processing of debt complaints against members of the 
Military Services and involuntary allotments from the pay of members of 
the Military Services.
    (b) An involuntary allotment shall not exceed the lesser of 25 
percent of a member's pay subject to involuntary allotment or the 
maximum percentage of pay subject to garnishment proceedings under the 
applicable State law.
    (c) The amount of an involuntary allotment under 32 CFR part 112 and 
this part when combined with deductions as a result of garnishments or 
statutory allotments for spousal support and child support under 42 
U.S.C. 659, 661, 662, or 665, may not exceed the lesser of 25 percent of 
a member's pay subject to involuntary allotment or the maximum 
percentage of pay subject to garnishment proceedings under applicable 
State law. In any case in which the maximum percentage would be 
exceeded, garnishments and involuntary allotments for spousal and child 
support shall take precedence over involuntary allotments authorized 
under 32 CFR part 112 and this part. Involuntary allotments established 
under 32 CFR part 112 and this part shall be reduced or stopped as 
necessary to avoid exceeding the maximum percentage allowed.
    (d) The Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 note, 1601-1614, 1631-
1646, 1661-1666j, and 1667-1667e) prescribes the general disclosure 
requirements that must be met by those offering or extending consumer 
credit and Federal Reserve Board Regulation Z (12 CFR 226) prescribes 
the specific disclosure requirements for both open-end and installment 
credit transactions. In place of Federal Government requirements, State 
regulations apply to credit transactions when the Federal Reserve Board 
has determined that the State regulations impose substantially similar 
requirements and provide adequate enforcement measures. Commanding 
officers, with the assistance of judge advocates, should check 
regulations of the Federal Reserve Board to determine whether Federal or 
State laws and regulations govern.


<R05>
Sec. 113.5  Responsibilities.

    (a) The Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness shall 
monitor compliance with this part.
    (b) The Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) shall ensure 
Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) implementation of this 
part.
    (c) The Heads of the DoD Components shall ensure compliance with 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 113.6  Procedures.

    (a) The following procedures apply to the processing of debt 
complaints against members of the Military Services.
    (1) It is incumbent on those submitting indebtedness complaints to 
show that they have met the disclosure requirements of the Truth in 
Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 note, 1601-1614, 1631-1646, 1661-1666j, and 
1667-1667e) and Federal Reserve Board Regulation Z (12 CFR 226), and 
that they complied with the Standards of Fairness (appendix B to this 
part).
    (2) Creditors subject to Federal Reserve Board Regulation Z (12 CFR 
226), and assignees claiming thereunder, shall submit with their debt 
complaint an executed copy of the Certificate of Compliance (appendix A 
to this part), and a true copy of the general and specific disclosures 
provided the member

[[Page 568]]

of the Military Service as required by the Truth in Lending Act (15 
U.S.C. 1601 note, 1601-1614, 1631-1646, 1661-1666j, and 1667-1667e). 
Debt complaints that request assistance but do not meet these 
requirements will be returned without action to the claimant.
    (3) A creditor not subject to Federal Reserve Board Regulation Z (12 
CFR 226), such as a public utility company, shall submit with the 
request a certificate that no interest, finance charge, or other fee is 
in excess of that permitted by the law of the State in which the 
obligation was incurred.
    (4) A foreign-owned company having debt complaints shall submit with 
its request a true copy of the terms of the debt (English translation) 
and shall certify that it has subscribed to the Standards of Fairness 
(appendix B to this part).
    (5) Debt complaints that meet the requirements of this part shall be 
processed by Department of Defense Components. ``Processed'' means that 
Heads of the Department of Defense Components, or designees, shall:
    (i) Review all available facts surrounding the transaction forming 
the basis of the complaint, including the member's legal rights and 
obligations, and any defenses or counterclaims the member may have.
    (ii) Advise the member concerned that:
    (A) Just financial obligations are expected to be paid in a proper 
and timely manner, and what the member should do to comply with that 
policy;
    (B) Financial and legal counseling services are available under DoD 
Directive 1344.7 \3\ in resolving indebtedness; and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 113.3(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (C) That a failure to pay a just debt may result in the creditor 
obtaining a judgment from a court that could form the basis for 
collection of pay from the member pursuant to an involuntary allotment.
    (iii) If a member acknowledges a debt as a result of creditor 
contact with a DoD Component, advise the member that assistance and 
counseling may be available from the on-base military banking office, 
the credit union serving the military field of membership, or other 
available military community service organizations.
    (iv) Direct the appropriate commander to advise the claimant that:
    (A) Those aspects of DoD policy prescribed in 32 CFR part 112.4, are 
pertinent to the particular claim in question; and
    (B) The member concerned has been advised of his or her obligations 
on the claim.
    (v) The commander's response to the claimant shall not undertake to 
arbitrate any disputed debt, or admit or deny the validity of the claim. 
Under no circumstances shall the response indicate whether any action 
has been taken, or will be taken, against the member as a result of the 
complaint.
    (b) The following procedures apply to the processing of involuntary 
allotments from the pay of members of the Military Services.
    (1) Involuntary allotment application. (i) Regardless of the Service 
Affiliation of the member involved, with the exception of members of the 
Coast Guard an application to establish an involuntary allotment from 
the pay of a member of the Military Services shall be made by sending a 
completed DD Form 2653, ``Involuntary Allotment Application'' (appendix 
C to this part) to the appropriate address listed below. Applications 
sent to any other address shall be returned without action to the 
applicant.

(For Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps)

Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Cleveland Center, Code L, P.O. 
Box 998002, Cleveland, OH 44199-8002

(For Coast Guard only)

Topeka, KS 66683-3591

    (ii) Each application must include a copy of the final judgment 
certified by the clerk of court and such other documents as may be 
required by Sec. 113.6(b)(1)(iv).
    (iii) A garnishment summons or order is insufficient to satisfy the 
final judgment requirement of Sec. 113.6(b)(1)(ii) and is not required 
to apply for an involuntary allotment under this part.

[[Page 569]]

    (iv) Involuntary allotment applications must contain the following 
information, certifications, and acknowledgment:
    (A) The full name, social security number, and branch of Service of 
the military member against whose pay an involuntary allotment is 
sought. Although not required, inclusion of the member's current duty 
station and duty address on the application form will facilitate 
processing of the application.
    (B) The applicant's full name and address. If the applicant is not a 
natural person, the application must be signed by an individual with the 
authority to act on behalf of such entity. If the allotment is to be in 
favor of a person other than the original judgment holder, proof of the 
right to succeed to the interest of the original judgment holder is 
required and must be attached to the application.
    (C) The dollar amount of the judgment. Additionally, if the judgment 
awarded interest, the total dollar amount of the interest on the 
judgment accrued to the date of application.
    (D) A certification that the judgment has not been amended, 
superseded, set aside, or satisfied; or, if the judgment has been 
satisfied in part, the extent to which the judgment remains unsatisfied.
    (E) A certification that the judgment was issued while the member 
was not on active duty (in appropriate cases). If the judgment was 
issued while the member was on active duty, a certification that the 
member was present or represented by an attorney of the member's 
choosing in the proceedings, or if the member was not present or 
represented by an attorney of the member's choosing, that the judgment 
complies with the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, as 
amended (50 U.S.C. appendix sections 501-591).
    (F) A certification that the member's pay could be garnished under 
applicable State law and section 5520a(k) of the United States Code, if 
the member were a civilian employee.
    (G) A certification that, to the knowledge of the applicant, the 
debt has not been discharged in bankruptcy, nor has the member filed for 
protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws of the United 
States.
    (H) A certification that if the judgment is satisfied prior to the 
collection of the total amount through the involuntary allotment 
process, the applicant will provide prompt notice that the involuntary 
allotment must be discontinued.
    (I) A certification that if the member overpays the amount owed on 
the judgment, the applicant shall refund the amount of overpayment to 
the member within 30 days of discovery or notice of the overpayment, 
whichever, is earlier, and that if the applicant fails to repay the 
member, the applicant understands he or she may be denied the right to 
collect by involuntary allotment on other debt reduced to judgments.
    (J) Acknowledgment that as a condition of application, the applicant 
agrees that neither the United States, nor any disbursing official or 
Federal employee whose duties include processing involuntary allotment 
applications and payments, shall be liable for any payment or failure to 
make payment from moneys due or payable by the United States to any 
person pursuant to any application made in accordance herewith.
    (v) The original and three copies of the application and supporting 
documents must be submitted by the applicant to DFAS.
    (vi) A complete ``application package'' (the DD Form 2653, 
supporting documentation, and three copies of the application and 
supporting documents), is required for processing of any request to 
establish an involuntary allotment pursuant to this part and 32 CFR part 
112.
    (vii) Applications that do not conform to the requirements of this 
part shall not be processed. If an application is ineligible for 
processing, the application package shall be returned to the applicant 
with an explanation of the deficiency. In cases involving repeated false 
certifications by an applicant, the designated DFAS official may refuse 
to accept or process additional applications by that applicant for such 
period of time as the official deems appropriate to deter against such 
violations in the future.

[[Page 570]]

    (2) Processing of involuntary allotment applications. (i) Promptly 
upon receipt of DD Form 2653 (Appendix C to this part), the designated 
DFAS official shall review the ``application package'' to ensure 
compliance with the requirements of this part. If the application 
package is complete, the DFAS official shall:
    (A) Complete Section I of DD Form 2654, ``Involuntary Allotment 
Notice and Processing'' (Appendix D to this part), by inserting the 
name, social security number, rank, and branch of service of the 
military member against whom an application for involuntary allotment is 
being processed. Additionally, the DFAS official shall provide the due 
date for receipt of a response at DFAS. The due date shall be 90 days 
from the date DFAS mails the DD Form 2654 to the commander and member 
concerned as provided for in Sec. 113.6(b)(2)(i)(B).
    (B) Mail one copy of the application package to the member and two 
copies of the application package, along with DD Form 2654, to the 
commander of the military member or other official as designated by the 
Military Service concerned during times of war, national emergency, 
deployment, or other similar circumstances, who may act for the 
commander, provided the Military Service concerned has provided DFAS 
with the name or position of the official and the appropriate address 
(hereinafter, the meaning of the term ``commander'' includes such other 
official).
    (C) Within 60 days of mailing the copies of the application package 
and DD Form 2654, DFAS shall provide notice to the member and the 
member's commander that automatic processing of the involuntary 
allotment application shall occur if a response (including notice of an 
approved extension as authorized in Sec. 113.6(b)(2)(iii)(B) and (F), 
is not received by the due date specified in Section I of DD Form 2654. 
In the absence of a response, DFAS may automatically process the 
involuntary allotment application on the fifteenth calendar day after 
the date a response was due. When DFAS has received notice of an 
extension, automatice processing shall not begin until the fifteenth 
calendar day after the approved extension date.
    (D) Retain the original of the application package and DD Form 2654.
    (ii) Upon receipt of an application, the commander shall determine 
if the member identified in Section I of DD Form 2654 is assigned or 
attached to the commander's unit and available to respond to the 
involuntary allotment application. If the member is not assigned or 
attached, or not available to respond (e.g., retired, in a prisoner of 
war status, or in a missing in action status), the commander will 
promptly complete Section II of DD Form 2654 and attach appropriate 
documentation supporting the determination. The commander will then mail 
the application package and DD Form 2654 to DFAS. Section II shall also 
be used by the commander to notify DFAS of extensions beyond the due 
date for a response contained in Section I of DD Form 2654. When such 
extensions are authorized, the commander will complete Section II, make 
a copy of Sections I and II, and promptly mail the copy to DFAS.
    (iii) Within 5 days of receipt of an application package and DD Form 
2654 from the designated DFAS official, the commander shall notify the 
member of the receipt of the application, provide the member a copy of 
the entire application package, and counsel the member using and 
completing Section III of DD Form 2654 about the following:
    (A) That an application for the establishment of an involuntary 
allotment for the lesser of 25 percent of the member's pay subject to 
involuntary allotment or the maximum percentage of pay subject to 
garnishment proceedings under the applicable State law has been 
received.
    (B) That the member has 15 calendar days from the date of receipt of 
the commander's notice to complete Section IV of DD Form 2654. That for 
good cause shown, the commander may grant an extension of reasonable 
time (normally not exceeding 30 calendar days) to submit a response. 
That during times of deployment, war, national emergency, assignment 
outside the United States, hospitalization, or other similar situations 
that prevent the

[[Page 571]]

member from obtaining necessary evidence or from responding in a timely 
manner, extensions exceeding 30 calendar days may be granted. That if 
the member fails to respond within the time allowed, the commander will 
note the member's failure to respond in Section V of DD Form 2654 and 
send the form to DFAS for appropriate action.
    (C) That the member's response will either consent to the 
involuntary allotment or contest it.
    (D) That the member may contest the application for any one of the 
following reasons:
    (1) There has not been compliance with the procedural requirements 
of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, as amended (50 
U.S.C. appendix sections 501-591) during the judicial proceeding upon 
which the involuntary allotment application is sought.
    (2) ``Exigencies of military duty'' (as defined in 32 CFR part 
112.3(d)) caused the ``absence'' of the member from appearance in a 
judicial proceeding forming the basis for the judgment upon which the 
application is sought.
    (3) Information in the application is patently false or erroneous in 
material part.
    (4) The judgment has been fully satisfied, superseded, or set aside.
    (5) The judgment has been materially amended, or partially 
satisfied. When asserting this defense, the member shall include 
evidence of the amount of the judgment that has been satisfied.
    (6) There is a legal impediment to the establishment of the 
involuntary allotment (for example, the judgment debt has been 
discharged in bankruptcy, the judgment debtor has filed for protection 
from the creditors under the bankruptcy laws of the United States, the 
applicant is not the judgment holder nor a proper successor in interest 
to that holder, or the applicant has been enjoined by a Federal or state 
court from enforcing the judgment debt).
    (7) Or other appropriate reasons that must be clearly specified and 
explained by the member.
    (E) That, if the member contests the involuntary allotment, the 
member shall provide evidence (documentary or otherwise) in support 
thereof. Furthermore, that any evidence submitted by the member may be 
disclosed to the applicant for the involuntary allotment.
    (F) That the member may consult with a legal assistance attorney, if 
reasonably available, or a civilian attorney at no expense to the 
government. That if a legal assistance attorney is available, the member 
should immediately arrange for an appointment. That the member may 
request a reasonable delay from the commander to obtain legal assistance 
(in cases where an approved delay will cause DFAS to receive the 
member's response after the due date identified in Section I of DD Form 
2654, the commander must immediately notify the designated DFAS official 
of the delay, the date for an expected response, and the reason for the 
delay by completing Section II of DD Form 2654 and forwarding a copy of 
Sections I and II to DFAS). Additionally, that requests for extensions 
of time based on the need for legal assistance shall be denied to 
members who fail to exercise due diligence in seeking such assistance.
    (G) That if the member contests the involuntary allotment on the 
grounds that exigencies of military duty caused the absence of the 
member from the judicial proceeding at which the judgment was rendered, 
then the member's commander shall review and make the final 
determination on this contention, and notify the designated DFAS 
official of the commander's decision by completing Section V of DD Form 
2654 and forwarding the form to DFAS.
    (1) In determining whether exigencies of military duty caused the 
absence of the member, the commander at the level designated by the 
Service concerned shall consider the definition of ``exigencies of 
military duty'' (as defined in 32 CFR part 112.3(d)).
    (2) Additionally, consideration shall be given to whether the 
commander at the time determined the military duties in question to be 
of such paramount importance that they prevented making the member 
available to attend the judicial proceedings, or rendered the member 
unable to timely respond to process, motions, pleadings, or orders of 
the court.
    (H) That if the member contests the involuntary allotment on any 
basis other than exigencies of military duty,

[[Page 572]]

the application package and DD Form 2654 shall be returned to the 
commander who shall forward it to the designated DFAS official for 
appropriate action.
    (I) That if the member fails to respond to the commander within the 
time allowed under Sec. 113.6(b)(2)(iii)(B), the commander shall notify 
the designated DFAS official of the member's failure to respond by 
completing Section V of DD Form 2654, and forwarding the form to DFAS.
    (iv) After counseling the member in accordance with Sec. 
113.6(b)(2)(iii)(A)-(I), the commander shall:
    (A) Date and sign Section III of DD Form 2654.
    (B) Obtain the member's acknowledgment of counseling by having the 
member sign the appropriate space on Section III of DD Form 2654.
    (C) Determine if the member consents to the involuntary allotment or 
needs the time authorized under this part to review the application 
package and take appropriate action. If the member consents to the 
involuntary allotment, the commander shall direct the member to 
appropriately complete Section IV of DD Form 2654. The commander must 
then complete the appropriate item in Section V and promptly forward the 
completed DD Form 2654 to the designated DFAS official.
    (D) Complete the appropriate items in Section V of DD Form 2654 when 
the member fails to respond within the time authorized for a response, 
or asserts that exigencies of military duty caused the absence of the 
member from an appearance in the judicial proceeding upon which the 
Involuntary Allotment Application is sought.
    (1) In determining whether exigencies of military duty caused the 
absence of the member, the commander, at the level designated by the 
Service concerned, shall consider the definition of ``exigencies of 
military duty'' (as defined in 32 CFR part 112.3(d)), the evidence 
provided by the member, any other reasonably available evidence (e.g., a 
copy of the member's personnel record), and whether the commander at the 
time determined the military duties in question to be of such paramount 
importance that they prevented making the member available to attend the 
judicial proceedings, or rendered the member unable to timely respond to 
process, motions, pleadings, or orders of the court.
    (2) The evidentiary standard for a commander to determine whether 
existences of military duty caused the absence of the member from an 
appearance in the judicial proceeding upon which the Involuntary 
Allotment Application is sought is a ``preponderance of the evidence'' 
(as defined in Sec. 113.3(d) of this part).
    (3) If the commander has made a determination on exigencies of 
military duty, the commander must insert in Section V of DD Form 2654, 
the title and address of the appeal authority.
    (E) Promptly following the date the member's response is due to the 
commander as determined by Sec. 113.6(b)(2)(iii)(B), ensure that the DD 
Form 2654 is appropriately completed and mail the form, along with any 
response received from the member, to DFAS.
    (F) Provide the member a copy of the completed DD Form 2654 within 5 
days of mailing to the designated DFAS official.
    (v) Upon receipt of DD Form 2654 and any additional evidence 
submitted by the member, the designated DFAS official shall conduct a 
review of the entire application package, DD Form 2654, and any evidence 
submitted by the member, to determine whether the application for an 
involuntary allotment should be approved and established.
    (A) In those cases where the member's commander has completed 
Section V of DD Form 2654, and determined that exigencies of military 
duty caused the absence of the member from an appearance in a judicial 
proceeding upon which the involuntary allotment application is sought, 
the designated DFAS official shall deny the involuntary allotment 
application and provide the applicant written notice of the denial and 
the reason therefor. The designated DFAS official shall also advise the 
applicant that:
    (1) The responsibility for determining whether exigencies of 
military duty existed belonged to the member's commander and the 
Military Department concerned.

[[Page 573]]

    (2) The commander's decision may be appealed within 60 days of the 
date DFAS mailed the notice of the decision to the applicant.
    (3) An Appeal must be submitted to the appeal authority at the 
address provided by DFAS (as found in Section V of the DD Form 2654) in 
their written notice of denial, and that an appeal submitted to an 
appeal authority and address different from the one provided by DFAS may 
be returned without action.
    (4) An appeal must be submitted in writing and contain sufficient 
evidence to overcome the presumption that the commander's exigency 
determination was correct.
    (5) The appellate authority shall decide an appeal within 30 days of 
its receipt and promptly notify the applicant in writing of the 
decision. The 30 day decision period may be extended during times of 
deployment, war, national emergency, or other similar situations.
    (6) If an appeal is successful, the applicant must submit a written 
request, along with a copy of the appellate authority's decision, to 
DFAS within 15 days of receipt of the appellate authority's decision.
    (B) Upon receiving written notice that an applicant has successfully 
appealed a commander's determination on exigencies of military duty that 
resulted in denial of an involuntary allotment application, DFAS shall 
review the application in accordance with Sec. 113.6(b)(2)(v)(C), and 
determine whether the involuntary allotment should be approved and 
initiated.
    (C) In all cases, other than as described in Sec. 
113.6(b)(2)(v)(A), the designated DFAS official shall deny an 
involuntary allotment application, and give written notice to the 
applicant of the reason(s) for denial, if the designated DFAS official 
determines that:
    (1) There has not been compliance with the procedural requirements 
of the Soldier's and Sailor's Civil Relief Act of 1940, as amended (50 
U.S.C. appendix sections 501-591) during the judicial proceeding upon 
which the involuntary allotment application is sought.
    (2) Information in the application is patently false or erroneous in 
material part.
    (3) The judgment has been fully satisfied, superseded, or set aside.
    (4) The judgment has been materially amended, or partially 
satisfied. In such a case, the request for involuntary allotment may be 
approved only to satisfy that portion of the judgment that remains in 
effect and unsatisfied; the remainder of the request shall be denied.
    (5) There is a legal impediment to the establishment of the 
involuntary allotment (for example, the judgment debt has been 
discharged in bankruptcy, the judgment debtor has filed for protection 
from the creditors under the bankruptcy laws of the United States, the 
applicant is not the judgment creditor nor a proper successor in 
interest to that creditor, or the applicant has been enjoined by a 
Federal or State court from enforcing the judgment debt).
    (6) The member's pay is already subject to one or more involuntary 
allotments or garnishments that equal the lesser of 25 percent of the 
member's pay subject to involuntary allotment or the maximum percentage 
of pay subject to garnishment proceedings under the applicable State 
law.
    (7) The applicant has abused the processing privilege (e.g., an 
applicant, having been notified of the requirements of this part, 
repeatedly refuses or fails to comply therewith).
    (8) Or other appropriate reasons that must be clearly explained to 
the applicant.
    (D) In all cases other than as described in Sec. 113.6(b)(2)(v) (A) 
and (C), the designated DFAS official shall approve the involuntary 
allotment application and establish an involuntary allotment against the 
pay subject to involuntary allotment of the member.
    (vi) The designated DFAS official shall, at any time after 
establishing an involuntary allotment, cancel or suspend such allotment 
and notify the applicant of that cancellation if the member concerned, 
or someone acting on his or her behalf, submits legally sufficient 
proof, by affidavit or otherwise, that the allotment should not continue 
because of the existence of the factors enumerated in Sec. 
113.6(b)(2)(v)(A) and (C)(1)-(8).
    (3) Payments

[[Page 574]]

    (i) Payment of an approved involuntary allotment under 32 CFR part 
112 and this part shall commence within 30 days after the designated 
DFAS official has approved the involuntary allotment.
    (ii) Payments under this part shall not be required more frequently 
than once each month, and the designated official shall not be required 
to vary normal pay and disbursement cycles.
    (iii) If the designated DFAS official receives several applications 
on the same member of a Military Service, payments shall be satisfied on 
a first-come, first-served basis.
    (iv) Payments shall continue until the judgment is satisfied or 
until canceled or suspended.
    (A) DFAS shall collect the total judgment, including interest when 
awarded by the judgment. Within 30 days following collection of the 
amount of the judgment, including interest as annotated by the applicant 
in Section I of DD Form 2654, the applicant may submit a final statement 
of interest that accrued during the pay-off period. This final statement 
of interest request must be accompanied by a statement of account 
showing how the applicant computed the interest amount. DFAS will 
collect this post-application interest provided it is an amount owed 
pursuant to the judgment. DFAS shall not accept any further interest 
requests.
    (B) Interest or other costs associated with the debt forming the 
basis for the judgment, but not included as an amount awarded by the 
judgment, shall not be paid to applicants for involuntary allotments.
    (v) If the member is found not to be entitled to money due from or 
payable by the Military Services, the designated official shall return 
the application and advise the applicant that no money is due from or 
payable by the Military Service to the member. When it appears that pay 
subject to an involuntary allotment is exhausted temporarily or 
otherwise unavailable, the applicant shall be told why and for how long 
that money is unavailable, if known. Involuntary allotments shall be 
canceled on or before the date a member retires, is discharged, or is 
released from active duty. The designated DFAS official shall notify the 
applicant of the reason for cancellation.
    (vi) Upon receiving notice from an applicant that a judgment upon 
which an involuntary allotment is based has been satisfied, vacated, 
modified, or set aside, the designated DFAS official shall promptly 
adjust or discontinue the involuntary allotment.
    (vii) The Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) may, in DoD 
7000.14-R \4\ Volume 7, Part A, designate the priority to be given to 
involuntary allotments pursuant to 32 CFR part 112 and this part, among 
the deductions and collections taken from a member's pay, except that 
they may not give precedence over deductions required to arrive at a 
member's disposable pay for garnishments or involuntary allotments 
authorized by statute for alimony and child support payments. In the 
absence of a contrary designation by the Comptroller, all other lawful 
deductions (except voluntary allotments by the member) and collections 
shall take precedence over these involuntary allotments.

              Appendix B to Part 113--Standards of Fairness

    1. No finance charge contracted for, made, or received under any 
contract shall be in excess of the charge that could be made for such 
contract under the law of the place in which the contract is signed in 
the United States by the military member.
    a. In the event a contract is signed with a U.S. company in a 
foreign country, the lowest interest rate of the State or States in 
which the company is chartered or does business shall apply.
    b. However, interest rates and service charges applicable to 
overseas military banking facilities shall be as established by the 
Department of Defense.
    2. No contract or loan agreement shall provide for an attorney's fee 
in the event of default unless suit is filed, in which event the fee 
provided in the contract shall not exceed 20 percent of the obligation 
found due. No attorney fees shall be authorized if the attorney is a 
salaried employee of the holder.
    3. In loan transactions, defenses that the debtor may have against 
the original lender or its agent shall be good against any subsequent 
holder of the obligation. In credit transactions, defenses against the 
seller or its agent shall be good against any subsequent holder of the 
obligation, provided that the holder had actual knowledge of the defense 
or under conditions where reasonable inquiry would have apprised the 
holder of this fact.
    4. The military member shall have the right to remove any security 
for the obligation beyond State or national boundaries if the military 
member or family moves beyond such boundaries under military orders and 
notifies the creditor, in advance of the removal, of the new address 
where the security will be located. Removal of the security shall not 
accelerate payment of the obligation.
    5. No late charge shall be made in excess of 5 percent of the late 
payment, or $5.00, whichever is the lesser amount, or as provided by law 
or applicable regulatory agency determination. Only one late charge may 
be made for any tardy installment. Late charges shall not be levied 
where an allotment has been timely filed, but payment of the allotment 
has been delayed. Late charges by overseas banking facilities are a 
matter of contract with the Department of Defense.
    6. The obligation may be paid in full at any time or through 
accelerated payments of any amount. There shall be no penalty for 
prepayment. In the event of prepayment, that portion of the finance 
charges that has inured to the benefit of the seller or creditor shall 
be prorated on the basis of the charges that would have been ratably 
payable had finance charges been calculated and payable as equal 
periodic payments over the terms of the contract, and only the prorated 
amount to the date of prepayment shall be due. As an alternative, the 
``Rule of 78'' may be applied.
    7. If a charge is made for loan insurance protection, it must be 
evidenced by delivery of a policy or certificate of insurance to the 
military member within 30 days.
    8. If the loan or contract agreement provides for payments in 
installation, each payment, other than the down payment, shall be in 
equal or substantially equal amounts, and installments shall be 
successive and of equal or substantially equal duration.
    9. If the security for the debt is repossessed and sold in order to 
satisfy or reduce the debt, the repossession and resale shall be 
governed by the laws of the State in which the security is requested.
    10. A contract for personal goods and services may be terminated at 
any time before delivery of the goods or services without charge to the 
purchaser. However, if goods made to the special order of the purchaser 
result in preproduction costs, or require preparation for delivery, such 
additional costs shall be listed in the order form or contract.
    a. No termination charge shall be made in excess of this amount. 
Contracts for delivery at future intervals may be terminated as to the 
undelivered portion.
    b. The purchaser shall be chargeable only for that proportion of the 
total cost that the goods or services delivered bear to the total goods 
called for by the contract. (This is in addition to the right to rescind 
certain credit transactions involving a security interest in real estate 
provided by the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 note, 1601-1614, 
1631-1646, 1661-1665a, 1666-1666j, and 1667-1667e) and Federal Reserve 
Board Regulation Z (12 CFR 226)).

Sec. 143.2  Applicability and scope.

    (a) The provisions of this part apply to:
    (1) Department of Defense Components, which include the Office of 
the Secretary of Defense, the Military Departments, the Organization of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Unified and Specified Commands, and the 
Defense Agencies;
    (2) All military and civilian personnel of the Department of 
Defense; and
    (3) Individuals and groups entering, using, or seeking to enter or 
use military installations.
    (b) This part does not limit the application of the Uniform Code of 
Military Justice title 10 U.S.C., sections 801-940 or 10 U.S.C. 976 
including the prohibitions and criminal penalties set forth therein with 
respect to matters that are the subject of this part or that are beyond 
its scope.


<R05>
Sec. 143.3  Policy.

    It is the policy of the United States under Public Law 95-610 that:

    1. Members of the armed forces of the United States must be prepared 
to fight and, if necessary, to die to protect the welfare, security, and 
liberty of the United States and of their fellow citizens.
    2. Discipline and prompt obedience to lawful orders of superior 
officers are essential and time-honored elements of the American 
military tradition and have been reinforced from the earliest articles 
of war by laws and regulations prohibiting conduct detrimental to the 
military chain of command and lawful military authority.
    3. The processes of conventional collective bargaining and labor-
management negotiation cannot and should not be applied to the 
relationships between members of the armed forces and their military and 
civilian superiors.
    4. Strikes, slowdowns, picketing, and other traditional forms of job 
action have no place in the armed forces.
    5. Unionization of the armed forces would be incompatible with the 
military chain of command, would undermine the role, authority, and 
position of the commander, and would impair the morale and readiness of 
the armed forces.
    6. The circumstances which could constitute a threat to the ability 
of the armed forces to perform their mission are not comparable to the 
circumstances which could constitute a threat to the ability of Federal 
civilian agencies to perform their functions and should be viewed in 
light of the need for effective performance of duty by each member of 
the armed forces.


<R05>
Sec. 143.4  Prohibited activity.

    (a) Membership and enrollment. (1) A member of the armed forces, 
knowing of the activities or objectives of a particular military labor

member of such organization.

    (b) Negotiation or bargaining. (1) No person on a military 
installation, and no member of the armed forces, may negotiate or

forces, on behalf of members of the armed forces, concerning the terms 
or conditions of service of such members.
    (2) No member of the armed forces, and no civilian officer or 
employee, may negotiate or bargain on behalf of the United States

armed forces with any person who represents or purports to represent 
members of the armed forces.
    (c) Strikes and other concerted activity. (1) No person on a 
military installation, and no member of the armed forces, may organize 
or attempt to organize, or participate in, any strike, picketing, march, 
demonstration, or other similar form of concerted action involving 
members of the armed forces that is directed against the Government of 
the United States and that is intended to induce any civilian officer or 
employee, or any member of the armed forces, to:

[[Page 584]]

    (i) Negotiate or bargain with any person concerning the terms or 
conditions of service of any member of the armed forces,
    (ii) Recognize any military labor organization as a representative

employee, may permit or authorize the use of any military installation 
for any meeting, march, picketing demonstration, or other similar 
activity which is for the purpose of engaging in any activity prohibited 
by this Directive.
    (d) Representation. A military labor organization may not represent, 
or attempt to represent, any member of the armed forces before any 
civilian officer or employee, or any member of the armed forces, in 
connection with any grievance or complaint of any such member arising 
out of the terms or conditions of service of such member in the armed 
forces.


<R05>
Sec. 143.5  Activity not covered by this part.

    (a) This part does not limit the right of any member of the armed 
forces to:
    (1) Join or maintain membership in any lawful organization or 
association not constituting a ``military labor organization'' as

in question may be evaluated, along with evidence on the conduct 
constituting a prohibited act.
    (b) In determining whether the commission of a prohibited act by a 
person can be imputed to the organization, examples of factors that may 
be considered include: the frequency of such act; the position in the 
organization of persons committing the act; whether the commission of 
such act was known by the leadership of the organization; whether the 
commission of the act was condemned or disavowed by the leadership of 
the organization.
    (c) Any information about persons and organizations not affiliated

<R05>
Sec. 144.1  Purpose.

    This part implements 10 U.S.C. 982 to establish uniform Department 
of Defense policies for jury service by members of the Armed Forces on 
active duty.


<R05>
Sec. 144.2  Applicability.

    The provisions of this part apply to active-duty members of the 
Armed Forces.


<R05>
Sec. 144.3  Definitions.

    (a) Armed Forces. The Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and the 
Coast Guard when it is operating as a Service in the Navy.
    (b) State. Includes the fifty United States, U.S. Territories, 
District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
    (c) Active duty. Full-time duty in the active military service of 
the United States. Includes full-time training duty, annual training 
duty, active duty for training, and attendance, while in the active 
military service, at a school designated as a Service school by law or 
by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned.
    (d) Operating forces. Those forces whose primary mission is to 
participate in combat and the integral supporting elements thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 144.4  Policy.

    It is DoD policy to permit members of the Armed Forces maximally to 
fulfill their civic responsibilities consistent with their military 
duties. For service members stationed in the United States, serving on a 
State or local jury is one such civic obligation. Service members are 
exempt from jury duty, when it unreasonably would interfere with 
performance of their military duties or adversely affect the readiness 
of a unit, command, or activity.


<R05>
Sec. 144.5  Responsibilities.

    The Secretaries of the Military Departments, or designees, in 
accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, shall 
determine whether Service members shall be exempt from jury duty. This 
authority may be delegated no lower than to commanders authorized to 
convene special courts-martial.


<R05>
Sec. 144.6  Procedures.

    The Secretaries of the Military Departments shall publish procedures 
that provide the following:
    (a) When a Service member on active duty is summoned to perform 
State or local jury duty, the Secretary concerned, or the official to 
whom such authority has been delegated, shall decide if such jury duty 
would:
    (1) Interfere unreasonably with the performance of the service 
member's military duties.
    (2) Affect adversely the readiness of the unit, command, or activity 
to which the member is assigned.
    (b) If such jury service would interfere with the service member's 
military duties or adversely affect readiness, the service member shall 
be exempted from jury duty. The decision of the Secretary concerned, or 
the official to whom such authority has been delegated, shall be 
conclusive.
    (c) All general and flag officers, commanders and commanding 
officers, officers-in-charge, and all personnel assigned to the 
operating forces, in a training status, or stationed outside the United 
States are exempt from serving on a State or local jury. Such jury 
service necessarily would interfere with the performance of military 
duties by these members and adversely affect the readiness of the unit, 
command, or activity to which they are assigned.
    (d) Service members who serve on State or local juries shall not be 
charged leave or lose any pay or entitlements during the period of 
service. All fees accrued to the member for jury service are payable to 
the United States Treasury. Members are entitled to any reimbursement 
from the State or local jury authority for expenses incurred in the 
performance of jury duty, such as for transportation costs or parking 
fees.
    (e) Written notice of each exemption determination shall be provided 
to the responsible State or local official who summoned an exempt member 
for jury duty.

Component when required.
    (4) Copies of each allegation referred under paragraph (a)(2) shall 
be forwarded by the General Counsel concerned to the IG, DoD.
    (b) OSC Investigations of Prohibited Personnel Practices. (1) The 
head of each DoD Component shall designate a Senior Management Official 
to:
    (i) Serve as a point of contact in providing assistance to the OSC 
in conducting investigations of alleged prohibited activities before any 
designation of an attorney of record for the Component or individual 
respondent for matters in litigation.
    (ii) Monitor those investigations.
    (iii) Ensure that appropriate Component personnel are fully apprised 
of the nature and basis for an OSC investigation, as well as the rights 
and duties of Component personnel in regard to such investigations.
    (iv) Ensure that any corrective or disciplinary action considered 
appropriate because of facts disclosed by such an investigation is 
accomplished under paragraph (b)(2), in a timely manner.
    (2) The designated Senior Management Official shall have authority 
to:
    (i) Refer to responsible officials recommendations by the OSC for 
corrective action.
    (ii) Seek OSC approval of proposed disciplinary action against an 
employee for an alleged prohibited personnel practice or illegal or 
improper act under investigation by the OSC when it is determined that 
such discipline is warranted.
    (iii) Ensure that disciplinary action against an employee adjudged 
at fault following completion of an OSC investigation has been 
considered to avoid the need for a proceeding before the MSPB.
    (iv) Ensure that information concerning members of the Armed Forces

[[Page 591]]

who are found by the Component to have committed a prohibited personnel 
practice or other violation of this Directive in the exercise of 
authority over civilian personnel is referred to appropriate military 
authority.
    (3) The Senior Management Official shall:
    (i) Establish a system under which an employee is identified to 
serve as the Liaison Officer for any OSC investigator who may initiate 
an investigation at a facility, base, or installation for which the 
employee is assigned liaison duties. It shall be the responsibility of 
the Liaison Officer to:
    (A) Assist the OSC investigator.
    (B) Ensure that all OSC requests for documents are in writing.
    (C) Process such requests, as well as all requests for interviews.
    (ii) Determine, to the extent practicable, whether an investigation 
is being, or has been, conducted that replicates in whole or in part the 
proposed or incomplete investigation by the OSC, and convey that 
information to the OSC whenever this might avoid redundant investigative 
effort.
    (iii) Inform the General Counsel of the Component concerned of any 
OSC investigation and consult with the General Counsel on any legal 
issue related to an OSC investigation.
    (iv) Ensure that Component personnel involved are given timely legal 
and policy advice, through arrangements effected by the Liaison Officer, 
on the nature and basis for an OSC investigation, the authority of the 
OSC, and the rights and duties of Component personnel, including those 
set forth in Appendix.
    (v) Inform the IG, DoD, of any OSC investigation of an alleged 
prohibited personnel practice that is identified as having resulted from 
a whistleblower complaint or involves an allegation of otherwise illegal 
or improper conduct.

               Appendix to Part 145--Legal Representation

    1. An employee or member of the Armed Forces asked to provide 
information (testimonial or documentary) to the OSC in the course of an 
investigation by that office may obtain legal advice from DoD attorneys, 
both civilian and military, on that employee's or members's rights and 
obligations. This includes assistance at any interviews with OSC 
investigators. However, the attorney-client relationship shall not be 
established unless the employee is suspected or accused by the OSC of 
committing a prohibited personnel practice or other illegal or improper 
act and has been assigned DoD counsel.
    2. An employee who believes that he or she is suspected or has been 
accused by the OSC of committing a prohibited personnel practice or 
other illegal or improper act may obtain legal representation from the 
Department of Defense under the conditions prescribed in Sec. 145(b)(1) 
of this part, except as provided in section 7, below. The attorney 
assigned shall be a military member or employee from another Component 
whenever an attorney from the same Component is likely to face a 
conflict between his or her ethical obligation to the employee client 
and to the Component employer, and in any case where the suspected or 
accused employee has requested representation from another Component. 
Outside legal counsel may be retained by the Component on behalf of the 
employee only under unusual circumstances and only with the personal 
approval of the General Counsel of the Department of Defense.
    3. The General Counsel responsible for authorizing representation 
shall determine whether a conflict is liable to occur if an attorney 
from the same Component is assigned to represent the employee and, in 
that case or in a case in which the suspected or accused employee has 
requested representation from another Component, shall seek the 
assistance of another General Counsel in obtaining representation from 
outside the Component. The General Counsels of the Military Departments 
and the DLA shall ensure the availability of appropriately trained 
counsel for assignment to such cases.
    4. To obtain legal representation the employee:
    a. Must request legal representation, in writing, together with all 
process and pleadings served, and explain the circumstances that justify 
DoD legal assistance.
    b. Indicate whether he or she has retained legal counsel from 
outside the Department of Defense.
    c. Obtain a written certification from his or her supervisor that 
the employee was acting within the scope of his of her official duties, 
and that no adverse or disciplinary personnel action against the 
employee for the conduct being investigated by the OSC has been 
initiated by the Component.
    5. Employee requests for legal representation must be approved by 
the General Counsel, DoD, for employees of OSD or a Defense Agency 
(other than the DLA), or by the General Counsel of a Military Department 
or the General Counsel of the DLA for employees of those Components.
    6. The conditions of legal representation must be explained to the 
accused employee

[[Page 592]]

in writing and accepted in writing by that employee.
    7. DoD resources may not be used to provide legal representation for 
an employee with respect to a DoD disciplinary action against the 
employee for committing or participating in a prohibited personnel 
practice or for engaging in illegal or improper conduct, regardless of 
whether that participation or conduct is also the basis for disciplinary 
action proposed by the OSC.
    8. After approval of an employee's request, under section 4, above, 
a DoD attorney shall be assigned (or, in unusual circumstances, outside 
counsel retained) as the employee's representative in matters pending 
before the OSC or MSPB. This approval may be limited to representing the 
employee only with respect to some of the pending matters if other 
specific matters of concern to the OSC or MSPB do not satisfy the 
requirements of his Directive.
    9. An attorney-client relationship shall be established and 
continued between the suspected or accused employee and assigned DoD 
counsel.
    10. In representing a DoD employee under this part, a DoD attorney 
designated counsel for the employee shall act as a vigorous advocate of 
the employee's individual legal interests before the OSC or MSPB; the 
attorney's professional responsibility to the Department of Defense and 
his or her employing Component will be satisfied by fulfilling this 
responsibility to the employee. Legal representation may be terminated 
only with the approval of the General Counsel who authorized 
representation, and normally only on the basis of information not 
available at the time the attorney was assigned.
    11. The attorney-client relationship may be terminated if the 
assigned DoD counsel for the employee determines, with the approval of 
the General Counsel who authorizes representation, that:
    a. The employee was acting outside the scope of his or her official 
duties when engaging in the conduct that is the basis for the OSC 
investigation or charge.
    b. Termination of the professional representation is not in 
violation of the rules of professional conduct applicable to the 
assigned counsel.
    12. The DoD attorney designated counsel may request relief from the 
duties of representation or counseling without being required to furnish 
explanatory information that might compromise the assurance to the 
client of confidentiality.
    13. This part authorizes cognizant DoD officials to approve a 
represented employee's request for travel, per diem, witness 
appearances, or other departmental support necessary to ensure effective 
legal representation of the employee by the designated counsel.
    14. An employee's participation in OSC investigations, MSPB 
hearings, and other related proceedings shall be considered official 
departmental business for time and attendance requirements and similar 
purposes.
    15. The following advice to employees questioned during the course 
of an OSC investigation may be appropriate in response to the most 
frequent inquiries:
    a. An employee may decline to provide a ``yes'' or ``no'' answer in 
favor of a more qualified answer when this is necessary to ensure 
accuracy in responding to an OSC interviewer's questions.
    b. Requests for clarification of both questions and answers are 
appropriate to avoid misinterpretation.
    c. Means to ensure verification of an interview by OSC investigators 
are appropriate, whether the employee is or is not accompanied by a 
legal representative. Tape recorders may only be used for this purpose 
when:
    (1) The recorder is used in full view.
    (2) All attendees are informed.
    (3) The OSC interrogator agrees to the tape recording of the 
proceeding.
    d. Any errors that appear in a written summary of an interview 
prepared by the interviewer should be corrected before the employee 
signs the statement. The employee is not required to sign any written 
summary that is not completely accurate. An employee may make a copy of 
the summary for his or her own use as a condition of signing.

<R05>
Sec. 146.6  Procedures.

    (a) On receipt of a request for assistance from a court, or a 
Federal, State, or local official concerning a court order described in 
Sec. 146.4(a), the Head of the DoD Component concerned, or designee, 
shall determine whether the request is based on an order issued by a 
court of competent jurisdiction. Attempts shall be made to resolve the 
matter to the satisfaction of the court without the return of, or other 
action affecting, the member, employee, or family member (subject). 
Before action is taken under this section, the subject shall be afforded 
the opportunity to provide evidence of legal efforts to resist the court 
order, or otherwise show legitimate cause for noncompliance. If the Head 
of the DoD Component concerned determines that such efforts warrant a 
delay in taking action under this section, the DoD Component Head may 
grant a brief delay (not more than 90 days). All delays promptly shall 
be reported to the ASD(FM&P) and to the GC, DoD.
    (1) If the request pertains to a felony or to contempt involving the 
unlawful or contemptuous removal of a child from the jurisdiction of a 
court or the custody of a parent or another person awarded custody by 
court order, and the matter cannot be resolved with the court without 
the return of the subject to the United States, the Head of the DoD 
Component, or designee, promptly shall take the action prescribed in 
paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, unless the ASD(FM&P), or 
designee, grants an exception.
    (2) If the request does not pertain to a felony or contempt 
involving the unlawful or contemptuous removal of a child from the 
jurisdiction of the court or the custody of a parent or another person 
awarded custody by court order, and if the matter cannot be resolved 
with the court without the return of the subject to the United States, 
the Head of the DoD Component, or designee, promptly shall take the 
action prescribed in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, when 
deemed appropriate with the facts and circumstances of each particular 
case, following consultation with legal staff.
    (b) If a DoD member is the subject of the request, the member shall 
be ordered, under 10 U.S.C. 814, to return expeditiously to an 
appropriate port of entry at Government expense, contingent on the party 
requesting return of the member providing for transportation, and 
escort, if desired, of the member from such port of entry to the 
jurisdiction of the party. The party requesting return of the member 
shall be notified at least 10 days before the member's return to the 
selected port of entry, absent unusual circumstances.
    (c) If a DoD employee is the subject of the request concerning the 
court order, the employee strongly shall be encouraged to comply with 
the court order. Failure to respond to the court order may be a basis 
for withdrawal of command sponsorship and may be the basis for adverse 
action against the DoD employee, to include removal from the Federal 
Service. Proposals to take such adverse action must be approved by the 
Head of the DoD Component concerned, or designee. Such proposals shall 
be coordinated with the cognizant civilian personnel office and legal 
counsel.
    (d) If the family member of a DoD member or employee is the subject 
of a request concerning the court order, the family member strongly 
shall be encouraged to comply with the court order. Failure to respond 
to the court order may be a basis for withdrawing the command 
sponsorship of the family member.

<R04>
                         Subpart A_Adjudication


<R05>
Sec. 147.1  Introduction.

    The following adjudicative guidelines are established for all United 
States Government civilian and military personnel, consultants, 
contractors, employees of contractors, licensees, certificate holders or 
grantees and their employees and other individuals who require access to 
classified information. They apply to persons being considered for 
initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information, 
to include sensitive compartmented information and special access 
programs and are to be used by government departments and agencies in 
all final clearance determinations.


<R05>
Sec. 147.2  Adjudicative process.

    (a) The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient 
period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is eligible for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is predicated upon the individual meeting these 
personnel security guidelines. The adjudicative process is the careful 
weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept. 
Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a 
determination. In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, 
the adjudicator should consider the following actors:
    (1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;
    (2) The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation;
    (3) The frequency and recency of the conduct;
    (4) The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct;
    (5) The voluntariness of participation;
    (6) The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent 
behavioral changes;
    (7) The motivation for the conduct;
    (8) The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress;
    (9) The likelihood of continuation of recurrence.

[[Page 596]]

    (b) Each case must be judged on its own merits, and final 
determination remains the responsibility of the specific department or 
agency. Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is 
clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of 
the national security.
    (c) The ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing 
of eligibility for a security clearance is clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security must be an overall common sense 
determination based upon careful consideration of the following, each of 
which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person, as 
explained further below:
    (1) Guideline A: Allegiance to the United States.
    (2) Guideline B: Foreign influence.
    (3) Guideline C: Foreign preference.
    (4) Guideline D: Sexual behavior.
    (5) Guideline E: Personal conduct.
    (6) Guideline F: Financial considerations.
    (7) Guideline G: Alcohol consumption.
    (8) Guideline H: Drug involvement.
    (9) Guideline I: Emotional, mental, and personality disorders.
    (10) Guideline J: Criminal conduct.
    (11) Guideline K: Security violations.
    (12) Guideline L: Outside activities.
    (13) Guideline M: Misuse of Information Technology Systems.
    (d) Although adverse information concerning a single criterion may 
not be sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may 
be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring 
pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or emotionally 
unstable behavior. Notwithstanding, the whole person concept, pursuit of 
further investigations may be terminated by an appropriate adjudicative 
agency in the face of reliable, significant, disqualifying, adverse 
information.
    (e) When information of security concern becomes known about an 
individual who is currently eligible for access to classified 
information, the adjudicator should consider whether the person:
    (1) Voluntarily reported the information;
    (2) Was truthful and complete in responding to questions;
    (3) Sought assistance and followed professional guidance, where 
appropriate;
    (4) Resolved or appears likely to favorably resolve the security 
concern;
    (5) Has demonstrated positive changes in behavior and employment;
    (6) Should have his or her access temporarily suspended pending 
final adjudication of the information.
    (f) If after evaluating information of security concern, the 
adjudicator decides that the information is not serious enough to 
warrant a recommendation of disapproval or revocation of the security 
clearance, it may be appropriate to recommend approval with a warning 
that future incidents of a similar nature may result in revocation of 
access.


<R05>
Sec. 147.3  Guideline A--Allegiance to the United States.

    (a) The concern. An individual must be of unquestioned allegiance to 
the United States. The willingness to safeguard classified information 
is in doubt if there is any reason to suspect an individual's allegiance 
to the Untied States.
    (b) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying include: (1) Involvement in any act of sabotage, 
espionage, treason, terrorism, sedition, or other act whose aim is to 
overthrow the Government of the United States or alter the form of 
government by unconstitutional means;
    (2) Association or sympathy with persons who are attempting to 
commit, or who are committing, any of the above acts;
    (3) Association or sympathy with persons or organizations that 
advocate the overthrow of the United States Government, or any state or 
subdivision, by force or violence or by other unconstitutional means;
    (4) Involvement in activities which unlawfully advocate or practice 
the commission of acts of force or violence to prevent others from 
exercising their rights under the Constitution or laws of the United 
States or of any state.
    (c) Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: (1) 
The individual

[[Page 597]]

was unaware of the unlawful aims of the individual or organization and 
severed ties upon learning of these;
    (2) The individual's involvement was only with the lawful or 
humanitarian aspects of such an organization;
    (3) Involvement in the above activities occurred for only a short 
period of time and was attributable to curiosity or academic interest;
    (4) The person has had no recent involvement or association with 
such activities.


<R05>
Sec. 147.4  Guideline B--Foreign influence.

    (a) The concern. A security risk may exist when an individual's 
immediate family, including cohabitants and other persons to whom he or 
she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens 
of the Untied States or may be subject to duress. These situations could 
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the 
compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other 
countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to 
security determinations if they make an individual potentially 
vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.
    (b) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying include: (1) An immediate family member, or a person to 
whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a 
citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country;
    (2) Sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of 
their citizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence 
or duress exists;
    (3) Relatives, cohabitants, or associates who are connected with any 
foreign government;
    (4) Failing to report, where required, associations with foreign 
nationals;
    (5) Unauthorized association with a suspected or known collaborator 
or employee of a foreign intelligence service;
    (6) Conduct which may make the individual vulnerable to coercion, 
exploitation, or pressure by a foreign government;
    (7) Indications that representatives or nationals from a foreign 
country are acting to increase the vulnerability of the individual to 
possible future exploitation, coercion or pressure;
    (8) A substantial financial interest in a country, or in any foreign 
owned or operated business that could make the individual vulnerable to 
foreign influence.
    (c) Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: (1) A 
determination that the immediate family member(s) (spouse, father, 
mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) 
in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be 
exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to 
choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States;
    (2) Contacts with foreign citizens are the result of official United 
States Government business;
    (3) Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and 
infrequent;
    (4) The individual has promptly complied with existing agency 
requirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats 
from persons or organizations from a foreign country;
    (5) Foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to 
affect the individual's security responsibilities.


<R05>
Sec. 147.5  Guideline C--Foreign preference.

    (a) The concern. When an individual acts in such a way as to 
indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then

    (3) Activity is sanctioned by the United States;
    (4) Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual 
citizenship.


<R05>
Sec. 147.6  Guidance D--Sexual behavior.

    (a) The concern. Sexual behavior is a security concern if it 
involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional 
disorder, may subject the individual to coercion, exploitation, or 
duress, or reflects lack of judgment or discretion.\1\ Sexual 
orientation or preference may not be used as a basis for or a 
disqualifying factor in determining a person's eligibility for a 
security clearance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The adjudicator should also consider guidelines pertaining to 
criminal conduct (Guideline J) and emotional, mental and personality 
disorders (Guideline I) in determining how to resolve the security 
concerns raised by sexual behavior.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying include: (1) Sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether 
or not the individual has been prosecuted;

unable to stop a pattern or self-destructive or high-risk behavior or 
that which is symptomatic of a personally disorder;
    (3) Sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to 
coercion, exploitation, or duress;
    (4) Sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that which reflects

    (4) The behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, 
exploitation, or duress.


<R05>
Sec. 147.7  Guideline E--Personal conduct.

    (a) The concern. Conduct involving questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that 
the person may not properly safeguard classified information. The 
following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or 
administrative termination of further processing for clearance 
eligibility:
    (1) Refusal to undergo or cooperate with required security 
processing, including medical and psychological testing;
    (2) Refusal to complete required security forms, releases, or 
provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of 
investigators, security officials or other representatives in connection 
with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination.
    (b) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying also include: (1) Reliable, unfavorable information 
provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other 
acquaintances;

    (3) Deliberately providing false or misleading information 
concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, security 
official, competent

[[Page 599]]

medical authority, or other representative in connection with a 
personnel security or trustworthiness determination;
    (4) Personal conduct or concealment of information that may increase 
an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duties, such 
as engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's 
personal, professional, or community standing or render the person 
susceptible to blackmail;
    (5) A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation 
of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the 
agency;
    (6) Association with persons involved in criminal activity.
    (c) Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: (1) 
The information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination 
of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability;
    (2) The falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and 
the individual has subsequently provided correct information 
voluntarily;
    (3) The individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the 
falsification before being confronted with the facts;
    (4) Omission of material facts was caused or significantly 
contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel, 
and the previously omitted information was promptly and fully provided;
    (5) The individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce

ceased.


<R05>
Sec. 147.8  Guideline F--Financial considerations.

    (a) The concern. An individual who is financially overextended is at 
risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained 
affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable 
criminal acts.

disqualifying include: (1) A history of not meeting financial 
obligations;
    (2) Deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, 
employee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, 
filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial 
breaches of trust;
    (3) Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;
    (4) Unexplained affluence;
    (5) Financial problems that are linked to gambling, drug abuse, 
alcoholism, or other issues of security concern.
    (c) Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: (1) 
The behavior was not recent;
    (2) It was an isolated incident;
    (3) The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond 
the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downtrun, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation);
    (4) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;
    (5) The affluence resulted from a legal source;
    (6) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts.


<R05>
Sec. 147.9  Guideline G--Alcohol consumption.

    (a) The concern. Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the 
exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control 
impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of 
classified information due to carelessness.
    (b) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying include: (1) Alcohol-related incidents away from work, 
such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse

The alcohol related incidents do not indicate a pattern;
    (2) The problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no 
indication of a recent problem;
    (3) Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety;
    (4) Following diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, the 
individual has successfully completed impatient or outpatient 
rehabilitation along with aftercare requirements, participates 
frequently in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar 
organization, has abstained from alcohol for a period of at least 12 
months, and received a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical 
professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member 
of a recognized alcohol treatment program.


<R05>
Sec. 147.10  Guideline H--Drug involvement.

    (a) The concern. (1) Improper or illegal involvement with drugs 
raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to 
protect classified information. Drug abuse or dependence may impair 
social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an 
unauthorized disclosure of classified information.
    (2) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and 
include:
    (i) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and 
listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., 
marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and 
hallucinogens),
    (ii) Inhalants and other similar substances.
    (3) Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug 
in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.
    (b) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying include: (1) Any drug abuse (see above definition);
    (2) Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, 
manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution;
    (3) Diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional (e.g., 
physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug 
dependence;
    (4) Evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed 
clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized drug 
treatment program;
    (5) Failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program 
prescribed by a credentialed medical professional. Recent drug 
involvement, especially following the granting of a security clearance, 
or an expressed intent not to discontinue use, will almost invariably 
result in an unfavorable determination.
    (c) Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: (1) 
The drug involvement was not recent;
    (2) The drug involvement was an isolated or aberration event;
    (3) A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future;
    (4) Satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, 
including rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence 
of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical 
professional.


<R05>
Sec. 147.11  Guideline I--Emotional, mental, and personality disorders.

    (a) The concern: Emotional, mental, and personality disorders can 
cause a significant deficit in an individual's psychological, social and 
occupation functioning. These disorders are of security concern because 
they may indicate a defect in judgment, reliability, or stability. A 
credentialed mental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or 
psychiatrist), employed

[[Page 601]]

by, acceptable to or approved by the government, should be utilized in 
evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information fully 
and properly, and particularly for consultation with the individual's 
mental health care provider.
    (b) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying include: (1) An opinion by a credentialed mental health 
professional that the individual has a condition or treatment that may 
indicate a defect in judgment, reliability, or stability;
    (2) Information that suggests that an individual has failed to 
follow appropriate medical advice relating to treatment of a condition, 
e.g., failure to take prescribed medication;
    (3) A pattern of high-risk, irresponsible, aggressive, anti-social 
or emotionally unstable behavior;
    (4) Information that suggests that the individual's current behavior 
indicates a defect in his or her judgment or reliability.
    (c) Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: (1) 
There is no indication of a current problem;
    (2) Recent opinion by a credentialed mental health professional that 
an individual's previous emotional, mental, or personality disorder is 
cured, under control or in remission and has a low probability of 
recurrence or exacerbation;
    (3) The past emotional instability was a temporary condition (e.g., 
one caused by a death, illness, or marital breakup), the situation has 
been resolved, and the individual is no longer emotionally unstable.


<R05>
Sec. 147.12  Guideline J--Criminal conduct.

    (a) The concern. A history or pattern of criminal activity creates 
doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.
    (b) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying include: (1) Allegations or admissions of criminal 
conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;
    (2) A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.
    (c) Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: (1) 
The criminal behavior was not recent;
    (2) The crime was an isolated incident;
    (3) The person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and

    (4) The person did not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors 
leading to the violation are not likely to recur;
    (5) Acquittal;
    (6) There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.


<R05>
Sec. 147.13  Guideline K--Security violations.

    (a) The concern. Noncompliance with security regulations raises 
doubt about an individual's trustworthiness, willingness, and ability to 
safeguard classified information.
    (b) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying include. (1) Unauthorized disclosure of classified 
information;
    (2) Violations that are deliberate or multiple or due to negligence.
    (c) Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include actions 
that: (1) Were inadvertent;
    (2) Were isolated or infrequent;

    (4) Demonstrate a positive attitude towards the discharge of 
security responsibilities.


<R05>
Sec. 147.14  Guideline L--Outside activities.

    (a) The concern. Involvement in certain types of outside employment 
or activities is of security concern if it poses a conflict with an 
individual's security responsibilities and could create an increased 
risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information.
    (b) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying include any service, whether compensated, volunteer, or 
employment with: (1) A foreign country;
    (2) Any foreign national;

[[Page 602]]

    (4) Any foreign, domestic, or international organization or person 
engaged in analysis, discussion, or publication of material on 
intelligence, defense, foreign affairs, or protected technology.

Evaluation of the outside employment or activity indicates that it does 
not pose a conflict with an individual's security responsibilities;
    (2) The individual terminates the employment or discontinues the 
activity upon being notified that it is in conflict with his or her 
security responsibilities.


<R05>
Sec. 147.15  Guideline M--Misuse of Information technology systems.

    (a) The concern. Noncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines, 
or regulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise 
security concerns about an individual's trustworthiness, willingness, 
and ability to properly protect classified systems, networks, and 
information. Information Technology Systems include all related 
equipment used for the communication, transmission, processing, 
manipulation, and storage of classified or sensitive information.
    (b) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be

information technology system without authorization, when specifically 
prohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations;
    (4) Introduction of hardware, software, or media into any 
information technology system without authorization, when specifically 
prohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations.

The misuse was not recent or significant;
    (2) The conduct was unintentional or inadvertent;
    (3) The introduction or removal of media was authorized;
    (4) The misuse was an isolated event;

                    Subpart B_Investigative Standards


<R05>
Sec. 147.18  Introduction.

    The following investigative standards are established for all United 
States Government civilian and military personnel, consultants, 
contractors, employees of contractors, licensees, certificate holders or 
grantees and their employees and other individuals who require access to 
classified information, to include Sensitive Compartmented Information 
and Special Access Programs, and are to be used by government 
departments and agencies as the investigative basis for final clearance 
determinations. However, nothing in these standards prohibits an agency 
from using any lawful investigative procedures in addition to these 
requirements in order to resolve any issue identified in the course of a 
background investigation or reinvestigation.


<R05>
Sec. 147.19  The three standards.

    There are three standards (Attachment D to this subpart part 
summarizes when to use each one):
    (a) The investigation and reinvestigation standards for ``L'' access 
authorizations and for access to confidential and secret (including all 
secret-level Special Access Programs not specifically approved for 
enhanced investigative requirements by an official authorized to 
establish Special Access Programs by section in 4.4 of Executive Order 
12958) (60 FR 19825, 3 CFR 1995 Comp., p. 33);
    (b) The investigation standard for``Q'' access authorizations and 
for access to top secret (including top secret Special Access Programs) 
and Sensitive Compartmented Information;
    (c) The reinvestigation standard for continued access to the levels 
listed in paragraph (b) of this section.

[[Page 603]]


<R05>
Sec. 147.20  Exception to periods of coverage.

    Some elements of standards specify a period of coverage (e.g. seven 
years). Where appropriate, such coverage may be shortened to the period 
from the subject's eighteenth birthday to the present or to two years, 
whichever is longer.


<R05>
Sec. 147.21  Expanding investigations.

    Investigations and reinvestigations may be expanded under the 
provisions of Executive Order 12968 (60 FR 40245, 3 CFR 1995 Comp., p. 
391) and other applicable statutes and Executive Orders.


<R05>
Sec. 147.22  Transferability.

    Investigations that satisfy the requirements of a given standard and 
are current meet the investigative requirements for all levels specified 
for the standard. They shall be mutually and reciprocally accepted by 
all agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 147.23  Breaks in service.

    If a person who requires access has been retired or separated from 
U.S. government employment for less than two years and is the subject of 
an investigation that is otherwise current, the agency regranting the 
access will, as a minimum, review an updated Standard Form 86 and 
applicable records. A reinvestigation is not required unless the review 
indicates the person may no longer satisfy the standards of Executive 
Order 12968 (60 FR 40245, 3 CFR 1995 Comp., p. 391); (Attachment D to 
this subpart, Table 2).


<R05>
Sec. 147.24  The national agency check.

    The National Agency Check is a part of all investigations and 
reinvestigations. It consists of a review of;
    (a) Investigative and criminal history files of the FBI, including a 
technical fingerprint search;
    (b) OPM's Security/Suitability Investigations Index;
    (c) DoD's Defense Clearance and Investigations Index;
    (d) Such other national agencies (e.g., CIA, INS) as appropriate to 
the individual's background.

Attachment A to Subpart B of Part 147--Standard A--National Agency Check 
            With Local Agency Checks and Credit Check (NACLC)

    (a) Applicability. Standard A applies to investigations and

19825, 3 CFR 1995 Comp., p. 333);
    (2) ``L'' access authorizations.
    (b) For Reinvestigation: When to Reinvestigate. The reinvestigation 
may be initiated at any time following completion of, but not later than 
ten years (fifteen years for CONFIDENTIAL) from the date of, the

<R04>
                Subpart C_Guidelines for Temporary Access


<R05>
Sec. 147.28  Introduction.

    The following minimum investigative standards, implementing section 
3.3 of Executive Order 12968, Access to Classified Information, are 
established for all United States Government and military personnel, 
consultants, contractors, subcontractors, employees of contractors, 
licensees, certificate holders or grantees and their employees and other 
individuals who require access to classified information before the 
appropriate investigation can be completed and a final determination 
made.


<R05>
Sec. 147.29  Temporary eligibility for access.

    Based on a justified need meeting the requirements of section 3.3 of 
Executive Order 12968, temporary eligibility for access may be granted 
before investigations are complete and favorably adjudicated, where 
official functions must be performed prior to completion of the 
investigation and adjudication process. The temporary eligibility will 
be valid until completion of the investigation and adjudication; 
however, the agency granting it may revoke it at any time based on 
unfavorable information identified in the course of the investigation.


<R05>
Sec. 147.30  Temporary eligibility for access at the confidential and 
secret levels and temporary eligibility for ``L'' access authorization.

    As a minimum, such temporary eligibility requires completion of the 
Standard Form 86, including any applicable supporting documentation, 
favorable review of the form by the appropriate adjudicating authority, 
and submission of a request for an expedited National Agency Check with 
Local Agency Checks and Credit (NACLC).


<R05>
Sec. 147.31  Temporary eligibility for access at the top secret levels 

and temporary eligibility for ``Q'' access authorization: For someone 
who is the subject 
          of a favorable investigation not meeting the investigative 
          standards for access at those levels.

    As a minimum, such temporary eligibility requires completion of the 
Standard Form 86, including any applicable supporting documentation, 
favorable review of the form by the appropriate adjudicating authority, 
and expedited submission of a request for a Single Scope Background 
Investigation (SSBI).


<R05>
Sec. 147.32   Temporary eligibility for access at the top secret and 

SCI levels and temporary eligibility for ``Q'' access authorization: 
For someone who is 
          not the subject of a current, favorable personnel or 
          personnel-security investigation of any kind.

    As a minimum, such temporary eligibility requires completion of the 
Standard Form 86, including any applicable supporting documentation, 
favorable review of the form by the appropriate adjudicating authority, 
immediate submission of a request for an expedited Single Scope 
Background Investigation (SSBI), and completion and favorable review by 
the appropriate adjudicating authority of relevant criminal history and 
investigative records of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and of 
information in the Security/Suitability Investigations Index (SII) and 
the Defense Clearance and Investigations Index (DCII).


<R05>
Sec. 147.33  Additional requirements by agencies.

    Temporary eligibility for access must satisfy these minimum 
investigative standards, but agency heads may

[[Page 607]]

establish additional requirements based on the sensitivity of the 
particular, identified categories of classified information necessary to 
perform the lawful and authorized functions that are the basis for 
granting temporary eligibility for access. However, no additional 
requirements shall exceed the common standards for background 
investigations developed under section 3.2(b) of Executive Order 12968. 
Temporary eligibility for access is valid only at the agency granting it 
and at other agencies who expressly agree to accept it and acknowledge 
understanding of its investigative basis. It is further subject to 
limitations specified in sections 2.4(d) and 3.3 of Executive Order 
12968, Access to Classified Information.

<R04>
   Subpart A_National Policy on Reciprocity of Use and Inspections of 
                               Facilities


<R05>
Sec. 148.1  Intergency reciprocal acceptance .

    Interagency reciprocal acceptance of security policies and 
procedures for approving, accrediting, and maintaining the secure 
posture of shared facilities will reduce aggregate costs, promote 
interoperability of agency security systems, preserve vitality of the 
U.S. industrial base, and advance national security objectives.


<R05>
Sec. 148.2  Classified programs.

    Once a facility is authorized, approved, certified, or accredited, 
all U.S. Government organizations desiring to conduct classified 
programs at the facility at the same security level shall accept the 
authorization, approval, certification, or accreditation without change, 
enhancements, or upgrades. Executive Order, Safeguarding Directives, 
National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), the 
NISPOM Supplement, the Director of Central Intelligence Directives, 
interagency agreements, successor documents, or other mutually agreed 
upon methods shall be the basis for such acceptance.


<R05>
Sec. 148.3  Security review.

    After initial security authorization, approval, certification, or 
accreditation, subsequent security reviews shall normally be conducted 
no more frequently than annually.
    Additionally, such reviews shall be aperiodic or random, and be 
based upon risk management principles. Security reviews may be conducted 
``for cause'', to follow up on previous findings, or to accomplish 
close-out actions. Visits may be made to a facility to conduct security 
support actions, administrative inquiries, program reviews, and 
approvals as deemed appropriate by the cognizant security authority or 
agency.


<R05>
Sec. 148.4  Policy documentation.

    Agency heads shall ensure that any policy documents their agency 
issues setting out facilities security policies and procedures 
incorporate the policy set out herein, and that such policies are 
reasonable, effective, efficient, and enable and promote interagency 
reciprocity.

[[Page 608]]


<R05>
Sec. 148.5  Idenfification of the security policy board.

    Agencies which authorize, approve, certify, or accredit facilities 
shall provide to the Security Policy Board Staff a points of contact 
list to include names and telephone numbers of personnel to be contacted 
for verification of authorized, approved, certified, or accredited 
facility status. The Security Policy Board Staff will publish a 
comprehensive directory of points of contact.


<R05>
Sec. 148.6  Agency review.

    Agencies will continue to review and assess the potential value 
added to the process of co-use of facilities by development of 
electronic data retrieval across government. As this review continues, 
agencies creating or modifying facilities databases will do so in a 
manner which facilitates community data sharing, interest of national 
defense or foreign policy.


<R04>
Subpart B_Guidelines for the Implementation and Oversight of the Policy 
           on Reciprocity of use and Inspections of Facilities


<R05>
Sec. 148.10  General.

    (a) Redundant, overlapping, and duplicative policies and practices 
that govern the co-use of facilities for classified purposes have 
resulted in excessive protection and unnecessary expenditure of funds. 
Lack of reciprocity has also impeded achievement of national security 
objectives and adversely affected economic and technological interest.
    (b) Interagency reciprocal acceptance of security policies and 
procedures for approving, accrediting, and maintaining the secure 
posture of shared facilities will reduce the aggregate costs, promote 
interoperability of agency security systems, preserve the vitality of 
the U.S. industrial base, and advance national security objectives.
    (c) Agency heads, or their designee, are encouraged to periodically 
issue written affirmations in support of the policies and procedures 
prescribed herein and in the Security Policy Board (SPB) policy, 
entitled ``Reciprocity of Use and Inspections of Facilities.''
    (d) The policies and procedures prescribed herein shall be 
applicable to all agencies. This document does not supersede the 
authority of the Secretary of Defense under Executive Order 12829 (58 FR 
3479, 3 CFR 1993 Comp., p. 570); the Secretary of Energy or the Chairman 
of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission under the Atomic Energy Act of 
1954, as amended; the Secretary of State under the Omnibus Diplomatic 
Security and Anti-Terrorism Act of 1986; the Secretaries of the military 
departments and military department installation Commanders under the 
Internal Security Act of 1950; the Director of Central Intelligence

12333; the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office under 
Executive Order 12829 or Executive Order 12958 (60 FR 19825, 3 CFR 1995 
Comp., p. 333); or substantially similar authority instruments assigned 
to any other agency head.


<R05>
Sec. 148.11  Policy.

    (a) Agency heads, or their designee, shall ensure that security 
policies and procedures for which they are responsible are reasonable, 
effective, and efficient, and that those policies and procedures enable 
and promote interagency reciprocity.
    (b) To the extent reasonable and practical, and consistent with US 
law, Presidential decree, and bilateral and international obligations of 
the United States, the security requirements, restrictions, and 
safeguards applicable to industry shall be equivalent to those 
applicable within the Executive Branch of government.
    (c) Once a facility is authorized approved, certified, or 
accredited, all government organizations desiring to conduct classified 
programs at the facility at the same security level shall accept the 
authorization, approval, certification, or accreditation without change,

include names and telephone numbers of personnel to be contacted for 
verification of the status of facilities. The SPB Staff will publish a 
comprehensive directory of agency points of contact.
    (b) After initial security authorization, approval, certification, 
or accreditation, subsequent reviews shall normally be conducted no more 
frequently than annually. Additionally, such reviews shall be aperiodic 
or random, and be based upon risk-management principles. Security 
Reviews may be conducted ``for cause'', to follow up on previous 
findings, or to accomplish close-out actions.
    (c) The procedures employed to maximize interagency reciprocity 
shall be based primarily upon existing organizational reporting

suspected departures from applicable reciprocity requirements to the 
attention of the appropriate security authority in accordance with 
established agency procedures.
    (B) Should the matter remain unresolved, the complainant (employee, 
Security Officer, Special Security Officer, or similar official) is 
encouraged to report the matter formally to the Senior Agency Official 
for resolution.
    (C) Should the Senior Agency Official response be determined 
inadequate by the complainant, the matter should be reported formally to 
the Director, Security Policy Board Staff (D/SPBS). The D/SPBS, may 
revisit the matter with the Senior Agency Official or refer the matter 
to the Security Policy Forum as deemed appropriate.
    (D) Should the matter remain unresolved, the Security Policy Forum 
may consider referral to the SPB, the agency head, or the National 
Security Council as deemed appropriate.
    (ii) Industry. (A) Contractor employees are encouraged to bring 
suspected departures from the reciprocity provisions of the NISPOM to 
the attention to their Facility Security Officer (FSO) or Contractor 
Special Security Officer (CSSO), as appropriate, for resolution.
    (B) Should the matter remain unresolved, the complainant (employee, 
FSO, or CSSO) is encouraged to report the matter formally to the 
Cognizant Security Office (CSO) for resolution.
    (C) Should the CSO responses be determined inadequate by the 
complainant, the matter should be reported formally to the Senior Agency 
Official within the Cognizant Security Agency (CSA) for resolution.
    (D) Should the Senior Agency Official response be determined 
inadequately by the complainant, the matter should be reported formally 
to the Director, information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) for 
resolution.
    (E) The Director, ISOO, may revisit the matter with the Senior 
Agency Official or refer the matter to the agency head or the National

administer an annual survey to a representative number of agency 
activities/personnel to assess the effectiveness of interagency 
reciprocity implementation. Administration of the survey shall be 
coordinated fully with each affected Senior Agency Official.
    (iii) The goal of annual surveys should not be punitive but 
educational. All agencies and departments have participated in the 
crafting of these facilities policies, therefore, non-compliance is a 
matter of internal education and direction.
    (e) Agencies will continue to review and assess the potential value 
added to the process of co-use of facilities by development of 
electronic data retrieval across government.

Sec. 150.3  Scope of review.

    In cases referred to it for review pursuant to Article 66, the Court 
may act only with respect to the findings and sentence as approved by 
the convening authority. In reviewing a case or action under Article

    (b) En banc. When sitting as a whole, a majority of the judges of 
the Court constitutes a quorum for the purpose of hearing and 
determining any matter before the Court. The determination of any matter

thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 150.5  Place for filing papers.

transmitted by mail or other means, they are not filed until received in 
such office.


<R05>
Sec. 150.6  Signing of papers.

    All formal papers shall be signed and shall show, typewritten or 
printed, the signer's name, address, military grade (if any), and the 
capacity in which the paper is signed. Such signature constitutes a 
certification that the statements made therein are true and correct to

signing the paper and that the paper is filed in good faith and not for 
purposes of unnecessary delay.


<R05>

is not to be included. The last day of the period so computed is to be 
included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, or, when 
the act to be done is the filing of a paper in court, a day on which the 
office of the Clerk of the Court is closed due to weather or other

runs until the end of the next day which is neither a Saturday, Sunday, 
nor a holiday.

Court while suspended from practice by the Judge Advocate General of the 
service concerned.


<R05>

    The conduct of counsel appearing before the Court shall be in 
accordance with rules of conduct prescribed pursuant to Rule for Courts-
Martial 109 by the Judge Advocate General of the service concerned. 
However, the Court may exercise its inherent power to regulate counsel 
appearing before it, including the power to remove counsel from a 
particular case for misconduct in relation to that case. Conduct deemed 
by the Court to warrant consideration of suspension from practice or 
other professional discipline shall be reported by the Court to the 
Judge Advocate General concerned.


<R05>
Sec. 150.10  Request for appellate defense counsel.

    An accused may be represented before the Court by appellate counsel

service of a copy of the convening authority's action under Rule for 
Courts-Martial 1107(h), forward to the convening authority or the Judge

    (a) When a record of trial is referred to the court--
    (1) If the accused has requested representation by appellate defense 
counsel, pursuant to Article 70(c)(1), counsel detailed pursuant to 
Article 70(a) will be assigned to represented the accused; or
    (2) If the accused gives notice that he or she has retained or has 
taken action to retain civilian counsel, appellate defense counsel shall 
be assigned to represent the interests of the accused pending appearance 
of civilian counsel. Assigned defense counsel will continue to assist 
after appearance by civilian counsel unless excused by the accused; or
    (3) If the accused has neither requested appellate counsel nor given 
notice of action to retain civilian counsel, but has not waived 
representation by counsel, appellate defense counsel will be assigned to 
represent the accused, subject to excusal by the accused or by direction 
of the Court.
    (b) In any case--
    (1) The Court may request counsel when counsel have not been 
assigned.

    When civilian counsel represents an accused before the Court, the

the Court will regard civilian counsel as primary counsel unless 
notified otherwise. Ordinarily, civilian counsel will use the accused's 
copy of the record. Civilian counsel may reproduce, at no expense to the 
government, appellate defense counsel's copy of the record.

[[Page 615]]


<R05>
Sec. 150.13  Notice of appearance of counsel.

    Military and civilian appellate counsel shall file a written notice

Sec. 150.14  Waiver or withdrawal of appellate review.

    Withdrawals from appellate review, and waivers of appellate review 
filed after expiration of the period prescribed by the Rule for Courts-
Martial 1110(f)(1), will be referred to the Court for consideration. At 
its discretion, the Court may require the filing of a motion for 
withdrawal, issue a show cause order, or grant the withdrawal without 
further action, as may be appropriate. The Court will return the record 
of trial, in a case withdrawn from appellate review, to the Judge 
Advocate General for action pursuant to Rule for Courts-Martial 1112.


<R05>
Sec. 150.15  Assignments of error and briefs.

    (b) Time for filing and number of briefs. Any brief for an accused 
shall be filed within 60 days after appellate counsel has been notified 
of the receipt of the record in the Office of the Judge Advocate 
General. If the Judge Advocate General has directed appellate government 
counsel to represent the United States, such counsel shall file an 
answer on behalf of the government within 30 days after any brief and 
assignment of errors has been filed on behalf of an accused. Appellate 
counsel for an accused may file a reply brief no later than 7 days after 
the filing of a response brief on behalf of the government. If no brief 
is filed on behalf of an accused, a brief on behalf of the government 
may be filed within 30 days after expiration of the time allowed for the 
filing of a brief on behalf of the accused.
    (c) Appendix. The brief of either party may include an appendix. If 
an unpublished opinion is cited in the brief, a copy shall be attached

rules, or regulations. A motion must be filed under Sec. 150.23, infra, 
to attach any other matter.


<R05>
Sec. 150.16  Oral arguments.

    Oral arguments may be heard in the discretion of the Court upon

motion of a party for oral argument shall be made no later than 7 days 
after the filing of an answer to an appellant's brief. Such motion shall 
identify the issue(s) upon which counsel seek argument. The Court may, 
on its own motion, identify the issue(s) upon which it wishes argument.


<R05>
Sec. 150.17  En banc proceedings.

    (a)(1) A party may suggest the appropriateness of consideration or 
reconsideration by the Court as a whole. Such consideration or 
reconsideration ordinarily will not be ordered except:
    (i) When consideration by the full Court is necessary to secure or 
maintain uniformity of decision, or
    (ii) When the proceedings involve a question of exceptional 
importance, or
    (iii) When a sentence being reviewed pursuant to Article 66 extends 
to death.
    (2) In cases being reviewed pursuant to Article 66, a party's 
suggestion that a matter be considered initially by the Court as a whole 
must be filed with the Court within 7 days after the government files 
its answer to the assignment of errors, or the appellant files a reply 
under Sec. 150.15(b). In other proceedings, the suggestion must be 
filed with the party's initial petition or other initial

[[Page 616]]

pleading, or within 7 days after the response thereto is filed. A 
suggestion for reconsideration by the Court as a whole must be made 
within the time prescribed by Sec. 150.19 for filing a motion for 
reconsideration. No response to a suggestion for consideration or 
reconsideration by the Court as a whole may be filed unless the Court 
shall so order.
    (b) The suggestion of a party for consideration or reconsideration 
by the Court as a whole shall be transmitted to each judge of the Court 
who is present for duty, but a vote need not be taken to determine 
whether the cause shall be considered or reconsidered by the Court as a 
whole on such a suggestion made by a party unless a judge requests a 
vote.
    (c) A majority of the judges present for duty may order that any 
appeal or other proceeding be considered or reconsidered by the Court 
sitting as a whole. However, en banc reconsideration of an en banc 
decision will not be held unless at least one member of the original 
majority concurs in a vote for reconsideration.
    (d) This rule does not affect the power of the Court sua sponte to 
consider or reconsider any case sitting as a whole.


<R05>
Sec. 150.18  Orders and decisions of the Court.

reconsideration unless ordered by the Court. The original of the motion 
filed with the Court shall indicate the date of receipt of a copy of the

States. When an accused has not been named as a party, the accused shall 
be identified by name, military grade and service number by the 
petitioner and shall be designated as the real party in interest.
    (c) Electronic petitions. The Court will docket petitions for 
extraordinary relief submitted by electronic means. A petition submitted 
by electronic means will conclude with the full name and address of 
petitioner's counsel, if any, and will state when the written petition

petition, order the respondent to show cause and file an answer within 
the time specified, or take whatever other action it deems appropriate.
    (g) Oral argument and final action. The Court may set the matter for 
oral argument. However, on the basis of the pleading alone, the Court 
may grant or deny the relief sought or make such other order in the case 
as the circumstances may require. This includes referring the matter to 
a special master, who need not be a military judge, to further 
investigate; to take evidence; and to make such recommendations as the 
Court deems appropriate.

<R05>
Sec. 151.1  Reissuance and purpose.

    This part is reissued to update established DoD policy and 
procedures on trial by foreign courts and treatment in foreign prisons 
of U.S. military personnel, nationals of the U.S. serving with, employed 
by, or accompaning the Armed Forces of the United States, and the 
dependents of both (hereafter referred to as U.S. personnel); and 
provides uniform reporting on the exercise of foreign criminal 
jurisdiction.


<R05>
Sec. 151.2  Applicability.

    The provisions of this part apply to the Office of the Secretary of 
Defense, the Military Departments, and the Unified and Specified 
Commands. As used herein, the term ``Military Services'' refers to the 
Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps.


<R05>
Sec. 151.3  Policy.

    It is the policy of the Department of Defense to protect, to the 
maximum extent possible, the rights of U.S. personnel who may be subject 
to criminal trial by foreign courts and imprisonment in foreign prisons.


<R05>
Sec. 151.4  Procedures and responsibilities.

    (a) Application of Senate resolution on status of forces. This 
directive implements the Senate Resolution accompanying the Senate's 
consent to ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty (NATO) Status of 
Forces Agreement (Sec. 151.6). Although the Senate Resolution applies 
only to countries where the NATO Status of Forces Agreement is in 
effect, the same procedures for safeguarding the interests of U.S. 
personnel subject to foreign jurisdiction shall be applied insofar as 
practicable in overseas areas where U.S. forces are regularly stationed.
    (b) Orientation of personnel. The Military Services shall issue 
uniform regulations establishing an information and education policy on 
the laws and customs of the host country for personnel assigned to 
foreign areas.
    (c) Designated commanding officer. Formal invocation of the Senate 
Resolution procedure shall be the responsibility of a single military 
commander in each foreign country where United States forces are 
stationed. Attache personnel and other military personnel serving under 
a chief of a diplomatic mission shall not be considered U.S. forces in 
this part.
    (1) In the geographical areas for which a unified command exists, 
the commander shall designate within each country the ``Commanding 
Officer'' referred to in the Senate Resolution (Sec. 151.6).

[[Page 621]]

    (2) In areas where a unified command does not exist, a commanding 
officer in each country shall be nominated by the Military Departments. 
These recommendations shall be forwarded by the Judge Advocate General 
of the Army to the Secretary of Defense, for implementation through the 
Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (International Security 
Affairs). In designating the commanding officer to act for all the 
Military Departments, consideration must be given to the availability of 
legal officers and readiness of access to the seat of the foreign 
government. Such an officer may also be appointed by the Military 
Departments for countries where no U.S. forces are regularly stationed.
    (d) Country law studies. (1) For each foreign country where U.S. 
forces are subject to the criminal jurisdiction of foreign authorities, 
the designated commanding officer for such country shall make and 
maintain a current study of the laws and legal procedures in effect. 
Studies of the laws of other countries shall be made when directed. This 
study shall be a general examination of the substantive and procedural 
criminal law of the foreign country, and shall contain a comparison 
thereof with the procedural safeguards of a fair trial in the State 
courts of the United States.
    (2) Copies of these studies shall be forwarded by the designated 
commanding officer to each of the Judge Advocates General of the 
Military Services. Principal emphasis is to be placed on those 
safeguards that are of such a fundamental nature as to be guaranteed by 
the Constitution of the United States in all criminal trials in State 
courts of the United States. See Sec. 151.7 for enumeration of 
safeguards considered important. These country law studies shall be 
subject to a continuing review. Whenever there is a significant change 
in any country's criminal law, the change shall be forwarded by the 
designated commanding officer to each of the Military Service's Judge 
Advocates General.
    (e) Waivers of local jurisdiction--military personnel. (1) In cases 
where it appears probable that release of jurisdiction over U.S. 
military personnel will not be obtained and the accused may not obtain a 
fair trial, the commander exercising general court-martial jurisdiction 
over the accused shall communicate directly with the designated 
commanding officer, report the full facts of the case, and supply a 
recommendation.
    (2) The designated commanding officer shall determine, in the light 
of legal procedures in effect in that country, whether there is danger 
that the accused will not receive a fair trial. A trial shall not be 
considered unfair merely because it is not identical with trials held in 
the United States. Due regard, however, should be given to those United 
States trial rights listed in Sec. 151.7 that are relevant to the facts 
and circumstances of the trial in question.
    (3) If the designated commanding officer determines there is risk of 
an unfair trial, the commanding officer shall decide, after consultation 
with the chief of the diplomatic mission, whether to press a request for 
waiver of jurisdiction through diplomatic channels. If the commanding 
officer so decides, the recommendation shall be submitted through the 
unified commander, if any, and The Judge Advocate General of the 
accused's service, to the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The 
objective in each case is to see that U.S. military personnel obtain a 
fair trial in the receiving state under all circumstances.
    (f) Request to foreign authorities not to exercise their criminal 
jurisdiction over civilians and dependents. The following procedures 
shall be followed when it appears that foreign authorities may assume 
criminal jurisdiction over dependents of U.S. military personnel, 
civilian personnel, and their dependents:
    (1) When the designated commanding officer determines, after a 
careful consideration of all the circumstances, that suitable corrective 
action can be taken under existing administrative regulations, the 
commanding officer may request the local foreign authorities to refrain 
from exercising their criminal jurisdiction.
    (2) When it appears possible that release of jurisdiction will not 
be obtained and that the accused may not obtain a fair trial, the 
commander exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the command 
in which such

[[Page 622]]

personnel are located shall communicate directly with the designated 
commanding officer, reporting the full facts of the case and supplying a 
recommendation.
    (3) The designated commanding officer shall then determine, in the 
light of legal procedures in effect in that country, whether there is 
danger that the accused will not receive a fair trial.
    (4) If it is determined that there is such danger, the designated 
commanding officer shall decide, after consultation with the chief of 
the diplomatic mission, whether a request should be submitted through 
diplomatic channels to foreign authorities seeking their assurances of a 
fair trial for the accused or, in appropriate circumstances, that they 
forego their right to exercise jurisdiction over the accused. If the 
designated commanding officer so decides, a recommendation shall be 
submitted through the unified commander, if any, and The Judge Advocate 
General of the Military Service concerned, to the Office of the 
Secretary of Defense.
    (g) Trial observers and trial observer report. (1) The designated 
commanding officer shall submit to the chief of the diplomatic mission a 
list of persons qualified to serve as U.S. observers at trials before 
courts of the receiving state. Nominees shall be lawyers, and shall be 
selected for maturity of judgment. The list shall include, where 
possible, representatives of all Military Services whose personnel are 
stationed in that country to enable the chief of the diplomatic mission 
to appoint an observer from the same Military Service as the accused. 
The requirement that nominees shall be lawyers may be waived in cases of 
minor offenses. Incidents that result in serious personal injury or that 
would normally result in sentences to confinement, whether or not 
suspended, shall not be considered minor offenses.
    (2) Trial observers shall attend and prepare formal reports in all 
cases of trials of U.S. personnel by foreign courts or tribunals, except 
for minor offenses. In cases of minor offenses, the observer shall 
attend the trial at the discretion of the designated commanding officer, 
but shall not be required to make a formal report. These reports need 
not be classified, but shall be treated as For Official Use Only 
documents. They shall be forwarded intact to the designated commanding 
officer through such agencies as the designated commanding officer may 
prescribe for transmission to the Judge Advocate General of the 
accused's service, with any comments of the appropriate Military Service 
commander. These reports shall be forwarded immediately upon the 
completion of the trial in the lower court, and shall not be delayed 
because of the possibility of a new trial, rehearing or appeal, reports 
of which shall be forwarded in the same manner. Copies shall also be 
forwarded to the unified commander, if any, and to the chief of the 
diplomatic mission.
    (3) The trial observer report shall contain a factual description or 
summary of the trial proceedings. It should enable an informed judgment 
to be made regarding: (i) Whether there was any failure to comply with 
the procedural safeguards secured by a pertinent status of forces 
agreement, and (ii) whether the accused received a fair trial under all 
the circumstances. The report shall specify the conclusions of the trial 
observer with respect to paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, and shall 
state in detail the basis for the conclusions. Unless the designated 
commanding officer directs otherwise, the report shall not contain 
conclusions with respect to paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (4) The designated commanding officer, upon receipt of a trial 
observer report, shall be responsible for determining: (i) Whether there 
was any failure to comply with the procedural safeguards secured by the 
pertinent status of forces agreement, and (ii) whether the accused 
received a fair trial under all the circumstances. Due regard should be 
given to those fair trial rights listed in Sec. 151.7 that are relevant 
to the particular facts and circumstances of the trial. However, a trial 
shall not be found unfair merely because it is not identical with trials 
held in the United States. If the designated commanding officer is of 
the opinion that the procedural safeguards specified in pertinent 
agreements were denied or that the trial was otherwise

[[Page 623]]

unjust, the commanding officer shall submit to the Office of the 
Secretary of Defense, through the unified commander and the Judge 
Advocate General of the Military Service concerned, a recommendation as 
to appropriate action to rectify the trial deficiencies and otherwise to 
protect the rights or interests of the accused. This shall include a 
statement of efforts taken or to be taken at the local level to protect 
the right of the accused. An information copy of the recommendation of 
the designated commanding officer shall be forwarded to the diplomatic 
or consular mission in the country concerned.
    (h) Counsel fees and related assistance. When the Secretary of the 
Military Department concerned or designee considers such action to be in 
the best interests of the United States, representation by civilian 
counsel and other assistance described under 10 U.S.C. 1037 may be 
furnished at Government expense to U.S. personnel tried in foreign 
countries.
    (i) Treatment of U.S. personnel confined in foreign penal 
institutions. (1) Insofar as practicable and subject to the laws and 
regulations of the country concerned and the provisions of any agreement 
therewith, the Department of Defense seeks to ensure that U.S. military 
personnel: (i) When in the custody of foreign authorities are fairly 
treated at all times and (ii) when confined (pretrial and post-trial) in 
foreign penal institutions are accorded the treatment and are entitled 
to all the rights, privileges, and protections of personnel confined in 
U.S. military facilities. Such rights, privileges, and protections are 
enunciated in present Military Service directives and regulations, and 
include, but are not limited to, legal assistance, visitation, medical 
attention, food, bedding, clothing, and other health and comfort 
supplies.
    (2) In consonance with this policy, U.S. military personnel confined 
in foreign penal institutions shall be visited at least every 30 days, 
at which time the conditions of confinement and other matters relating 
to their health and welfare shall be observed. The Military Services 
shall maintain, on a current basis, records of these visits as reports 
by their respective commands. Records of each visit should contain the 
following information:
    (i) Names of personnel conducting visit and date of visit.
    (ii) Name of each prisoner visited, serial number, and sentence.
    (iii) Name and location of prison.
    (iv) Treatment of the individual prisoner by prison warden and other 
personnel (include a short description of the rehabilitation program, if 
any, as applied to the prisoner).
    (v) Conditions existing in the prison, such as light, heat, 
sanitation, food, recreation, and religious activities.
    (vi) Change in status of prisoner, conditions of confinement or 
transfer to another institution.
    (vii) Condition of prisoner, physical and mental.
    (viii) Assistance given to prisoner, such as legal, medical, food, 
bedding, clothing, and health and comfort supplies.
    (ix) Action taken to have any deficiencies corrected, either by the 
local commander or through diplomatic or consular mission.
    (x) Designation of command responsible for prisoner's welfare and 
reporting of visits.
    (xi) Information as to discharge of a prisoner from the Military 
Service or termination of confinement.
    (3) When it is impracticable for the individual's commanding officer 
or representative to make visits, the designated commanding officer 
should be requested to arrange that another unit be responsible for such 
visits or to request that the appropriate diplomatic or consular mission 
assume responsibility therefor. When necessary, a medical officer should 
participate in the visits and record the results of medical 
examinations. If reasonable requests for permission to visit U.S. 
military personnel are arbitrarily denied, or it is ascertained that the 
individual is being mistreated or that the conditions of custody or 
confinement are substandard, the case should be referred to the 
diplomatic or consular mission concerned for appropriate action.
    (4) To the extent possible, military commanders should seek to 
conclude local arrangements whereby U.S. military authorities may be 
permitted to

[[Page 624]]

accord U.S. military personnel confined in foreign institutions the 
treatment, rights, privileges, and protection similar to those accorded 
such personnel confined in U.S. military facilities. The details of such 
arrangements should be submitted to the Judge Advocates General of the 
Military Services.
    (5) The military commanders shall make appropriate arrangements with 
foreign authorities whereby custody of individuals who are members of 
the Armed Forces of the United States shall, when they are released from 
confinement by foreign authorities, be turned over to U.S. military 
authorities. In appropriate cases, diplomatic or consular officers 
should be requested to keep the military authorities advised as to the 
anticipated date of the release of such persons by the foreign 
authorities.
    (6) In cooperation with the appropriate diplomatic or consular 
mission, military commanders shall, insofar as possible, ensure that 
dependents of U.S. military personnel, nationals of the United States 
serving with, employed by or accompanying the armed forces, and 
dependents of such nationals when in the custody of foreign authorities, 
or when confined (pretrial and post-trial) in foreign penal institutions 
receive the same treatment, rights, and support as would be extended to 
U.S. military personnel in comparable situations pursuant to the 
provisions of Sec. 151.4(i).
    (j) Discharge. U.S. military personnel confined in foreign prisons 
shall not be discharged from military service until the completion of 
the term of imprisonment and the return of the accused to the United 
States, except that in unusual cases such discharges may be accomplished 
upon prior authorization of the Secretary of the Military Department 
concerned.
    (k) Information policy. It is the basic policy of the Department of 
Defense that the general public and the Congress must be provided 
promptly with the maximum information concerning status of forces 
matters that are consistent with the national interest. Information 
shall be coordinated and furnished to the public and the Congress in 
accordance with established procedures, including DoD Directive 5122.5, 
\1\ ``Assistant Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs),'' July 10, 1961, 
and parts 286 and 286a of this title.

General Counsel, DoD.


<R05>
Sec. 151.6  Resolution of ratification, with reservations, as agreed 
to by the Senate on July 15, 1953.

    Resolved (two-thirds of the Senators present concurring therein), 
That the Senate advise and consent to the ratification of Executive T, 
Eighty-second Congress, second session, an agreement between the parties 
to the North Atlantic Treaty Regarding the Status of their Forces, 
signed at London on June 19, 1951. It is the understanding of the 
Senate, which understanding inheres in its advise and consent to the 
ratification of the Agreement, that nothing in the Agreement diminishes, 
abridges, or alters the right of the United States of America to 
safeguard its own security by excluding or removing persons whose 
presence in the United States is deemed prejudicial to its safety or 
security, and that no person whose presence in the United States is 
deemed prejudicial to its safety or security shall be permitted to enter 
or remain in the United States. In giving its advise and consent to 
ratification, it is the sense of the Senate that:
    (a) The criminal jurisdiction provisions of Article VII do not 
constitute a precedent for future agreements;
    (b) Where a person subject to the military jurisdiction of the 
United States is to be tried by the authorities of a receiving state, 
under the treaty the Commanding Officer of the armed forces of the 
United States in such state shall examine the laws of such state with 
particular reference to the procedural safeguards contained in the 
Constitution of the United States;
    (c) If, in the opinion of such Commanding Officer, under all the 
circumstances of the case, there is danger that the accused will not be 
protected becase of the absence or denial of constitutional rights the 
accused would enjoy in the United States, the Commanding Officer shall 
request the authorities of the receiving State to waive jurisdiction in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3(c) of Article VII (which 
requires the receiving

[[Page 626]]

State to give ``sympathetic consideration'' to such request) and if such 
authorities refuse to waive jurisdiction, the commanding officer shall 
request the Department of State to press such request through diplomatic 
channels and notification shall be given by the Executive Branch to the 
Armed Services Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives;
    (d) A representative of the United States to be appointed by the 
Chief of Diplomatic Mission with the advice of the senior U.S. military 
representative in the receiving State will attend the trial of any such 
person by the authorities of a receiving State under the agreement, and 
any failure to comply with the provisions of paragraph 9 of Article VII 
of the Agreement shall be reported to the commanding officer of the 
Armed Forces of the United States in such State who shall then request 
the Department of State to take appropriate action to protect the rights 
of the accused, and notification shall be given by the Executive Branch 
to the Armed Services Committees of the Senate and House of 
Representatives.


<R05>
Sec. 151.7  Fair trial guarantees.

    The following is a listing of ``fair trial'' safeguards or 
guarantees that are considered to be applicable to U.S. State court 
criminal proceedings, by virtue of the 14th Amendment as interpreted by 
the Supreme Court of the United States. The list is intended as a guide 
for the preparation of country law studies prescribed by Sec. 151.4 and 
for the determinations made by the designated commanding officer under 
Sec. 151.4(e) through Sec. 151.4(g). Designated commanding officers 
should also consider other factors that could result in a violation of 
due process of law in State court proceedings in the United States.
    (a) Criminal statute alleged to be violated must set forth specific 
and definite standards of guilt.
    (b) Accused shall not be prosecuted under an ex post facto law.
    (c) Accused shall not be punished by bills of attainder.
    (d) Accused must be informed of the nature and cause of the 
accusation and have a reasonable time to prepare a defense.
    (e) Accused is entitled to have the assistance of defense counsel.
    (f) Accused is entitled to be present at the trial.
    (g) Accused is entitled to be confronted with hostile witnesses.
    (h) Accused is entitled to have compulsory process for obtaining 
favorable witnesses.
    (i) Use of evidence against the accused obtained through 
unreasonable search or seizure or other illegal means is prohibited.
    (j) Burden of proof is on the Government in all criminal trials.
    (k) Accused is entitled to be tried by an impartial court.
    (l) Accused may not be compelled to be a witness against him or 
herself; and shall be protected from the use of a confession obtained by 
torture, threats, violence, or the exertion of any improper influence.
    (m) Accused shall not be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment.
    (n) Accused is entitled to be tried without unreasonable 
(prejudicial) delay.
    (o) Accused is entitled to a competent interpreter when the accused 
does not understand the language in which the trial is conducted and 
does not have counsel proficient in the language both of the court and 
of the accused.
    (p) Accused is entitled to a public trial.
    (q) Accused may not be subjected to consecutive trials for the same 
offense that are so vexatious as to indicate fundamental unfairness.

<R05>
Sec. 152.5.  Implementation.

    The foregoing policies and procedures providing guidelines for 
implementation of this part, as well as those contained in the appendix, 
are intended exclusively for the guidance of military personnel and 
civilian employees of the Department of Defense, and the United States 
Coast Guard by agreement of the Department of Homeland Security. These 
guidelines are intended to improve the internal management of the 
Federal Government and are not intended to create any right, privilege, 
or benefit, substantive of procedural, to any person or enforceable at 
law by any party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, 
or any person.

 Appendix A to Part 152--Guidance to the Joint Service Committee (JSCA)

    (a) Review the Manual for Courts-Martial. (1) The Joint Service 
Committee (JSC) shall conduct an annual review of the Manual for Courts-
Martial (MCM), in light of judicial and legislative developments in 
military and civilian practice, to ensure:
    (i) The MCM implements the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) 
and reflects current military practice and judicial precedent.
    (ii) The rules and procedures of the MCM are uniform insofar as 
practicable.
    (iii) The MCM applies, to the extent practicable, the principles of 
law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of 
criminal cases in United States district courts, but which are not 
contrary to or inconsistent with the UCMJ.
    (iv) The MCM is workable throughout the worldwide jurisdiction of 
the UCMJ; and,
    (v) The MCM is workable across the spectrum of circumstances in 
which courts-martial are conducted, including combat conditions.
    (2) During this review, any JSC voting member may propose for the 
Voting Group's consideration an amendment to the MCM. Proposed 
amendments to the MCM shall ordinarily be referred to the JSC Working 
Group (WG) for study. The WG assists the JSC in staffing various 
proposals, conducting studies of proposals and other military justice 
related topics at the JSC's direction, and making reports to the JSC. 
Any proposed amendment to the MCM, if approved by a majority of the JSC 
voting members, becomes a part of the annual review.
    (3) The JSC shall prepare a draft of the annual review of the MCM 
and forward it to the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, on 
or about December 31st. The General Counsel of the Department of Defense 
may submit the draft of the annual review to the Code Committee 
established by Article 146 of the UCMJ, with an invitation to submit 
comments.
    (4) The draft of the annual review shall set forth any specific 
recommendations for changes to the MCM, including, if not adequately 
addressed in the accompanying discussion or analysis, a concise 
statement of the basis and purpose of any proposed change. If no changes 
are recommended, the draft review shall so state. If the JSC recommends 
changes to the MCM, the draft review shall so state. If the JSC 
recommends changes to the MCM, the public notice procedures of paragraph 
(d)(3) of this appendix are applicable.
    (b) Changes to the Manual for Courts-Martial. (1) By January 1st of 
each year, the JSC voting members shall ensure that a solicitation for 
proposed changes to the MCM is sent

[[Page 629]]

to appropriate agencies within their respective Services that includes, 
but is not limited to, the judiciary, the trial counsel and defense 
counsel organizations, and the judge advocate general schools.
    (2) The Federal Register announcement of each year's annual review 
of proposed changes to the MCM shall also invite members of the public 
to submit any new proposals for JSC consideration during subsequent JSC 
annual reviews.
    (3) When the JSC receives proposed changes to the MCM either by 
solicitation or Federal Register notice, the JSC shall determine whether 
the proposal should be considered under paragraph (a)(2) of this 
appendix by determining if one or more of the JSC voting member(s) 
intends to sponsor the proposed change. The JSC shall determine when 
such sponsored proposals should be considered under the annual review 
process, taking into account any other proposals under consideration and 
any other reviews or studies directed by the General Counsel of the 
Department of Defense.
    (4) Changes to the MCM shall be proposed as part of the annual 
review conducted under paragraph (a) of this appendix. When earlier 
implementation is required, the JSC may send proposed changes to the 
General Counsel of the Department of Defense, for coordination under DoD 
Directive 5500.1.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Available at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Proposals to Amend the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The JSC 
may determine that the efficient administration of military justice 
within the Armed Services requires amendments to the UCMJ, or that a 
desired amendment to the MCM makes necessary an amendment to the UCMJ. 
In such cases, the JSC shall forward to the General Counsel of the 
Department of Defense, a legislative proposal to change the UCMJ. The 
General Counsel of the Department of Defense may direct that the JSC 
forward any such legislative proposal to the Code Committee for its 
consideration under Article 146, UCMJ.
    (d) Public Notice and Meeting. (1) Proposals to amend the UCMJ are 
not governed by the procedures set out in this paragraph. (See DoD 
Directive 5105. 18. This paragraph applies only to the JSC 
recommendations to amend the MCM.)
    (2) It is DoD policy to encourage public participation in the JSC's 
review of the MCM. Notice that the Department of Defense, through the 
JSC, intends to propose changes to the MCM normally shall be published 
in the Federal Register before submission of such changes to the 
President. This notice is not required when the Secretary of Defense in 
his sole and unreviewable discretion proposes that the President issue 
the change without such notice on the basis that public notice 
procedures, as set forth in this part, are unnecessary or contrary to 
the sound administration of military justice, or a MCM change 
corresponding to legislation is expeditiously required to keep the MCM 
current and consistent with changes in applicable law.
    (3) The Office of General Counsel of the Department of Defense shall 
facilitate publishing the Federal Register notice required under this 
paragraph.
    (4) The notice under this paragraph shall consist of the publication 
of the full text of the proposed changes, including discussion and 
analysis, unless the General Counsel of the Department of Defense 
determines that such publication in full would unduly burden the Federal 
Register, the time and place where a copy of the proposed change may be 
examined, and the procedure for obtaining access to or a copy of the 
proposed change.
    (5) A period of not fewer than 60 days after publication of notice 
normally shall be allowed for public comment, but a shorter period may 
be authorized when the General Counsel of the Department of Defense 
determines that a 60-day period is unnecessary or is contrary to the 
sound administration of military justice. The Federal Register notice 
shall normally indicate that public comments shall be submitted to the 
Executive Secretary of the JSC.
    (6) The JSC shall provide notice in the Federal Register and hold a 
public meeting during the public comments period, where interested 
persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to submit views on any 
of the proposed changes contained in the annual review. Public proposals 
and comments to the JSC should include a reference to the specific 
provision to be changed, a rational for the proposed change, and 
specific and detailed proposed language to replace the current language. 
Incomplete submissions might be insufficient to receive the 
consideration desired. The JSC shall seek to consider all views 
presented at the public meeting as well as any written comments 
submitted during the 60-day period when determining the final form of 
any proposed amendments to the MCM.
    (E) Internal Rules and Record-Keeping. (1) In furthering DoD policy, 
studying issues, or performing other duties relating to the 
administration of military justice, the JSC may establish internal rules 
governing its operation.
    (2) The JSC shall create a file system and maintain appropriate JSC 
records.

Sec. 153.3  Definitions.

    Estate planning. The continuing process of arranging for the use, 
conservation, and transfer of one's property and wealth during life and 
upon death. The process produces a plan that may include some or all of 
these: A testator/testatrix will, military testamentary instrument, a 
trust, life insurance, an advance medical directive, a healthcare power 
of attorney, designation of anatomical gifts, and other dispositive 
documents.
    Military advance medical directive. A written document, prepared in 
accordance with this Part, which explains one's wishes about medical 
treatment if one becomes incompetent or unable to communicate, or which 
governs the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment from 
the maker of the document in the event of an incurable or irreversible 
condition that will cause death within a relatively short period of 
time, and when the maker is no longer able/competent to make decisions 
regarding his/her medical treatment.
    Military legal assistance counsel. A judge advocate, as defined in 
10 U.S.C. 801(13) or a civilian attorney serving as a legal assistance 
officer, under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1044.
    Military power of attorney. A written instrument prepared in 
accordance with this part, whereby one person, as principal, appoints

with testamentary intent in accordance with this part and that:
    (a) Is executed in accordance with this part (Sec. 153.4 (b)) by

or recording before probate that is provided for testamentary 
instruments under the laws of a State.

Sec. 153.4  Policy.

    It is DoD policy that:

[[Page 631]]

    (a) General. (1) Although not every person needs a will or military 
testamentary instrument, all military personnel shall consider the 
advisability of making either. Whether a will or military testamentary 
instrument is necessary or desirable, and its form and execution, depend 
on the individual's desires, circumstances and the intestate succession 
laws of the appropriate State. Ultimately, those eligible for legal 
assistance must decide for themselves whether to prepare any estate 
planning document(s).
    (2) The Military Departments, within the limits of available 
resources and expertise, shall inform and educate persons eligible for 
legal assistance on estate planning generally, and the advisability of 
preparing a will or military testamentary instrument. It is especially 
important that military personnel be educated with respect to these 
matters before mobilization, deployment, or similar actions.
    (3) All commanding officers shall urge military personnel to seek 
legal counsel regarding an estate plan well before mobilization, 
deployment, or similar activities. However, any testamentary instrument, 
to be legally effective, must be the free and voluntary act of the 
person making it.
    (b) Military testamentary instrument. A military testamentary 
instrument shall:
    (1) Be executed by the testator/testatrix (or, if the testator/
testatrix is unable to execute the instrument personally, executed in 
the presence of, by the direction of, and on behalf of the testator/
testatrix).
    (2) Be executed in the presence of a military legal assistance 
counsel acting as presiding attorney.
    (3) Be executed in the presence of at least two disinterested 
witnesses (in addition to the presiding attorney), each of whom attests 
to witnessing the testator/testatrix execution of the instrument by 
signing it.
    (4) Include a statement or preamble in form and content, 
substantially as outlined at appendix A to this part.
    (5) Include (or have attached to it), a self-proving affidavit, in a 
form and content, substantially as outlined at appendix B to this part
    (c) Military power of attorney. 10 U.S.C. 1044b requires recognition 
of powers of attorney prepared for persons eligible for legal 
assistance. If prepared, such documents will include a statement or 
preamble in form and content, substantially as outlined at appendix C to 
this part.
    (d) Military advance medical directive. Section 1044c of 10 U.S.C. 
requires recognition of military advance medical directives prepared for 
persons eligible for legal assistance. If prepared, such documents will 
include a statement or preamble in form and content, substantially as 
outlined at enclosure 4.
    (e) Reserve component members. Subject to the availability of legal 
staff resources, the Secretaries of the Military Departments may provide 
legal assistance in connection with their personal civil legal affairs 
to members of Reserve components and their dependents, following release 
from active duty under a call or order to active duty for more than 30 
days issued under a mobilization authority (as determined by the 
Secretary of Defense). Eligibility for such legal assistance shall be 
for a period of time that begins on the date of the release and is not 
less than twice the length of the period served on active duty under 
that call or order to active duty.


<R05>
Sec. 153.5  Responsibilities.

    (a) The Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness) shall 
manage implementation of this part.
    (b) The Secretaries of the Military Departments shall insure 
compliance with this part and establish policies and procedures to 
implement this part.

         Appendix A to Part 153--Military Testamentary Preamble

section 1044d of title 10, United States Code, and executed by a person

                           Subpart B_Policies


<R05>
Sec. 154.6  Standards for access to classified information or assignment 
to sensitive duties.

    (a) General. Only U.S. citizens shall be granted a personnel 
security clearance, assigned to sensitive duties, or granted access to 
classified information unless an authority designated in Appendix E has 
determined that, based on all available information, there are 
compelling reasons in furtherance of the Department of Defense mission, 
including, special expertise, to assign an individual who is not a 
citizen to sensitive duties or grant a Limited Access Authorization to 
classified information. Non-U.S. citizens may be employed in the 
competitive service in sensitive civilian positions only when 
specifically approved by the Office of Personnel Management, pursuant to 
E.O. 11935. Exceptions to these requirements shall be permitted only for 
compelling national security reasons.
    (b) Clearance and sensitive position standard. The personnel 
security standard that must be applied to determine whether a person is 
eligible for access to classified information or assignment to sensitive 
duties is whether, based on all available information, the person's 
loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that entrusting the 
person with classified information or assigning the person to sensitive 
duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.
    (c) Military service standard. The personnel security standard that 
must be applied in determining whether a person is suitable under 
national security criteria for appointment, enlistment, induction, or 
retention in the Armed Forces is that, based on all available 
information, there is no reasonable basis for doubting the person's 
loyalty to the Government of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 154.7  Criteria for application of security standards.

    The ultimate decision in applying either of the security standards 
set forth in Sec. 154.6 (b) and (c) must be an overall common sense 
determination based upon all available facts. The criteria for 
determining eligibility for a clearance under the security standard 
shall include, but not be limited to the following:
    (a) Commission of any act of sabotage, espionage, treason, 
terrorism, anarchy, sedition, or attempts thereat or preparation 
therefor, or conspiring with or aiding or abetting another to commit or 
attempt to commit any such act.
    (b) Establishing or continuing a sympathetic association with a 
saboteur, spy, traitor, seditionist, anarchist, terrorist, 
revolutionist, or with an espionage or other secret agent or similar 
representative of a foreign nation whose interests may be inimical to 
the interests of the United States, or with any person who advocates the 
use of force or violence to overthrow the Government of the United 
States or to alter the form of Government of the United States by 
unconstitutional means.
    (c) Advocacy or use of force or violence to overthrow the Government 
of the United States or to alter the form of Government of the United 
States by unconstitutional means.
    (d) Knowing membership with the specific intent of furthering the 
aims of, or adherence to and active participation in any foreign or 
domestic organization, association, movement, group or combination of 
persons (hereafter referred to as organizations) which unlawfully 
advocates or practices the commission of acts of force or violence to 
prevent others from exercising their rights under the Constitution or 
laws of the U.S. or of any State or which seeks to overthrow the 
Government of the U.S. or any State or subdivision thereof by unlawful 
means.
    (e) Unauthorized disclosure to any person of classified information, 
or of other information, disclosure of which is prohibited by statute, 
Executive Order or regulation.

[[Page 638]]

    (f) Performing or attempting to perform one's duties, acceptance and 
active maintenance of dual citizenship, or other acts conducted in a 
manner which serve or which could be expected to serve the interests of 
another government in preference to the interests of the United States.
    (g) Disregard of public law, statutes, Executive Orders or 
regulations including violation of security regulations or practices.
    (h) Criminal or dishonest conduct.
    (i) Acts of omission or commission that indicate poor judgment, 
unreliability or untrustworthiness.
    (j) Any behavior or illness, including any mental condition, which, 
in the opinion of competent medical authority, may cause a defect in 
judgment or reliability with due regard to the transient or continuing 
effect of the illness and the medical findings in such case.
    (k) Vulnerability to coercion, influence, or pressure that may cause 
conduct contrary to the national interest. This may be
    (1) The presence of immediate family members or other persons to 
whom the applicant is bonded by affection or obligation in a nation (or 
areas under its domination) whose interests may be inimical to those of 
the United States, or
    (2) Any other circumstances that could cause the applicant to be 
vulnerable.
    (l) Excessive indebtedness, recurring financial difficulties, or 
unexplained affluence.

oral statement, document, form or other representation or device used by 
the Department of Defense or any other Federal agency.
    (p) Failing or refusing to answer or to authorize others to answer 
questions or provide information required by a congressional committee,

judgment.
    (q) Acts of sexual misconduct or perversion indicative of moral 
turpitude, poor judgment, or lack of regard for the laws of society.


<R05>
Sec. 154.8  Types and scope of personnel security investigations.

    (a) General. The types of personnel security investigations 
authorized below vary in scope of investigative effort required to meet 
the purpose of the particular investigation. No other types are 
authorized. The scope of a PSI may be neither raised nor lowered without 
the approval of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.
    (b) National Agency Check. Essentially, a NAC is a records check of 
designated agencies of the Federal Government that maintain record 
systems containing information relevant to making a personnel security 
determination. An ENTNAC is a NAC (scope as outlined in paragraph 1, 
Appendix A) conducted on inductees and first-term enlistees, but lacking 
a technical fingerprint search. A NAC is also an integral part of each 
BI, SBI, and Periodic Reinvestigation (PR). Subpart C prescribes when an 
NAC is required.
    (c) National Agency Check plus written inquiries. The Office of 
Personnel Management (OPM) conducts a NAC plus Written Inquiries (NACIs) 
on civilian employees for all departments and agencies of the Federal 
Government, pursuant to E.O. 10450. NACIs are considered to meet the 
investigative requirements of this regulation for a nonsensitive or 
noncritical sensitive position and/or up to a Secret clearance and, in 
addition to the NAC, include coverage of law enforcement agencies, 
former employers and supervisors, references, and schools covering the 
last 5 years.
    (d) DoD National Agency check plus written inquiries. DIS will 
conduct a DNACI, consisting of the scope contained in paragraph 2, 
Appendix A, for DoD military and contractor personnel for access to 
Secret information. Subpart C prescribes when a DNACI is required.

[[Page 639]]

    (e) Background investigation. The BI is the principal type of 
investigation conducted when an individual requires Top Secret clearance 
or is to be assigned to a critical sensitive position. The BI normally 
covers a 5-year period and consists of a subject interview, NAC, LACs, 
credit checks, developed character references (3), employment records 
checks, employment references (3), and select scoping as required to 
resolve unfavorable or questionable information. (See paragraph 3, 
Appendix A). Subpart C prescribes when a BI is required.
    (f) Special background investigation. (1) An SBI is essentially a BI 
providing additional coverage both in period of time as well as sources 
of information, scoped in accordance with the provisions of DCID 1/14 
but without the personal interview. While the kind of coverage provided 
for by the SBI determines eligibility for access to SCI, DoD has adopted 
this coverage for certain other Special Access programs. Subpart C 
prescribes when an SBI is required.
    (2) The OPM, FBI, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Secret Service, 
and the Department of State conduct specially scoped BIs under the 
provisions of DCID 1/14. Any investigation conducted by one of the 
above-cited agencies under DCID 1/14 standards is considered to meet the 
SBI investigative requirements of this part.
    (3) The detailed scope of an SBI is set forth in paragraph 4, 
Appendix A.
    (g) Special investigative inquiry. (1) A Special Investigative 
Inquiry is a personnel security investigation conducted to prove or 
disprove allegations relating to the criteria outlined in Sec. 154.7(a) 
of this part except current criminal activities (see Sec. 154.9(c)(4)), 
that have arisen concerning an individual upon whom a personnel security 
determination has been previously made and who, at the time of the 
allegation, holds a security clearance or otherwise occupies a position 
that requires a trustworthiness determination.
    (2) Special Investigative Inquiries are scoped as necessary to 
address the specific matters requiring resolution in the case concerned 
and generally consist of record checks and/or interviews with 
potentially knowledgeable persons. An SII may include an interview with 
the subject of the investigation when necessary to resolve conflicting 
information and/or to provide an opportunity to refute or mitigate 
adverse information.
    (3) In those cases when there is a disagreement between Defense 
Investigative Service (DIS) and the requester as to the appropriate 
scope of the investigation, the matter may be referred to the Deputy 
Under Secretary of Defense for Policy for resolution.
    (h) Periodic reinvestigation. As referred to in Sec. 154.19(a) and 
other national directives, certain categories of duties, clearance, and 
access require the conduct of a PR every five years according to the 
scope outlined in paragraph 5, Appendix A. The PR scope applies to 
military, civilian, contractor, and foreign national personnel.
    (i) Personal interview. Investigative experience over the years has 
demonstrated that, given normal circumstances, the subject of a 
personnel security investigation is the best source of accurate and 
relevant information concerning the matters under consideration. 
Further, restrictions imposed by the Privacy Act of 1974 dictate that 
Federal investigative agencies collect information to the greatest 
extent practicable directly from the subject when the information may 
result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, 
and privileges under Federal programs. Accordingly, personal interviews 
are an integral part of the DoD personnel security program and shall be 
conducted in accordance with the requirements set forth in the following 
paragraphs of this section.
    (1) BI/PR. A personal interview shall be conducted by a trained DIS 
agent as part of each BI and PR.
    (2) Resolving adverse information. A personal interview of the 
subject shall be conducted by a DIS agent (or, when authorized, by 
investigative personnel of other DoD investigative organizations 
designated in this Regulation to conduct personnel security 
investigations), when necessary, as part of each Special Investigative 
Inquiry, as well as during the course of initial or expanded 
investigations, to resolve or

[[Page 640]]

clarify any information which may impugn the subject's moral character, 
threaten the subject's future Federal employment, raise the question of 
subject's security clearability, or be otherwise stigmatizing.
    (3) Hostage situation. A personal interview shall be conducted by a 
DIS agent (or, when authorized, by investigative personnel of other DoD 
investigative organizations designated in this Regulation to conduct 
personnel security investigations) in those instances in which an 
individual has immediate family members or other persons bound by ties 
of affection or obligation who reside in a nation whose interests are 
inimical to the interests of the United States. (See Sec. 154.9(d).
    (4) Applicants/potential nominees for DoD military or civilian 
positions requiring access to SCI or other positions requiring an SBI. A 
personal interview of the individual concerned shall be conducted, to 
the extent feasible, as part of the selection process for applicants/
potential nominees for positions requiring access to SCI or completion 
of an SBI. The interview shall be conducted by a designee of the 
Component to which the applicant or potential nominee is assigned. 
Clerical personnel are not authorized to conduct these interviews. Such 
interviews shall be conducted utilizing resources in the order of 
priority indicated below:
    (i) Existing personnel security screening systems (e.g., Air Force 
Assessment Screening Program, Naval Security Group Personnel Security 
Interview Program, U.S. Army Personnel Security Screening Program); or
    (ii) Commander of the nominating organization or such official as he 
or she has designated in writing (e.g., Deputy Commander, Executive 
Officer, Security Officer, Security Manager, S-2, Counterintelligence 
Specialist, Personnel Security Specialist, or Personnel Officer); or
    (iii) Agents of investigative agencies in direct support of the 
Component concerned.
    (5) Administrative procedures. (i) The personal interview required 
by paragraph (i)(4) of this section shall be conducted in accordance 
with Appendix F.
    (ii) For those investigations requested subsequent to the personal 
interview requirements of paragraph (i)(4) of this section the following 
procedures apply:
    (A) The DD Form 1879 (Request for Personnel Security Investigation) 
shall be annotated under Item 20 (Remarks) with the statement ``Personal 
Interview Conducted by (cite the duty assignment of the designated 
official (e.g., Commander, Security Officer, Personnel Security 
Specialist, etc.))'' in all cases in which an SBI is subsequently 
requested.
    (B) Unfavorable information developed through the personal interview 
required by paragraph (i)(4) of this section, will be detailed in a 
written report attached to the DD Form 1879 to include full 
identification of the interviewer. Failure to provide such information 
may result in conduct of an incomplete investigation by DIS.
    (C) Whenever it is determined that it is not feasible to conduct the 
personal interview required by paragraph (i)(4) of this section prior to 
requesting the SBI, the DD Form 1879 shall be annotated under Item 20 
citing the reason for not conducting the interview.
    (j) Expanded investigation. If adverse or questionable information 
relevant to a security determination is developed during the conduct of 
a personnel security investigation, regardless of type, the 
investigation shall be expanded, consistent with the restrictions in 
Sec. 154.10(e) to the extent necessary to substantiate or disprove the 
adverse or questionable information.


<R05>
Sec. 154.9  Authorized personnel security investigative agencies.

    (a) General. The DIS provides a single centrally directed personnel 
security investigative service to conduct personnel security 
investigations within the 50 States, District of Columbia, and 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for DoD Components, except as provided for 
in DoD Directive 5100.23.\1\ DIS will request the Military Departments 
or other appropriate Federal Agencies to accomplish DoD investigative 
requirements in other geographic areas beyond their jurisdiction. No 
other DoD Component

[[Page 641]]

shall conduct personnel security investigations unless specifically 
authorized by the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. In 
certain instances provided for below, the DIS shall refer an 
investigation to other investigative agencies.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 154.2(c).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Subversive affiliations--(1) General. In the context of DoD 
investigative policy, subversion refers only to such conduct as is 
forbidden by the laws of the United States. Specifically, this is 
limited to information concerning the activities of individuals or 
groups that involve or will involve the violation of Federal law, for 
the purpose of:
    (i) Overthrowing the Government of the United States or the 
government of a State;
    (ii) Substantially impairing for the purpose of influencing U.S. 
Government policies or decisions:
    (A) The functions of the Government of the United States, or
    (B) The functions of the government of a State;
    (iii) Depriving persons of their civil rights under the Constitution 
or laws of the United States.
    (2) Military Department/FBI jurisdiction. Allegations of activities 
covered by Sec. 154.7 (a) through (f) are in the exclusive 
investigative domain of either the counterintelligence agencies of the 
Military Departments or the FBI, depending on the circumstances of the 
case and the provisions of the Agreement Governing the Conduct of 
Defense Department Counterintelligence Activities in Conjunction with 
the FBI. Whenever allegations of this nature are developed, whether 
before or after a security clearance has been issued or during the 
course of a personnel security investigation conducted by DIS, they 
shall be referred immediately to either the FBI or to a military 
department counterintelligence agency, as appropriate.
    (3) DIS jurisdiction. Allegations of activities limited to those set 
forth in Sec. 154.7 (g) through (j) of this part shall be investigated 
by DIS.
    (c) Suitability information--(1) General. Most derogatory 
information developed through personnel security investigations of DoD 
military or civilian personnel is so-called suitability information, 
that is, information pertaining to activities or situations covered by 
Sec. 154.7 (g) through (q). Almost all unfavorable personnel security 
determinations made by DoD authorities are based on derogatory 
suitability information, although such information is often used as a 
basis for unfavorable administrative actions not of a security nature, 
such as action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice or removal 
from Federal employment under OPM regulations.
    (2) Pre-clearance investigation. Derogatory suitability information, 
except that covered in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, developed 
during the course of a personnel security investigation, prior to the 
issuance of an individual's personnel security clearance, shall be 
investigated by DIS to the extent necessary to confirm or refute its 
applicability to Sec. 154.7 (g) through (q).
    (3) Postadjudication investigation. Derogatory suitability 
allegations, except those covered by paragraph (c)(4) of this section 
arising subsequent to clearance requiring investigation to resolve and 
to determine the individual's eligibility for continued access to 
classified information, reinstatement of clearance/access, or retention 
in a sensitive position shall be referred to DIS to conduct a Special 
Investigative Inquiry. Reinvestigation of individuals for adjudicative 
reconsideration due to the passage of time or evidence of favorable 
behavior shall also be referred to DIS for investigation. In such cases, 
completion of the appropriate statement of personal history by the 
individual constitutes consent to be investigated. Individual consent or 
completion of a statement of personal history is not required when Sec. 
154.19(b) applies. Postadjudication investigation of allegations of a 
suitability nature required to support other types of unfavorable 
personnel security determinations or disciplinary procedures independent 
of a personnel security determination shall be handled in accordance 
with applicable Component administrative regulations. These latter 
categories of allegations lie outside the DoD personnel security program 
and are not a proper investigative function for departmental 
counterintelligence organizations, Component personnel security 
authorities, or DIS.

[[Page 642]]

    (4) Allegations of criminal activity. Any allegations of conduct of 
a nature indicating possible criminal conduct, including any arising 
during the course of a personnel security investigation, shall be 
referred to the appropriate DoD, military department or civilian 
criminal investigative agency. Military department investigative 
agencies have primary investigative jurisdiction in cases where there is 
probable cause to believe that the alleged conduct will be the basis for 
prosecution under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
    (d) Hostage situations--(1) General. A hostage situation exists when 
a member of an individual's immediate family or such other person to 
whom the individual is bound by obligation or affection resides in a 
country whose interests are inimical to the interests of the United 
States. The rationale underlying this category of investigation is based 
on the possibility that an individual in such a situation might be 
coerced, influenced, or pressured to act contrary to the best interests 
of national security.
    (2) DIS jurisdiction. In the absence of evidence of any coercion, 
influence or pressure, hostage investigations are exclusively a 
personnel security matter, rather than counterintelligence, and all such 
investigations shall be conducted by DIS.
    (3) Military Department and/or FBI jurisdiction. Should indications 
be developed that hostile intelligence is taking any action specifically 
directed against the individual concerned--or should there exist any 
other evidence that the individual is actually being coerced, 
influenced, or pressured by an element inimical to the interests of 
national security--then the case becomes a counterintelligence matter 
(outside of investigative jurisdiction of DIS) to be referred to the 
appropriate military department or the FBI for investigation.
    (e) Overseas personnel security investigations. Personnel security 
investigations requiring investigation overseas shall be conducted under 
the direction and control of DIS by the appropriate military department 
investigative organization. Only postadjudication investigations 
involving an overseas subject may be referred by the requester directly 
to the military department investigative organization having 
investigative responsibility in the overseas area concerned (see 
Appendix I) with a copy of the investigative request sent to DIS. In 
such cases, the military department investigative agency will complete 
the investigation, forward the completed report of investigation 
directly to DIS, with a copy to the requester.


<R05>
Sec. 154.10  Limitations and restrictions.

    (a) Authorized requesters and personnel security determination 
authorities. Personnel security investigations may be requested and 
personnel security clearances (including Special Access authorizations 
as indicated) granted only by those authorities designated in Sec. 
154.31 and Appendix E.
    (b) Limit investigations and access. The number of persons cleared 
for access to classified information shall be kept to a minimum, 
consistent with the requirements of operations. Special attention shall 
be given to eliminating unnecessary clearances and requests for 
personnel security investigations.
    (c) Collection of investigative data. To the greatest extent 
practicable, personal information relevant to security determinations 
shall be obtained directly from the subject of a personnel security 
investigation. Such additional information required to make the 
necessary personnel security determination shall be obtained as 
appropriate from knowledgeable personal sources, particularly the 
subject's peers, and through checks of relevant records including 
school, employment, credit, medical, and law enforcement records.
    (d) Privacy Act notification. Whenever personal information is 
solicited from an individual preparatory to the initiation of a 
personnel security investigation, the individual must be informed of--
    (1) The authority (statute or Executive order that authorized 
solicitation);
    (2) The principal purpose or purposes for which the information is 
to be used;
    (3) The routine uses to be made of the information;
    (4) Whether furnishing such information is mandatory or voluntary;
    (5) The effect on the individual, if any, of not providing the 
information and

[[Page 643]]

    (6) That subsequent use of the data may be employed as part of an 
aperiodic, random process to screen and evaluate continued eligibility 
for access to classified information.
    (e) Restrictions on investigators. Investigation shall be carried 
out insofar as possible to collect only as much information as is 
relevant and necessary for a proper personnel security determination. 
Questions concerning personal and domestic affairs, national origin, 
financial matters, and the status of physical health thus should be 
avoided unless the question is relevant to the criteria of Sec. 154.7. 
Similarly, the probing of a person's thoughts or beliefs and questions 
about conduct that have no personnel security implications are 
unwarranted. When conducting investigations under the provisions of this 
part, investigators shall:
    (1) Investigate only cases or persons assigned within their official 
duties.
    (2) Interview sources only where the interview can take place in 
reasonably private surroundings.
    (3) Always present credentials and inform sources of the reasons for 
the investigation. Inform sources of the subject's accessibility to the 
information to be provided and to the identity of the sources providing 
the information. Restrictions on investigators relating to Privacy Act 
advisements to subjects of personnel security investigations are 
outlined in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (4) Furnish only necessary identity data to a source, and refrain 
from asking questions in such a manner as to indicate that the 
investigator is in possession of derogatory information concerning the 
subject of the investigation.
    (5) Refrain from using, under any circumstances, covert or 
surreptitious investigative methods, devices, or techniques including 
mail covers, physical or photographic surveillance, voice analyzers, 
inspection of trash, paid informants, wiretap, or eavesdropping devices.
    (6) Refrain from accepting any case in which the investigator knows 
of circumstances that might adversely affect his fairness, impartiality, 
or objectivity.
    (7) Refrain, under any circumstances, from conducting physical 
searches of the subject or his property.
    (8) Refrain from attempting to evaluate material contained in 
medical files. Medical files shall be evaluated for personnel security 
program purposes only by such personnel as are designated by DoD medical 
authorities. However, review and collection of medical record 
information may be accomplished by authorized investigative personnel.
    (f) Polygraph restrictions. The polygraph may be used as a personnel 
security screening measure only in those limited instances authorized by 
the Secretary of Defense in DoD Directive 5210.48.\1\

         Subpart C_Personnel Security Investigative Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 154.13  Sensitive positions.

    (a) Designation of sensitive positions. Certain civilian positions 
within the Department of Defense entail duties of such a sensitive 
nature, including access to classified information, that the misconduct, 
malfeasance, or nonfeasance of an incumbent in any such position could 
result in an unacceptably adverse impact upon the national security. 
These positions are referred to in this part as sensitive positions. It 
is vital to the national security that great care be exercised in the 
selection of individuals to fill such positions. Similarly, it is 
important that only positions which truly meet one or more of the 
criteria set forth in paragraph (b) of this section be designated as 
sensitive.
    (b) Criteria for security designation of positions. Each civilian 
position within the Department of Defense shall be categorized, with 
respect to security sensitivity, as either nonsensitive, noncritical-
sensitive, or critical-sensitive.
    (1) The criteria to be applied in designating a position as 
sensitive are:
    (i) Critical-sensitive.
    (A) Access to Top Secret information.
    (B) Development or approval of plans, policies, or programs that 
affect the overall operations of the Department of Defense or of a DoD 
Component.

[[Page 644]]

    (C) Development or approval of war plans, plans or particulars of 
future major or special operations of war, or critical and extremely 
important items of war.
    (D) Investigative and certain investigative support duties, the 
issuance of personnel security clearances or access authorizations, or 
the making of personnel security determinations.
    (E) Fiduciary, public contact, or other duties demanding the highest 
degree of public trust.
    (F) Duties falling under Special Access programs.
    (G) Category I automated data processing (ADP) positions.
    (H) Any other position so designated by the head of the Component or 
designee.
    (ii) Noncritical-sensitive.
    (A) Access to Secret or Confidential information.
    (B) Security police/provost marshal-type duties involving the 
enforcement of law and security duties involving the protection and 
safeguarding of DoD personnel and property.
    (C) Category II automated data processing positions.
    (D) Duties involving education and orientation of DoD personnel.
    (E) Duties involving the design, operation, or maintenance of 
intrusion detection systems deployed to safeguard DoD personnel and 
property.
    (F) Any other position so designated by the head of the Component or 
designee.
    (2) All other positions shall be designated as nonsensitive.
    (c) Authority to designate sensitive positions. The authority to 
designate sensitive positions is limited to those authorities designated 
in paragraph G, Appendix E. These authorities shall designate each 
position within their jurisdiction as to its security sensitivity and 
maintain these designations current vis-a-vis the specific duties of 
each position.
    (d) Limitation of sensitive positions. It is the responsibility of 
those authorities authorized to designate sensitive positions to insure 
that only those positions are designated as sensitive that meet the 
criteria of paragraph (b) and (c) of this section that the designation 
of sensitive positions is held to a minimum consistent with mission 
requirements. Designating authorities shall maintain an accounting of 
the number of sensitive positions by category, i.e., critical or non-
critical sensitive. Such information will be included in annual report 
required in subpart K.
    (e) Billet control system for Top Secret. (1) To standardize and 
control the issuance of Top Secret clearances within the Department of 
Defense, a specific designated billet must be established and maintained 
for all DoD military and civilian positions requiring access to Top 
Secret information. Only persons occupying these billet positions will 
be authorized a Top Secret clearance. If an individual departs from a 
Top Secret billet to a billet/position involving a lower level 
clearance, the Top Secret clearance will be administratively rescinded. 
This Top Secret billet requirement is in addition to the existing billet 
structure maintained for SCI access.
    (2) Each request to DIS for a BI or SBI that involves access to Top 
Secret or SCI information will require inclusion of the appropriate 
billet reference, on the request for investigation. Each Component head 
should in corporate, to the extent feasible, the Top Secret billet 
structure into the component Manpower Unit Manning Document. Such a 
procedure should minimize the time and effort required to maintain such 
a billet structure.
    (3) A report on the number of established Top Secret billets will be 
submitted each year to the DUSD(P) as part of the annual clearance 
report referred to in subpart K.


<R05>
Sec. 154.14  Civilian employment.

    (a) General. The appointment of each civilian employee in any DoD 
Component is subject to investigation, except for reappointment when the 
break in employment is less than 12 months. The type of investigation 
required is set forth in this section according to position sensitivity.
    (b) Nonsensitive positions. In accordance with the OPM Federal 
Personnel Manual, a NACI shall be requested not later than 3 working 
days after a person is appointed to a nonsensitive position. Although 
there is normally no investigation requirement for per diem,

[[Page 645]]

intermittent, temporary or seasonal employees in nonsensitive positions 
provided such employment does not exceed an aggregate of 120 days in 
either a single continuous or series of appointments, a NAC may be 
requested of DIS where deemed appropriate by the employing activity.
    (c) Noncritical-sensitive positions. (1) An NACI shall be requested 
and the NAC portion favorably completed before a person is appointed to 
a noncritical-sensitive position (for exceptions see paragraph (e) (1) 
and (2) of this section). An ENTNAC, NAC or DNACI conducted during 
military or contractor employment may also be used for appointment 
provided a NACI has been requested from OPM and there is no more than 12 
months break in service since completion of the investigation.
    (2) Seasonal employees (including summer hires) normally do not 
require access to classified information. For those requiring access to 
classified information the appropriate investigation is required. The 
request for the NAC (or NACI) should be submitted to DIS by entering 
``SH'' (summer hire) in red letters approximately one inch high on the 
DD Form 398-2, Personnel Security Questionnaire (National Agency 
Checklist). Additionally, to ensure expedited processing by DIS, summer 
hire requests should be assembled and forwarded to DIS in bundles, when 
appropriate.
    (d) Critical-sensitive positions. A BI shall be favorably completed 
prior to appointment to critical-sensitive positions (for exceptions see 
paragraph (e) (1) and (2) of this section. Certain critical-sensitive 
positions require a preappointment SBI in accordance with Sec. 154.17. 
Preappointment BIs and SBIs will be conducted by DIS.
    (e) Exceptions--(1) Noncritical-sensitive. In an emergency, a 
noncritical-sensitive position may be occupied pending the completion of 
the NACI if the head of the requesting organization finds that the delay 
in appointment would be harmful to the national security and such 
finding is reduced to writing and made part of the record. In such 
instances, the position may be filled only after the NACI has been 
requested.
    (2) Critical-sensitive. In an emergency, a critical-sensitive 
position may be occupied pending completion of the BI (or SBI, as 
appropriate) if the head of the requesting organization finds that the 
delay in appointment would be harmful to the national security and such 
finding is reduced to writing and made a part of the record. In such 
instances, the position may be filled only when the NAC portion of the 
BI (or SBI) or a previous valid NACI, NAC or ENTNAC has been completed 
and favorably adjudicated.
    (f) Mobilization of DoD civilian retirees. The requirements 
contained in paragraph (a) of this section, regarding the type of 
investigation required by position sensitivity for DoD civilian retirees 
temporary appointment when the break in employment is greater than 12 
months, should either be expedited or waived for the purposes of 
mobilizing selected reemployed annuitants under the provisions of title 
5, United States Code, depending upon the degree of sensitivity of the 
position to which assigned. Particular priority should be afforded to 
newly assigned personnel assigned to the defense intelligence and 
security agencies with respect to granting security clearances in an 
expeditious manner under paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 154.15  Military appointment, enlistment, and induction.

    (a) General. The appointment, enlistment, and induction of each 
member of the Armed Forces or their Reserve Components shall be subject 
to the favorable completion of a personnel security investigation. The 
types of investigation required are set forth in this section.
    (b) Entrance investigation. (1) An ENTNAC shall be conducted on each 
enlisted member of the Armed Forces at the time of initial entry into 
the service. A DNACI shall be conducted on each commissioned officer, 
except as permitted by paragraph (d) of this section, warrant officer, 
cadet, midshipman, and Reserve Officers Training Candidate, at the time 
of appointment. A full NAC shall be conducted upon reentry of any of the 
above when there has been a break in service greater than 12 months.

[[Page 646]]

    (2) If an officer or warrant officer candidate has been the subject 
of a favorable NAC or ENTNAC and there has not been a break in service 
of more than 12 months, a new NAC is not authorized. This includes ROTC 
graduates who delay entry onto active duty pending completion of their 
studies.
    (3) All derogatory information revealed during the enlistment or 
appointment process that results in a moral waiver will be fully 
explained on a written summary attached to the DD Form 398-2.
    (c) Reserve Components and National Guard. Reserve Component and 
National Guard personnel not on active duty are subject to the 
investigative requirements of this section.
    (d) Exceptions for certain commissioned officers of Reserve 
Components. The requirements for entrance investigation shall be rigidly 
adhered to except as follows. Health professionals, chaplains, and 
attorneys may be commissioned in the Reserve Components prior to 
completion of a DNACI provided that:
    (1) A DNACI is initiated at the time an application for a commission 
is received; and
    (2) The applying health professional, chaplain, or attorney agrees 
in writing that, if the results of the investigation are unfavorable, he 
or she will be subject to discharge if found to be ineligible to hold a 
commission. Under this exception, commissions in Reserve Components 
other than the National Guard may be tendered to immigrant alien health 
professionals, chaplains, and attorneys.
    (e) Mobilization of military retirees. The requirements contained in 
paragraph (c) of this section, regarding a full NAC upon reentry to 
active duty of any officer or enlisted regular/reserve military retiree 
or Individual Ready Reserve who has been separated from service for a 
period of greater than 12 months, should be waived for the purposes of 
partial or full mobilization under provisions of title 10, (title 14, 
pertaining to the U.S. Coast Guard as an element of the Navy) U.S. Code, 
to include the period of prescribed service refresher training. 
Particular priority should be afforded to military retirees mobilized 
and assigned to the defense intelligence and security agencies 
communities.


<R05>
Sec. 154.16  Security clearance.

    (a) General. (1) The authorities designated in paragraph A, Appendix 
E are the only authorities authorized to grant, deny or revoke DoD 
personnel security clearances. The granting of such clearances shall be 
limited to only those persons who require access to classified 
information for mission accomplishment.
    (2) Military, DoD civilian, and contractor personnel who are 
employed by or serving in a consultant capacity to the DoD, may be 
considered for access to classified information only when such access is 
required in connection with official duties. Such individuals may be 
granted either a final or interim personnel security clearance provided 
the investigative requirements set forth below are complied with, and 
provided further that all available information has been adjudicated and 
a finding made that such clearance would be clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security.
    (b) Investigative requirements for clearance--(1) Top Secret. (i) 
Final Clearance:
    (A) BI.
    (B) Established billet per Sec. 154.13(e) (1) through (3) (except 
contractors).
    (ii) Interim Clearance:
    (A) Favorable NAC, ENTNAC, DNACI, or NACI completed
    (B) Favorable review of DD Form 398/SF-86/SF-171/DD Form 49

    (2) Secret. (i) Final Clearance:
    (A) DNACI: Military (except first-term enlistees) and contractor 
employees
    (B) NACI: Civilian employees
    (C) ENTNAC: First-term enlistees
    (ii) Interim Clearance:
    (A) When a valid need to access Secret information is established, 
an interim Secret clearance may be issued

[[Page 647]]

in every case, provided that the steps outlined in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) 
(B) through (E) of this section have been complied with.
    (B) Favorable review of DD Form 398-2/SF-85/SF-171/DD Form 48.
    (C) NACI, DNACI, or ENTNAC initiated.
    (D) Favorable review of local personnel, base military police,

civilian personnel.
    (3) Confidential. (i) Final Clearance:
    (A) NAC or ENTNAC: Military and contractor employees (except for 
Philippine national members of the United States Navy on whom a BI shall 
be favorably completed.)
    (B) NACI: Civilian employees (except for summer hires who may be 
granted a final clearance on the basis of a NAC).
    (ii) Interim Clearance:
    (A) Favorable review of DD Form 398-2/SF 85/SF 171/ DD Form 48.
    (B) NAC, ENTNAC or NACI initiated.
    (C) Favorable review of local personnel, base military police, 
medical, and security records as appropriate.
    (D) Provisions of Sec. 154.14(e) (1) and (2) have been complied 
with regarding civilian personnel.
    (4) Validity of previously granted clearances. Clearances granted 
under less stringent investigative requirements retain their validity; 
however, if a higher degree of clearance is required, investigative 
requirements of this directive will be followed.
    (c) Access to classified information by non-U.S. citizens. (1) Only 
U.S. citizens are eligible for a security clearance. Therefore, every 
effort shall be made to ensure that non-United States citizens are not 
employed in duties that may require access to classified information. 
However, when there are compelling reasons to grant access to classified 
information to an immigrant alien or a foreign national in furtherance 
of the mission of the Department of Defense, such individuals may be 
granted a ``Limited Access Authorization'' (LAA) under the following 
conditions:
    (i) LAAs will be limited to Secret and Confidential level only; LAAs 
for Top Secret are prohibited.
    (ii) Access to classified information is not inconsistent with that 
determined releasable by designated disclosure authorities, in 
accordance with DoD Directive 5230.11\1\ to the country of which the 
individual is a citizen.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 154.2(c).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (iii) Access to classified information must be limited to 
information relating to a specific program or project.
    (iv) Favorable completion of an BI (scoped for 10 years); where the 
full investigative coverage cannot be completed, a counterintelligence 
scope polygraph examination will be required in accordance with the 
provisions of DoD Directive 5210.48.
    (v) Security clearances previously issued to immigrant aliens will 
be reissued as LAAs.
    (vi) The Limited Access Authorization determination shall be made 
only by an authority designated in paragraph B, Appendix E.
    (vii) LAAs issued by the Unified and Specified Commands shall be 
reported to the central adjudicative facility of the appropriate 
military department in accordance with the assigned responsibilities in 
DoD Directive 5100.3\1\ for inclusion in the Defense Central Index of 
Investigation (DCII).
    (2) In each case of granting a Limited Access Authorization, a 
record shall be maintained as to:
    (i) The identity (including current citizenship) of the individual 
to whom the Limited Access Authorization is granted, to include name and 
date and place of birth;
    (ii) Date and type of most recent investigation to include the 
identity of the investigating agency;
    (iii) The nature of the specific program material(s) to which access 
is authorized (delineated as precisely as possible);
    (iv) The classification level to which access is authorized; and
    (v) The compelling reasons for granting access to the materials 
cited in (iii).
    (vi) Status of the individual (i.e., immigrant alien or foreign 
national).

[[Page 648]]

    (3) Individuals granted LAAs under the foregoing provisions shall be 
the subject of a 5-year periodic reinvestigation as set forth in 
paragraph 5, Appendix A.
    (4) Foreign nationals who are LAA candidates must agree to submit to 
a counterintelligence-scope polygraph examination prior to being granted 
access in accordance with DoD Directive 5210.48.
    (5) If geographical and political situations prevent the full 
completion of the BI (and/or counterintelligence-scope polygraph) 
issuance of an LAA shall not be authorized; exceptions to the policy may 
only be authorized by the DUSD(P).
    (6) A report on all LAAs in effect, including the data required in 
paragraphs (d)(2) (i) through (vi) of this section shall be furnished to 
the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy within 60 days after 
the end of each fiscal year. (See Sec. 154.77).
    (d) Access by persons outside the Executive Branch. (1) Access to 
classified information by persons outside the Executive Branch shall be 
accomplished in accordance with 32 CFR part 159. The investigative 
requirement shall be the same as for the appropriate level of security 
clearance, except as indicated below.
    (2) Members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives do not 
require personnel security clearances. They may be granted access to DoD 
classified information which relates to matters under the jurisdiction 
of the respective Committees to which they are assigned and is needed to 
perform their duties in connection with such assignments.
    (3) Congressional staff members requiring access to DoD classified 
information shall be processed for a security clearance in accordance 
with 32 CFR part 353 and the provisions of this part. The Director, 
Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) will initiate the required 
investigation (initial or reinvestigation) to DIS, adjudicate the 
results and grant, deny or revoke the security clearance, as 
appropriate. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Legislative Affairs) 
will be notified by WHS of the completed clearance action.
    (4) State governors do not require personnel security clearances. 
They may be granted access to specifically designated classified 
information, on a ``need-to-know'' basis, based upon affirmation by the 
Secretary of Defense or the head of a DoD Component or single designee, 
that access, under the circumstances, serves the national interest. 
Staff personnel of a governor's office requiring access to classified 
information shall be investigated and cleared in accordance with the 
prescribed procedures of this part when the head of a DoD Component, or 
single designee, affirms that such clearance serves the national 
interest. Access shall also be limited to specifically designated 
classified information on a ``need-to-know'' basis.
    (5) Members of the U.S. Supreme Court, the Federal judiciary and the 
Supreme Courts of the individual States do not require personnel 
security clearances. They may be granted access to DoD classified 
information to the extent necessary to adjudicate cases being heard 
before these individual courts.
    (6) Attorneys representing DoD military, civilian or contractor 
personnel, requiring access to DoD classified information to properly 
represent their clients, shall normally be investigated by DIS and 
cleared in accordance with the prescribed procedures in paragraph (b) of 
this section. This shall be done upon certification of the General 
Counsel of the DoD Component involved in the litigation that access to 
specified classified information, on the part of the attorney concerned, 
is necessary to adequately represent his or her client. In exceptional 
instances, when the exigencies of a given situation do not permit timely 
compliance with the provisions of Sec. 154.16(b), access may be granted 
with the written approval of an authority designated in Appendix E 
provided that as a minimum: a favorable name check of the FBI and the 
DCII has been completed, and a DoD Non-Disclosure Agreement has been 
executed. In post-indictment cases, after a judge has invoked the 
security procedures of the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) 
the Department of Justice may elect to conduct the necessary background 
investigation

[[Page 649]]

and issue the required security clearance, in coordination with the 
affected DoD Component.
    (e) Restrictions on issuance of personnel security clearances. 
Personnel security clearances must be kept to the absolute minimum 
necessary to meet mission requirements. Personnel security clearances 
shall not be issued:
    (1) To persons in nonsensitive positions.
    (2) To persons whose regular duties do not require authorized access 
to classified information.
    (3) For ease of movement of persons within a restricted, controlled, 
or industrial area, whose duties do not require access to classified 
information.
    (4) To persons who may only have inadvertent access to sensitive 
information or areas, such as guards, emergency service personnel, 
firemen, doctors, nurses, police, ambulance drivers, or similar 
personnel.
    (5) To persons working in shipyards whose duties do not require 
access to classified information.
    (6) To persons who can be prevented from accessing classified 
information by being escorted by cleared personnel.
    (7) To food service personnel, vendors and similar commercial sales 
or service personnel whose duties do not require access to classified 
information.
    (8) To maintenance or cleaning personnel who may only have 
inadvertent access to classified information unless such access cannot 
be reasonably prevented.
    (9) To persons who perform maintenance on office equipment, 
computers, typewriters, and similar equipment who can be denied 
classified access by physical security measures.
    (10) To perimeter security personnel who have no access to 
classified information.
    (11) To drivers, chauffeurs and food service personnel.
    (f) Dual citizenship. Persons claiming both U.S. and foreign 
citizenship shall be processed under Sec. 154.16(b) and adjudicated in 
accordance with the ``Foreign Preference'' standard in Appendix I.
    (g) One-time access. Circumstances may arise where an urgent 
operational or contractual exigency exists for cleared DoD personnel to 
have one-time or short duration access to classified information at a 
higher level than is authorized by the existing security clearance. In 
many instances, the processing time required to upgrade the clearance 
would preclude timely access to the information. In such situations, and 
only for compelling reasons in furtherance of the DoD mission, an 
authority referred to in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, may grant 
higher level access on a temporary basis subject to the terms and 
conditions prescribed below. This special authority may be revoked for 
abuse, inadequate record keeping, or inadequate security oversight. 
These procedures do not apply when circumstances exist which would 
permit the routine processing of an individual for the higher level 
clearance. Procedures and conditions for effecting emergency one-time 
access to the next higher classification level are as follows:
    (1) Authorization for such one-time access shall be granted by a 
flag or general officer, a general court-martial convening authority or 
equivalent Senior Executive Service member, after coordination with 
appropriate security officials.
    (2) The recipient of the one-time access authorization must be a 
U.S. citizen, possess a current DoD security clearance, and the access 
required shall be limited to classified information one level higher 
than the current clearance.
    (3) Such access, once granted, shall be cancelled promptly when no 
longer required, at the conclusion of the authorized period of access, 
or upon notification from the granting authority.
    (4) The employee to be afforded the higher level access shall have 
been continuously employed by a DoD Component or a cleared DoD 
contractor for the preceding 24-month period. Higher level access is not 
authorized for part-time employees.
    (5) Pertinent local records concerning the employee concerned shall 
be reviewed with favorable results.
    (6) Whenever possible, access shall be confined to a single instance 
or at most, a few occasions. The approval for access shall automatically 
expire 30

[[Page 650]]

calendar days from date access commenced. If the need for access is 
expected to continue for a period in excess of 30 days, written approval 
of the granting authority is required. At such time as it is determined 
that the need for access is expected to extend beyond 90 days, the 
individual concerned shall be promptly processed for the level of 
clearance required. When extended access has been approved, such access 
shall be cancelled at or before 90 days from original date of access.
    (7) Access at the higher level shall be limited to information under 
the control and custody of the authorizing official and shall be 
afforded under the general supervision of a properly cleared employee. 
The employee charged with providing such supervision shall be 
responsible for:
    (i) Recording the higher-level information actually revealed,
    (ii) The date(s) such access is afforded; and
    (iii) The daily retrieval of the material accessed.
    (8) Access at the next higher level shall not be authorized for 
COMSEC, SCI, NATO, or foreign government information.
    (9) The exercise of this provision shall be used sparingly and 
repeat use within any 12 month period on behalf of the same individual 
is prohibited. The approving authority shall maintain a record 
containing the following data with respect to each such access approved:
    (i) The name, and SSN of the employee afforded higher level access.
    (ii) The level of access authorized.
    (iii) Justification for the access, to include an explanation of the 
compelling reason to grant the higher level access and specifically how 
the DoD mission would be furthered.
    (iv) An unclassified description of the specific information to 
which access was authorized and the duration of access along with the 
date(s) access was afforded.
    (v) A listing of the local records reviewed and a statement that no 
significant adverse information concerning the employee is known to 
exist.
    (vi) The approving authority's signature certifying (h)(9) (i) 
through (v) of this section.
    (vii) Copies of any pertinent briefing/debriefings administered to 
the employee.
    (h) Access by retired flag/general officers. (1) Upon determination 
by an active duty flag/general officer that there are compelling 
reasons, in furtherance of the Department of Defense mission, to grant a 
retired flag/general officer access to classified information in 
connection with a specific DoD program or mission, for a period not 
greater than 90 days, the investigative requirements of this part may be 
waived. The access shall be limited to classified information at a level 
commensurate with the security clearance held at the time of 
retirement--not including access to SCI.
    (2) The flag/general officer approving issuance of the clearance 
shall, provide the appropriate DoD Component central clearance facility 
a written record to be incorporated into the DCII detailing:
    (i) Full identifying data pertaining to the cleared subject;
    (ii) The classification of the information to which access was 
authorized.
    (3) Such access may be granted only after the compelling reason and 
the specific aspect of the DoD mission which is served by granting such 
access has been detailed and under the condition that the classified 
materials involved are not removed from the confines of a government 
installation or other area approved for storage of DoD classified 
information.

Sec. 154.17  Special access programs.

    (a) General. It is the policy of the Department of Defense to 
establish, to the extent possible, uniform and consistent personnel 
security investigative requirements. Accordingly, investigations 
exceeding established requirements are authorized only when mandated by 
statute, national regulations, or international agreement. In this 
connection, there are certain Special Access programs originating at the 
national or international level that require personnel security 
investigations and procedures of a special nature. These programs and 
the special investigative requirements imposed by them

[[Page 651]]

are described in this section. A Special Access program is any program 
designed to control access, distribution, and protection of particularly 
sensitive information established pursuant to section 4-2 of Executive 
Order 12356 and prior Orders. Title 32 CFR part 159 governs the 
establishment of Departmental Special Access Programs.
    (b) Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). (1) The investigative 
requirements for access to SCI is an SBI (See paragraph 4, Appendix A) 
including a NAC on the individual's spouse or cohabitant. When 
conditions indicate, additional investigation shall be conducted on the 
spouse of the individual and members of the immediate family (or other 
persons to whom the individual is bound by affection or obligation) to 
the extent necessary to permit a determination by the adjudication 
agency that the Personnel Security standards of DCID 1/14 are met.
    (2) A previous investigation conducted within the past five years 
which substantially meets the investigative requirements prescribed by 
this section may serve as a basis for granting access approval provided 
that there has been no break in the individual's military service, DoD 
civilian employment, or access to classified information under the 
Industrial Security Program greater than 12 months. The individual shall 
submit one copy of an updated PSQ covering the period since the 
completion of the last SBI.
    (c) Single Integrated Operation Plan--Extremely Sensitive 
Information (SIOP-ESI). The investigative requirement for access to 
SIOP-ESI is an SBI, including a NAC on the spouse and the individual's 
immediate family who are 18 years of age or over and who are U.S. 
citizens other than by birth or who are resident aliens.
    (d) Presidential support activities. (1) DoD Directive 5210.55 \1\ 
prescribes the policies and procedures for the nomination, screening, 
selection, and continued evaluation of DoD military and civilian 
personnel and contractor employees assigned to or utilized in 
Presidential Support activities. The type of investigation of 
individuals assigned to Presidential Support activities varies according 
to whether the person investigated qualifies for Category One or 
Category Two as indicated below:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 154.2(c).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) Category one. (A) Personnel assigned on a permanent or full-time 
basis to duties in direct support of the President (including the office 
staff of the Director, White House Military Office, and all individuals 
under his control):
    (1) Presidential aircrew and associated maintenance and security 
personnel.
    (2) Personnel assigned to the White House communications activities 
and the Presidential retreat.
    (3) White House transportation personnel.
    (4) Presidential mess attendants and medical personnel.
    (5) Other individuals filling administrative positions at the White 
House.
    (B) Personnel assigned on a temporary or part-time basis to duties 
supporting the President:
    (1) Military Social Aides.
    (2) Selected security, transportation, flight-line safety, and 
baggage personnel.
    (3) Others with similar duties.
    (C) Personnel assigned to the Office of the Military Aide to the 
Vice President.
    (ii) Category two. (A) Personnel assigned to honor guards, 
ceremonial units, and military bands who perform at Presidential 
functions and facilities.
    (B) Employees of contractors who provide services or contractors 
employees who require unescorted access to Presidential Support areas, 
activities, or equipment--including maintenance of the Presidential 
retreat, communications, and aircraft.
    (C) Individuals in designated units requiring a lesser degree of 
access to the President or Presidential Support activities.
    (2) Personnel nominated for Category One duties must have been the 
subject of an SBI, including a NAC on the spouse and all members of the 
individual's immediate family of 18 years of age or over who are U.S. 
citizens other than by birth or who are resident aliens. The SBI must 
have been completed within the 12 months preceding

[[Page 652]]

selection for Presidential Support duties. If such an individual marries 
subsequent to the completion of the SBI, the required spouse check shall 
be made at that time.
    (3) Personnel nominated for Category Two duties must have been the 
subject of a BI, including a NAC on the spouse and all members of the 
individual's immediate family of 18 years of age or over who are U.S. 
citizens other than by birth or who are resident aliens. The BI must 
have been completed within the 12 months preceding selection for 
Presidential Support duties. It should be noted that duties (separate 
and distinct from their Presidential Support responsibilities) of some 
Category Two personnel may make it necessary for them to have special 
access clearances which require an SBI.
    (4) The U.S. citizenship of foreign-born immediate family members of 
all Presidential Support nominees must be verified by investigation.
    (5) A limited number of Category One personnel having especially 
sensitive duties have been designated by the Director, White House 
Military Office as ``Category A.'' These personnel shall be investigated 
under special scoping in accordance with the requirements of the 
Memorandum of Understanding between the Director, White House Military 
Office and the Special Assistant to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary 
of Defense, July 30, 1980.
    (e) Nuclear Weapon Personnel Reliability Program (PRP). (1) DoD 
Directive 5210.42 \1\ sets forth the standards of individual reliability 
required for personnel performing duties associated with nuclear weapons 
and nuclear components. The investigative requirement for personnel 
performing such duties is:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 154.2(c).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) Critical position: BI. In the event that it becomes necessary to 
consider an individual for a critical position and the required BI has 
not been completed, interim certification may be made under carefully 
controlled conditions as set forth below.
    (A) The individual has had a favorable DNACI, NAC (or ENTNAC) within 
the past 5 years without a break in service or employment in excess of 1 
year.
    (B) The BI has been requested.
    (C) All other requirements of the PRP screening process have been 
fulfilled.
    (D) The individual is identified to supervisory personnel as being 
certified on an interim basis.
    (E) The individual is not used in a two-man team with another such 
individual.
    (F) Justification of the need for interim certification is 
documented by the certifying official.
    (G) Should the BI not be completed within 150 days from the date of 
the request, the certifying official shall query the Component clearance 
authority, who shall ascertain from DIS the status of the investigation. 
On the basis of such information, the certifying official shall 
determine whether to continue or to withdraw the interim certification.
    (ii) Controlled position: DNACI/NACI. (A) An ENTNAC completed for 
the purpose of first term enlistment or induction into the Armed Forces 
does not satisfy this requirement.
    (B) Interim certification is authorized for an individual who has 
not had a DNACI/NACI completed within the past 5 years, subject to the 
following conditions:
    (1) The individual has had a favorable ENTNAC/NAC, or higher 
investigation, that is more than 5 years old and has not had a break in 
service or employment in excess of 1 year.
    (2) A DNACI/NACI has been requested at the time of interim 
certification.
    (3) All other requirements of the PRP screening process have been 
fulfilled.
    (4) Should the DNACI/NACI not be completed within 90 days from the 
date of the request, the procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(G) 
of this section for ascertaining the delay of the investigation in the 
case of a critical position shall apply.
    (iii) Additional requirements apply. (A) The investigation upon 
which certification is based must have been completed within the last 5 
years from the date of initial assignment to a PRP position and there 
must not have been a break in service or employment in excess of 1 year 
between completion of the investigation and initial assignment.

[[Page 653]]

    (B) In those cases in which the investigation was completed more 
than 5 years prior to initial assignment or in which there has been a 
break in service or employment in excess of 1 year subsequent to 
completion of the investigation, a reinvestigation is required.
    (C) Subsequent to initial assignment to the PRP, reinvestigation is 
not required so long as the individual remains in the PRP.
    (D) A medical evaluation of the individual as set forth in DoD 
Directive 5210.42.
    (E) Review of the individual's personnel file and other official 
records and information locally available concerning behavior or conduct 
which is relevant to PRP standards.
    (F) A personal interview with the individual for the purpose of 
informing him of the significance of the assignment, reliability 
standards, the need for reliable performance, and of ascertaining his 
attitude with respect to the PRP.
    (G) Service in the Army, Navy and Air Force Reserve does not 
constitute active service for PRP purposes.
    (f) Access to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) classified 
information. (1) Personnel assigned to a NATO staff position requiring 
access to NATO Cosmic (Top Secret), Secret, or Confidential information 
shall have been the subject of a favorably adjudicated BI (10 year 
scope), DNACI/NACI or NAC/ENTNAC, current within five years prior to the 
assignment, in accordance with USSAN Instruction 1-69 and Sec. 
154.19(f).
    (2) Personnel not assigned to a NATO staff position, but requiring 
access to NATO Cosmic, Secret or Confidential information in the normal 
course of their duties, must possess the equivalent final U.S. security 
clearance based upon the appropriate personnel security investigation 
(Appendix A) required by Sec. Sec. 154.16(b) and 154.19(j) of this 
part.
    (g) Other special access programs. Special investigative 
requirements for Special Access programs not provided for in this 
paragraph may not be established without the written approval of the 
Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.


<R05>
Sec. 154.18  Certain positions not necessarily requiring access to 
classified information.

    (a) General. DoD Directive 5200.8 \1\ outlines the authority of 
military commanders under the Internal Security Act of 1950 to issue 
orders and regulations for the protection of property or places under 
their command. Essential to carrying out this responsibility is a 
commander's need to protect the command against the action of 
untrustworthy persons. Normally, the investigative requirements 
prescribed in this part should suffice to enable a commander to 
determine the trustworthiness of individuals whose duties require access 
to classified information or appointment to positions that are sensitive 
and do not involve such access. However, there are certain categories of 
positions or duties which, although not requiring access to classified 
information, if performed by untrustworthy persons, could enable them to 
jeopardize the security of the command or otherwise endanger the 
national security. The investigative requirements for such positions or 
duties are detailed in this section.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 154.2(c).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Access to restricted areas, sensitive information or equipment 
not involving access to classified information. (1) Access to restricted 
areas, sensitive information or equipment by DoD military, civilian or 
contractor personnel shall be limited to those individuals who have been 
determined trustworthy as a result of the favorable completion of a NAC 
(or ENTNAC) or who are under the escort of appropriately cleared 
personnel. Where escorting such persons is not feasible, a NAC shall be 
conducted and favorably reviewed by the appropriate component agency or 
activity prior to permitting such access. DoD Components shall not 
request, and shall not direct or permit their contractors to request, 
security clearances to permit access to areas when access to classified 
information is not required in the normal course of duties or which 
should be precluded by appropriate security measures. In determining 
trustworthiness under this paragraph, the provisions of Sec. 154.7 and 
Appendix H will be utilized.

[[Page 654]]

    (2) In meeting the requirements of this paragraph, approval shall be 
obtained from one of the authorities designated in paragraph A, Appendix 
E of this part, for authority to request NACs on DoD military, civilian 
or contractor employees. A justification shall accompany each request 
which shall detail the reasons why escorted access would not better 
serve the national security. Requests for investigative requirements 
beyond a NAC shall be forwarded to the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense 
for Policy for approval.
    (3) NAC requests shall--
    (i) Be forwarded to DIS in accordance with the provisions of 
paragraph B, Appendix C,
    (ii) Contain a reference to this paragraph on the DD Form 398-2, and
    (iii) List the authority in Appendix E who approved the request.
    (4) Determinations to deny access under the provisions of this 
paragraph must not be exercised in an arbitrary, capricious, or 
discriminatory manner and shall be the responsibility of the military or 
installation commander as provided for in DoD Directive 5200.8.
    (c) Nonappropriated fund employees. Each Nonappropriated Fund 
employee who is employed in a position of trust as designated by an 
official authorized in paragraph H, Appendix E, shall have been the 
subject of a NAC completed no longer than 12 months prior to employment 
or a prior personnel security investigation with no break in Federal 
service or employment greater than 12 months in accordance with DoD 
Manual 1401.1-M. An individual who does not meet established suitability 
requirements may not be employed without prior approval of the 
authorizing official. Issuance of a Confidential or Secret clearance 
will be based on a DNACI or NACI in accordance with Sec. 154.16(b).
    (d) Customs inspectors. DoD employees appointed as customs 
inspectors, under waivers approved in accordance with DoD 5030.49-R 
shall have undergone a favorably adjudicated NAC completed within the 
past 5 years unless there has been a break in DoD employment greater 
than 1 year in which case a current NAC is required.
    (e) Red Cross/United Service Organizations personnel. A favorably 
adjudicated NAC shall be accomplished on Red Cross or United Service 
Organizations personnel as prerequisite for assignment with the Armed 
Forces overseas (32 CFR part 253).
    (f) Officials authorized to issue security clearances. Any person 
authorized to adjudicate personnel security clearances shall have been 
the subject of a favorably adjudicated BI.
    (g) Personnel security clearance adjudication officials. Any person 
selected to serve with a board, committee, or other group responsible 
for adjudicating personnel security cases shall have been the subject of 
a favorably adjudicated BI.
    (h) Persons requiring DoD building passes. Pursuant to DoD Directive 
5210.46 \1\ each person determined by the designated authorities of the 
Components concerned as having an official need for access to DoD 
buildings in the National Capital Region shall be the subject of a 
favorably, adjudicated NAC prior to issuance of a DoD building pass. 
Conduct of a BI for this purpose is prohibited unless approved in 
advance by ODUSD(P).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 154.2(c).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) Foreign national employees overseas not requiring access to 
classified information. Foreign nationals employed by DoD organizations 
overseas, whose duties do not require access to classified information, 
shall be the subject of the following record checks, initiated by the 
appropriate military department investigative organization consistent 
with Sec. 154.9(e) prior to employment:
    (1) Host government law enforcement and security agency checks at 
the city, state (province), and national level, whenever permissible by 
the laws of the host government; and
    (2) DCII.
    (3) FBI-HQ/ID. (Where information exists regarding residence by the 
foreign national in the United States for one year or more since age 
18).
    (j) Special agents and investigative support personnel. Special 
agents and those noninvestigative personnel assigned to investigative 
agencies whose official duties require continuous access to complete 
investigative files and material require an SBI.

[[Page 655]]

    (k) Persons requiring access to chemical agents. Personnel whose 
duties involve access to or security of chemical agents shall be 
screened initially for suitability and reliability and shall be 
evaluated on a continuing basis at the supervisory level to ensure that 
they continue to meet the high standards required. At a minimum, all 
such personnel shall have had a favorably adjudicated NAC completed 
within the last 5 years prior to assignment in accordance with the 
provisions of DoD Directive 5210.65.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 154.2(c).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (l) Education and orientation personnel. Persons selected for duties 
in connection with programs involving the education and orientation of 
military personnel shall have been the subject of a favorably 
adjudicated NAC prior to such assignment. This does not include 
teachers/administrators associated with university extension courses 
conducted on military installations in the United States. Non-US 
citizens from a country listed in Appendix G shall be required to 
undergo a BI if they are employed in a position covered by this 
paragraph.
    (m) Contract guards. Any person performing contract guard functions 
shall have been the subject of a favorably adjudicated NAC prior to such 
assignment.
    (n) Transportation of arms, ammunition and explosives (AA&E). Any 
DoD military, civilian or contract employee (including commercial 
carrier) operating a vehicle or providing security to a vehicle 
transporting Category I, II or Confidential AA&E shall have been the 
subject of a favorably adjudicated NAC or ENTNAC.
    (o) Personnel occupying information systems positions designated 
ADP-I, ADP-II & ADP-III. DoD military, civilian personnel, consultants, 
and contractor personnel performing on unclassified automated 
information systems may be assigned to one of three position sensitivity 
designations (in accordance with Appendix J) and investigated as 
follows:

ADP-I: BI
ADP-II: DNACI/NACI
ADP-III: NAC/ENTNAC


Those personnel falling in the above categories who require access to 
classified information will, of course, be subject to the appropriate 
investigative scope contained in Sec. 154.16(b).
    (p) Others. Requests for approval to conduct an investigation on 
other personnel, not provided for in Sec. 154.18 (b) through (o) 
considered to fall within the general provisions of Sec. 154.18(a) 
shall be submitted, detailing the justification therefor, for approval 
to the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. Approval of such 
requests shall be contingent upon an assurance that appropriate review 
procedures exist and that adverse determinations will be made at no 
lower than major command level.


<R05>
Sec. 154.19  Reinvestigation.

    (a) General. DoD policy prohibits unauthorized and unnecessary 
investigations. There are, however, certain situations and requirements 
that necessitate reinvestigation of an individual who has already been 
investigated under the provisions of this part. It is the policy to 
limit reinvestigation of individuals to the scope contained in paragraph 
5, Appendix A to meet overall security requirements. Reinvestigation, 
generally, is authorized only as follows:
    (1) To prove or disprove an allegation relating to the criteria set 
forth in Sec. 154.7 of this part with respect to an individual holding 
a security clearance or assigned to a position that requires a 
trustworthiness determination;
    (2) To meet the periodic reinvestigation requirements of this part 
with respect to those security programs enumerated below; and
    (3) Upon individual request, to assess the current eligibility of 
individuals who did not receive favorable adjudicative action after an 
initial investigation, if a potential clearance need exists and there 
are reasonable indications that the factors upon which the adverse 
determination was made no longer exists.
    (b) Allegations related to disqualification. Whenever questionable 
behavior patterns develop, derogatory information is discovered, or 
inconsistencies arise related to the disqualification criteria outlined 
in Sec. 154.7 that could

[[Page 656]]

have an adverse impact on an individual's security status, a Special 
Investigative Inquiry (SII), psychiatric, drug or alcohol evaluation, as 
appropriate, may be requested to resolve all relevant issues in doubt. 
If it is essential that additional relevant personal data is required 
from the investigative subject, and the subject fails to furnish the 
required data, the subject's existing security clearance or assignment 
to sensitive duties shall be terminated in accordance with Sec. 
154.56(b).
    (c) Access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). Each 
individual having current access to SCI shall be the subject of a PR 
conducted on a 5-year recurring basis scoped as set forth in paragraph 
5, Appendix A.
    (d) Critical-sensitive positions. Each DoD civilian employee 
occupying a critical sensitive position shall be the subject of a PR 
conducted on a 5-year recurring basis scoped as set forth in paragraph 
5, Appendix A.
    (e) Presidential support duties. Each individual assigned 
Presidential Support duties shall be the subject of a PR conducted on a 
5-year recurring basis scoped as set forth in paragraph 5, Appendix A.
    (f) NATO staff. Each individual assigned to a NATO staff position 
requiring a COSMIC clearance shall be the subject of a PR conducted on a 
5-year recurring basis scoped as set forth in paragraph 5, Appendix A. 
Those assigned to a NATO staff position requiring a NATO SECRET 
clearance shall be the subject of a new NAC conducted on a 5-year 
recurring basis.
    (g) Extraordinarily sensitive duties. In extremely limited 
instances, extraordinary national security implications associated with 
certain SCI duties may require very special compartmentation and other 
special security measures. In such instances, a Component SOIC may, with 
the approval of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, 
request PR's at intervals of less than 5 years as outlined in paragraph 
5, Appendix A. Such requests shall include full justification and a 
recommendation as to the desired frequency. In reviewing such requests, 
the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy shall give due 
consideration to:
    (1) The potential damage that might result from the individual's 
defection or abduction.
    (2) The availability and probable effectiveness of means other than 
reinvestigation to evaluate factors concerning the individual's 
suitability for continued SCI access.
    (h) Foreign nationals employed by DoD organizations overseas. 
Foreign nationals employed by DoD organizations overseas who have been 
granted a ``Limited Access Authorization'' pursuant to Sec. 154.16(d) 
shall be the subject of a PR, as set forth in paragraph 5, Appendix A, 
conducted under the auspices of DIS by the appropriate military 
department or other U.S. Government investigative agency consistent with 
Sec. 154.9(e) and Appendix I of this part.
    (i) Persons accessing very sensitive information classified Secret. 
(1) Heads of DoD Components shall submit a request to the Deputy Under 
Secretary of Defense for Policy for approval to conduct periodic 
reinvestigations on persons holding Secret clearances who are exposed to 
very sensitive Secret information.
    (2) Generally, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy will 
only approve periodic reinvestigations of persons having access to 
Secret information if the unauthorized disclosure of the information in 
question could reasonably be expected to:
    (i) Jeopardize human life or safety.
    (ii) Result in the loss of unique or uniquely productive 
intelligence sources or methods vital to U.S. security.
    (iii) Compromise technologies, plans, or procedures vital to the 
strategic advantage of the United States.
    (3) Each individual accessing very sensitive Secret information who 
has been designated by an authority listed in paragraph A, Appendix E as 
requiring periodic reinvestigation, shall be the subject of a PR 
conducted on a 5-year recurring basis scoped as stated in paragraph 5, 
Appendix A.
    (j) Access to Top Secret information. Each individual having current 
access to Top Secret information shall be the subject of a PR conducted 
on a 5-year recurring basis scoped as outlined in paragraph 5, Appendix 
A.

[[Page 657]]

    (k) Personnel occupying computer positions designated ADP-1. All DoD 
military, civilians, consultants, and contractor personnel occupying 
computer positions designated ADP-I, shall be the subject of a PR 
conducted on a 5-year recurring basis as set forth in paragraph 5, 
Appendix A.


<R05>
Sec. 154.20  Authority to waive investigative requirements.

    Authorized officials. Only an official designated in paragraph G, 
Appendix E, is empowered to waive the investigative requirements for 
appointment to a sensitive position, assignment to sensitive duties or 
access to classified information pending completion of the investigation 
required by this section. Such waiver shall be based upon certification 
in writing by the designated official that such action is necessary to 
the accomplishment of a DoD mission. A minor investigative element that 
has not been met should not preclude favorable.

<R05>
Sec. 154.23  General.

    Previously conducted investigations and previously rendered 
personnel security determinations shall be accepted within DoD in 
accordance with the policy set forth below.


<R05>
Sec. 154.24  Prior investigations conducted by DoD investigative 
organizations.

    As long as there is no break in military service/civilian employment 
greater than 12 months, any previous personnel security investigation 
conducted by DoD investigative organizations that essentially is 
equivalent in scope to an investigation required by this part will be 
accepted without requesting additional investigation. There is no time 
limitation as to the acceptability of such investigations, subject to 
the provisions of Sec. Sec. 154.8(h) and 154.25(b) of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 154.25  Prior personnel security determinations made by DoD 
authorities.

    (a) Adjudicative determinations for appointment in sensitive 
positions, assignment to sensitive duties or access to classified 
information (including those pertaining to SCI) made by designated DoD 
authorities will be mutually and reciprocally accepted by all DoD 
Components without requiring additional investigation, unless there has 
been a break in the individual's military service/civilian employment of 
greater than 12 months or unless derogatory information that occurred 
subsequent to the last prior security determination becomes known. A 
check of the DCII should be conducted to accomplish this task.
    (b) Whenever a valid DoD security clearance or Special Access 
authorization (including one pertaining to SCI) is on record, Components 
shall not request DIS or other DoD investigative organizations to 
forward prior investigative files for review unless:
    (1) Significant derogatory information or investigation completed 
subsequent to the date of last clearance or Special Access 
authorization, is known to the requester; or
    (2) The individual concerned is being considered for a higher level 
clearance (e.g., Secret or Top Secret) or the individual does not have a 
Special Access authorization and is being considered for one; or
    (3) There has been a break in the individual's military service/
civilian employment of greater than 12 months subsequent to the issuance 
of a prior clearance.
    (4) The most recent SCI access authorization of the individual 
concerned was based on a waiver.
    (c) Requests for prior investigative files authorized by this part 
shall be made in writing, shall cite the specific justification for the 
request (i.e., upgrade of clearance, issue Special Access authorization, 
etc.), and shall include the date, level, and issuing organization of 
the individual's current or most recent security clearance or Special 
Access authorization.
    (d) All requests for non-DoD investigative files, authorized under 
the criteria prescribed by paragraphs (a), (b)

[[Page 658]]

(1), (2), (3), and (4) and (c) of this section shall be:
    (1) Submitted on DD Form 398-2 to DIS;
    (2) Annotated as a ``Single Agency Check'' of whichever agency or 
agency developed the investigative file or to obtain the check of a 
single national agency.
    (e) When further investigation is desired, in addition to an 
existing non-DoD investigative file, a DD Form 1879 will be submitted to 
DIS with the appropriate security forms attached. The submission of a 
Single Agency Check via DD Form 398-2 will be used to obtain an existing 
investigative file or check a single national agency.
    (f) Whenever a civilian or military member transfers from one DoD 
activity to another, the losing organization's security office is 
responsible for advising the gaining organization of any pending action 
to suspend, deny or revoke the individual's security clearance as well 
as any adverse information that may exist in security, personnel or 
other files. In such instances the clearance shall not be reissued until 
the questionable information has been adjudicated.


<R05>
Sec. 154.26  Investigations conducted and clearances granted by other 
agencies of the Federal government.

    (a) Whenever a prior investigation or personnel security 
determination (including clearance for access to information classified 
under E.O. 12356 of another agency of the Federal Government meets the 
investigative scope and standards of this part, such investigation or 
clearance may be accepted for the investigative or clearance purposes of 
this part, provided that the employment with the Federal agency 
concerned has been continuous and there has been no break longer than 12 
months since completion of the prior investigation, and further provided 
that inquiry with the agency discloses no reason why the clearance 
should not be accepted. If it is determined that the prior investigation 
does not meet the provisions of this paragraph, supplemental 
investigation shall be requested.
    (b) A NACI conducted by OPM shall be accepted and considered 
equivalent to a DNACI for the purposes of this part.
    (c) Department of Defense policy on reciprocal acceptance of 
clearances with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Department of 
Energy is set forth in DoD Directive 5210.2.\1\

<R04>
         Subpart E_Requesting Personnel Security Investigations


<R05>
Sec. 154.30  General.

    Requests for personnel security investigations shall be limited to 
those required to accomplish the Defense mission. Such requests shall be 
submitted only by the authorities designated in Sec. 154.31. These 
authorities shall be held responsible for determining if persons under 
their jurisdiction require a personnel security investigation. Proper 
planning must be effected to ensure that investigative requests are 
submitted sufficiently in advance to allow completion of the 
investigation before the time it is needed to grant the required 
clearance or otherwise make the necessary personnel security 
determination.


<R05>
Sec. 154.31  Authorized requesters.

    Requests for personnel security investigation shall be accepted only 
from the requesters designated below:
    (a) Military Departments. (1) Army.
    (i) Central Clearance Facility.
    (ii) All activity commanders.
    (iii) Chiefs of recruiting stations.
    (2) Navy (including Marine Corps).
    (i) Central Adjudicative Facility.
    (ii) Commanders and commanding officers of organizations listed on 
the Standard Navy Distribution List.
    (iii) Chiefs of recruiting stations.
    (3) Air Force.
    (i) Air Force Security Clearance Office.
    (ii) Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence.
    (iii) All activity commanders.
    (iv) Chiefs of recruiting stations.
    (b) Defense Agencies--Directors of Security and activity commanders.
    (c) Organization of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--Chief, Security 
Division.

[[Page 659]]

    (d) Office of the Secretary of Defense--Director for Personnel and 
Security, Washington Headquarters Services.
    (e) Commanders of Unified and Specified Commands or their designees.
    (f) Such other requesters approved by the Deputy Under Secretary of 
Defense for Policy.


<R05>
Sec. 154.32  Criteria for requesting investigations.

    Authorized requesters shall use the tables set forth in Appendix C 
to determine the type of investigation that shall be requested to meet 
the investigative requirement of the specific position or duty 
concerned.


<R05>
Sec. 154.33  Request procedures.

    To insure efficient and effective completion of required 
investigations, all requests for personnel security investigations shall 
be prepared and forwarded in accordance with Appendix B and the 
investigative jurisdictional policies set forth in Sec. 154.9.


<R05>
Sec. 154.34  Priority requests.

    To insure that personnel security investigations are conducted in an 
orderly and efficient manner, requests for priority for individual 
investigations or categories of investigations shall be kept to a 
minimum. DIS shall not assign priority to any personnel security 
investigation or categories of investigations without written approval 
of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.


<R05>
Sec. 154.35  Personal data provided by the subject of the investigation.

    (a) To conduct the required investigation, it is necessary that the 
investigative agency be provided certain relevant data concerning the 
subject of the investigation. The Privacy Act of 1974 requires that, to 
the greatest extent practicable, personal information shall be obtained 
directly from the subject individual when the information may result in 
adverse determinations affecting an individual's rights, benefits, and 
privileges under Federal programs.
    (b) Accordingly, it is incumbent upon the subject of each personnel 
security investigation to provide the personal information required by 
this part. At a minimum, the individual shall complete the appropriate 
investigative forms, provide fingerprints of a quality acceptable to the 
FBI, and execute a signed release, as necessary, authorizing custodians 
of police, credit, education, employment, and medical and similar 
records, to provide relevant record information to the investigative 
agency. When the FBI returns a fingerprint card indicating that the 
quality of the fingerprints is not acceptable, an additional set of 
fingerprints will be obtained from the subject. In the event the FBI 
indicates that the additional fingerprints are also unacceptable, no 
further attempt to obtain more fingerprints need be made; this aspect of 
the investigation will then be processed on the basis of the name check 
of the FBI files. As an exception, a minimum of three attempts will be 
made for all Presidential Support cases, for SCI access nominations if 
the requester so indicates, and in those cases in which more than minor 
derogatory information exists. Each subject of a personnel security 
investigation conducted under the provisions of this part shall be 
furnished a Privacy Act Statement advising of the authority for 
obtaining the personal data, the principal purpose(s) for obtaining it, 
the routine uses, whether disclosure is mandatory or voluntary, the 
effect on the individual if it is not provided, and that subsequent use 
of the data may be employed as part of an aperiodic review process to 
evaluate continued eligibility for access to classified information.
    (c) Failure to respond within the time limit prescribed by the 
requesting organization with the required security forms or refusal to 
provide or permit access to the relevant information required by this 
part shall result in termination of the individual's security clearance 
or assignment to sensitive duties utilizing the procedures of Sec. 
154.59 or further administrative processing of the investigative 
request.

[[Page 660]]


<R04>
                         Subpart F_Adjudication


<R05>
Sec. 154.40  General.

    (a) The standard which must be met for clearance or assignment to 
sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the 
person's loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that 
entrusting the person with classified information or assigning the 
person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of 
national security.
    (b) The principal objective of the DoD personnel security 
adjudicative function, consequently, is to assure selection of persons 
for sensitive positions who meet this standard. The adjudication process 
involves the effort to assess the probability of future behavior which 
could have an effect adverse to the national security. Since few, if 
any, situations allow for positive, conclusive evidence of certain 
future conduct, it is an attempt to judge whether the circumstances of a 
particular case, taking into consideration prior experience with similar 
cases, reasonably suggest a degree of probability of prejudicial 
behavior not consistent with the national security. It is invariably a 
subjective determination, considering the past but necessarily 
anticipating the future. Rarely is proof of trustworthiness and 
reliability or untrustworthiness and unreliability beyond all reasonable 
doubt.
    (c) Establishing relevancy is one of the key objectives of the 
personnel security adjudicative process in evaluating investigative 
material. It involves neither the judgment of criminal guilt nor the 
determination of general suitability for a given position; rather, it is 
the assessment of a person's trustworthiness and fitness for a 
responsibility which could, if abused, have unacceptable consequences 
for the national security.
    (d) While equity demands optimal uniformity in evaluating individual 
cases, assuring fair and consistent assessment of circumstances from one 
situation to the next, each case must be weighed on its own merits, 
taking into consideration all relevant facts, and prior experience in 
similar cases. All information of record, both favorable and 
unfavorable, must be considered and assessed in terms of accuracy, 
completeness, relevance, seriousness, and overall significance. In all 
adjudications the protection of the national security shall be the 
paramount determinant.


<R05>
Sec. 154.41  Central adjudication.

    (a) To ensure uniform application of the requirement of this part 
and to ensure that DoD personnel security determinations are effected 
consistent with existing statutes and Executive orders, the head of each 
Military Department and Defense Agencies shall establish a single 
Central Adjudication Facility for his/her component. The function of 
such facility shall be limited to evaluating personnel security 
investigations and making personnel security determinations. The chief 
of each Central Adjudication Facility shall have the authority to act on 
behalf of the head of the Component concerned with respect to personnel 
security determinations. All information relevant to determining whether 
a person meets the appropriate personnel security standard prescribed by 
this part shall be reviewed and evaluated by personnel security 
specialists specifically designated by the head of the Component 
concerned, or designee.
    (b) In view of the significance each adjudicative decision can have 
on a person's career and to ensure the maximum degree of fairness and 
equity in such actions, a minimum level of review shall be required for 
all clearance/access determinations related to the following categories 
of investigations:
    (1) BI/SBI/PR/ENAC/SII:
    (i) Favorable: Completely favorable investigations shall be reviewed 
and approved by an adjudicative official in the civilian grade of GS-7/9 
or the military rank of O-3.
    (ii) Unfavorable: Investigations that are not completely favorable 
shall undergo at least two levels of review by adjudicative officials, 
the second of which must be at the civilian grade of GS-11/12 or the 
military rank of O-4. When an unfavorable administrative action is 
contemplated under Sec. 154.56(b), the letter of intent (LOI) to deny 
or revoke must be approved and signed by an adjudicative official at the 
civilian grade of GS-13/14 or the military rank

[[Page 661]]

of O-5. A final notification of unfavorable administrative action, 
subsequent to the issuance of the LOI, must be approved and signed at 
the civilian grade of GS-14/15 or the military rank of O-6.
    (2) NACI/DNACI/NAC/ENTNAC:
    (i) Favorable: A completely favorable investigation may be finally 
adjudicated after one level of review provided that the decisionmaking 
authority is at the civilian grade of GS-5/7 or the military rank of 0-
2.
    (ii) Unfavorable: Investigations that are not completely favorable 
must be reviewed by an adjudicative official in the civilian grade of 
GS-7/9 or the military rank of 0-3. When an unfavorable administrative 
action is contemplated under Sec. 154.56(b), the letter of intent to 
deny/revoke must be signed by an adjudicative official at the civilian 
grade of GS-11/12 or the military rank of 0-4. A final notification of 
unfavorable administrative action subsequent to the issuance of the LOI 
must be signed by an adjudicative official at the civilian grade of GS-
13 or the military rank of 0-5 or above.
    (c) Exceptions to the above policy may only be granted by the Deputy 
Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.


<R05>
Sec. 154.42  Evaluation of personnel security information.

    (a) The criteria and adjudicative policy to be used in applying the 
principles at Sec. 154.40 are set forth in Sec. 154.7(a) and Appendix 
H of this part. The ultimate consideration in making a favorable 
personnel security determination is whether such determination is 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security and shall be 
an overall common sense evaluation based on all available information. 
Such a determination shall include consideration of the following 
factors:
    (1) The nature and seriousness of the conduct;
    (2) The circumstances surrounding the conduct;
    (3) The frequency and recency of the conduct;
    (4) The age of the individual;
    (5) The voluntariness of participation; and
    (6) The absence or presence of rehabilitation.
    (b) Detailed adjudication policy guidance to assist adjudicators in 
determining whether a person is eligible for access to classified 
information or assignment to sensitive duties is contained in Appendix 
H. Adjudication policy for access to SCI is contained in DCID 1/14.


<R05>
Sec. 154.43  Adjudicative record.

    (a) Each adjudicative determinations, whether favorable or 
unfavorable, shall be entered into the Defense Clearance and 
Investigations Index (DCII) on a daily basis, but in no case to exceed 5 
working days from the date of determination.
    (b) The rationale underlying each unfavorable personnel security 
determination, to include the appeal process, and each favorable 
personnel security determination where the investigation or information 
upon which the determination was made included significant derogatory 
information of the type set forth in Sec. 154.7 and appendix H to part 
154, shall be maintained in written or automated form and is subject to 
the provisions of 32 CFR part 285 and 32 CFR part 310. This information 
shall be maintained for a minimum of 5 years from the date of 
determination.

[58 FR 61025, Nov. 19, 1993]


<R04>
             Subpart G_Issuing Clearance and Granting Access


<R05>
Sec. 154.47  General.

    (a) The issuance of a personnel security clearance (as well as the 
function of determining that an individual is eligible for access to 
Special Access program information, or is suitable for assignment to 
sensitive duties or such other duties that require a trustworthiness 
determination) is a function distinct from that involving the granting 
of access to classified information. Clearance determinations are made 
on the merits of the individual case with respect to the subject's 
suitability for security clearance. Access determinations are made 
solely on the basis of the individual's need for access to classified 
information in order to

[[Page 662]]

perform official duties. Except for suspension of access pending final 
adjudication of a personnel security clearance, access may not be 
finally denied for cause without applying the provisions of Sec. 
154.56(b).
    (b) Only the authorities designated in paragraph A, Appendix E are 
authorized to grant, deny or revoke personnel security clearances or 
Special Access authorizations (other than SCI). Any commander or head of 
an organization may suspend access for cause when there exists 
information raising a serious question as to the individual's ability or 
intent to protect classified information, provided that the procedures 
set forth in Sec. 154.55(b) of this part are complied.
    (c) All commanders and heads of DoD organizations have the 
responsibility for determining those position functions in their 
jurisdiction that require access to classified information and the 
authority to grant access to incumbents of such positions who have been 
cleared under the provisions of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 154.48  Issuing clearance.

    (a) Authorities designated in paragraph A, Appendix E shall record 
the issuance, denial or revocation of a personnel security clearance in 
the DCII (see Sec. 154.43). A record of the clearance issued shall also 
be recorded in an individual's personnel/security file or official 
personnel folder, as appropriate.
    (b) A personnel security clearance remains valid until the 
individual is separated from the Armed Forces, separated from DoD 
civilian employment, has no further official relationship with DoD, 
official action has been taken to deny, revoke or suspend the clearance 
or access, or regular access to the level of classified information for 
which the individual holds a clearance is no longer necessary in the 
normal course of his or her duties. If an individual resumes his or her 
affiliation with DoD no single break in the individual's relationship 
with DoD exists greater than 24 months and/or, the need for regular 
access to classified information at or below the previous level recurs, 
and no record of an unfavorable administrative action exists, the 
appropriate clearance shall be reissued without further investigation or 
adjudication provided there has been no additional investigation or 
development of derogatory information.
    (c) Personnel security clearances of DoD military personnel shall be 
granted denied or revoked only by the designated authority of the parent 
Military Department. Issuance, reissuance, denial, or revocation of a 
personnel security clearance by any DoD Component concerning personnel 
who have been determined to be eligible for clearance by another 
component is expressly prohibited. Investigations conducted on Army, 
Navy, and Air Force personnel by DIS will be returned only to the parent 
service of the subject for adjudication regardless of the source of the 
original request. The adjudicative authority will be responsible for 
expeditiously transmitting the results of the clearance determination. 
As an exception, the employing DoD Component may issue an interim 
clearance to personnel under their administrative jurisdiction pending a 
final eligibility determination by the individual's parent Component. 
Whenever an employing DoD Component issues an interim clearance to an 
individual from another Component, written notice of the action shall be 
provided to the parent Component.
    (d) When a Defense agency, to include Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, initiates an SBI (or PR) for access to SCI on a military 
member, DIS will return the completed investigation to the appropriate 
Military Department adjudicative authority in accordance with paragraph 
(c) of this section for issuance (or reissuance) of the Top Secret 
clearance. Following the issuance of the security clearance, the 
military adjudicative authority will forward the investigative file to 
the Defense agency identified in the ``Return Results To'' block of the 
DD Form 1879. The receiving agency will then forward the completed SBI 
on to DIA for the SCI adjudication in accordance with DCID 1/14.
    (e) The interim clearance shall be recorded in the DCSI (Sec. 
154.43) by the parent DoD Component in the same manner as a final 
clearance.

[52 FR 11219, Apr. 8, 1987, as amended at 58 FR 61025, Nov. 19, 1993]

[[Page 663]]


<R05>
Sec. 154.49  Granting access.

    (a) Access to classified information shall be granted to persons 
whose official duties require such access and who have the appropriate 
personnel security clearance. Access determinations (other than for 
Special Access programs) are not an adjudicative function relating to an 
individual's suitability for such access. Rather they are decisions made 
by the commander that access is officially required.
    (b) In the absence of derogatory information on the individual 
concerned, DoD commanders and organizational managers shall accept a 
personnel security clearance determination, issued by any DoD authority 
authorized by this part to issue personnel security clearances, as the 
basis for granting access, when access is required, without requesting 
additional investigation or investigative files.
    (c) The access level of cleared individuals will, wherever possible, 
be entered into the Defense Clearance and Investigations Index (DCII), 
along with clearance eligibility. However, completion of the DCII Access 
field is required effective October 1, 1993 in all instances where the 
adjudicator with a personnel security investigation. Agencies are 
encouraged to start completing this field as soon as possible.

[52 FR 11219, Apr. 8, 1987, as amended at 58 FR 61025, Nov. 19, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 154.50  Administrative withdrawal.

    As set forth in Sec. 154.48 the personnel security clearance and 
access eligibility must be withdrawn when the events described therein 
occur. When regular access to a prescribed level of classified 
information is no longer required in the normal course of an 
individual's duties, the previously authorized access eligibility level 
must be administratively downgraded or withdrawn, as appropriate.


<R04>
              Subpart H_Unfavorable Administrative Actions


<R05>
Sec. 154.55  Requirements.

    (a) General. For purposes of this part, an unfavorable 
administrative action includes any adverse action which is taken as a 
result of a personnel security determination, as defined at Sec. 154.3 
and any unfavorable personnel security determination, as defined at 
Sec. 154.3. This subpart is intended only to provide guidance for the 
internal operation of the Department of Defense and is not intended to, 
does not, and may not be relied upon, to create or enlarge the 
jurisdiction or review authority of any court or administrative 
tribunal, including the Merit Systems Protection Board.
    (b) Referral for action. (1) Whenever derogatory information 
relating to the criteria and policy set forth in Sec. 154.7(a) and 
Appendix H of this part is developed or otherwise becomes available to 
any DoD element, it shall be referred by the most expeditious means to 
the commander or the security officer of the organization to which the 
individual is assigned for duty. The commander or security officer of 
the organization to which the subject of the information is assigned 
shall review the information in terms of its security significance and 
completeness. If further information is needed to confirm or disprove 
the allegations, additional investigation should be requested. The 
commander of the duty organization shall insure that the parent 
Component of the individual concerned is informed promptly concerning 
the derogatory information developed and any actions taken or 
anticipated with respect thereto. However, referral of derogatory 
information to the commander or security officer shall in no way affect 
or limit the responsibility of the central adjudication facility to 
continue to process the individual for denial or revocation of clearance 
or access to classified information, in accordance with Sec. 154.56(b), 
if such action is warranted and supportable by the criteria and policy 
contained in Sec. 154.7(a) and Appendix H. No unfavorable 
administrative action as defined in Sec. 154.3 may be taken by the 
organization to which the individual is assigned for duty without 
affording the person the full range of protections contained in Sec. 
154.56(b) or, in the case of SCI, Annex B, DCID 1/14.
    (2) The Director DIS shall establish appropriate alternative means 
whereby information with potentially serious security significance can 
be reported

[[Page 664]]

other than through DoD command or industrial organization channels. Such 
access shall include utilization of the DoD Inspector General 
``hotline'' to receive such reports for appropriate follow-up by DIS. 
DoD Components and industry will assist DIS in publicizing the 
availability of appropriate reporting channels. Additionally, DoD 
Components will augment the system when and where necessary. Heads of 
DoD Components will be notified immediately to take action if 
appropriate.
    (c) Suspension.
    (1) The commander or head of the organization shall determine 
whether, on the basis of all facts available upon receipt of the initial 
derogatory information, it is in the interests of national security to 
continue subject's security status unchanged or to take interim action 
to suspend subject's access to classified information or assignment to 
sensitive duties (or other duties requiring a trustworthiness 
determination), if information exists which raises serious questions as 
to the individual's ability to intent to protect classified information 
or execute sensitive duties (or other duties requiring a trustworthiness 
determination) until a final determination is made by the appropriate 
authority designated in appendix F to this part.
    (2) Whenever a determination is made to suspend a security clearance 
for access to classified information or assignment to sensitive duties 
(or other duties requiring a trustworthiness determination), the 
individual concerned must be notified of the determination in writing by 
the commander, or head of the component or adjudicative authority, to 
include a brief statement of the reason(s) for the suspension action 
consistent with the interests of national security.
    (3) Component field elements must promptly report all suspension 
actions to the appropriate central adjudicative authority, but not later 
than 10 working days from the date of the suspension action. The 
adjudicative authority will immediately update the DCII Eligibility and 
Access fields to alert all users to the individual's changed status.
    (4) Every effect shall be made to resolve suspension cases as 
expeditiously as circumstances permit. Suspension cases exceeding 180 
days shall be closely monitored and managed by the DoD Component 
concerned until finally resolved. Suspension cases pending in excess of 
12 months will be reported to the DASD(CI&SCM) for review and 
appropriate action.
    (5) A final security clearance eligibility determination shall be 
made for all suspension actions and the determination entered in the 
DCII. If, however, the individual under suspension leaves the 
jurisdiction of the Department of Defense and no longer requires a 
clearance (or trustworthiness determination), entry of the ``Z'' Code 
(adjudication action incomplete due to loss of jurisdiction) if the 
clearance eligibility field is appropriate. In no case shall a 
``suspension'' code (Code Y) remain as a permanent record in the DCII.
    (6) A clearance or access entry in the DCII shall not be suspended 
or downgraded based solely on the fact that a periodic reinvestigation 
was not conducted precisely within the 5 year time period for TOP 
SECRET/SCI or within the period prevailing for SECRET clearances under 
departmental policy. While every effort should be made to ensure that 
PRs are conducted within the prescribed time frame, agencies must be 
flexible in their administration of this aspect of the personnel 
security program so as not to undermine the ability of the Department of 
Defense to accomplish its mission.
    (d) Final unfavorable administrative actions. The authority to make 
personnel security determinations that will result in an unfavorable 
administrative action is limited to those authorities designated in 
Appendix E, except that the authority to terminate the employment of a 
civilian employee of a military department or Defense agency is vested 
solely in the head of the DoD component concerned and in such other 
statutory official as may be designated. Action to terminate civilian 
employees of the Office of the Secretary of Defense and DoD Components, 
on the basis of criteria listed in Sec. 154.7 (a) through (f), shall be 
coordinated with the Deputy Under Secretary

[[Page 665]]

of Defense for Policy prior to final action by the head of the DoD 
Component. DoD civilian employees or members of the Armed Forces shall 
not be removed from employment or separated from the Service under 
provisions of this part if removal or separation can be effected under 
OPM regulations or administrative (nonsecurity) regulations of the 
military departments. However, actions contemplated in this regard shall 
not affect or limit the responsibility of the central adjudication

Sec. 154.56  Procedures.

    (a) General. No final personnel security determination shall be made 
on a member of the Armed Forces, an employee of the Department of 
Defense, a consultant to the Department of Defense, or any other person 
affiliated with the Department of Defense without granting the 
individual concerned the procedural benefits set forth in paragraph (b) 
of this section when such determination results in an unfavorable 
administrative action (see Sec. 154.55(a)). As an exception, Red Cross/
United Service Organizations employees shall be afforded the procedures 
prescribed by 32 CFR part 253.
    (b) Unfavorable administrative action procedures. Except as provided 
for below, no unfavorable administrative action shall be taken under the 
authority of this part unless the person concerned has been given:
    (1) A written statement of the reasons why the unfavorable 
administrative action is being taken. The statement shall be as 
comprehensive and detailed as the protection of sources afforded 
confidentiality under the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 
U.S.C. 552a) and national security permit. The statement will also 
provide the name and address of the agencies (agencies) to which the 
individual may write to obtain a copy of the investigative file(s) upon 
which the unfavorable administrative action is being taken. Prior to 
issuing a statement of reasons to a civilian employee for suspension or 
removal action, the issuing authority must comply with the provisions of 
Federal Personnel Manual, chapter 732, subchapter 1, paragraph 1-6b. The 
signature authority must be as provided for in Sec. 154.41(b) (1)(ii) 
and (2)(ii).
    (2) An opportunity to reply in writing to such authority as the head 
of the Component concerned may designate;
    (3) A written response to any submission under subparagraph b. 
stating the final reasons therefor, which shall be as specific as 
privacy and national security considerations permit. The signature 
authority must be as provided for in Sec. 154.41(b) (1)(ii) and 
(2)(ii). Such response shall be as prompt as individual circumstances 
permit, not to exceed 60 days from the date of receipt of the appeal 
submitted under paragraph (b)(2) of this section provided no additional 
investigative action is necessary. If a final response cannot be 
completed within the time frame allowed, the subject must be notified in 
writing of this fact, the reasons therefor, and the date a final 
response is expected, which shall not, in any case, exceed a total of 90 
days from the date of receipt of the appeal under paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (4) An opportunity to appeal to a higher level of authority 
designated by the Component concerned.
    (c) Exceptions to policy. Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this 
section or any other provision of this part, nothing in this part shall 
be deemed to limit or affect the responsibility and powers of the 
Secretary of Defense to find that a person is unsuitable for entrance or 
retention in the Armed Forces, or is ineligible for a security clearance 
or assignment to sensitive duties, if the national security so requires, 
pursuant to section 7532, title 5, U.S. Code. Such authority may not be 
delegated and may be exercised only when it is determined that the 
procedures prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section are not 
appropriate. Such determination shall be conclusive.

Sec. 154.57  Reinstatement of civilian employees.

    (a) General. Any person whose civilian employment in the Department 
of Defense is terminated under the provisions of this part shall not be 
reinstated or restored to duty or reemployed in the Department of 
Defense unless the Secretary of Defense, or the head of a DoD Component, 
finds that such reinstatement, restoration, or reemployment is clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security. Such a finding shall 
be made a part of the personnel security record.
    (b) Reinstatement benefits. A DoD civilian employee whose employment 
has been suspended or terminated under the provisions of this part and 
who is reinstated or restored to duty under the provisions of section 
3571 of title 5 U.S. Code is entitled to benefits as provided for by 
section 3 of Pub. L. 89-380.


<R04>
             Subpart I_Continuing Security Responsibilities


<R05>
Sec. 154.60  Evaluating continued security eligibility.

    (a) General. A personnel security determination is an effort to 
assess the future trustworthiness of an individual in terms of the 
likelihood of the individual preserving the national security. Obviously 
it is not possible at a given point to establish with certainty that any 
human being will remain trustworthy. Accordingly the issuance of a 
personnel security clearance or the determination that a person is 
suitable for assignment to sensitive duties cannot be considered as a 
final personnel security action. Rather, there is the clear need to 
assure that, after the personnel security determination is reached, the 
individual's trustworthiness is a matter of continuing assessment. The 
responsibility for such assessment must be shared by the organizational 
commander or manager, the individual's supervisor and, to a large 
degree, the individual himself. Therefore, the heads of DoD Components 
shall establish and maintain a program designed to evaluate on a 
continuing basis the status of personnel under their jurisdiction with 
respect to security eligibility. This program should insure close 
coordination between security authorities and personnel, medical, legal 
and supervisory personnel to assure that all pertinent information 
available within a command is considered in the personnel security 
process.
    (b) Management responsibility. (1) Commanders and heads of 
organizations shall insure that personnel assigned to sensitive duties 
(or other duties requiring a trustworthiness determination under the 
provisions of this part) are initially indoctrinated and periodically 
instructed thereafter on the national security implication of their 
duties and on their individual responsibilities.
    (2) The heads of all DoD components are encouraged to develop 
programs designed to counsel and assist employees in sensitive positions 
who are experiencing problems in their personal lives with respect to 
such areas as financial, medical or emotional difficulties. Such 
initiatives should be designed to identify potential problem areas at an 
early stage so that any assistance rendered by the employing activity 
will have a reasonable chance of precluding long term, job-related 
security problems.
    (c) Supervisory responsibility. Security programs shall be 
established to insure that supervisory personnel are familiarized with 
their special responsibilities in matters pertaining to personnel 
security with respect to personnel under their supervision. Such 
programs shall provide practical guidance as to indicators that may 
signal matters of personnel security concern. Specific instructions 
should be disseminated concerning reporting procedures to enable the 
appropriate authority to take timely corrective action to protect the 
interests of national security as well as to provide any necessary help 
to the individual concerned to correct any personal problem which may 
have a bearing upon the individual's continued eligibility for access.
    (1) In conjunction with the submission of PRs stated in Sec. 
154.19, and paragraph 5, Appendix A, supervisors will be required to 
review an individual's DD Form 398 to ensure that no significant adverse 
information of which they are aware and that may have a bearing on 
subject's continued eligibility for

[[Page 667]]

access to classified information is omitted.
    (2) If the supervisor is not aware of any significant adverse 
information that may have a bearing on the subject's continued 
eligibility for access, then the following statement must be documented, 
signed and dated, and forwarded to DIS with the investigative package.

    I am aware of no information of the type contained at Appendix D, 32 
CFR part 154, relating to subject's trustworthiness, reliability, or 
loyalty that may reflect adversely on his/her ability to safeguard 
classified information.

    (3) If the supervisor is aware of such significant adverse 
information, the following statement shall be documented, signed and 
dated and forwarded to DIS with the investigative package, and a written 
summary of the derogatory information forwarded to DIS with the 
investigative package:

    I am aware of information of the type contained in Appendix D, 32 
CFR part 154, relating to subject's trustworthiness, reliability, or 
loyalty that may reflect adversely on his/her ability to safeguard 
classified information and have reported all relevant details to the 
appropriate security official(s).

    (4) In conjunction with regularly scheduled fitness and performance 
reports of military and civilian personnel whose duties entail access to 
classified information, supervisors will include a comment in accordance 
with paragraphs (c) (2) and (3) of this section as well as a comment 
regarding an employee's discharge of security responsibilities, pursuant 
to their Component guidance.
    (d) Individual responsibility. (1) Individuals must familiarize 
themselves with pertinent security regulations that pertain to their 
assigned duties. Further, individuals must be aware of the standards of 
conduct required of persons holding positions of trust. In this 
connection, individuals must recognize and avoid the kind of personal 
behavior that would result in rendering one ineligible for continued 
assignment in a position of trust. In the final analysis, the ultimate 
responsibility for maintaining continued eligibility for a position of 
trust rests with the individual.
    (2) Moreover, individuals having access to classified information 
must report promptly to their security office:
    (i) Any form of contact, intentional or otherwise, with individuals 
of any nationality, whether within or outside the scope of the 
employee's official activities, in which:
    (A) Illegal or unauthorized access is sought to classified or 
otherwise sensitive information.
    (B) The employee is concerned that he or she may be the target of 
exploitation by a foreign entity.
    (ii) Any information of the type referred to in Sec. 154.7 or 
appendix H to this part.
    (e) Co-worker responsibility. Co-workers have an equal obligation to 
advise their supervisor or appropriate security official when they 
become aware of information with potentially serious security 
significance regarding someone with access to classified information or 
employed in a sensitive position.

[52 FR 11219, Apr. 8, 1987, as amended at 58 FR 61025, Nov. 19, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 154.61  Security education.

    (a) General. The effectiveness of an individual in meeting security 
responsibilities is proportional to the degree to which the individual 
understands them. Thus, an integral part of the DoD security program is 
the indoctrination of individuals on their security responsibilities. 
Moreover, such indoctrination is essential to the efficient functioning 
of the DoD personnel security program. Accordingly, heads of DoD 
Components shall establish procedures in accordance with this chapter 
whereby persons requiring access to classified information, or being 
assigned to positions that require the occupants to be determined 
trustworthy are periodically briefed as to their security 
responsibilities.
    (b) Initial briefing. (1) All persons cleared for access to 
classified information or assigned to duties requiring a trustworthiness 
determination under this part shall be given an initial security 
briefing. The briefing shall be in accordance with the requirements of 
32 CFR part 159 and consist of the following elements:

[[Page 668]]

    (i) The specific security requirements of their particular job.
    (ii) The techniques employed by foreign intelligence activities in 
attempting to obtain classified information and their responsibility for 
reporting such attempts.
    (iii) The prohibition against disclosing classified information, by 
any means, to unauthorized persons or discussing or handling classified 
information in a manner that would make it accessible to unauthorized 
persons.
    (iv) The penalties that may be imposed for security violations.
    (2) If an individual declines to execute Standard Form 312, 
``Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement'' (replaced the 
Standard Form 189), the DoD Component shall initiate action to deny or 
revoke the security clearance of such person in accordance with Sec. 
154.56(b).
    (c) Refresher briefing. Programs shall be established to provide, at 
a minimum, annual security training for personnel having continued 
access to classified information. The elements outlined in 32 CFR part 
159 shall be tailored to fit the needs of experienced personnel.
    (d) Foreign travel briefing. While world events during the past 
several years have diminished the threat to our national security from 
traditional cold-war era foreign intelligence services, foreign 
intelligence service continue to pursue the unauthorized acquisition of 
classified or otherwise sensitive U.S. Government information, through 
the recruitment of U.S. Government employees with access to such 
information. Through security briefings and education, the Department of 
Defense continues to provide for the protection of information and 
technology considered vital to the national security interests from 
illegal or unauthorized acquisition by foreign intelligence services.
    (1) DoD Components will establish appropriate internal procedures 
requiring all personnel possessing a DoD security clearance to report to 
their security office all contacts with individuals of any nationality, 
whether within or outside the scope of the employee's official 
activities, in which:
    (i) Illegal or unauthorized access is sought to classified or 
otherwise sensitive information.
    (ii) The employee is concerned that he or she may be the target of 
exploitation by a foreign entity.
    (2) The DoD security manager, security specialist or other qualified 
individual will review and evaluate the reported information. Any facts 
or circumstances of a reported contact with a foreign national that 
appear to:
    (i) Indicate an attempt or intention to obtain unauthorized access 
to proprietary, sensitive, or classified information or technology;
    (ii) Offer a reasonable potential for such; or
    (iii) Indicate the possibility of continued contact with the foreign 
national for such purposes, shall be promptly reported to the 
appropriate counterintelligence agency.
    (e) Termination briefing. (1) Upon termination of employment 
administrative withdrawal of security clearance, or contemplated absence 
from duty or employment for 60 days or more, DoD military personnel and 
civilian employees shall be given a termination briefing, return all 
classified material, and execute a Security Termination Statement. This 
statement shall include:
    (i) An acknowledgment that the individual has read the appropriate 
provisions of the Espionage Act, other criminal statutes, DoD 
Regulations applicable to the safeguarding of classified information to 
which the individual has had access, and understands the implications 
thereof;
    (ii) A declaration that the individual no longer has any documents 
or material containing classified information in his or her possession;
    (iii) An acknowledgment that the individual will not communicate or 
transmit classified information to any unauthorized person or agency; 
and
    (iv) An acknowledgment that the individual will report without delay 
to the FBI or the DoD Component concerned any attempt by any 
unauthorized person to solicit classified information.

[[Page 669]]

    (2) When an individual refuses to execute a Security Termination 
Statement, that fact shall be reported immediately to the security 
manager of the cognizant organization concerned. In any such case, the 
individual involved shall be debriefed orally. The fact of a refusal to 
sign a Security Termination Statement shall be reported to the Director, 
Defense Investigative Service who shall ensure that it is recorded in 
the Defense Clearance and Investigations Index.
    (3) The Security Termination Statement shall be retained by the DoD 
Component that authorized the individual access to classified 
information for the period specified in the Component's records 
retention schedules, but for a minimum of 2 years after the individual 
is given a termination briefing.
    (4) In addition to the provisions of paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2), and 
(e)(3) of this section, DoD Components shall establish a central 
authority to be responsible for ensuring that Security Termination 
Statements are executed by senior personnel (general officers, flag 
officers and GS-16s and above). Failure on the part of such personnel to 
execute a Security Termination Statement shall be reported immediately 
to the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.

Sec. 154.78  Inspections.

    The heads of DoD Components shall assure that personnel security 
program matters are included in their administrative inspection 
programs.

               Appendix A to Part 154--Investigative Scope

    This appendix prescribes the scope of the various types of personnel 
security investigations.
    1. National Agency Check (NAC). Components of a NAC. At a minimum, 
the first three of the described agencies (DCII, FBI/HQ, and FBI/ID) 
below shall be included in each complete NAC; however, a NAC may also 
include a check of any or all of the other described agencies, if 
appropriate.
    a. DCII records consist of an alphabetical index of personal names 
and impersonal titles that appear as subjects or incidentals in 
investigative documents held by the criminal, counterintelligence, 
fraud, and personnel security investigative activities of the three 
military departments, DIS, Defense Criminal Investigative Service 
(DCIS), and the National Security Agency. DCII records will be checked 
on all subjects of DoD investigations.
    b. FBI/HQ has on file copies of investigations conducted by the FBI. 
The FBI/HQ check, included in every NAC, consists of a review of files 
for information of a security nature and that developed during 
applicant-type investigations.
    c. An FBI/ID check, included in every NAC (but not ENTNAC), is based 
upon a technical fingerprint search that consists of a classification of 
the subject's fingerprints and comparison with fingerprint cards 
submitted by law enforcement activities. If the fingerprint card is not 
classifiable, a ``name check only'' of these files is automatically 
conducted.
    d. OPM. The files of OPM contain the results of investigations 
conducted by OPM under Executive Orders 9835 and 10450, those requested 
by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Department of Energy 
(DOE) and those requested since August 1952 to serve as a basis for 
``Q'' clearances. Prior to that date, ``Q'' clearance investigations 
were conducted by the FBI. A ``Q'' clearance is granted to individuals 
who require access to DOE information. In order to receive a ``Q'' 
clearance, a full field background investigation must be completed on 
the individual requiring access in accordance with the Atomic Energy Act 
of 1954. Also on file are the results of investigations on the operation 
of the Merit System, violations of the Veterans Preference Act, appeals 
of various types, fraud and collusion in Civil Service examinations and 
related matters, data on all Federal employment, and an index of all BIs 
on civilian employees or applicants completed by agencies of the 
Executive Branch of the U.S. Government. The OPM files may also contain 
information relative to U.S. citizens who are, or who were, employed by 
a United Nations organization or other public international organization 
such as the Organization of American States. OPM records are checked on 
all persons who are, or who have been, civilian employees of the U.S. 
Government; or U.S. citizens who are, or who have been, employed by a 
United Nations organization or other public international organization; 
and on those who have been granted security clearances by the NRC or 
DOE.
    e. Immigration and Naturalization Service (I&NS). The files of I&NS 
contain (or show where filed) naturalization certificates, certificates 
of derivative citizenship, all military certificates of naturalization, 
repatriation files, petitions for naturalization and declaration of 
intention, visitors' visas, and records of aliens (including government 
officials and representatives of international organizations) admitted 
temporarily into the U.S. I&NS records are checked when the subject is:
    (1) An alien in the U.S., or
    (2) A naturalized citizen whose naturalization has not been 
verified, or
    (3) An immigrant alien, or
    (4) A U.S. citizen who receives derivative citizenship through the 
naturalization of one or both parents, provided that such citizenship 
has not been verified in a prior investigation.
    f. State Department. The State Department maintains the following 
records:
    (1) Security Division (S/D) files contain information pertinent to 
matters of security, violations of security, personnel investigations 
pertinent to that agency, and correspondence files from 1950 to date. 
These files are checked on all former State Department employees.
    (2) Passport Division (P/D) shall be checked if subject indicates 
U.S. citizenship due to birth in a foreign country of American parents. 
This is a check of State Department Embassy files to determine if 
subject's birth was registered at the U.S. Embassy in the country where 
he was born. Verification of this registration is verification of 
citizenship.
    g. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The files of CIA contain 
information on present and former employees, including members of the 
Office of Strategic Services (OSS), applicants for employment, foreign 
nationals, including immigrant aliens in the U.S., and

[[Page 673]]

U.S. citizens traveling outside the U.S. after July 1, 1946. These files 
shall be checked under the following guidelines.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Investigation                   Criteria for CIA Checks
------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAC, DNACI or ENTNAC................  Residence anywhere outside of the
                                       U.S. for a year or more since age
                                       18 except under the auspices of
                                       the U.S. Government; and, travel,
                                       education, residence, or
                                       employment since age 18 in any
                                       designated country (Appendix G).
BI..................................  Same as NAC, DNACI, and ENTNAC
                                       requirements plus travel,
                                       residence, employment, and
                                       education outside the U.S. for
                                       more than a continuous 3-month
                                       period during the past 5 years,
                                       or since age 18, except when
                                       under the auspices of the
                                       Government.
SBI.................................  Same as BI requirements except the
                                       period of the investigation will
                                       cover the past 15 years, or since
                                       age 18. Also when subject's
                                       employment, education or
                                       residence has occurred overseas
                                       for a period of more than one
                                       year under the auspices of the
                                       U.S. Government, such checks will
                                       be made.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    These files shall also be checked if subject has been an employee of 
CIA or when other sources indicate that CIA may have pertinent 
information.
    h. Military Personnel Record Center files are maintained by separate 
departments of the Armed Forces, General Services Administration and the 
Reserve Records Centers. They consist of the Master Personnel Records of 
retired, separated, reserve, and active duty members of the Armed Force. 
These records shall be checked when the requester provides required 
identifying data indicating service during the last 15 years.
    i. Treasury Department. The files of Treasury Department agencies 
(Secret Service, Internal Revenue Service, and Bureau of Customs) will 
be checked only when available information indicates that an agency of 
the Treasury Department may be reasonably expected to have pertinent 
information.
    j. The files of other agencies such as the National Guard Bureau, 
the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO), etc., will be 
checked when pertinent to the purpose for which the investigation is 
being conducted.
    2. DoD National Agency Check plus Written Inquires (DNACI):
    a. Scope: The time period covered by the DNACI is limited to the 
most recent five (5) years, or since the 18th birthday, whichever is 
shorter, provided that the investigation covers at least the last two 
(2) full years of the subject's life, although it may be extended to the 
period necessary to resolve any questionable or derogatory information. 
No investigation will be conducted prior to an individual's 16th 
birthday. All DNACI investigation information will be entered on the DD 
Form 398-2 and FD-Form 258 and forwarded to the Defense Investigative 
Service (paragraph D, Appendix B).
    b. Components of a DNACI:
    (1) NAC. This is the same as described in paragraph 1, above.
    (2) Credit. (a) A credit bureau check will be conducted to cover the 
50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin 
Islands, at all locations where subject has resided (including duty 
stations and home ports), been employed, or attended school for 6 months 
(cumulative) during the past five (5) years.
    (b) When information developed reflects unfavorably upon a person's 
current credit reputation or financial responsibility, the investigation 
will be expanded as necessary.
    (3) Employment.--(a) Non-Federal Employment. (1) Verify, via written 
inquiry, all employment within the period of investigation with a 
duration of six (6) months or more. Current employment will be checked 
regardless of duration.
    (2) If all previous employments have been less than 6 months long, 
the most recent employment, in addition to the current, will be checked 
in all cases.
    (3) Seasonal holiday, part-time and temporary employment need not be 
checked unless subparagraph 2 above applies.
    (b) Federal employment. All Federal employment (to include military 
assignments) within the period of investigation will be verified by the 
requester through locally available records, and a statement reflecting 
that such checks have been favorably accomplished will be contained in 
the investigative request. Those that cannot be verified in this fashion 
will be accomplished via written inquiry by DIS (within the 50 United 
States, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands).
    3. Background Investigation (BI). The period of investigation for 
the BI is 5 years and applies to military, civilian, and contractor 
personnel.
    a. NAC. See paragraph 1, above.
    b. Local Agency Checks (LAC). Same as paragraph 4j, below, except 
period of coverage is five years.
    c. Credit checks. Same as paragraph 4i, below.
    d. SUBJECT Interview (SI). This is the principal component of a BI. 
In some instances an issue will arise after the primary SI and a 
secondary interview will be conducted. Interviews in the latter category 
are normally ``issue'' interviews that will be reported in the standard 
BI narrative format.
    e. Employment records. Employment records will be checked at all 
places where employment references are interviewed with the exception of 
current Federal employment when the requester indicates that such 
employment has been verified with favorable results.
    f. Employment reference coverage. A minimum of three references, 
either supervisors or

[[Page 674]]

co-workers, who have knowledge of the SUBJECT's activities in the work 
environment will be interviewed. At least one employment reference at 
the current place of employment will always be interviewed with the 
exception of an individual attending military basic training, or other 
military training schools lasting less than 90 days. However, if the 
SUBJECT has only been at the current employment for less than 6 months, 
it will be necessary to go not only to his or her current employment 
(for example, for one employment reference) but also to the preceding 
employment of at least 6 months for additional employment references. If 
the SUBJECT has not had prior employment of at least 6 months, 
interview(s) will be conducted at the most recent short-term employment 
in addition to the current employment.
    g. Developed and Listed Character References. A minimum of three 
developed character references (DCR) whose combined association with the 
SUBJECT covers the entire period of investigation will be interviewed. 
If coverage cannot be obtained through the DCRs, listed character 
reference (LCR) will be contacted to obtain coverage.
    h. Unfavorable information. Unfavorable information developed in the 
field will be expanded.
    4. Special Background Investigation (SBI)-- a. Components of an SBI. 
The period of investigation for an SBI is the last 15 years or since the 
18th birthday, whichever is the shorter period, provided that the 
investigation covers at least the last 2 full years of the subject's 
life. No investigation will be conducted for the period prior to an 
individual's 16th birthday. Emphasis shall be placed on peer coverage 
whenever interviews are held with personal sources in making education, 
employment, and reference (including developed) contact.
    b. NAC. In addition to conducting a NAC on the subject of the 
investigation, the following additional requirements apply.
    (1) A DCII, FBI/ID name check only and FBI/HQ check shall be 
conducted on subject's current spouse or cohabitant. In addition, such 
other national agency checks as deemed appropriate based on information 
on the subject's SPH or PSQ shall be conducted.
    (2) A check of FBI/HQ files on members of subject's immediate family 
who are aliens in the U.S. or immigrant aliens who are 18 years of age 
or older shall be conducted. As used throughout the part, members of 
subject's immediate family include the following:
    (a) Current spouse.
    (b) Adult children, 18 years of age or older, by birth, adoption, or 
marriage.
    (c) Natural, adopted, foster, or stepparents.
    (d) Guardians.
    (e) Brothers and sisters either by birth, adoption, or remarriage of 
either parent.
    (3) The files of CIA shall be reviewed on alien members of subject's 
immediate family who are 18 years of age or older, regardless of whether 
or not these persons reside in the U.S.
    (4) I&NS files on members of subject's immediate family 18 years of 
age or older shall be reviewed when they are:
    (a) Aliens in the U.S., or
    (b) Naturalized U.S. citizens whose naturalization has not been 
verified in a prior investigation, or
    (c) Immigrant aliens, or
    (d) U.S. citizens born in a foreign country of American parent(s) or 
U.S. citizens who received derivative citizenship through the 
naturalization of one or both parents, provided that such citizenship 
has not been verified in a prior investigation.
    c. Birth. Verify subject's date and place of birth (DPOB) through 
education, employment and/or other records. Verify through Bureau of 
Vital Statistics (BVS) records if not otherwise verified under d., 
below, or if a variance is developed.
    d. Citizenship. Subject's citizenship status must be verified in all 
cases. U.S. citizens who are subjects of investigation will be required 
to produce documentation that will confirm their citizenship. Normally 
such documentation should be presented to the DoD Component concerned 
prior to the initiation of the request for investigation. When such 
documentation is not readily available, investigative action may be 
initiated with the understanding that the designated authority in the 
DoD Component will be provided with the documentation prior to the 
issuance of a clearance. DIS will not check the BVS for native-born U.S. 
citizens except as indicated in 4.c. above. In the case of foreign-born 
U.S. citizens, DIS will check I&NS records. The citizenship status of 
all foreign-born members of subject's immediate family shall be 
verified. Additionally, when the investigation indicates that a member 
of subject's immediate family has not obtained U.S. citizenship after 
having been eligible for a considerable period of time, an attempt 
should be made to determine the reason. The documents listed below are 
acceptable for proof of U.S. citizenship for personnel security 
determination purposes:
    (1) A birth certificate must be presented if the individual was born 
in the United States. To be acceptable, the certificate must show that 
the birth record was filed shortly after birth and must be certified 
with the registrar's signature and the raised, impressed, or 
multicolored seal of his office except for States or jurisdictions 
which, as a matter of policy, do not issue certificates with a raised or 
impressed seal. Uncertified copies of birth certificates are not 
acceptable.
    (a) A delayed birth certificate (a record filed more than one year 
after the date of birth) is acceptable provided that it shows

[[Page 675]]

that the report of birth was supported by acceptable secondary evidence 
of birth as described in subparagraph (b), below.
    (b) If such primary evidence is not obtainable, a notice from the 
registrar stating that no birth record exists should be submitted. The 
notice shall be accompanied by the best combination of secondary 
evidence obtainable. Such evidence may include a baptismal certificate, 
a certificate of circumcision, a hospital birth record, affidavits of 
persons having personal knowledge of the facts of the birth, or other 
documentary evidence such as early census, school, or family bible 
records, newspaper files and insurance papers. Secondary evidence should 
have been created as close to the time of birth as possible.
    (c) All documents submitted as evidence of birth in the United 
States shall be original or certified documents. Uncertified copies are 
not acceptable.
    (2) A certificate of naturalization shall be submitted if the 
individual claims citizenship by naturalization.
    (3) A certificate of citizenship issued by the I&NS shall be 
submitted if citizenship was acquired by birth abroad to a U.S. citizen 
parent or parents.
    (4) A Report of Birth Abroad of A Citizen of The United States of 
America (Form FS-240), a Certification of Birth (Form FS-545 or DS-
1350), or a Certificate of Citizenship is acceptable if citizenship was 
acquired by birth abroad to a U.S. citizen parent or parents.
    (5) A passport or one in which the individual was included will be 
accepted as proof of citizenship.
    e. Education. (1) Verify graduation or attendance at institutions of 
higher learning in the U.S. within the last 15 years, if such attendance 
was not verified during a prior investigation.
    (2) Attempts will be made to review records at overseas educational 
institutions when the subject resided overseas in excess of one year.
    (3) Verify attendance or graduation at the last secondary school 
attended within the past 10 years if there was no attendance at an 
institution of higher learning within the period of investigation.
    (4) Verification of attendance at military academies is only 
required when the subject failed to graduate.
    f. Employment. (1) Non-Federal employment. Verify all employment 
within the period of investigation to include seasonal, holiday, 
Christmas, part-time, and temporary employment. Interview one supervisor 
and one co-worker at subject's current place of employment as well as at 
each prior place of employment during the past 10 years of six months 
duration or longer. The interview requirement for supervisors and co-
workers does not apply to seasonal, holiday, Christmas, part-time, and 
temporary employment (4 months or less) unless there are unfavorable 
issues to resolve or the letter of inquiry provides insufficient 
information.
    (2) Federal employment. All Federal employment will be verified 
within the period of investigation to include Christmas, seasonal 
temporary, summer hire, part-time, and holiday employment. Do not verify 
Federal employment through review of records if already verified by the 
requester. If Federal employment has not been verified by the requester, 
then subject's personnel file at his/her current place of employment 
will be reviewed. All previous Federal employment will be verified 
during this review. In the case of former Federal employees, records 
shall be examined at the Federal Records Center in St. Louis, Missouri. 
Interview one supervisor and one co-worker at all places of employment 
during the past 10 years if so employed for 6 months or more.
    (3) Military employment. Military service for the last 15 years 
shall be verified. The subject's duty station, for the purpose of 
interview coverage, is considered as a place of employment. One 
supervisor and one co-worker shall be interviewed at subject's current 
duty station if subject has been stationed there for 6 months or more; 
additionally, a supervisor and a co-worker at subject's prior duty 
stations where assigned for 6 months or more during the past 10 years 
shall be interviewed.
    (4) Unemployment. Subject's activities during all periods of 
unemployment in excess of 30 consecutive days, within the period of 
investigation, that are not otherwise accounted for shall be verified.
    (5) When an individual has resided outside the U.S. continuously for 
over one year, attempts will be made to confirm overseas employments as 
well as conduct required interviews of a supervisor and co-worker.
    g. References. Three developed character references who have 
sufficient knowledge of subject to comment on his background, 
suitability, and loyalty shall be interviewed personally. Efforts shall 
be made to interview developed references whose combined association 
with subject covers the full period of the investigation with particular 
emphasis on the last 5 years. Employment, education, and neighborhood 
references, in addition to the required ones, may be used as developed 
references provided that they have personal knowledge concerning the 
individual's character, discretion, and loyalty. Listed character 
references will be interviewed only when developed references are not 
available or when it is necessary to identify and locate additional 
developed character references or when it is necessary to verify 
subject's activities (e.g., unemployment).
    h. Neighborhood investigation. Conduct a neighborhood investigation 
to verify each of subject's residences in the U.S. of a period of 6 
months or more on a cumulative basis, during the past 5 years or during 
the period of

[[Page 676]]

investigation, whichever is shorter. During each neighborhood 
investigation, interview two neighbors who can verify subject's period 
of residence in that area and who were sufficiently acquainted to 
comment on subject's suitability for a position of trust. Neighborhood 
investigations will be expanded beyond this 5-year period only when 
there is unfavorable information to resolve in the investigation.
    i. Credit. Conduct credit bureau check in the 50 States, the 
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and overseas (where APO/FPO addresses 
are provided) at all places where subject has resided (including duty 
stations and home ports), been employed, or attended school for 6 months 
or more, on a cumulative basis, during the last 7 years or during the 
period of the investigation, whichever is shorter. When coverage by a 
credit bureau is not available, credit references located in that area 
will be interviewed. Financial responsibility, including unexplained 
affluence, will be stressed in all reference interviews.
    j. Local Agency Checks (LAC's). LACs, including State central 
criminal history record repositories, will be conducted on subject at 
all places of residence to include duty stations and/or home ports, in 
the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, where 
residence occurred during the past 15 years or during the period of 
investigation, whichever is shorter. If subject's place of employment 
and/or education is serviced by a different law enforcement agency than 
that servicing the area of residence, LACs shall be conducted also in 
these areas.
    k. Foreign travel. If subject has been employed, educated, traveled 
or resided outside of the U.S. for more than 90 days during the period 
of investigation, except under the auspices of the U.S. Government, 
additional record checks during the NAC shall be made in accordance with 
paragraph 1.f. of this Appendix. In addition, the following requirements 
apply:
    (1) Foreign travel not under the auspices of the U.S. Government. 
When employment, education, or residence has occurred overseas for more 
than 90 days during the past 15 years or since age 18, which was not 
under the auspices of the U.S. Government, a check of records will be 
made at the Passport Office of the Department of State, the CIA, and 
other appropriate agencies. Efforts shall be made to develop sources, 
generally in the U.S., who knew the individual overseas to cover 
significant employment, education, or residence and to determine whether 
any lasting foreign contacts or connections were established during this 
period. If the individual has worked or lived outside of the U.S. 
continuously for over one year, the investigation will be expanded to 
cover fully this period through the use of such investigative assets and 
checks of record sources as may be available to the U.S. Government in 
the foreign country in which the individual resided.
    (2) Foreign travel under the auspices of the U.S. Government. When 
employment, education, or residence has occurred overseas for a period 
of more than one year, under the auspices of the U.S. Government, a 
record check will be made at the Passport Office of the Department of 
State, the CIA and other appropriate agencies. Efforts shall be made to 
develop sources (generally in the U.S.) who knew the individual overseas 
to cover significant employment, education, or residence and to 
determine whether any lasting foreign contacts or connections were 
established during this period. Additionally, the investigation will be 
expanded to cover fully this period through the use of such 
investigative assets and checks of record sources as may be available to 
the U.S. Government in the foreign country in which the individual 
resided.
    1. Foreign connections. All foreign connections (friends, relatives, 
and/or business connections) of subject and immediate family in the U.S. 
or abroad, except where such association was the direct result of 
subject's official duties with the U.S. Government, shall be 
ascertained. Investigation shall be directed toward determining the 
significance of foreign connections on the part of subject and the 
immediate family, particularly where the association is or has been with 
persons whose origin was within a country whose national interests are 
inimical to those of the U.S. When subject or his spouse has close 
relatives residing in a Communist-controlled country, or subject has 
resided, visited, or traveled in such a country, not under U.S. 
Government auspices, the provisions of Sec. 154.8(i)(3) of this part 
apply.
    m. Organizations. Efforts will be made during reference interviews 
and record reviews to determine if subject and/or the immediate family 
has, or formerly had, membership in, affiliation with, sympathetic 
association towards, or participated in any foreign or domestic 
organization, association, movement, group, or combination of persons of 
the type described in Sec. 154.7(a) through (d) of this part.
    n. Divorce. Divorces, annulments, and legal separations of subject 
shall be verified only when there is reason to believe that the grounds 
for the action could reflect on subject's suitability for a position of 
trust.
    o. Military service. All military service and types of discharge 
during the last 15 years shall be verified.
    p. Medical records. Medical records shall not be reviewed unless:
    (1) The requester indicates that subject's medical records were 
unavailable for review prior to submitting the request for 
investigation, or
    (2) The requester indicates that unfavorable information is 
contained in subject's medical records, or

[[Page 677]]

    (3) The subject lists one or more of the following on the SPH or 
PSQ:
    (a) A history of mental or nervous disorders.
    (b) That subject is now or has been addicted to the use of habit-
forming drugs such as narcotics or barbiturates or is now or has been a 
chronic user to excess of alcoholic beverages.
    q. Updating a previous investigation to SBI standards. If a previous 
investigation does not substantially meet the minimum standards of an 
SBI or if it is more than 5 years old, a current investigation is 
required but may be limited to that necessary to bring the individual's 
file up to date in accordance with the investigative requirements of an 
SBI. Should new information be developed during the current 
investigation that bears unfavorably upon the individual's activities 
covered by the previous investigation, the current inquiries shall be 
expanded as necessary to develop full details of this new information.
    5. Periodic Reinvestigation (PR). a. Each DoD military, civilian, 
consultant and contractor employee (to include non-U.S. citizens 
(foreign nationals and/or immigrant aliens) holding a limited access 
authorization) occupying a critical sensitive position, possessing a TOP 
SECRET clearance, or occupying a special access program position shall 
be the subject of a PR initiated 5 years from the date of completion of 
the last investigation. The PR shall cover the period of the last 5 
years.
    b. Minimum investigative requirements. A PR shall include the 
following minimum scope.
    (1) NAC. A valid NAC on the SUBJECT will be conducted in all cases. 
Additionally, for positions requiring SCI access, checks of DCII, FBI/
HQ, FBI/ID name check only, and other agencies deemed appropriate, will 
be conducted on the SUBJECT's current spouse or cohabitant, if not 
previously conducted. Additionally, NACs will be conducted on immediate 
family members, 18 years of age or older, who are aliens and/or 
immigrant aliens, if not previously accomplished.
    (2) Credit. Credit bureau checks covering all places where the 
SUBJECT resided for 6 months or more, on a cumulative basis, during the 
period of investigation, in the 50 States, District of Columbia, Puerto 
Rico and overseas (where APO/FPO addresses are provided), will be 
conducted.
    (3) Subject interview. The interview should cover the entire period 
of time since the last investigation, not just the last 5-year period. 
Significant information disclosed during the interview, which has been 
satisfactorily covered during a previous investigation, need not be 
explored again unless additional relevant information warrants further 
coverage. An SI is not required if one of the following conditions 
exists:
    (a) The SUBJECT is aboard a deployed ship or in some remote area 
that would cause the interview to be excessively delayed.
    (b) The SUBJECT is in an overseas location serviced by the State 
Department or the FBI.
    (4) Employment. Current employment will be verified. Military and 
Federal service records will not routinely be checked, if previously 
checked by the requester when PR was originally submitted. Also, 
employment records will be checked wherever employment interviews are 
conducted. Records need be checked only when they are locally available, 
unless unfavorable information has been detected.
    (5) Employment references. Two supervisors or co-workers at the most 
recent place of employment or duty station of 6 months; if the current 
employment is less than 6 months employment reference interviews will be 
conducted at the next prior place of employment, which was at least a 6-
month duration.
    (6) Developed Character References (DCRs). Two developed character 
references who are knowledgeable of the SUBJECT will be interviewed. 
Developed character references who were previously interviewed will only 
be reinterviewed when other developed references are not available.
    (7) Local Agency Checks (LACs). DIS will conduct local agency checks 
on the SUBJECT at all places of residence, employment, and education 
during the period of investigation, regardless of duration, including 
overseas locations.
    (8) Neighborhood Investigation. Conduct a neighborhood investigation 
to verify subjects' current residence in the United States. Two 
neighbors who can verify subject's period of residence in that area and 
who are sufficiently acquainted to comment on the subject's suitability 
for a position of trust will be interviewed. Neighborhood investigations 
will be expanded beyond the current residence when unfavorable 
information arises.
    (9) Ex-spouse interview. If the subject of investigation is 
divorced, the ex-spouse will be interviewed when the date of final 
divorce action is within the period of investigation.
    (10) Select scoping. When the facts of the case warrant, additional 
select scoping will be accomplished, as necessary, to fully develop or 
resolve an issue.

[52 FR 11219, Apr. 8, 1987, as amended at 58 FR 61026, Nov. 19, 1993]

               Appendix B to Part 154--Request Procedures

    A. General. To conserve investigative resources and to insure that 
personnel security investigations are limited to those essential

[[Page 678]]

to current operations and are clearly authorized by DoD policies, 
organizations requesting investigations must assure that continuing 
command attention is given to the investigative request process.
    In this connection, it is particularly important that the provision 
of Executive Order 12356 requiring strict limitations on the 
dissemination of official information and material be closely adhered to 
and that investigations requested for issuing clearances are limited to 
those instances in which an individual has a clear need for access to 
classified information. Similarly, investigations required to determine 
eligibility for appointment or retention in DoD, in either a civilian or 
military capacity, must not be requested in frequency or scope exceeding 
that provided for in this part.
    In view of the foregoing, the following guidelines have been 
developed to simplify and facilitate the investigative request process:
    1. Limit requests for investigation to those that are essential to 
current operations and clearly authorized by DoD policies and attempt to 
utilize individuals who, under the provisions of this part, have already 
met the security standard;
    2. Assure that military personnel on whom investigative requests are 
initiated will have sufficient time remaining in service after 
completion of the investigation to warrant conducting it;
    3. Insure that request forms and prescribed documentation are 
properly executed in accordance with instructions;
    4. Dispatch the request directly to the DIS Personnel Investigations 
Center;
    5. Promptly notify the DIS Personnel Investigations Center if the 
investigation is no longer needed (notify OPM if a NACI is no longer 
needed); and
    6. Limit access through strict need-to-know, thereby requiring fewer 
investigations.
    In summary, close observance of the above-cited guidelines will 
allow the DIS to operate more efficiently and permit more effective, 
timely, and responsive service in accomplishing investigations.
    B. National Agency Check (NAC). When a NAC is requested an original 
only of the DD Form 398-2 (National Agency Check Request) and a 
completed FD 258 (Applicant Fingerprint Card) are required. If the 
request is for an ENTNANC, an original only of the DD Form 398-2 and a 
completed DD Form 2280 (Armed Forces Fingerprint Card) are required. 
Those forms should be sent directly to: Personnel Investigation Center, 
Defense Investigative Service, P.O. Box 1083, Baltimore, Maryland 21203.
    C. National Agency Check plus written Inquiries (NACI). When a NACI 
is requested, an original and one copy of the SF 85 (Data for 
Nonsensitive or Noncritical-sensitive Position), an SF 171 (Personal 
Qualifications Statement), and an SF 87 (U.S. Civil Service Commission 
Fingerprint Chart) shall be sent directly to: Office of Personnel 
Management, Bureau of Personnel Investigations, NACI Center, Boyers, 
Pennsylvania 16018.
    The notation ``ALL REFERENCES'' shall be stamped immediately above 
the title at the top of the Standard Form 85.
    D. DoD National Agency Check with Inquiries (DNACI). 1. When a DNACI 
is requested, one copy of DD Form 1879, an original and two copies of 
the DD Form 398-2 (National Agency Check Request), two copies of FD 258 
(Fingerprint Card), and an original of DD Form 2221 (Authority for 
Release of Information and Records) shall be sent directly to: Personnel 
Investigations Center, Defense Investigative Service, P.O. Box 1083, 
Baltimore, Maryland 21203.
    2. The DD Form 398-2 must be completed to cover the most recent five 
year period. All information, to include items relative to residences 
and employment, must be complete and accurate to avoid delays in 
processing.
    E. Special Background Investigation (SBI)/Background Investigation 
(BI). 1. When requesting a BI or SBI, one copy of DD Form 1879 (Request 
for Personnel Security Investigation), an original and four copies of DD 
Form 398 (Statement of Personnel History), two copies of FD 258, and an 
original of DD Form 2221 (Authority for Release of Information and 
Records) shall be sent directly to the: Personnel Investigations Center, 
Defense Investigative Service, P.O. Box 454, Baltimore, Maryland 21203.
    2. For the BI and SBI, the DD Form 398 must be completed to cover 
the most recent five and 15 year period, respectively, or since the 18th 
birthday, whichever is shorter.
    F. Periodic Reinvestigation (PR). 1. PRs shall be requested only in 
such cases as are authorized by Sec. 154.19 (a) through (k) of this 
part.
    a. For a PR requested in accordance with Sec. 154.19 (a) and (k) 
and the DD Form 1879 must be accompanied by the following documents:
    (1) Original and four copies of DD Form 398.
    (2) Two copies of FD-258.
    (3) Original copy of DD Form 2221.
    b. In processing PRs, previous investigative reports will not be 
requested by the requesting organization, unless significant derogatory 
or adverse information, postdating the most recent favorable 
adjudication, is developed during the course of reviewing other locally 
available records. In the latter instance, requests for previous 
investigative reports may only be made if it is determined by the 
requesting organization that the derogatory information is so 
significant that a review of previous investigative reports is

[[Page 679]]

necessary for current adjudicative determinations.
    2. No abbreviated version of DD Form 398 may be submitted in 
connection with a PR.
    3. The PR request shall be sent to the address in paragraph E.1.
    G. Additional investigation to resolve derogatory or adverse 
information. 1. Requests for additional investigation required to 
resolve derogatory or adverse information shall be submitted by DD Form 
1879 (Request for Personnel Security Investigation) to the: Defense 
Investigative Service, P.O. Box 454, Baltimore, Maryland 21203.
    Such requests shall set forth the basis for the additional 
investigation and describe the specific matter to be substantiated or 
disproved.
    2. The request should be accompanied by an original and four copies 
of the DD Form 398, where appropriate, two copies of FD-258 and an 
original copy of DD Form 2221, unless such documentation was submitted 
within the last 12 months to DIS as part of a NAC or other personnel 
security investigation. If pertinent, the results of a recently 
completed NAC, NACI, or other related investigative reports available 
should also accompany the request.
    H. Obtaining results of prior investigations. Requesters requiring 
verification of a specified type of personnel security investigation, 
and/or requiring copies of prior investigations conducted by the DIS 
shall submit requests by letter or message to: Defense Investigative 
Service Investigative Files Division, P.O. Box 1211, Baltimore, Maryland 
21203, Message Address: DIS PIC BALTIMORE MD/ /D0640.
    The request will include subject's name, grade, social security 
number, date and place of birth, and DIS case control number if known.
    I. Requesting postadjudication cases. 1. Requests pertaining to 
issues arising after adjudication of an investigation (postadjudication 
cases) shall be addressed to DIS on a DD Form 1879 accompanied by a DD 
Form 398, where appropriate.
    2. All requests for initial investigations will be submitted to PIC 
regardless of their urgency. If, however, there is an urgent need for a 
postadjudication investigation, or the mailing of a request to PIC for 
initiation of a postadjudication case would prejudice timely pursuit of 
investigative action, the DD Form 1879 may be directed for initiation, 
in CONUS, to the nearest DIS Field Office, and in overseas locations, to 
the military investigative service element supporting the requester 
(Appendix I). The field element (either DIS or the military 
investigative agency) will subsequently forward either the DD Form 1879 
or completed investigation to PIC.
    3. A fully executed DD Form 1879 and appropriate supporting 
documents may not be immediately available. Further, a case that is 
based on sensitive security issues may be compromised by a request that 
the subject submit a DD Form 398. A brief explanation should appear on 
DD Form 1879s which does not include complete supporting documentation.
    J. Requests involving contractor employees. To preclude duplicative 
investigative requests and double handling of contractor employee cases 
involving access to classified information, all requests for 
investigation of contractor personnel must be submitted, using 
authorized industrial security clearance forms, for processing through 
the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office, except for programs in 
which specific approval has been obtained from the Deputy Under 
Secretary of Defense for Policy to utilize other procedures.
    K. Responsibility for proper documentation of requests. The official 
signing the request for investigation shall be responsible for insuring 
that all documentation is completed in accordance with these 
instructions.

Appendix F to Part 154--Guidelines for Conducting Prenomination Personal 
                               Interviews

    A. Purpose. The purpose of the personal interview is to assist in 
determining the acceptability of an individual for nomination and 
further processing for a position requiring an SBI.
    B. Scope. Questions asked during the course of a personal interview 
must have a relevance to a security determination. Care must be taken 
not to inject improper matters into the personal interview. For example, 
religious beliefs and affiliations, beliefs and opinions regarding 
racial matters, political beliefs and affiliations of a nonsubversive 
nature, opinions regarding the constitutionality of legislative 
policies, and affiliations with labor unions and fraternal organizations 
are not proper subjects for inquiry. Department of Defense 
representatives conducting personal interviews should always be prepared 
to explain the relevance of their inquiries. Adverse inferences shall 
not be drawn from the refusal of a person to answer questions the 
relevance of which has not been established.

[[Page 683]]

    C. The interviewer. Except as prescribed in paragraph B. above, 
persons conducting personal interviews normally will have broad latitude 
in performing this essential and important function and, therefore, a 
high premium must necessarily be placed upon the exercise of good 
judgment and common sense. To insure that personal interviews are 
conducted in a manner that does not violate lawful civil and private 
rights or discourage lawful political activity in any of its forms, or 
intimidate free expression, it is necessary that interviewers have a 
keen and well-developed awareness of and respect for the rights of 
interviewees. Interviewers shall never offer an opinion as to the 
relevance or significance of information provided by the interviewee to 
eligibility for access to SCI. If explanation in this regard is 
required, the interviewer will indicate that the sole function of the 
interview is to obtain information and that the determination of 
relevance or significance to the individual's eligibility will be made 
by other designated officials.
    D. Interview procedures. 1. The Head of the DoD Component concerned 
shall establish uniform procedures for conducting the interview that are 
designed to elicit information relevant to making a determination of 
whether the interviewee, on the basis of the interview and other locally 
available information (DD 398, Personnel Security Investigation 
Questionnaire, personnel records, security file, etc.), is considered 
acceptable for nomination and further processing.
    2. Such procedures shall be structured to insure the interviewee his 
full rights under the Constitution of the United States, the Privacy Act 
of 1974 and other applicable statutes and regulations.
    E. Protection of interview results. All information developed during 
the course of the interview shall be maintained in personnel security 
channels and made available only to those authorities who have a need-
to-know in connection with the processing of an individual's nomination 
for duties requiring access to SCI or those who need access to 
information either to conduct the required SBI or to adjudicate the 
matter of the interviewee's eligibility for access to SCI, or as 
otherwise authorized by Executive order or statute.
    F. Acceptability determination. 1. The determination of the 
interviewee's acceptability for nomination for duties requiring access 
to sensitive information shall be made by the commander, or designee, of 
the DoD organization that is considering nominating the interviewee for 
such duties.
    2. Criteria guidelines contained in DCID 1/14 upon which the 
acceptability for nomination determination is to be based shall be 
provided to commanders of DoD organizations who may nominate individuals 
for access to SCI and shall be consistent with those established by the 
Senior Officer of the Intelligence Community of the Component concerned 
with respect to acceptability for nomination to duties requiring access 
to SCI.

                    Appendix G to Part 154 [Reserved]

               Appendix H to Part 154--Adjudication Policy

    General. The following adjudication policy has been developed to 
assist DoD adjudicators in making determinations with respect to an 
individual's eligibility for employment or retention in sensitive duties 
or eligibility for access to classified information. Adjudication policy 
relative to access to sensitive compartmented information is contained 
in DCID \1/14\.
    While reasonable consistency in reaching adjudicative determinations 
is desirable, the nature and complexities of human behavior preclude the 
development of a single set of guidelines or policies that is equally 
applicable in every personnel security case. Accordingly, the following 
adjudication policy is not intended to be interpreted as inflexible 
rules of procedure. The following policy requires dependence on the 
adjudicator's sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis as 
each case must be weighed on its own merits, taking into consideration 
all relevant circumstances, and prior experience in similar cases as 
well as the guidelines contained in the adjudication policy, which have 
been compiled from common experience in personnel security 
determinations.
    Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination 
based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, 
both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis being placed on 
the seriousness, recency, frequency and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, 
or undertaken with knowledge of the circumstances or consequences 
involved; and, to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability 
that conduct will or will not continue in the future. The listed 
``Disqualifying Factors'' and ''Mitigating Factors'' in this set of 
Adjudication Policies reflect the consideration of those factors of 
seriousness, recency, frequency, motivation, etc., to common situations 
and types of behavior encountered in personnel security adjudications, 
and should be followed whenever an individual case can be measured 
against this policy guidance. Common sense may occasionally necessitate 
deviations from this policy guidance, but such deviations should not be 
frequently made and must be carefully explained and documented.
    The ``Disqualifying Factors'' provided herein establish some of the 
types of serious conduct under the criteria that can justify a

[[Page 684]]

determination to deny or revoke an individual's eligibility for access 
to classified information, or appointment to, or retention in sensitive 
duties. The ``Mitigating Factors'' establish some of the types of 
circumstances that may mitigate the conduct listed under the 
``Disqualifying Factors''. Any determination must include a 
consideration of both the conduct listed under ``Disqualifying Factors'' 
and any circumstances listed under the appropriate or corresponding 
``Mitigating Factors''.
    The adjudication policy is subdivided into sections appropriate to 
each of the criteria provided in Sec. 154.7 of this part, except Sec. 
154.7(i) for which conduct under any of the ``Disqualifying Factors'' of 
the adjudication policy or any other types of conduct may be 
appropriately included, if it meets the definition of Sec. 154.7(i).
    In all adjudications, the protection of the national security shall 
be the paramount determinant. In the last analysis, a final decision in 
each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance 
of the clearance or assignment to the sensitive position is ``clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security.''

                                 Loyalty

    (See Sec. 154.7 (a) through (d)).

                   Security Responsibility Safeguards

    (See Sec. 154.7 (g) and (e)).
    Basis: Disregard of public law, Statutes, Executive Orders or 
Regulations, including violation of security regulations or practices, 
or unauthorized disclosure to any person of classified information, or 
of other information, disclosure of which is prohibited by Statute, 
Executive Order or Regulation.
    Disqualifying Factors: (behavior falls within one or more of the 
following categories):
    1. Deliberate or reckless disregard of security regulations, public 
law, statutes or Executive Orders which could have resulted in the loss 
or compromise of classified information.
    2. Deliberate or reckless violations of security regulations, 
including, but not limited to, taking classified information home or 
carrying classified data while in a travel status without proper 
authorization, intentionally copying classified documents in order to 
obsure classification markings, disseminating classified information to

information, or other information, disclosure of which is prohibited by 
Statute, Executive Order or Regulation, to persons who are not cleared 
or authorized to receive it.
    3. Pattern of negligent conduct in handling or storing classified 
documents.
    Mitigating Factors (circumstances which may mitigate disqualifying

significantly contributed to by an improper or inadequate security 
briefing, provided the individual reasonably relied on such briefing in 
good faith.
    2. Individual is personally responsible for a large volume of 
classified information and the violation was merely administrative in 
nature.
    3. Security violation was merely an isolated incident not involving 
deliberate or reckless violation of security policies, practices or 
procedures.

                            Criminal Conduct

    (See Sec. 154.7(h)).
    Basis: Criminal or dishonest conduct.
    When it is determined that an applicant for a security clearance, or 
a person holding a clearance, has engaged in conduct which would 
constitute a felony under the laws of the United States, the clearance 
of such person shall be denied or revoked unless it is determined that 
there are compelling reasons to grant or continue such clearance. 
Compelling reasons can only be shown by clear and convincing evidence of 
the following:
    (a) The felonious conduct (1) did not involve an exceptionally grave 
offense; (2) was an isolated episode; and (3) the individual has 
demonstrated trustworthiness and respect for the law over an extended 
period since the offense occurred; or
    (b) The felonious conduct (1) did not involve an exceptionally grave 
offense; (2) was an isolated episode; (3) was due to the immaturity of 
the individual at the time it occurred; and (4) the individual has 
demonstrated maturity, trustworthiness, and respect for the law since 
that time; or
    (c) In cases where the individual has committed felonious conduct 
but was not convicted of a felony, there are extenuating circumstances 
which mitigate the seriousness of the conduct such that it does not 
reflect a lack of trustworthiness or respect for the law.
    The above criteria supersede all criteria previously used to 
adjudicate criminal conduct involving commission of felonies under the 
Laws of the United States. Involvement in criminal activities which does 
not constitute a felony under the laws of the United States shall be 
evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth below. (For purposes 
of this paragraph, the term ``felony'' means any

[[Page 686]]

crime punishable by imprisonment for more than a year. The term 
``exceptionally grave offense'' includes crimes against the Federal 
Government, its instrumentalities, officers, employees or agents; or 
involves dishonesty, fraud, bribery or false statement; or involves 
breach of trust or fiduciary duty; or involves serious threat to life or 
public safety.)
    Disqualifying Factors: (behavior falls within one or more of the 
following categories):
    1. Criminal conduct involving:
    a. Commission of a State felony.
    b. Force, coercion, or intimidation.
    c. Firearms, explosives, or other weapons.
    d. Dishonesty or false statements, e.g. fraud, theft, embezzlement, 
falsification of documents or statements.
    e. Obstruction or corruption of government functions.
    f. Deprivation of civil rights.
    g. Violence against persons.
    2. Criminal conduct punishable by confinement for one year or more.
    3. An established pattern of criminal conduct, whether the 
individual was convicted or not.
    4. Failure to complete a rehabilitation program resulting from 
disposition of a criminal proceeding or violation of probation, even if 
the violation did not result in formal revocation of probation. 
Rehabilitation should not be considered a success or failure while the 
individual is still on parole/probation.
    5. Criminal conduct that is so recent in time as to preclude a 
determination that recurrence is unlikely.
    6. Close and continuing association with persons known to the 
individual to be involved in criminal activities.
    7. Criminal conduct indicative of a serious mental aberration, lack 
of remorse, or insufficient probability of rehabilitative success, 
(e.g., spouse or child abuse).
    8. Disposition:
    a. Conviction.
    b. Disposition on a legal issue not going to the merits of the 
crime.
    c. Arrest or indictment pending trial when there is evidence that 
the individual engaged in the criminal conduct for which arrested or 
indicted.
    9. Arrest record. In evaluating an arrest record, information that 
indicates that the individual was acquitted, that the charges were 
dropped or the subject of a ``stet'' or ``nolle prosequi'', that the 
record was expunged, or that the cause was dismissed due to error not 
going to the merits, does not negate the security significance of the 
underlying conduct. Personnel security determinations are to be made on 
the basis of all available information concerning a person's conduct and 
actions rather than the legal outcome of a criminal proceeding.
    Mitigating Factors: (circumstances which may mitigate disqualifying 
information):
    1. Immaturity attributable to the age of the individual at the time 
of the offense.
    2. Extenuating circumstances surrounding the offense.
    3. Circumstances indicating that the actual offense was less serious 
than the offense charged.
    4. Isolated nature of the conduct.
    5. Conduct occurring only in the distant past (such as more than 5 
years ago) in the absence of subsequent criminal conduct.
    6. Transitory conditions directly or significantly contributing to 
the conduct (such as divorce action, death in family, severe 
provocation) in the absence of subsequent criminal conduct.

                      Mental or Emotional Disorders

    (See Sec. 154.7(j)).
    Basis: Any behavior or illness, including any mental condition, 
which, in the opinion of competent medical authority, may cause a defect 
in judgment or reliability with due regard to the transient or 
continuing effect of the illness and the medical findings in such case.
    Disqualifying Factors: (behavior or condition falls within one or 
more of the following categories):
    1. Diagnosis by competent medical authority (board certified 
psychiatrist or clinical psychologist) that the individual has an 
illness or mental condition which may result in a significant defect in 
judgment or reliability.
    2. Conduct or personality traits that are bizarre or reflect 
abnormal behavior or instability even though there has been no history 
of mental illness or treatment, but which nevertheless, in the opinion 
of competent medical authority, may cause a defect in judgment or 
reliability.
    3. A diagnosis by competent medical authority that the individual 
suffers from mental or intellectual incompetence or mental retardation 
to a degree significant enough to establish or suggest that the 
individual could not recognize, understand or comprehend the necessity 
of security regulations, or procedures, or that judgment or reliability 
are significantly impaired, or that the individual could be influenced 
or swayed to act contrary to the national security.
    4. Diagnosis by competent medical authority that an illness or 
condition that had affected judgment or reliability may recur even 
though the individual currently manifests no symptoms, or symptoms 
currently are reduced or in remission.
    5. Failure to take prescribed medication or participate in treatment 
(including follow-up treatment or aftercare), or otherwise failing to 
follow medical advice relating to treatment of the illness or mental 
condition.
    Mitigating Factors: (circumstances which may mitigate disqualifying 
information):

[[Page 687]]

    1. Diagnosis by competent medical authority that an individual's 
previous mental or emotional illness or condition that did cause 
significant defect in judgment or reliability is cured and has no 
probability of recurrence, or such a minimal probability of recurrence 
as to reasonably estimate there will be none.
    2. The contributing factors or circumstances which caused the 
bizarre conduct or traits, abnormal behavior, or defect in judgment and 
reliability have been eliminated or rectified, there is a corresponding 
alleviation of the individual's condition and the contributing factors 
or circumstances are not expected to recur.
    3. Evidence of the individual's continued reliable use of prescribed 
medication for a period of at least two years, without recurrence and 
testimony by competent medical authority that continued maintenance of 
prescribed medication is medically practical and likely to preclude 
recurrence of the illness or condition affecting judgment or 
reliability.
    4. There has been no evidence of a psychotic condition, a serious or 
disabling neurotic disorder, or a serious character or personality 
disorder for the past 10 years.

       Foreign Connections/Vulnerability to Blackmail or Coercion

    (See paragraph Sec. 154.7(k)).
    Basis: Vulnerability to coercion, influence, or pressure that may 
cause conduct contrary to the national interest. This may be (1) the 
presence of immediate family members or other persons to whom the 
applicant is bonded by affection or obligation in a nation (or areas 
under its domination) whose interests may be inimical to those of the 
United States, or (2) any other circumstances that could cause the 
applicant to be vulnerable.
    Disqualifying Factors: (behavior falls within one or more of the 
following categories):
    1. Indications that the individual now is being blackmailed, 
pressured or coerced by any individual, group, association, organization 
or government.
    2. Indications that a vulnerable individual actually has been 
targeted and/or approached for possible blackmail, coercion or pressure 
by any individual, group, association, organization or government.
    3. Indications that the individual has acted to increase the 
vulnerability for future possible blackmail, coercion or pressure by any 
individual, group, association, organization or governments, especially 
by foreign intelligence services. Indicators include, but are not 
limited to the following:
    a. Failure to report to security officials any evidence, indication 
or suspicion that mail to relatives has been opened, unusually delayed 
or tampered with in any way, or that telephone calls have been 
monitored.
    b. An increase in curiosity or official or quasi-official inquiries 
about the individual to relatives in the country where they reside 
occasioned by the receipt of mail, packages, telephone calls or visits 
from the individual.
    c. Contact with, or visits by officials to the individual while 
visiting relatives in another country, to learn more about the 
individual, or the individual's employment or residence, etc.
    d. Unreported attempts to obtain classified or other sensitive 
information or data by representatives of a foreign country.
    4. Conduct or actions by the individual while visiting in a country 
hostile to the United States that increase the individual's 
vulnerability to be targeted for possible blackmail, coercion or 
pressure. These include, but are not limited to the following:
    a. Violation of any laws of the foreign country where relatives 
reside during visits or through mailing letters or packages, (e.g., 
smuggling, currency exchange violations, unauthorized mailings, 
violations of postal regulations of the country, or any criminal 
conduct, including traffic violations) which may call the attention of 
officials to the individual.
    b. Frequent and regular visits, correspondence, or telephone contact 
with relatives in the country where they reside, increasing the 
likelihood of official notice.
    c. Failure to report to security officials those inquiries by 
friends or relatives for more than a normal level of curiosity 
concerning the individual's employment, sensitive duties, military 
service or access to classified information.
    d. Repeated telephone or written requests to the foreign government 
officials for official favors, permits, visas, travel permission, or 
similar requests which increase the likelihood of official notice.
    e. Reckless conduct, open or public misbehavior or commission of 
acts contrary to local customs or laws, or which violate the mores of 
the foreign country and increase the likelihood of official notice.
    f. Falsification of documents, lying to officials, harassing or 
taunting officials or otherwise acting to cause an increase in the 
likelihood of official notice or to increase the individual's 
vulnerability because personal freedom could be jeopardized.
    g. Commission of any illicit sexual act, drug purchase or use, 
drunkenness or similar conduct which increases the likelihood of 
official notice, or which increases the individual's vulnerability 
because personal freedom could be jeopardized.
    5. Conduct or actions by the individual that increase the 
individual's vulnerability to possible coercion, blackmail or pressure, 
regardless of the country in which it occurred, including, but not 
limited to the following:
    a. Concealment or attempts to conceal from an employer prior 
unfavorable employment history, criminal conduct, mental or

infomration):
    1. The individual:
    a. Receives no financial assistance from and provides no financial 
assistance to persons or organizations in the designated country.
    b. Has been in the United States for at least 5 years since becoming

country in question.
    i. Has promptly reported to proper authorities all attempted 
contacts, requests or threats from persons or organizations from the 
designated country.
    j. The individual is aware of the possible vulnerability to attempts 
of blackmail or coercion and has taken positive steps to reduce or 
eliminate such vulnerability.

injecting, smoking devices and equipment, etc.
    5. Information that the individual intends to continue to use 
(regardless of frequency) any narcotic, dangerous drug or cannabis. 
Note: There is no corresponding Mitigating Factor for this Disqualifying 
Factor because it is DoD policy that, as a general rule, if any 
individual expresses or implies any intent to continue use of any 
narcotic, dangerous drug, or other controlled substance, including 
marijuana and hashish, without a prescription, in any amount and 
regardless of frequency, it is to be considered contrary to the national 
interest and the interests of national security to grant or allow 
retention of a security clearance for access to classified information 
for that individual.)
    Mitigating Factors (circumstances which may mitigate disqualifying 
information):
    1. Abuse of cannabis only, as follows: (Use this to assess 
Disqualifying Factor 1)
    a. Experimental abuse, which occurred more than six months ago and 
the individual has demonstrated an intent not to use cannabis or any 
other narcotic, psychoactive substance or dangerous drug in the future.

and each separate substance must not be considered separately. (Use this 
to assess Disqualifying Factor 2).
    a. Experimental abuse occurred more than 12 months ago, the 
individual has demonstrated an intent not to use any drugs or cannabis 
in the future and has successfully completed a drug rehabilitation 
program.
    b. Occasional abuse occurred more than two years ago, the individual 
has demonstrated an intent not to use any drugs or cannabis in the

    3. Use this only to assess conduct under Disqualifying Factor 3.
    a. Involvement in trafficking, cultivation, processing, manufacture, 
sale or distribution occurred more than five years ago, the individual 
has demonstrated an intent not to do so in the future, and has a stable 
lifestyle and satisfactory employment record and has not been involved 
in any other criminal activity.
    b. Cultivation was for personnel use only, in a limited amount for a 
limited period and the individual has not been involved in similar 
activity or other criminal activity for more than three years and has 
demonstrated intent not to do so again in the future.

misrepresentation or dishonest conduct by the individual.
    3. The behavior was not willful.
    4. The falsification was done unknowingly or without the 
individual's knowledge.
    5. The individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the

    6. Omission of material fact was caused by or significantly 
contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel, 
provided the individual reasonably relied on such improper or inadequate 
advice in good faith, and when the requirement subsequently was made 
known to the individual, the previously omitted information was promptly 
and fully provided.

                            Refusal to Answer

    (See Sec. 154.7(p)).
    Basis: Failing or refusing to answer or to authorize others to

             Appendix I to Part 154--Overseas Investigations

                               1. Purpose

    The purpose of this appendix is to establish, within the framework 
of this part, 32 CFR part 361 and Defense Investigative Service Manual 
20-1, standardized procedures for the military investigative agencies to 
follow when they perform administrative and investigative functions on 
behalf of DIS at overseas locations.

                          2. Type Investigation

    This part describes in detail Background Investigations (BI) which 
are conducted for Limited Access Authorizations and those Special 
Investigative Inquiries conducted for post-adjudicative purposes. 
Hereafter they are referred to as LAA and Post-adjudicative cases and 
are briefly described in paragraphs a and b below:
    a. Limited access authorization. A level of access to classified 
defense information that may be granted to a non-U.S. citizen under

[[Page 693]]

certain conditions, one of which is that a BI must have been completed 
with satisfactory results. Sec. 154.16(d) further describes LAA cases.
    b. Post-adjudication investigation. A Personnel Security 
Investigation (PSI) predicated on new, adverse or questionable security, 
suitability or hostage information that arises and requires the 
application of investigation procedures subsequent to adjudicative 
action on a DoD-affiliated person's eligibility for continued access to 
classified information, assignment to or retention in sensitive duties 
or other designated duties requiring such investigation. While these 
cases are normally predicated on the surfacing of unfavorable 
information subsequent to favorable adjudication, they may also be 
opened when favorable information is offered to counter a previous 
unfavorable adjudication. Sec. 154.9(c)(3) further describes these 
cases.

                               3. General

    a. As a rule, investigative activity in most PSIs occurs in the U.S. 
even when the Subject is at an overseas location. Therefore, the 
submission of requests for investigation to the Personnel Investigation 
Center (PIC) at Baltimore is a required procedure as it ensures uniform 
application of DoD PSI policy and the efficient dispatch and 
coordination of leads.
    b. When the purpose of the investigation is for an LAA or post-
adjudication on a Subject overseas, much, if not all of the leads are at 
an overseas location. While these cases also may be submitted directly 
to PIC for action, there is an inherent delay in the mailing of the 
request, the exchange of leads and reports with PIC, and transmittal of 
the reports back to the requester. To avoid this delay, the military 
investigative agencies, when acting for DIS overseas in accordance with 
32 CFR part 361 may, with their Headquarters approval, accept these 
requests for investigations, initiate them and disseminate the results 
from the same level as they open, close, and disseminate their own 
cases. Usually this will greatly improve response time to the requester.
    c. Under the procedures in paragraph b., above, DIS will not often 
be in a position to directly exercise its responsibility for control and 
direction until the case or lead is in progress or even completed; 
therefore, adherence to the policy stated in referenced documents, and 
as modified herein, is mandatory. When the policy of the military 
investigative agency is at variance with the above, the matter will be 
referred to the respective headquarters for resolution.
    d. Since DIS is ultimately responsible for the personnel security 
product, it must be kept informed of all such matters referred to in 
this appendix. For instance, when the investigative agency overseas 
receives a DD Form 1879, Request for Personnel Security Investigation, 
which sets forth an issue outside DIS jurisdiction, it will reject the 
request, inform the requester of the reason and furnish an information 
copy of the DD Form 1879 and rejection letter to PIC. When the issue/
jurisdiction is unclear to the investigative agency, the DD Form 1879 
and the perceived jurisdictional question should be promptly forwarded 
to DIS for action and, if appropriate, to the component's headquarters 
for information. Questions on the interpretation of DIS or DoD policy 
and Directives pertaining to individual PSI cases can usually be 
resolved through direct communications with PIC.
    e. 32 CFR part 361 establishes the supporting relationship of the 
military investigative agencies to DIS in overseas areas, and DIS 
provides these agencies with copies of relevant policy and interpretive 
guidance. For these reasons, the investigative agency vice the 
requester, is responsible for evaluating the request, processing it, 
collecting and evaluating the results within their jurisdiction for 
sufficiency, and forwarding the completed product to the appropriate 
activity.
    f. The magnitude of operations at PIC requires that methods of 
handling LAA and post-adjudicative cases be consistent to the maximum 
extent possible. For this reason, the procedures for LAA cases are 
nearly identical to those for post-adjudicative cases. Briefly, the main 
exceptions are:
    (1) The notification to PIC that a post-adjudication case has been 
opened will be by message, since an issue is present at the outset, 
whereas notification of an LAA case should normally be by mail.
    (2) The scope of the LAA investigation is 10 years or since the 
person's 18th birthday, whichever is shortest, whereas the leads in a 
post-djudication case are limited to resolving the issue.

                             4. Jurisdiction

    a. As set-forth in 32 CFR part 361 DIS is responsible for conducting 
all DoD PSIs in the 50 States, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, 
and will request the military departments to accomplish investigative 
requirements elsewhere. The military investigative agencies in overseas 
locations routinely respond to personnel security investigative leads 
for DIS.
    b. DIS jurisdiction also includes investigation of subversive 
affiliations, suitability information, and hostage situations when such 
inquiries are required for personnel security purposes; however, 
jurisdiction will rest with the military investigative agencies, FBI 
and/or civil authorities as appropriate when the alleged subversion or 
suitability issue represents a violation of law or, in the case of a 
hostage situation, there is an indication that the person concerned is 
actually being

[[Page 694]]

pressured, coerced, or influenced by interests inimical to the United 
States, or that hostile intelligence is taking action specifically 
directed against that person. Specific policy guidance on the 
applicability of these procedures and the jurisdictional considerations 
are stated in Sec. 154.9.

                             5. Case Opening

    a. A request for investigation must be submitted by using DD Form 
1879 and accompanied by supporting documentation unless such 
documentation is not immediately available, or the obtaining of 
documentation would compromise a sensitive investigation. Upon receipt 
of the request, the military investigative component will identify the 
issue(s), scope the leads, and ensure that the proposed action is that 
which is authorized for DIS as delineated in this part, 32 CFR part 361 
and Defense Investigative Service Manual 201-1.
    b. Upon such determination, the Component will prepare an Action 
Lead Sheet (ALS) which fully identifies the Subject and the scope of the 
case, and specifies precisely the leads which each investigative 
component (including DIS/PIC when appropriate) is to conduct.
    c. Case opening procedures described above are identical for LAA and 
post-adjudication cases except with respect to notification of case 
opening to PIC:
    (1) Post-adjudication Cases. These cases, because they involve an 
issue, are potentially sensitive and must be examined as early as 
possible by PIC for conformity to the latest DoD policy. Accordingly, 
the initial notification to PIC of case openings will always be by 
message. The message will contain at a minimum:
    (a) Full identification of the subject;
    (b) A narrative describing the allegation/facts in sufficient detail 
to support opening of the case; and
    (c) A brief listing of the leads that are planned.
    The DD Form 1879 and supporting documents, along with the agency's 
ALS, should be subsequently mailed to PIC.
    (2) LAA Cases. The notification to PIC of case opening will normally 
be accomplished by mailing the DD Form 1879, DD Form 398 (Personal 
History Statement), a copy of the ALS, and any other supporting 
documents to PIC. Message notification to PIC in LAA cases will only be 
required if there is a security or suitability issue apparent in the DD 
Form 1879 or supporting documents.
    (d) Beyond initial actions necessary to test allegation for 
investigative merit and jurisdiction, no further investigative action 
should commence until the notification of case opening to PIC has been 
dispatched.
    (e) PIC will promptly respond to the notification of case opening by 
mail or message specifying any qualifying remarks along with a summary 
of previously existing data. PIC will also provide a DIS case control 
number (CCN). This number must be used by all components on all case 
related paperwork/reports.
    (The investigating agency may assign its unique service CCN for 
interim internal control; however, the case will be processed, 
referenced, and entered into the DCII by the DIS case control number.) 
The first five digits of the DIS CCN will be the Julian date of the case 
opening when received at DIS.

                           6. Case Processing

    a. The expected completion time for leads in LAA cases is 50 
calendar days and for post-adjudication cases, 30 days, as computed from 
the date of receipt of the request. If conditions preclude completion in 
this time period, a pending report of the results to date, along with an 
estimated date of completion will be submitted to PIC.
    b. Copies of all ALSs will be furnished to PIC. In addition, PIC 
will be promptly notified of any significant change in the scope of the 
case, or the development of an investigative issue.
    c. The procedures for implementing the Privacy Act in PSI cases are 
set in DIS Manual 20-1-M 1. Any other restrictions on the release of 
information imposed by an overseas source or by regulations of the 
country where the inquiry takes place will be clearly stated in the 
report.
    d. The report format for these cases will be that used by the 
military investigative agency.
    e. Investigative action outside the jurisdictional area of an 
investigative component office may be directed elsewhere by ALS as 
needed in accordance with that agency's procedures and within the 
following geographical considerations:
    (1) Leads will be sent to PIC if the investigative action is in the 
United States, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Bahama 
Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the following islands in the 
Pacific: Wake, Midway, Kwajalin, Johnston, Carolines, Marshalls, and 
Eniwetok.
    (2) Leads to areas not listed above may be dispatched to other units 
of the investigative agency or even to another military agency's field 
units if there is an agreement or memorandum of understanding that 
provides for such action. For case accountability purposes, copies of 
such ``lateral'' leads must be sent to the PIC.
    (3) Leads that cannot be dispatched as described in paragraph (2) 
above, and those that must be sent to a non-DoD investigative agency 
should be sent to PIC for disposition.
    f. The Defense Investigative Manual calls for obtaining PIC approval 
before conducting a Subject interview on a post-adjudicative 
investigation. To avoid the delay that compliance with this procedure 
would create, a

[[Page 695]]

military investigative component may conduct the interview provided:
    (1) All other investigative leads have been completed and reviewed.
    (2) The CCN has been received, signifying DIS concurrence with the 
appropriateness of the investigation.
    (3) Contrary instructions have not been received from the PIC.
    (4) The interview is limited to the resolution of the relevant 
issues disclosed by the investigation.
    g. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs f.(1) through (4) of 
this Appendix, if time is of the essence due to imminent transfer of the 
subject, a subject interview may be conducted at the discretion of the 
investigative agency.

                    7. Case Responsibility LAA and PA

    Paragraph 3, above, describes the advantages of timely handling 
which accrue when the military investigative components act for DIS 
overseas. These actions for DIS may, however, be limited by the 
component's staffing and resource limitations, especially since some 
cases require more administration and management than others. Post-
adjudication case leads, for instance, will normally be within the 
geographical jurisdiction of the component that accepted the request for 
investigation; therefore, relatively little case management is required. 
In contrast, LAA cases may require leads world-wide, and, therefore, 
create more complex case management and administration, especially in 
the tracking, monitoring and reviewing of leads outside the component's 
geographical area. Accordingly, an investigative component will accept 
the case from the requester, but only assign itself the appropriate 
leads within its own geographical jurisdiction and send the balance to 
PIC for appropriate disposition in accordance with the following:
    a. The investigative agency will accept the request for 
investigation (thereby saving time otherwise lost in mailing to PIC) but 
limit its involvement in case management by extracting only those leads 
it will conduct or manage locally.
    b. The agency should then prepare an ALS that shows clearly what 
leads it will cover and send PIC a copy of this ALS, along with the 
request for investigation and any other appropriate documentation. It 
must be clear in the ALS that PIC is to act on all those leads that the 
unit has not assigned to itself.
    c. PIC, as case manager, will assume responsibility for the complete 
investigative package and, upon receipt of the last lead, will send the 
results to the appropriate activity.
    d. The agency that accepted the case and assigned itself leads may 
send a copy of its report to the activity in the ``Results to'' block at 
the same time it sends the originals to PIC. If so, the letter of 
transmittal must inform the recipient that these reports are only a 
portion of the investigation, and that the balance will be forthcoming 
from PIC. Similarly, PIC must be informed of which investigative reports 
were disseminated. (This is normally done by sending PIC a copy of the 
letter of transmittal.)

                                8. Scope

    a. LAA. The scope of investigation is 10 years or from age 18, 
whichever is the shortest period.
    b. Post-Adjudication Cases. There is no standard scope. The 
inquiries conducted will be limited to those necessary to resolve the 
issue(s).

                       9. Case Closing: LAA and PA

    a. Whether the investigative component or PIC closes out an 
investigation, there are three key elements to consider:
    (1) The investigative results must be reviewed for quality and 
conformance to policy.
    (2) The results must be sent to the activity listed in the ``Results 
to'' block of the DD Form 1879.
    (3) PIC must be informed whether or not any dissemination was made 
by the investigative agency and, if so, what reports were furnished.
    b. Investigative results may also be sent to a requester or higher 
level activity that makes a statement of need for the results. In such 
instances, a copy of the letter requesting the results and the 
corresponding letter of transmittal must be sent to PIC for retention.
    c. When an investigative agency disseminates reports for PIC, it may 
use the transmittal documents, letters, or cover sheets it customarily 
uses for its own cases.
    d. The material that is to be provided to PIC will consist of: The 
originals of all reports, and all other case documentation such as 
original statements, confidential source sheets, interview logs, 
requests for investigation, letters of transmittal to adjudicaters/
requesters, or communications with the requester, such as those that 
modify the scope of the investigation.
    e. For DIS to fulfill its responsibilities under DoD 5220.22-R and 
the Privacy Act of 1974 all inquiries conducted in its behalf must be 
set forth in an ROI for the permanent file, whether the case is 
completed, terminated early, or referred to another agency.

                              10. Referral

    A case may require premature closing at any time after receipt of 
the DD Form 1879 by the investigative component if the information 
accompanying the request, or that which is later developed, is outside 
DIS jurisdiction. For example, alleged violations of

[[Page 696]]

law, a counterintelligence matter, or actual coercion/influence in a 
hostage situation (see paragraph 4.b. of this Appendix ) must be 
referred to the appropriate agency, and DIS involvement terminated. The 
requester will be informed by letter or indorsement to the DD Form 1879 
of the information developed that, due to jurisdictional consideration, 
the case was referred to (fill in appropriate address) and that the DIS 
case is closed. The agency to which referral was made and PIC will be 
furnished with the results of all investigations conducted under DIS 
auspices. DIS, however, has an interest in the referral agency's actions 
and no information should be solicited from that agency.

    Appendix J to Part 154--ADP Position Categories and Criteria for 
                          Designating Positions

    OMB Circular A-71 (and Transmittal Memo <greek-i>B1), July 1978 OMB 
Circular A-130, December 12, 1985, and FPM Letter 732, November 14, 1978 
contain the criteria for designating positions under the existing 
categories used in the personnel security program for Federal civilian 
employees as well as the criteria for designating ADP and ADP related 
positions. This policy is outlined below:

                         ADP Position Categories

                     1. Critical-Sensitive Positions

    ADP-I positions. Those positions in which the incumbent is 
responsible for the planning, direction, and implementation of a 
computer security program; major responsibility for the direction, 
planning and design of a computer system, including the hardware and 
software; or, can access a system during the operation or maintenance in 
such a way, and with a relatively high risk for causing grave damage, or 
realize a significant personal gain.

                   2. Noncritical-Sensitive Positions

    ADP-II positions. Those positions in which the incumbent is 
responsible for the direction, planning, design, operation, or 
maintenance of a computer system, and whose work is technically reviewed 
by a higher authority of the ADP-I category to insure the integrity of 
the system.

                        3. Nonsensitive Positions

    ADP-III positions. All other positions involved in computer 
activities.
    In establishing the categories of positions, other factors may enter 
into the determination, permitting placement in higher or lower 
categories based on the agency's judgement as to the unique 
characteristics of the system or the safeguards protecting the system.

                   Criteria for Designating Positions

    Three categories have been established for designating computer and 
computer-related positions--ADP-I, ADP-II, and ADP-III. Specific 
criteria for assigning positions to one of these categories is as 
follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Category                             Criteria
------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADP-I..........................  Responsibility or the development and

                                  direction and control of risk analysis
                                  and/or threat assessment.
                                 Significant involvement in life-
                                  critical or mission-critical systems.

                                  approval of data for input into a
                                  system which does not necessarily
                                  involve personal access to the system,
                                  but with relatively high risk for
                                  effecting grave damage or realizing

                                  technical review by higher authority
                                  in the ADP-I category to ensure the
                                  integrity of the system.
                                 Positions involving major
                                  responsibility for the direction

    This part:
    (a) Applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Military 
Departments, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Joint 
Staff, the Inspector General of the Department of Defense (IG, DoD), and 
the Defense Agencies (hereafter referred to collectively as ``the DoD 
Components'').
    (b) By mutual agreement, also extends to other Federal Agencies that 
include:
    (1) Department of Agriculture.
    (2) Department of Commerce.
    (3) Department of Interior.
    (4) Department of Justice.
    (5) Department of Labor.

    (17) United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.
    (18) United States Information Agency.
    (19) United States International Trade Commission.
    (20) United States Trade Representative.
    (c) Applies to cases that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance 
Office (DISCO) forwards to the ``Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA)'' for action under this part to determine whether it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the applicant.
    (d) Provides a program that may be extended to other security cases 
at the direction of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, 
Control, Communications, and Intelligence (ASD(C\3\I)).
    (e) Does not apply to cases in which:
    (1) A security clearance is withdrawn because the applicant no 
longer has a need for access to classified information;
    (2) An interim security clearance is withdrawn by the DISCO during 
an investigation; or
    (3) A security clearance is withdrawn for administrative reasons 
that are without prejudice as to a later determination of whether the 
grant or continuance of the applicant's security clearance would be 
clearly consistent with the national interest.
    (f) Does not apply to cases for access to sensitive compartmented 
information or a special access program.

[57 FR 5383, Feb. 14, 1992, as amended at 59 FR 35464, July 12, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 155.3  Definitions.

    (a) Applicant. Any U.S. citizen who holds or requires a security 
clearance or any immigrant alien who holds or requires a limited access 
authorization for access to classified information needed in connection 
with his or her employment in the private sector; any U.S. citizen who 
is a direct-hire employee or selectee for a position with the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and who holds or requires NATO 
certificates of security clearance or security assurances for access to 
U.S. or foreign classified information; or any U.S. citizen nominated by

[[Page 698]]

the Red Cross or United Service Organizations for assignment with the 
Military Services overseas. The term ``applicant'' does not apply to 
those U.S. citizens who are seconded to NATO by U.S. Departments and 
Agencies or to U.S. citizens recruited through such Agencies in response 
to a request from NATO.
    (b) Clearance Decision. A decision made in accordance with this part 
concerning whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant an applicant a security clearance for access to Confidential, 
Secret, or Top Secret information. A favorable clearance decision 
establishes eligibility of the applicant to be granted a security 
clearance for access at the level governed by the documented need for 
such access, and the type of investigation specified for that level in 
32 CFR part 154. An unfavorable clearance decision denies any 
application for a security clearance and revokes any existing security 
clearance, thereby preventing access to classified information at any 
level and the retention of any existing security clearance.


<R05>
Sec. 155.4  Policy.

    It is DoD policy that:
    (a) All proceedings provided for by this part shall be conducted in 
a fair and impartial manner.
    (b) A clearance decision reflects the basis for an ultimate finding 
as to whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for the applicant.
    (c) Except as otherwise provided for by E.O. 10865, as amended, or 
this part, a final unfavorable clearance decision shall not be made 
without first providing the applicant with:
    (1) Notice of specific reasons for the proposed action.
    (2) An opportunity to respond to the reasons.
    (3) Notice of the right to a hearing and the opportunity to cross-
examine persons providing information adverse to the applicant.
    (4) Opportunity to present evidence on his or her own behalf, or to 
be represented by counsel or personal representative.
    (5) Written notice of final clearance decisions.
    (6) Notice of appeal procedures.
    (d) Actions pursuant to this part shall cease upon termination of 
the applicant's need for access to classified information except in 
those cases in which:
    (1) A hearing has commenced;
    (2) A clearance decision has been issued; or
    (3) The applicant's security clearance was suspended and the 
applicant provided a written request that the case continue.

otherwise comply with the procedures authorized by this part. The 
applicant may elect on constitutional or other grounds not to comply; 
but refusal or failure to furnish or authorize the providing of relevant 
and material information or otherwise cooperate at any stage in the 
investigation or adjudicative process may prevent the DOHA from making a 
clearance decision. If an applicant fails or refuses to:
    (1) Provide relevant and material information or to authorize others 
to provide such information; or
    (2) Proceed in a timely or orderly fashion in accordance with this 
part; or
    (3) Follow directions of an Administrative Judge or the Appeal 
Board; then the Director, DOHA, or designee, may revoke any security 
clearance held by the applicant and discontinue case processing. 
Requests for resumption of case processing and reinstatement of a 
security clearance may be approved by the Director, DOHA, only upon a 
showing of good cause. If the request is denied, in whole or in part, 
the decision is final and bars reapplication for a security clearance 
for 1 year from the date of the revocation.
    (c) Each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common 
sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria in 32 CFR 154.7 and 
adjudication policy in appendix H to 32 CFR part 154, including as 
appropriate:
    (1) Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding 
circumstances.
    (2) Frequency and recency of the conduct.
    (3) Age of the applicant.
    (4) Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct 
was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the 
consequences involved.
    (5) Absence or presence of rehabilitation.
    (6) Probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or 
recur in the future.

[[Page 700]]

    (d) Whenever there is a reasonable basis for concluding that an 
applicant's continued access to classified information poses an imminent 
threat to the national interest, any security clearance held by the 
applicant may be suspended by the ASD(C\3\I), with the concurrence of 
the GC, DoD, pending a final clearance decision. This suspension may be 
rescinded by the same authorities upon presentation of additional 
information that conclusively demonstrates that an imminent threat to 
the national interest no longer exists. Procedures in appendix A to this 
part shall be expedited whenever an applicant's security clearance has 
been suspended pursuant to this section.
    (e) Nothing contained in this part shall limit or affect the 
responsibility and powers of the Secretary of Defense or the head of 
another Department or Agency to deny or revoke a security clearance when 
the security of the nation so requires. Such authority may not be 
delegated and may be exercised only when the Secretary of Defense or the 
head of another Department or Agency determines that the hearing 
procedures and other provisions of this part cannot be invoked 
consistent with the national security. Such a determination shall be 
conclusive.
    (f) Additional procedural guidance is in appendix A to this part.

[57 FR 5383, Feb. 14, 1992, as amended at 59 FR 35464, July 12, 1994]

         Appendix A to Part 155--Additional Procedural Guidance

    1. When the DISCO cannot affirmatively find that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for an applicant, the case will be promptly referred to the 
DOHA.
    2. Upon referral, the DOHA shall make a prompt determination whether 
to grant or continue a security clearance, issue a statement of reasons 
(SOR) as to why it is not clearly consistent with the national interest 
to do so, or take interim actions, including but not limited to:
    a. Direct further investigation.
    b. Propound written interrogatories to the applicant or other 
persons with relevant information.
    c. Requiring the applicant to undergo a medical evaluation by a DoD 
Psychiatric Consultant.
    d. Interviewing the applicant.
    3. An unfavorable clearance decision shall not be made unless the 
applicant has been provided with a written SOR that shall be as detailed 
and comprehensive as the national security permits. A letter of 
instruction with the SOR shall explain that the applicant or Department 
Counsel may request a hearing. It shall also explain the adverse 
consequences for failure to respond to the SOR within the prescribed 
time frame.
    4. The applicant must submit a detailed written answer to the SOR 
under oath or affirmation that shall admit or deny each listed 
allegation. A general denial or other similar answer is insufficient. To 
be entitled to a hearing, the applicant must specifically request a 
hearing in his or her answer. The answer must be received by the DOHA 
within 20 days from receipt of the SOR. Requests for an extension of 
time to file an answer may be submitted to the Director, DOHA, or 
designee, who in turn may grant the extension only upon a showing of 
good cause.
    5. If the applicant does not file a timely and responsive answer to 
the SOR, the Director, DOHA, or designee, may discontinue processing the 
case, deny issuance of the requested security clearance, and direct the 
DISCO to revoke any security clearance held by the applicant.
    6. Should review of the applicant's answer to the SOR indicate that 
allegations are unfounded, or evidence is insufficient for further 
processing, Department Counsel shall take such action as appropriate 
under the circumstances, including but not limited to withdrawal of the 
SOR and transmittal to the Director for notification of the DISCO for 
appropriate action.
    7. If the applicant has not requested a hearing with his or her 
answer to the SOR and Department Counsel has not requested a hearing 
within 20 days of receipt of the applicant's answer, the case shall be 
assigned to an Administrative Judge for a clearance decision based on 
the written record. Department Counsel shall provide the applicant with 
a copy of all relevant and material information that could be adduced at 
a hearing. The applicant shall have 30 days from receipt of the 
information in which to submit a documentary response setting forth 
objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation, as 
appropriate.
    8. If a hearing is requested by the applicant or Department Counsel, 
the case shall be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a clearance 
decision based on the hearing record. Following issuance of a notice of 
hearing by the Administrative Judge, or designee, the applicant shall 
appear in person with or without counsel or a personal representative at 
a time and place designated by the notice of hearing. The applicant 
shall have a reasonable time to prepare his or her case. The applicant 
shall be notified at least 15 days in advance of the time and place of

[[Page 701]]

the hearing, which generally shall be held at a location in the United 
States within a metropolitan area near the applicant's place of 
employment or residence. A continuance may be granted by the 
Administrative Judge only for good cause. Hearings may be held outside 
of the United States in NATO cases, or in other cases upon a finding of 
good cause by the Director, DOHA, or designee.
    9. The Administrative Judge may require a prehearing conference.
    10. The Administrative Judge may rule on questions of procedure, 
discovery, and evidence and shall conduct all proceedings in a fair, 
timely, and orderly manner.
    11. Discovery by the applicant is limited to non-privileged 
documents and materials subject to control by the DOHA. Discovery by 
Department Counsel after issuance of an SOR may be granted by the 
Administrative Judge only upon a showing of good cause.
    12. A hearing shall be open except when the applicant requests that 
it be closed, or when the Administrative Judge determines that there is 
a need to protect classified information or there is other good cause 
for keeping the proceeding closed. No inference shall be drawn as to the 
merits of a case on the basis of a request that the hearing be closed.
    13. As far in advance as practical, Department Counsel and the 
applicant shall serve one another with a copy of any pleading, proposed 
documentary evidence, or other written communication to be submitted to 
the Administrative Judge.
    14. Department Counsel is responsible for presenting witnesses and 
other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been 
controverted.
    15. The applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other 
evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the 
applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden 
of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.
    16. Witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination.
    17. The SOR may be amended at the hearing by the Administrative 
Judge on his or her own motion, or upon motion by Department Counsel or 
the applicant, so as to render it in conformity with the evidence 
admitted or for other good cause. When such amendments are made, the 
Administrative Judge may grant either party's request for such 
additional time as the Administrative Judge may deem appropriate for 
further preparation or other good cause.
    18. The Administrative Judge hearing the case shall notify the 
applicant and all witnesses testifying that 18 U.S.C. 1001 is 
applicable.
    19. The Federal Rules of Evidence (28 U.S.C. 101 et seq.) shall 
serve as a guide. Relevant and material evidence may be received subject 
to rebuttal, and technical rules of evidence may be relaxed, except as 
otherwise provided herein, to permit the development of a full and 
complete record.
    20. Official records or evidence compiled or created in the regular 
course of business, other than DoD personnel background reports of 
investigation (ROI), may be received and considered by the 
Administrative Judge without authenticating witnesses, provided that 
such information has been furnished by an investigative agency pursuant 
to its responsibilities in connection with assisting the Secretary of 
Defense, or the Department or Agency head concerned, to safeguard 
classified information within industry under to E.O. 10865, as amended. 
An ROI may be received with an authenticating witness provided it is 
otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence (28 U.S.C. 101 
et seq.).
    21. Records that cannot be inspected by the applicant because they 
are classified may be received and considered by the Administrative 
Judge, provided the GC, DoD, has:
    a. Made a preliminary determination that such evidence appears to be 
relevant and material.
    b. Determined that failure to receive and consider such evidence 
would be substantially harmful to the national security.
    22. A written or oral statement adverse to the applicant on a 
controverted issue may be received and considered by the Administrative 
Judge without affording an opportunity to cross-examine the person 
making the statement orally, or in writing when justified by the 
circumstances, only in either of the following circumstances:
    a. If the head of the Department or Agency supplying the statement 
certifies that the person who furnished the information is a 
confidential informant who has been engaged in obtaining intelligence 
information for the Government and that disclosure of his or her 
identity would be substantially harmful to the national interest; or
    b. If the GC, DoD, has determined the statement concerned appears to 
be relevant, material, and reliable; failure to receive and consider the 
statement would be substantially harmful to the national security; and 
the person who furnished the information cannot appear to testify due to 
the following:
    (1) Death, severe illness, or similar cause, in which case the 
identity of the person and the information to be considered shall be 
made available to the applicant; or
    (2) Some other cause determined by the Secretary of Defense, or when 
appropriate by the Department or Agency head, to be good and sufficient.
    23. Whenever evidence is received under item 21. or 22., the 
applicant shall be furnished with as comprehensive and detailed a 
summary of the information as the national security permits. The 
Administrative Judge

[[Page 702]]

and Appeal Board may make a clearance decision either favorable or 
unfavorable to the applicant based on such evidence after giving 
appropriate consideration to the fact that the applicant did not have an 
opportunity to confront such evidence, but any final determination 
adverse to the applicant shall be made only by the Secretary of Defense, 
or the Department or Agency head, based on a personal review of the case 
record.
    24. A verbatim transcript shall be made of the hearing. The 
applicant shall be furnished one copy of the transcript, less the 
exhibits, without cost.
    25. The Administrative Judge shall make a written clearance decision 
in a timely manner setting forth pertinent findings of fact, policies, 
and conclusions as to the allegations in the SOR, and whether it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for the applicant. The applicant and Department 
Counsel shall each be provided a copy of the clearance decision. In 
cases in which evidence is received under items 21. and 22., the 
Administrative Judge's written clearance decision may require deletions 
in the interest of national security.
    26. If the Administrative Judge decides that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest for the applicant to be granted or 
to retain a security clearance, the DISCO shall be so notified by the 
Director, DOHA, or designee, when the clearance decision becomes final 
in accordance with item 36., below.
    27. If the Administrative Judge decides that it is not clearly 
consistent with the national interest for the applicant to be granted or 
to retain a security clearance, the Director, DOHA, or designee, shall 
expeditiously notify the DISCO, which shall in turn notify the 
applicant's employer of the denial or revocation of the applicant's 
security clearance. The letter forwarding the Administrative Judge's 
clearance decision to the applicant shall advise the applicant that 
these actions are being taken, and that the applicant may appeal the 
Administrative Judge's clearance decision.
    28. The applicant or Department Counsel may appeal the 
Administrative Judge's clearance decision by filing a written notice of 
appeal with the Appeal Board within 15 days after the date of the 
Administrative Judge's clearance decision. A notice of appeal received 
after 15 days from the date of the clearance decision shall not be 
accepted by the Appeal Board, or designated Board Member, except for 
good cause. A notice of cross appeal may be filed with the Appeal Board 
within 10 days of receipt of the notice of appeal. An untimely cross 
appeal shall not be accepted by the Appeal Board, or designated Board 
Member, except for good cause.
    29. Upon receipt of a notice of appeal, the Appeal Board shall be 
provided the case record. No new evidence shall be received or 
considered by the Appeal Board.
    30. After filing a timely notice of appeal, a written appeal brief 
must be received by the Appeal Board within 45 days from the date of the 
Administrative Judge's clearance decision. The appeal brief must state 
the specific issue or issues being raised, and cite specific portions of 
the case record supporting any alleged error. A written reply brief, if 
any, must be filed within 20 days from receipt of the appeal brief. A 
copy of any brief filed must be served upon the applicant or Department 
Counsel, as appropriate.
    31. Requests for extension of time for submission of briefs may be 
submitted to the Appeal Board or designated Board Member.
    A copy of any request for extension of time must be served on the 
opposing party at the time of submission. The Appeal Board, or 
designated Board Member, shall be responsible for controlling the Appeal 
Board's docket, and may enter an order dismissing an appeal in an 
appropriate case or vacate such an order upon a showing of good cause.
    32. The Appeal Board shall address the material issues raised by the 
parties to determine whether harmful error occurred. Its scope of review 
shall be to determine whether or not:
    a. The Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported by such 
relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same 
record. In making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to 
the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge;
    b. The Administrative Judge adhered to the procedures required by 
E.O. 10865, as amended and this part; or
    c. The Administrative Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary, 
capricious, or contrary to law.
    33. The Appeal Board shall issue a written clearance decision 
addressing the material issues raised on appeal. The Appeal Board shall 
have authority to:
    a. Affirm the decision of the Administrative Judge;
    b. Remand the case to an Administrative Judge to correct identified 
error. If the case is remanded, the Appeal Board shall specify the 
action to be taken on remand; or
    c. Reverse the decision of the Administrative Judge if correction of 
identified error mandates such action.
    34. A copy of the Appeal Board's written clearance decision shall be 
provided to the parties. In cases in which evidence was received under 
items 21. and 22., the Appeal Board's clearance decision may require 
deletions in the interest of national security.

[[Page 703]]

    35. Upon remand, the case file shall be assigned to an 
Administrative Judge for correction of error(s) in accordance with the 
Appeal Board's clearance decision. The assigned Administrative Judge 
shall make a new clearance decision in the case after correcting the 
error(s) identified by the Appeal Board. The Administrative Judge's 
clearance decision after remand shall be provided to the parties. The 
clearance decision after remand may be appealed pursuant to items 28. to 
35.
    36. A clearance decision shall be considered final when:
    a. A security clearance is granted or continued pursuant to item 2.;
    b. No timely notice of appeal is filed;
    c. No timely appeal brief is filed after a notice of appeal has been 
filed;
    d. The appeal has been withdrawn;
    e. When the Appeal Board affirms or reverses an Administrative 
Judge's clearance decision; or
    f. When a decision has been made by the Secretary of Defense, or the 
Department or Agency head, under item 23.
    The Director, DOHA, or designee, shall notify the DISCO of all final 
clearance decisions.
    37. An applicant whose security clearance has been finally denied or 
revoked by the DOHA is barred from reapplication for 1 year from the 
date of the initial unfavorable clearance decision.
    38. A reapplication for a security clearance must be made initially 
by the applicant's employer to the DISCO and is subject to the same 
processing requirements as those for a new security clearance 
application. The applicant shall thereafter be advised he is responsible 
for providing the Director, DOHA, with a copy of any adverse clearance 
decision together with evidence that circumstances or conditions 
previously found against the applicant have been rectified or 
sufficiently mitigated to warrant reconsideration.
    39. If the Director, DOHA, determines that reconsideration is 
warranted, the case shall be subject to this part for making a clearance 
decision.
    40. If the Director, DOHA, determines that reconsideration is not 
warranted, the DOHA shall notify the applicant of this decision. Such a 
decision is final and bars further reapplication for an additional one 
year period from the date of the decision rejecting the application.
    41. Nothing in this part is intended to give an applicant reapplying 
for a security clearance any greater rights than those applicable to any 
other applicant under this part.
    42. An applicant may file a written petition, under oath or 
affirmation, for reimbursement of loss of earnings resulting from the 
suspension, revocation, or denial of his or her security clearance. The 
petition for reimbursement must include as an attachment the favorable 
clearance decision and documentation supporting the reimbursement claim. 
The Director, DOHA, or designee, may in his or her discretion require 
additional information from the petitioner.
    43. Claims for reimbursement must be filed with the Director, DOHA, 
or designee, within 1 year after the date the security clearance is 
granted. Department Counsel generally shall file a response within 60 
days after receipt of applicant's petition for reimbursement and provide 
a copy thereof to the applicant.
    44. Reimbursement is authorized only if the applicant demonstrates 
by clear and convincing evidence to the Director, DOHA, that all of the 
following conditions are met:
    a. The suspension, denial, or revocation was the primary cause of 
the claimed pecuniary loss; and
    b. The suspension, denial, or revocation was due to gross negligence 
of the Department of Defense at the time the action was taken, and not 
in any way by the applicant's failure or refusal to cooperate.
    45. The amount of reimbursement shall not exceed the difference 
between the earnings of the applicant at the time of the suspension, 
revocation, or denial and the applicant's interim earnings, and further 
shall be subject to reasonable efforts on the part of the applicant to 
mitigate any loss of earnings. No reimbursement shall be allowed for any 
period of undue delay resulting from the applicant's acts or failure to 
act. Reimbursement is not authorized for loss of merit raises and 
general increases, loss of employment opportunities, counsel's fees, or 
other costs relating to proceedings under this part.
    46. Claims approved by the Director, DOHA, shall be forwarded to the 
Department or Agency concerned for payment. Any payment made in response 
to a claim for reimbursement shall be in full satisfaction of any 
further claim against the United States or any Federal Department or 
Agency, or any of its officers or employees.
    47. Clearance decisions issued by Administrative Judges and the 
Appeal Board shall be indexed and made available in redacted form to the 
public.

COMSEC Committee Policies, COMSEC Resources Program documents, COMSEC 
Equipment Engineering Bulletins, COMSEC Equipment System Descriptions, 
and COMSEC Technical Bulletins.
    (ii) Those that relate to SIGINT. These appear as reports in various 
formats that bear security classifications, sometimes followed by five-
letter codewords (World War II's ULTRA, for example) and often carrying 
warning caveats such as ``This document contains codeword material'' and 
``Utmost secrecy is necessary . . .'' Formats may appear as messages 
having addressees, ``from'' and ``to'' sections, and as summaries with 
SIGINT content with or without other kinds of intelligence and comment.
    (iii) RDT&E reports and information that relate to either COMSEC or 
SIGINT.

identified in Sec. 158.7 of this part shall apply to Air Force 
information.


<R05>
Sec. 158.11  Declassification considerations.

    (a) Technological developments; widespread public knowledge of the 
subject matter; changes in military plans, operations, systems, or 
equipment; changes in the foreign relations or defense commitments of 
the United States; and similar events may bear upon the determination of 
whether information should be declassified. If the responsible DoD 
reviewer decides that, in view of such circumstances, the public 
disclosure of the information being reviewed no longer would result in 
damage to the national security, the information shall be declassified.
    (b) The following are examples of considerations that may be 
appropriate in deciding whether information in the categories listed in 
Sec. Sec. 158.7 through 158.10 may be declassified when it is reviewed:
    (1) The information no longer provides the United States a 
scientific, engineering, technical, operational, intelligence, 
strategic, or tactical advantage over other nations.
    (2) The operational military capability of the United States 
revealed by the information no longer constitutes a limitation on the 
effectiveness of the Armed Forces.
    (3) The information is pertinent to a system that no longer is used 
or relied on for the defense of the United States

[[Page 711]]

or its allies and does not disclose the capabilities or vulnerabilities 
of existing operational systems.
    (4) The program, project, or system information no longer reveals a 
current weakness or vulnerability.
    (5) The information pertains to an intelligence objective or 
diplomatic initiative that has been abandoned or achieved and will no 
longer damage the foreign relations of the United States.
    (6) The information reveals the fact or identity of a U.S. 
intelligence source, method, or capability that no longer is employed 
and that relates to no current source, method, or capability that upon 
disclosure could cause damage to national security or place a person in 
immediate jeopardy.
    (7) The information concerns foreign relations matters whose 
disclosure can no longer be expected to cause or increase international 
tension to the detriment of the national security of the United States.
    (c) Declassification of information that reveals the identities of 
clandestine human agents shall be accomplished only in accordance with 
procedures established by the Director of Central Intelligence for that 
purpose.
    (d) The NSA/CSS is the sole authority for the review and 
declassification of classified cryptologic information. The procedures 
established by the NSA/CSS to facilitate the review and declassification 
of classified cryptologic information are:
    (1) COMSEC documents and materials. (i) If records or materials in 
this category are found in agency files that are not under COMSEC 
control, refer them to the senior COMSEC authority of the agency 
concerned or by appropriate channels to the following address: Director, 
National Security Agency, Attn: Director of Policy (Q4), Fort George G. 
Meade, Maryland 20755.
    (ii) If the COMSEC information has been incorporated into other 
documents by the receiving agency, referral to the NSA/CSS is necessary 
before declassification.
    (2) SIGINT information. (i) If the SIGINT information is contained 
in a document or record originated by a DoD cryptologic organization, 
such as the NSA/CSS, and is in the files of a noncryptologic agency, 
such material will not be declassified if retained in accordance with an 
approved records disposition schedule. If the material must be retained, 
it shall be referred to the NSA/CSS for systematic review for 
declassification.
    (ii) If the SIGINT information has been incorporated by the 
receiving agency into documents it produces, referral to the NSA/CSS is 
necessary before any declassification.

<R05>
Sec. 162.2  Applicability and scope.

    This part.

[[Page 716]]

    (a) Applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD); the 
Military Departments; Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Joint 
Staff; the Defense Agencies; and the DoD Field Activities (hereafter 
referred to collectively as the ``DoD Components'').
    (b) Encompasses the acquisition of equipment and facilities to 
improve the following:
    (1) Productivity, quality, and processes of DoD Components including 
major facilities, equipment, or process modernization.
    (2) Performance of individual jobs, tasks, procedures, operations, 
and processes.
    (c) Encompasses PIF investments at appropriated and industrially 
funded activities, if they are not participating in the Defense Business 
Operations Fund. For industrially funded activities, projects may be 
submitted for PIF on an exception basis; primarily, this includes 
facilities, multi-function projects, prototypes, demonstrations, and 
cross-service initiatives. Investments at Government-owned, contractor-
operated (GOCO) facilities are limited to those for which the Department 
of Defense has responsibility to provide equipment or facilities and 
from which productivity benefits can be recovered within existing 
contractual provisions.


<R05>
Sec. 162.3  Definition.

    (a) Capital Investment. The acquisition, installation, 
transportation, and other costs needed to place equipment or facilities 
in operation meeting DoD capitalization requirements.
    (b) Economic Life. The time period over which the benefits to be 
gained from a project may reasonably be expected to accrue to the 
Department of Defense.
    (c) Internal Rate of Return (IRR). The discount rate that equates 
the present value of the future cash inflows, e.g. savings and cost 
avoidances, with the present value costs of an investment.
    (d) Life-Cycle Savings. The estimated cumulative budgetary savings 
expected over the life of the project.
    (e) Net Present Value of Investment. The difference between the 
present value benefit and the present value cost at a given discount 
rate.
    (f) Off-the-Shelf. Equipment that is readily available through 
Government or commercial sources or that can be fabricated through 
combination or modification of existing equipment.
    (g) Pay-Back Period. The number of years required for the cumulative 
savings to have the same value as the investment cost.
    (h) PECI Benefits. Benefits resulting from PECIs are classified as 
savings or as cost avoidance:
    (1) Savings. Benefits that can be precisely measured, quantified, 
and placed under management control at time of realization. Savings can 
be reflected as specific reductions in the approved program or budget, 
after they have been achieved. Examples include costs for manpower 
authorizations and or funded work-year reductions, reduced or eliminated 
operating costs (utilities, travel, and repair), and reduced or 
eliminated parts and contracts.
    (2) Cost-Avoidance. Benefits from actions that obviate the 
requirements for an increase in future levels of manpower or costs that 
would be necessary, if present management practices were continued. The 
effect of cost-avoidance savings is the achievement of a higher level of 
readiness or increased value (quantity, quality or timeliness) of output 
at level staffing cost or the absorption of a growing work load at the 
same level of staffing or cost.
    (i) Post-Investment Assessment (PIA). A PIA is conducted by DoD 
Components to establish accountability and provide information to 
improve future investment strategies.
    (j) Productivity. The efficiency with which resources are used to 
provide a government service or product at specified levels of quality 
and timeliness.
    (k) Productivity Enhancement (or Productivity Improvement). A 
decrease in the unit cost of products and services delivered with equal 
or better levels of quality and timeliness.
    (l) Productivity Enhancing Capital Investment (PECI). Equipment or 
facility funding that shall improve Government service, products, 
quality, or timeliness. PECI projects are funded using PIF, PEIF, and 
CSI programs. These programs are defined as follows:
    (1) Productivity Investment Fund (PIF). PIF projects cost over 
$100,000 and

[[Page 717]]

must amortize within 4 years from the date they become operational. In 
FY 1994 the threshold changes to $150,000.
    (2) Productivity Enhancing Incentive Fund (PEIF). PEIF projects cost 
under $100,000 and are expected to amortize within 2 years of the date 
they become operational. In FY 1994 the limit changes to $150,000.
    (3) Component-Sponsored Investment (CSI). CSI projects are fast pay-
back or high interest investments that may have different DoD Component 
selection criteria than those specified for PIF or PEIF projects.
    (m) Quality. The extent to which a product or service meets customer 
requirements and customer expectations.


<R05>
Sec. 162.4  Policy.

    It is DoD Policy that:
    (a) The PECI program shall be an integral part of DoD Component 
investment planning and of the Defense Planning, Programming, and 
Budgeting System (PPBS) DoD Instruction 7045.7.\4\ PECI planning shall 
include the productivity investment fund (PIF), the productivity 
enhancing incentive fund (PEIF), and component-sponsored investments 
(CSIs). The PECI program is a major DoD strategy to achieve productivity 
goals under E.O. 12637.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 162.1(a).
    \5\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 162.1(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) PECI projects shall be selected to improve quality and 
productivity, or to reduce unit cost of outputs in defense operations. 
PECI projects shall be evaluated and approved for funding based on 
recognized principles of economic analysis. Each PECI project shall be 
subject to all restrictions established by public law, DoD policy, and 
other regulatory constraints.
    (c) DoD personnel at all levels shall be encouraged to seek out and 
identify opportunities for quality and productivity improvement. Those 
efforts shall be supported by using the PECI as a means of financing the 
improvements. The PECI Program shall provide incentives for 
participation, supported by the financial management system and 
policies.
    (d) Individuals or groups who successfully identify PECI 
opportunities that result in significant savings or improvements in 
quality or productivity or who aggressively promote PECI incentives 
within their organizations should be recognized through the DoD 
Incentive Awards Program, DoD Instruction 5120.16,\6\ the Secretary of 
Defense Productivity Excellence Awards Program, performance appraisal, 
or other appropriate means. All these savings derived through PECI will 
remain with the originating DoD Component. As an incentive a portion of 
these savings, when possible, should remain at the submitting activity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 162.1(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) Funds provided through FY 1993 from the centrally managed OSD 
PIF may not be reprogrammed for non-PIF purposes without prior approval 
of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Force Management and Personnel) 
(ASD(FM&P)). The Heads of DoD Components shall monitor obligation rates 
to ensure PIF projects are executed quickly. If project funding cannot 
be obligated within the specified fiscal year(s) for the type of 
funding, the Head of the DoD Component must reprogram PIF funds to 
alternate approved PIF projects. The PIF projects shall be monitored to 
ensure timely implementation and to validate savings through the 
amortization period. The PECIs are subject to audit as established by 
DoD Instruction 7600.2 \7\ (reference (g)) policy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 162.1(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 162.5  Responsibilities.

    (a) The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Force Management and 
Personnel (ASD (FM&P)) shall:
    (1) Develop policies and guidance for the overall DoD PECI program.
    (2) Maintain oversight of the PECI program to ensure implementation 
of this instruction. Through FY 1993 that oversight includes total 
process control and coordination of PIF actions to identify, select and 
approve, reprogram, and disapprove projects. Starting FY 1994 and ASD 
(FM&P) shall retain central oversight of the PECI program which is 
decentralized to the Components.
    (3) Evaluate program results and training requirements and provide 
additional guidance, as necessary.

[[Page 718]]

    (4) Develop, maintain, and publish a DoD 5010.36-H consistent with 
DoD 5025.1-M \8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 162.1(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (5) Coordinate PECI efforts with the Heads of the DoD Components on 
matters that affect their particular areas of responsibility.
    (6) Use the Defense Productivity Program Office (DPPO) to:
    (i) Provide technical guidance and support for PECI efforts.
    (ii) Monitor and evaluate DoD Component PECI efforts.
    (iii) Ensure compliance with DoD Directive 7750.5 \9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 162.1(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) The Inspector General of the Department of Defense (IG, DoD) 
shall provide policy and guidance for the audit of the PECI and 
incorporate the requirement for audit into audit planning and program 
documents.
    (c) The Heads of the DoD Components shall:
    (1) Develop and sustain a formal PECI program that:
    (i) Emphasizes and encourages the improvement of day-to-day 
operations through PECI funding.
    (ii) Provides motivation and opportunities for personnel, at all 
levels, to participate in the identification, documentation, and 
implementation of PECI proposals.
    (iii) Includes PIF, PEIF, and CSI efforts, as appropriate.
    (iv) Reviews and approves submitted projects, broadens project 
applicability when reasonable, applies off-the-shelf technology, and 
integrates capital investment planning into the PPBS.
    (2) Designate an official to be the central point of contact (POC) 
who shall oversee and monitor the PECI program.
    (3) Establish procedures ensuring that the policies contained in 
Sec. 162.4, above, are adhered to.


<R05>
Sec. 162.6  Procedures.

    The following procedures shall be followed by the DoD Components in 
the identification, documentation, selection, and financing of PECI 
projects:
    (a) Document each PECI project to ensure that it is:
    (1) A desirable action in accordance with the DoD Component's long-
range planning and programing objectives, quality objectives, and 
customer and/or user satisfaction.
    (2) Needed to perform and improve valid operations, functions, or 
services (as established by assigned missions and taskings) that cannot 
be performed as effectively or economically by other means, such as the 
use of existing facilities, methods, processes, or procedures.
    (3) Justified on the basis of a valid economic analysis done in 
accordance with DoD Instruction 7041.3.
    (4) Validated as to reasonableness, completeness, and correct 
appropriation.
    (5) Classified properly as having savings or cost avoidance benefits
    (b) Include resources for PECI in programming documents and budget 
submissions. The level of funding shall be established under quality and 
productivity plans and goals established by the Component.
    (c) Use guidelines for project documentation, pre-investment 
analysis, financing, and post-investment accountability of PECI 
projects, when DoD 5010.36-H is published.
    (d) Classify PECI projects for financing and aggregated reporting as 
follows:
    (1) PIF projects. PIF projects are competitively selected from 
candidate proposals and financed through traditional budget 
appropriation processes from funds set aside for this purpose. PIF 
projects must cost over $100,000 and must amortize within 4 years from 
the date that they become operational. Both equipment and facilities 
investments that conform to public law, or DoD policies governing their 
qualification, may be included. Projects may include a function at 
several activities or locations and be Service-wide or Agency-wide. In 
FY 1994 the threshold will change to $150,000.
    (2) PEIF projects. PEIF projects are financed from the DoD Component 
accounts established in annual appropriations and are expected to 
amortize within 2 years of the date they become operational. Funding for 
PEIF projects shall be included in the DoD Component annual 
appropriations as a single

[[Page 719]]

amount to cover projects, as they are proposed throughout the budget 
year. PEIF projects cannot exceed $100,000 or cost limitations 
established by the OSD (whichever is greater) and are limited to 
facility modification and acquisition of ``off-the shelf'' equipment 
requiring little or no modification before use. In FY 1994 the limit 
changes to $150,000. Justification for those projects shall be based on 
the potential to improve quality and productivity that is realized 
through improvements in operating methods, quality, processes, or 
procedures.
    (3) CSI. CSI projects are investments financed from the DoD 
Component accounts that may have longer amortization periods than the 
PEIF and may have different DoD Component cost or benefit criteria than 
those specified for PIF projects. The CSI projects shall be identified 
and included in the DoD Component's annual budget.


<R05>
Sec. 162.7  Information requirements.

    (a) DoD Components shall submit to the ASD (FM&P), by December 15th 
of each year, an annual status report on all PECI programs as outlined 
in appendix A to this part. The DoD Components shall maintain the data 
at a central point to support reporting requirements.
    (b) The Summary Report, ``PECI Program Status,'' is assigned Report 
Control Symbol FM&P (A) 1561, in accordance with DoD Directive 7750.5.

Sec. 165.1  Purpose.

    This part updates policy to conform with Public Law 90-629, ``Arms 
Export

[[Page 720]]

Control Act,'' October 22, 1968, as amended for calculating and 
assessing nonrecurring cost recoupment charges on sales of items 
developed for or by the Department of Defense to non-U.S. Government 
customers.


<R05>
Sec. 165.2  Applicability and scope.

    (a) This part applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the 
Military Departments, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the 
Joint Staff, the Unified and Specified Commands, the Defense Agencies, 
and the DoD Field Activities (hereafter referred to collectively as 
``the DoD Components'').
    (b) The provisions of this part do not apply to sales of excess 
property when accountability has been transferred to property disposal 
activities and the property is sold in open competition to the highest 
bidder.
    (c) The policies and procedures provided for in this part shall 
apply to all sales on or after January 13, 1993, and supersede 
application thresholds and charges previously established. Previous 
versions continue to govern sales made during applicable effective 
dates. Such previously established nonrecurring cost recoupment 
thresholds and charges shall be eliminated or revised in accordance with 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 165.3  Definitions.

    (a) Cost pool. Represents the total cost to be distributed across 
the specific number of units. The nonrecurring research, development, 
test, and evaluation cost pool comprises the costs described in 
paragraph (f), of this section. The nonrecurring production cost pool 
comprises costs described in paragraph (e), of this section.
    (b) Foreign military sale. A sale by the U.S. Government of defense 
items or defense services to a foreign government or international 
organization under authority of the ``Arms Export Control Act,'' Public 
Law No. 90-629 (1968) as amended. Except as waived by the Under 
Secretary of Defense for Policy, Foreign Military Sales are the only 
sales subject to nonrecurring cost recoupment charges.
    (c) Major defense equipment. Any item of significant military 
equipment on the United States Munitions List having a nonrecurring 
research, development, test, and evaluation cost of more than 50 million 
dollars or a total production cost of more than 200 million dollars. The 
determination of whether an item meets the major defense equipment 
dollar threshold for research, development, test, and evaluation shall 
be based on DoD obligations recorded to the date the equipment is 
offered for sale. Production costs shall include costs incurred by the 
Department of Defense. Production costs for the foreign military sales 
program and known direct commercial sales production are excluded.
    (d) Model. A basic alpha-numeric designation in a weapon system 
series; e.g., a ship hull series, an equipment or system series, a 
airframe series, or a vehicle series. For example, the F5A and the F5F 
are different models in the same F-5 system series.
    (e) Nonrecurring production costs. Those one-time costs incurred in 
support of previous production of the model specified and those costs 
specifically incurred in support of the total projected production run. 
Those nonrecurring cost include DoD expenditures for preproduction 
engineering; rate and special tooling; special test equipment; 
production engineering; product improvement; destructive testing; and 
pilot model production, testing, and evaluation. That includes costs of 
any engineering change proposals initiated before the date of 
calculations of the nonrecurring costs recoupment charge. Nonrecurring 
production costs do not include DoD expenditures for machine tools, 
capital equipment, or facilities for which contractor rental payments 
are made or waived in accordance with the DoD FAR Supplement.
    (f) Nonrecurring research, development, test, and evaluation costs. 
Those costs funded by a research, development, test, and evaluation 
appropriation to develop or improve the product or technology under 
consideration either through contract or in-house DoD effort. This 
includes costs of any engineering change proposal started before the 
date of calculation of the nonrecurring cost recoupment charges as well 
as projections of such costs, to the extent additional effort applicable 
to

[[Page 721]]

the sale model or technology is necessary or planned. It does not 
include costs funded by either procurement or operation and maintenance 
appropriations.
    (g) Pro rata recovery of nonrecurring costs. Equal distribution 
(proration) of a pool of nonrecurring cost to a specific number of units 
that benefit from the investment so that a DoD Component shall collect 
from a customer a fair (pro rata) share of the investment in the product 
being sold. The production quantity base used to determine the pro rata 
calculation of major defense equipment includes total production.
    (h) Significant change in nonrecurring cost recoupment charge. A 
significant change occurs as follows:
    (1) A new calculation shows a change of 30 percent of the current 
system nonrecurring cost charge.
    (2) The nonrecurring cost unit charge increases or decreases by 
50,000 dollars or more; or
    (3) Where the potential for a 5 million dollars change in recoupment 
exists. The total collections may be estimated based on the projected 
sales quantities. When potential collections increase or decrease by 5 
million dollars, a significant change occurs.
    (i) ``Special'' research, development, test, and evaluation and 
nonrecurring production costs. Costs incurred under a foreign military 
sale at the request of, or for the benefit of, a foreign customer to 
develop a special feature or unique or joint requirement. Those costs 
must be paid by the customer as they are incurred.


<R05>
Sec. 165.4  Policy.

    It is DoD policy that:
    (a) A nonrecurring cost recoupment charge shall be imposed for sales 
of major defense equipment only as required by Act of Congress (e.g., 
Arms Export Control Act).
    (b) The Under Secretary of Defense for Policy may grant a waiver to 
recoupment charges in accordance with Sec. 165.7.
    (c) Nonrecurring cost charges shall be based on the amount of the 
DoD nonrecurring investment in an item.


<R05>
Sec. 165.5  Responsibilities.

    (a) The Comptroller of the Department of Defense shall provide 
necessary financial management guidance.
    (b) The Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition) shall take 
appropriate action to revise the DoD Federal Acquisition Regulation 
Supplement in accordance with this part.
    (c) The Under Secretary of Defense for Policy shall:
    (1) Monitor the application of this part.
    (2) Review and approve nonrecurring cost recoupment charges and 
nonrecurring cost recoupment charge waiver requests received from 
foreign countries and international organizations for foreign military 
sales.
    (3) Ensure publication of a listing of items developed for or by the 
Department of Defense to which nonrecurring cost recoupment charges are 
applicable.
    (d) The Secretaries of the Military Departments and the Directors of 
the Defense Agencies shall:
    (1) Determine the DoD nonrecurring investment in items developed for 
or by the Department of Defense and perform required pro rata 
calculations in accordance with this part and financial management 
guidance from the Comptroller of the Department of Defense.
    (2) Validate and provide recommended charges to the Under Secretary 
of Defense for Policy. Supporting documentation will be retained until 
the item has been eliminated from the nonrecurring cost recoupment 
charge listing.
    (3) Review approved nonrecurring cost recoupment charges on a 
biennial basis to determine if there has been a change in factors or 
assumptions used to compute a nonrecurring cost recoupment charge and, 
if there is a significant change in a nonrecurring cost recoupment 
charge, provide a recommended change to the Under Secretary of Defense 
for Policy.
    (4) Collect charges on foreign military sales in accordance with DoD 
7290.3-M,\1\ ``Foreign Military Sales Financial Management Manual'' and 
on

[[Page 722]]

other sales, made prior to January 13, 1993, in accordance with DoD 
7220.9-M,\2\ ``DoD Accounting Manual.''

    (5) Deposit collections to accounts as prescribed by the 
Comptroller, DoD.
    (6) Request guidance from the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, 
within 90 days, if an issue concerning a recoupment charge cannot be 
resolved.


<R05>
Sec. 165.6  Procedures.

    (a) The nonrecurring cost recoupment charge to be reimbursed shall 
be a pro rata recovery of nonrecurring cost for the applicable major 
defense equipment. Recovery of nonrecurring cost recoupment charges 
shall cease upon the recovery of total DoD costs. Such charges shall be 
based on a cost pool as defined in Sec. 165.3. For a system that 
includes more than one component, a ``building block'' approach (i.e., 
the sum of nonrecurring cost recoupment charges for individual 
components) shall be used to determine the nonrecurring cost recoupment 
charge for the sale of the entire system.
    (b) A nonrecurring cost recoupment charge shall not apply when a 
waiver has been approved by the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy in 
accordance with Sec. 165.7 or when sales are financed with U.S. 
Government funds made available on a nonrepayable basis. Approved 
revised nonrecurring cost recoupment charges shall not be applied 
retroactively to accepted foreign military sales agreements.
    (c) When major defense equipment are sold at a reduced price due to 
age or condition, the nonrecurring cost recoupment charge shall be 
reduced by the same percentage reduction.
    (d) The full amount of ``special'' research, development, test, and 
evaluation and nonrecurring production costs incurred for the benefit of 
particular customers shall be paid by those customers. However, when a 
subsequent purchaser requests the same specialized features that 
resulted from the added ``special'' research, development, test, and 
evaluation and nonrecurring production costs, a pro rata share of those 
costs may be paid by the subsequent purchaser and transferred to the 
original customer if those special nonrecurring costs exceed 50 million 
dollars. The pro rata share may be a unit charge determined by the DoD 
Component as a result of distribution of the total costs divided by the 
total production. Such reimbursements shall not be collected after 10 
years have elapsed since acceptance of DD Form 1513, ``U.S. DoD Offer 
and Acceptance,'' by the original customer, unless otherwise authorized 
by the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. The U.S. Government shall 
not be charged any nonrecurring costs recoupment charge if it adopts the 
features for its own use or provides equipment with such features under 
a U.S. Grant Aid or similar program.
    (e) For coproduction, codevelopment and cooperative development, or 
cooperative production DoD agreements, the policy set forth in this part 
shall determine the allocation basis for recouping from the third party 
purchasers the investment costs of the participants. Such DoD agreements 
shall provide for the application of the policies in this part to sales 
to third parties by any of the parties to the agreement and for the 
distribution of recoupments among the parties to the agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 165.7  Waivers (including reductions).

    (a) The ``Arms Export Control Act,'' Public Law No. 90-629, as 
amended, requires the recoupment of a proportionate amount of 
nonrecurring cost of major defense equipment from foreign military sales 
customers but authorizes consideration of reductions or waivers for 
particular sales which, if made, significantly advance U.S. Government 
interests and the furtherance of mutual defense treaties between the 
United States and certain countries.
    (b) Requests for waivers should originate with the foreign 
government and shall provide information on the extent of 
standardization to be derived as a result of the waiver.

[[Page 723]]

    (c) Blanket waiver requests should not be submitted and shall not be 
considered. The term ``blanket waiver'' refers to a nonrecurring cost 
recoupment charge waiver that is not related to a particular sale; for 
example, waivers for all sales to a country or all sales of a weapon 
system.
    (d) A waiver request shall not be considered for a sale that was 
accepted without a nonrecurring cost recoupment charge waiver, unless 
the acceptance was conditional on consideration of the waiver request.
    (e) Requests for waivers shall be processed expeditiously, and a 
decision normally made to either approve or disapprove the request 
within 60 days after receipt. A waiver in whole or in part of the 
recoupment charge or a denial of the request shall be provided in 
writing to the appropriate DoD Component.

<R05>
Sec. 169.1  Purpose.

    This document:
    (a) Revises 32 CFR part 169.
    (b) Updates DoD policies and assigns responsibilities for commercial 
activities (CAs) as required by E.O. 12615, Pub. L. 100-180, sec. 1111, 
and OMB Circular A-76.


<R05>
Sec. 169.2  Applicability and scope.

    This part:
    (a) Applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the 
Military Departments, and the Defense Agencies (hereafter referred to 
collectively as ``DoD Components'').
    (b) Encompasses DoD policy for CAs in the United States, its 
territories and possessions, the District of Columbia, and the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
    (c) Is not mandatory for CAs staffed solely with DoD civilian 
personnel paid by nonappropriated funds, such as military exchanges. 
However, this part is mandatory for CAs when they are staffed partially 
with DoD civilian personnel paid by or reimbursed from appropriated 
funds, such as libraries, open messes, and other morale, welfare, and 
recreation (MWR) activities. When related installation support functions 
are being cost-compared under a single solicitation, a DoD Component may 
decide that it is practical to include activities staffed solely with 
DoD civilian personnel paid by nonappropriated funds.
    (d) Does not apply to DoD governmental functions as defined Sec. 
169.3.
    (e) Does not apply when contrary to law, Executive orders, or any 
treaty or international agreement.
    (f) Does not apply in times of a declared war or military 
mobilization.
    (g) Does not provide authority to enter into contracts.
    (h) Does not apply to the conduct of research and development, 
except for severable in-house CAs that support research and development, 
such as those listed in enclosure 3 of DoD Instruction 4100.33 \1\ (32 
CFR part 169a).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) Does not justify conversion to contract solely to avoid 
personnel ceilings or salary limitations.
    (j) Does not authorize contracts that establish an employer-employee 
relationship between the Department of Defense and contractor employees, 
as described in FAR 37.104.


<R05>
Sec. 169.3  Definitions.

    Commercial Activity Review. The process of evaluating CAs for the 
purpose of determining whether or not a cost comparison will be 
conducted.
    Commercial Source. A business or other non-Federal activity located 
in the United States, its territories and possessions, the District of 
Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico that provides a commercial 
product or service.
    Conversion to Contract. The changeover of a CA from performance by 
DoD personnel to performance under contract by a commercial source.
    Conversion to In-House. The changeover of a CA from performance 
under

[[Page 725]]

contract to performance by DoD personnel.
    Core Logistics. Those functions identified as core logistics 
activities pursuant to section 307 of Pub. L 98-525 and section 1231 of 
Pub. L. 99-145, codified at section 2464, title 10 that are necessary to 
maintain a logistics capability (including personnel, equipment, and 
facilities) to ensure a ready and controlled source of technical 
competence and resources necessary to ensure effective and timely 
response to a mobilization, national defense contingency situation, and 
other emergency requirements.
    Cost Comparison. The process of developing an estimate of the cost 
of performance of a CA by DoD employees and comparing it, in accordance 
with the requirements in DoD Instruction 4100.33 to the cost of 
performance by contract.
    Direct-Conversion. Conversion to contract performance of an in-house 
commercial activity based on a simplified cost comparsion or the 
conversion of an in-house commerical activity performed exclusively by 
military personnel.
    Displaced DoD Employee. Any DoD employee affected by conversion to 
contract operation (including such actions as job elimination, or grade 
reduction). It includes both employees in the function converted to 
contract and employees outside the function who are affected adversely 
by conversion through reassignment or the exercise of bumping or retreat 
rights.
    DoD Commercial Activity (CA). An activity that provides a product or 
service obtainable (or obtained) from a commerical source. A DoD CA may 
be the mission of an organization or a function within the organization. 
It must be type of work that is separable from other functions or 
activities so that it is suitable for performance by contract. A 
representative list of the functions performed by such activities is 
provided in enclosure 3 of DoD Instruction 4100.33. A DoD CA falls into 
one of two categories:
    (a) Contract CA. A DoD CA managed by a DoD Component, but operated 
with contractor personnel.
    (b) In-House CA. A DoD CA operated by a DoD Component with DoD 
personnel.
    DoD Employee. Civilian personnel of the Department of Defense.
    DoD Governmental Function. A function that is related so intimately 
to the public interest as to mandate performance by DoD personnel. These 
functions include those that require either the exercise of discretion 
in applying Government authority or the use of value judgment in making 
the decision for the Department of Defense. Services or products in 
support of Governmental functions, such as those listed in enclosure 3 
of DoD Instruction 4100.33, are CAs and are subject to this part and its 
implementing Instructions. Governmental functions normally fall into two 
categories:
    (a) Act of Governing. The discretionary exercise of Governmental 
authority. Examples include criminal investigations, prosecutions, and 
other judicial functions; management of Government programs requiring 
value judgments, as in direction of the national defense; management and 
direction of the Armed Services; activities performed exclusively by 
military personnel who are subject to deployment in a combat, combat 
support, or combat service support role; conduct of foreign relations; 
selection of program priorities; direction of Federal employees; 
regulation of the use of space, oceans, navigable rivers, and other 
natural resources; management of natural resources on Federal Property; 
direction of intelligence and counterintelligence operations; and 
regulation of industry and commerce, including food and drugs.
    (b) Monetary Transactions and Entitlements. Refers to such actions 
as tax collection and revenue disbursements; control of treasury 
accounts and the money supply, and the administration of public trusts.
    DoD Personnel. Military and civilian personnel of the Department of 
Defense.
    Expansion. The modernization, replacement, upgrading, or enlargement 
of a DoD CA involving a cost increase exceeding either 30 percent of the 
total capital investment or 30 percent of the annual personnel and 
material costs. A

[[Page 726]]

consolidation of two or more CAs is not an expansion, unless the 
proposed total capital investment or annual personnel and material costs 
of the consolidation exceeds the total of the individual CAs by 30 
percent or more.
    Installation. An installation is the grouping of facilities, 
collocated in the same vicinity, that supports particular functions. 
Activities collocated and supported by an installation are considered to 
be tenants.
    Installation Commander. The commanding officer or head of an 
installation or a tenant activity, who has budget and supervisory 
control over resources and personnel.
    New Requirement. A recently established need for a commercial 
product or service. A new requirement does not include interim in-house 
operation of essential services pending reacquisition of the services 
prompted by such action as the termination of an existing contract 
operation.
    Preferential Procurement Programs. Preferential procurement programs 
include mandatory source programs such as Federal Prison Industries 
(FPI) and the workshops administered by the Committee for Purchase from 
the Blind and Other Severely Handicapped under Pub. L. 92-98. Small, 
minority, and disadvantaged businesses; and labor surplus area set-
asides and awards made under Pub. L. 85-536, section 8(a) and Pub. L. 
95-507 are included under preferential procurement programs.
    Right of First Refusal of Employment. Contractors provide Government 
employees, displaced as a result of the conversion to contract 
performance, the right of first refusal for employment openings under 
the contract in positions for which they are qualified, if that 
employment is consistent with post-Government employment conflict of 
interest standards.


<R05>
Sec. 169.4  Policy.

    (a) Ensure DoD Mission Accomplishment. When complying with this part 
and its implementing Instruction, DoD Components shall consider the 
overall DoD mission and the defense objective of maintaining readiness 
and sustainability to ensure a capability for mobilizing the defense and 
support structure.
    (b) Achieve Economy and Quality through Competition. Encourage 
competition with the objective of enhancing quality, economy, and 
performance. When performance by a commercial source is permissible, a 
comparsion of the cost of contracting and the cost of in-house 
performance shall be performed to determine who shall provide the best 
value for the Government, considering price and other factors included 
in the solicitation. The restriction of a solicitation to a preferential 
procurement program does not negate the requirement to perform a cost 
comparison. Performance history will be considered in the source 
selection process, and high quality performance should be rewarded.
    (c) Retain Governmental Functions In-House. Certain functions that 
are inherently governmental in nature, and intimately related to the 
public interest, mandate performance by DoD personnel only. These 
functions are not in competition with commercial sources; therefore, 
these functions shall be performed by DoD personnel.
    (d) Rely on the Commercial Sector. DoD Components shall rely on 
commercially available sources to provide commercial products and 
services except when required for national defense, when no satisfactory 
commercial source is available, or when in the best interest of direct 
patient care. DoD Components shall not consider an in-house new 
requirement, an expansion of an in-house requirement, conversion to in-
house, or otherwise carry on any CAs to provide commercial products or 
services if the products or services can be procured more economically 
from commercial sources.
    (e) Delegate Decision Authority and Responsibility. DoD Components 
shall delegate decision authority and responsibility to lower 
organization levels, giving more authority to the doers, and linking 
responsibility with that authority. This shall facilitate the work that 
installation commanders must perform without limiting their freedom to 
do their jobs. When possible, the installation commanders should have 
the freedom to make intelligent use of their resources, while preserving 
the

[[Page 727]]

essential wartime capabilities of U.S. support organizations in 
accordance with DoD Directive 4001.1.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 169.2(h)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (f) Share Resources Saved. When possible, make available to the 
installation commander a share of any resources saved or earned so that 
the commander can improve operations or working and living conditions on 
the installation.
    (g) Provide Placement Assistance. Provide a variety of placement 
assistance to employees whose Federal jobs are eliminated through CA 
competitions.

section 1111 and E.O. 12615, installation commanders shall have the 
authority and responsibility to carry out the following:
    (i) Prepare an inventory each fiscal year of commercial activities 
carried out by Government personnel on the military installation in 
accordance with DoD Instruction 4100.33.
    (ii) Decide which commercial activities shall be reviewed under the 
procedures and requirements of E.O. 12615, OMB Circular A-76, and DoD

under this part are solicited and awarded in accordance with the FAR and 
the DFARS.
    (9) Ensure that all notification and reporting requirements 
established in DoD Instruction 4100.33 are satisfied.
    (10) Ensure that the Freedom of Information Act Program is complied 
with in responding to requests for disclosure of contractor-supplied 
information obtained in the course of procurement.
    (11) Ensure that high standards of objectivity and consistency are 
maintained in compiling and maintaining the CA inventory and conducting 
the reviews and cost comparisons.

[[Page 728]]

    (12) Provide, when requested, assistance to installation commanders 
to ensure effective CA program implementation and technical competence 
in management and implementation of the CA program.
    (13) Ensure that maximum efforts are exerted to assist displaced DoD 
employees in finding suitable employment, to include, as appropriate:
    (i) Providing priority placement assistance for other Federal jobs.
    (ii) Training and relocation when these shall contribute directly to 
placement.
    (iii) Providing outplacement assistance for employment in other 
sectors of the economy with particular attention to assisting eligible 
employees to exercise their right of first refusal with the successful 
contractor.
    (14) Maintain the technical competence necessary to ensure effective 
and efficient management of the CA program.
    (15) Ensure, once the cost comparison is initiated, that the 
milestones are met, and completion of the cost comparison is without 
unreasonable delay.

Sec. 169a.2  Applicability and scope.

    This part:
    (a) Applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the 
Military Departments, the Defense Agencies and DoD Field Activities 
(hereafter referred to collectively as the ``DoD Components'').
    (b) Contains DoD procedures for CAs in the United States, its 
territories and possessions, the District of Columbia, and the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
    (c) Is not mandatory for CAs staffed solely with DoD civilian 
personnel paid by nonappropriated funds, such as military exchanges. 
However, this part is mandatory for CAs when they are

[[Page 729]]

staffed partially with DoD civilian personnel paid by or reimbursed from 
appropriated funds, such as libraries, open messes, and other morale, 
welfare, and recreation (MWR) activities. When related installation 
support functions are being cost-compared under a single solicitation, a 
DoD Component may decide that it is practical to include activities 
staffed solely with DoD civilian personnel paid by nonappropriated 
funds.
    (d) Does not apply to DoD governmental functions are defined in 
Sec. 169a.3.
    (e) Does not apply when contrary to law, Executive orders, or any 
treaty or international agreement.
    (f) Does not apply in times of a declared war or military 
mobilization.
    (g) Does not provide authority to enter into contracts.
    (h) Does not apply to the conduct of research and development, 
except for severable in-house CAs that support research and development, 
such as those listed in appendix A to this part.
    (i) Does not justify conversion to contract solely to avoid 
personnel ceilings or salary limitations.
    (j) Doe not authorize contracts that establish employer-employee 
relations between the Department of Defense and contractor employees as 
described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 CFR 37.104.
    (k) Does not establish and shall not be construed to create any 
substantive or procedural basis for anyone to challenge any DoD action 
or inaction on the basis that such action or inaction was not in 
accordance with this part except as specifically set forth in Sec. 
169a.15(d).

[57 FR 29207, July 1, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 169a.3  Definitions.

    Commercial activity review. The process of evaluating CAs for the 
purpose of determining whether or not a cost comparison will be 
conducted.
    Commercial source. A business or other non-Federal activity located 
in the United States, its territories and possessions, the District of 
Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico that provides a commercial 
product or service.
    Conversion to contract. The changeover of a CA from performance by 
DoD personnel to performance under contract by a commercial source.
    Conversion to in-house. The changeover of a CA from performance 
under contract by a commercial source to performance by DoD personnel.
    Cost comparison. The process of developing an estimate of the cost 
of performance of a CA by DoD employees and comparing it, in accordance 
with the requirements in this part, to the cost to the Government for 
contract performance of the CA.
    Directly affected parties. DoD employees and their representative 
organizations and bidders or offerers on the solicitation.
    Displaced DoD employee. Any DoD employee affected by conversion to 
contract operation (including such actions as job elimination, grade 
reduction, or reduction in rank). It includes both employees in the 
function converted to contract and to employees outside the function who 
are affected adversely by conversion through reassignment or the 
exercise of bumping or retreat rights.
    DoD Commercial Activity (CA). An activity that provides a product or 
service obtainable (or obtained) from a commercial source. A DoD CA is 
not a Governmental function. A DoD CA may be an organization or part of 
another organization. It must be a type of work that is separable from 
other functions or activities so that it is suitable for performance by 
contract. A representative list of the functions performed by such 
activities is provided in Enclosure 1. A DoD CA falls into one of two 
categories:
    (a) In-house CA. A DoD CA operated by a DoD Component with DoD 
personnel.
    (b) Contract CA. A DoD CA managed by a DoD Component operated with 
contractor personnel.
    DoD Employee. Refers to only civilian personnel of the Department of 
Defense.
    DoD governmental function. A function that is related so intimately 
to the public interest as to mandate performance by DoD personnel. These 
functions require either the exercise of discretion in applying 
Government authority or the use of value judgement

[[Page 730]]

in making the decision for the Department of Defense.
    Services or products in support of Governmental functions such as 
those listed in enclosure 3 of DoD Instruction 4100.33 are normally 
subject to this part and its implementing instructions. Governmental 
functions normally fall into two categories:
    (a) The act of governing; that is, the discretionary exercise of 
Governmental authority. Examples include criminal investigations, 
prosecutions, and other judicial functions; management of Governmental 
programs requiring value judgments, as in direction of the national 
defense; management and direction of the Armed Services; activities 
performed exclusively by military personnel who are subject to 
deployment in a combat, combat support, or combat service support role; 
conduct of foreign relations; selection of program priorities; direction 
of Federal employees; regulation of the use of space, oceans, navigable 
rivers, and other natural resources; direction of intelligence and 
counterintelligence operations; and regulation of industry and commerce, 
including food and drugs.
    (b) Monetary transactions and entitlements, such as tax collection 
and revenue disbursements; control of the money supply treasury 
accounts; and the administration of public trusts.
    DoD personnel. Refers to both military and civilian personnel of the 
Department of Defense.
    Expansion. The modernization, replacement, upgrading, or enlargement 
of a DoD CA involving a cost increase exceeding either 30 percent of the 
total capital investment or 30 percent of the annual personnel and 
material costs. A consolidation of two or more CAs is not an expansion 
unless the proposed total capital investment or annual personnel and 
material costs of the consolidation exceeds the total of the individual 
CAs by 30 percent or more.
    New requirement. A recently established need for a commercial 
product or service. A new requirement does not include interim in-house 
operation of essential services pending reacquisition of the services 
prompted by such action as the termination of an existing contract 
operation.
    Preferential procurement programs. Mandatory source programs such as 
Federal Prison Industries (FPI) and the workshops administered by the 
Committee for Purchase from the Blind and Other Severely Handicapped 
under the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act. Also included are small, minority and 
disadvantaged businesses, and labor surplus area set-asides and awards 
made under 15 U.S.C. section 637.

<R05>
Sec. 169a.4  Policy.

    (a) Ensure DoD mission accomplishment. The implementation of this 
part shall consider the overall DoD mission and the defense objective of 
maintaining readiness and sustainability to ensure a capability for 
mobilizing the defense and support structure.
    (b) Retain governmental functions in-house. Certain functions that 
are inherently governmental in nature, and intimately related to the 
public interest, mandate performance by DoD personnel only. These 
functions are not in competition with commercial sources; therefore, 
these functions shall be performed by DoD personnel.
    (c) Rely on the commercial sector. DoD Components shall rely on 
commercially available sources to provide commercial products and 
services, except when required for national defense, when no 
satisfactory commercial source is available, or when in the best 
interest of direct patient care. DoD Components shall not consider an 
in-house new requirement, an expansion of an in-house requirement, 
conversion to in-house, or otherwise carry on any CAs to provide 
commercial products or services if the products or services can be 
procured more economically from commercial sources.
    (d) Achieve economy and enhance productivity. Encourage competition 
with the objective of enhancing quality, economy, and performance.

When performance by a commercial source is permissible, a comparison of 
the cost of contracting and the cost of in-house performance shall be 
performed to determine who shall provide the best value for the 
Government,

[[Page 731]]

considering price and other factors included in the solicitation. If the 
installation commander has reason to believe that it may not be cost 
effective to make an award under mandatory source programs, section 8(a) 
of the Small Business Act or any other noncompetitive preferential 
procurement program, a cost comparison, or any other cost analysis, 
although not required by OMB Circular A-76, may be performed. 
Performance history will be considered in the source selection process, 
and high quality performance should be rewarded.
    (e) Delegate decision authority and responsibility. DoD Components 
shall delegate decision authority and responsibility to lower 
organization levels, giving more authority to the doers, and linking 
responsibility with that authority. This shall facilitate the work that 
installation commanders must perform without limiting their freedom to 
do their jobs. When possible, the installation commanders should have 
the freedom to make intelligent use of their resources, while preserving 
the essential wartime capabilities of U.S. support organizations in 
accordance with DoD Directive 4001.15.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 169a.1(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (f) Share resources saved. When possible, make available to the 
installation commander a share of any resources saved or earned so that 
the commander can improve operations or working and living conditions on 
the installation.
    (g) Provide Placement Assistance. Provide a variety of placement 
assistance to employees whose Federal jobs are eliminated through CA 
competitions.
    (h) Permit interim-in-house operation. A DoD in-house CA may be 
established on a temporary basis if a contractor defaults. Action shall 
be taken to resolicit bids or proposals in accordance with this part.

<R05>
Sec. 169a.8  Inventory and review schedule (Report Control Symbol 
DD-P&L(A)).

    (a) Information in each DoD Component's inventory shall be used to 
assess DoD implementation of OMB Circular A-76 and for other purposes. 
Each Component's inventory shall be updated at least annually to reflect 
changes to their review schedule and the results of reviews, cost 
comparisons, and direct conversions. Updated inventories for all DoD 
Components except National Security Agency/Central Security Service 
(NSA/CSS) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) Shall be submitted 
to the Assistant Secretary of Defense Production and Logistics) 
(ASD(P&L)) within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year. Inventory 
data pertaining to NSA/CSS and DIA shall be held at the specific Agency 
concerned for subsequent review by properly cleared personnel. Appendix 
A to this part provides the codes and explanations for functional areas 
and Appendix B to this part provides procedures for submitting the 
inventory.
    (b) DoD component's review schedules should be coordinated with the 
DoD Component's Efficiency Review Program and the Defense Regional 
Interservice Support (DRIS) Program to preclude duplication of efforts 
and to make use of information already available.
    (c) Review of CAs that provide interservice support shall be 
scheduled by the supplying DoD Component. Subsequent cost comparisons, 
when appropriate, shall be executed by the same DoD Component. All 
affected DoD Components shall be notified of the intent to perform a 
review.

[50 FR 40805, Oct. 7, 1985, as amended at 57 FR 29208, July 1, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 169a.9  Reviews: Existing in-house commercial activities.

    (a) DoD components shall conduct reviews of in-house CAs in 
accordance with their established review schedules. Existing in-house 
CAs, once reviewed shall be retained in-house without a cost comparison 
only when certain conditions are satisfied. (Detailed documentation will 
be maintained to support the decision to continue in-house performance). 
These conditions are as follows:
    (1) National Defense. In most cases, application of this criteria 
shall be made considering the wartime and

[[Page 732]]

peacetime duties of the specific positions involved rather than in terms 
of broad functions.
    (i) A CA, staffed with military personnel who are assigned to the 
activity, may be retained in-house for national defense reason when the 
following apply.
    (A) The CA is essential for training or experience in required 
military skills;
    (B) The CA is needed to provide appropriate work assignments for a 
rotation base for overseas or sea-to-shore assignments; or
    (C) The CA is necessary to provide career progression to needed 
military skill levels.
    (ii) Core logistics activities. The core logistics capability 
reported to Congress, March 29, 1984, under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 
2646 is comprised of the facilities, equipment, and management personnel 
at the activities listed in the report. The work at those activities may 
be performed by either government or contractor personnel, whichever is 
more cost effective. Core logistics activities reported to Congress 
under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2646, shall be retained in-house 
unless the Secretary of Defense grants a waiver as provided for in 10 
U.S.C. 2464. Requests for waivers shall be submitted to the ASD (P&L). 
DoD Components may propose to the ASD (P&L) additional core logistics 
capability for inclusion in the list of core logistics activities. Core 
logistics activities reported to Congress as additions to the original 
list shall be retained in-house unless subsequently waived by the 
Secretary of Defense.
    (iii) If the DoD Component has a larger number of similar CAs with a 
small number of essential military personnel in each CA, action shall be 
taken, when appropriate, to consolidate the military positions 
consistent with military requirements so that economical performance by 
either DoD civilian employees or by contract can be explored for 
accomplishing a portion of the work.
    (iv) The DoD Components may propose to the ASD (P&L) other criteria 
for exempting CAs for national defense reasons.
    (2) No satisfactory commercial source available. A DoD commercial 
activity may be performed by DoD personnel when it can be demonstrated 
that:
    (i) There is no satisfactory commercial source capable of providing 
the product or service that is needed. Before concluding that there is 
no satisfactory commercial source available, the DoD Component shall 
make all reasonable efforts to identify available sources.
    (A) DoD Components' efforts to find satisfactory commercial sources 
shall be carried out in accordance with the FAR and Defense FAR 
Supplement (DFAS) including review of bidders lists and inventories of 
contractors, consideration of preferential procurement programs, and 
requests for help from Government agencies such as the Small Business 
Administration.
    (B) Where the availability of commercial sources is uncertain, the 
DoD Component will place up to three notices of the requirement in the 
Commerce Business Daily (CBD) over a 90-day period. (Notices will be in 
the format specified in FAR, 48 CFR part 5 and part 7, subpart 7.3) When 
a bona fide urgent requirement occurs, the publication period in the CBD 
may be reduced to two notices, 15 days apart. Specifications and 
requirements in the notice will not be unduly restrictive and will not 
exceed those required of Government personnel or operations.
    (ii) Use of a commercial source would cause an unacceptable delay or 
disruption of an essential program. In-house operation of a commercial 
activity on the basis that use of a commercial source would cause an 
unacceptable delay or disrupt an essential DoD program requires a 
specific documented explanation.
    (A) The delay or disruption must be specific as to cost, time, and 
performance measures.
    (B) The disruption must be shown to be a lasting or unacceptable 
nature. Temporary disruption caused by conversion to contract is not 
sufficient support for the use of this criteria.
    (C) The fact that a DoD commercial activity involves a classified 
program, or is part of a DoD Component's basic mission, or that there is 
the possibility of a strike by contract employees is

[[Page 733]]

not adequate reason for Government performance of that activity. 
Further, urgency alone is not an adequate reason to continue Government 
operation of a commercial activity. It must be shown that commercial 
sources are not able, and the Government is able, to provide the product 
or service when needed.
    (D) Use of an exemption due to an unacceptable delay or disruption 
of an essential program shall be approved by the DoD Component's central 
point of contact office. This authority may be redelegated.
    (3) Patient Care. Commercial activities at DoD hospitals may be 
performed by DoD personnel when it is determined by the head of the DoD 
Component or his designee, in consultation with the DoD Component's 
chief medical director, that performance by DoD personnel would be in 
the best interest of direct patient care.

[50 FR 40805, Oct. 7, 1985, as amended at 57 FR 29208, July 1, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 169a.10  Contracts.

    When contract cost becomes unreasonable or performance becomes 
unsatisfactory, the requirement must be resolicited. If the DoD 
Component competes in the resolicitation, then a cost comparison of a 
contracted CA shall be performed in accordance with part III of the 
Supplement to OMB Circular A-76 (Office of Federal Procurement Policy 
pamphlet No. 4) \6\, part II of the Supplement to OMB Circular A-76 
(Management Study Guide) \7\, part IV of the Supplement to OMB Circular 
A-76 (Cost Comparison Handbook) \8\, if in-house performance is 
feasible. When contracted CAs are justified for conversion to in-house 
performance, the contract will be allowed to expire (options will not be 
exercised) once in-house capability is established.

<R05>
Sec. 169a.11  Expansions.

    In cases where expansion of an in-house commercial activity is 
anticipated, a review of the entire commercial activity, including the 
proposed expansion, shall be conducted to determine if performance by 
DoD personnel is authorized for national defense reasons, because no 
commercial source is available, or because it is in the best interest of 
direct patient care. If performance by DoD personnel is not justified 
under these criteria, a cost comparison of the entire activity shall be 
performed. Government facilities and equipment normally will not be 
expanded to accommodate expansions if adequate and cost effective 
contractor facilities and equipment are available.

[50 FR 40805, Oct. 7, 1985, as amended at 57 FR 29208, July 1, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 169a.12  New requirements.

    (a) In cases where a new requirement for a commercial product or 
service is anticipated, a review shall be conducted to determine if 
performance by DoD personnel is authorized for national defense reasons, 
because no commercial source is available, or because it is in the best 
interest of direct patient care. If performance by DoD personnel is not 
justified under these criteria, then the new requirement normally shall 
be performed by contract.
    (b) If there is reason to believe that commercial prices may be 
unreasonable, a preliminary cost analysis shall be conducted to 
determine whether it is likely that the work can be performed in-house 
at a cost that is less than anticipated for contract performance. If in-
house performance appears to be more economical, a cost comparison shall 
be scheduled. The appropriate conversion differentials will be added to 
the preliminary in-house cost before it is determined that in-house 
performance is likely to be more economical.
    (c) Government facilities and equipment normally will not be 
expanded to accommodate new requirements if adequate and cost-effective 
contractor facilities are available. The requirement for Government 
ownership of facilities does not obviate the possibility of contract 
operation. If justification for in-house operation is dependent on 
relative cost, the cost comparison may be delayed to accommodate the 
lead time necessary for acquiring the facilities.

[[Page 734]]

    (d) Approval or disapproval of in-house performance of new 
requirements involving a capital investment of $500,000 or more will not 
be redelegated below the level of DAS or equivalent.
    (e) Approval to budget for a major capital investment associated 
with a new requirement will not constitute OSD approval to perform the 
new requirement with DoD personnel. Government performance shall be 
determined in accordance with this part.


<R05>
Sec. 169a.13  CAs involving forty-five or fewer DoD civilian employees.

    (a) When adequately justified under the criteria required in 
Appendix C to this part, CAs involving 11 to 45 DoD civilian employees 
may be competed based on simplified cost comparison procedures and 10 or 
fewer DoD civilian employees may be directly converted to contract 
without the use of a simplified cost comparison. Such conversion shall 
be approved by the DoD Component's central point of contact office 
having the responsibility for implementation of this part. Part IV of 
the Supplement to OMB Circular A-76 and Appendix C to this part shall be 
utilized to define the specific elements of costs to be estimated in the 
simplified cost comparison.
    (b) In no case shall any CA involving more than forty-five employees 
be modified, reorganized, divided, or in any way changed for the purpose 
of circumventing the requirement to perform a full cost comparison.
    (c) The decision to perform a simplified cost comparison on a CA 
involving military personnel and 11 to 45 DoD Civilian employees 
reflects a management decision that the work need not be performed in-
house. Therefore, all direct military personnel costs will be estimated 
in the simplified cost comparison (see Appendix C to this part) on the 
basis of civilian performance.
    (d) A most efficient and cost-effective organization analysis 
certification is required for studies involving 11 to 45 DoD civilian 
employees (see Appendix C to this part).

[57 FR 29208, July 1, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 169a.14  Military personnel commercial activity.

    Commercial activities performed exclusively by military personnel 
not subject to deployment in a combat, combat support, or combat service 
support role may be converted to contract without a cost comparison, 
when adequate competition is available and reasonable prices can be 
obtained from qualified commercial sources.


<R05>
Sec. 169a.15  Special considerations.

    (a) Signals Intelligence, Telecommunications (SIGINT) and Automated 
Information System (AIS) security.
    (1) Before making a determination that an activity involving SIGINT 
as prescribed in Executive Order 12333, and AIS, security should be 
subjected to a cost comparison, the DoD Component shall specifically 
identify the risk to national security and complete a risk assessment to 
determine if the use of commercial resources poses a potential threat to 
national security. Information copies of the risk assessment and a 
decision memorandum containing data on the acceptable and/or 
unacceptable risk will be maintained within the requesting DoD 
Component's contracting office.
    (2) The National Security Agency (NSA) considers the polygraph 
program an effective means to enhance security protection for special 
access type information. The risk to national security is of an 
acceptable level if contractor personnel assigned to the maintenance and 
operation of SIGINT, Computer Security (COMPUSEC) and Communications 
Security (COMSEC) equipment agree to an aperiodic counter-intelligence 
scope polygraph examination. The following clause should be included in 
every potential contract involving SIGINT, Telecommunications, and AIS 
systems:

Contract personnel engaged in operation or maintaining SIGINT, COMSEC or 
COMPUSEC equipment or having access to classified documents or key 
material must consent to an aperiodic counter-intelligence scope 
polygraph examination administered by the Government. Contract personnel 
who

[[Page 735]]

refuse to take the polygraph examination shall not be considered for 
selection.
    (b) National intelligence. Before making a determination that an 
activity involving the collection/processing/production/dissemination of 
national intelligence as prescribed in Executive Order 12333 should be 
subjected to a cost comparison, the DoD Component must specifically 
identify the risk to national intelligence of using commercial sources. 
Except as noted in paragraph (a) of this section, the DoD Component 
shall provide its assessment of the risk to national intelligence of 
using commercial sources to the Director, DIA, who shall make the 
determination if the risk to national intelligence is unacceptable. DIA 
shall consult with other organizations as deemed necessary and shall 
provide the decision to the DoD Component. (Detailed documentation shall 
be maintained to support the decision).
    (c) Accountable Officer. (1) The functions and responsibilities of 
the Accountable Officer are defined by DoD 7200.10-M.\9\ Those functions 
of the Accountable Officer that involve the exercise of substantive 
discretionary authority in determining the Government's requirements and 
controlling Government assets cannot be performed by a contractor and 
must be retained in-house. The responsibilities of the Accountable 
Officer as an individual and the position of the Accountable Officer are 
not contractable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 169a.1(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Contractors can perform functions in support of the Accountable 
Officer and functions where they are performing in accordance with 
criteria defined by the Government. For instance, contractors can 
process requisitions, maintain stock control records, perform storage 
and warehousing, and make local procurements of items specified as 
deliverables in the contract.
    (3) The responsibility for administrative fund control must be 
retained in-house. The contractor can process all required paperwork up 
to funds obligation which must be done by the Government employee 
designated as responsible for funds control. The contractor can also 
process such documents as reports of survey and adjustments to stockage 
levels, but approval must rest with the Accountable Officer. In all 
cases, the administrative control of funds must be retained by the 
Government since contractors or their employees cannot be held 
responsible for violations of the United States Code.
    (d) Cost Comparison Process. If performance of a commercial activity 
by DoD personnel cannot be justified under national defense, non-
availability of commercial source, or patient care criteria, than a full 
cost comparison shall be conducted in accordance with part II of the 
Supplement to OMB Circular No. A-76, part III of the Supplement to OMB 
Circular No. A-76, and part IV of the Supplement to OMB Circular A-76, 
to determine if performance by DoD employees is justified on the basis 
of lower cost (unless the criteria of Sec. 169a. and Sec. 169a. are 
met). The conclusion that a commercial activity will be cost compared 
reflects a management decision that the work need not be accomplished by 
military personnel. Therefore, all direct personnel costs shall be 
estimated on the basis of civilian performance. Funds shall be budgeted 
to cover either the cost of the appropriate in-house operation required 
to accomplish the work or the estimated cost of the contract. Neither 
funds nor manpower authorizations shall be removed from the activity's 
budget in anticipation of the outcome of a study.
    (1) Notification. (i) Congressional notification. DoD Components 
shall notify Congress of the intention to do a cost comparison involving 
46 or more DoD civilian personnel. DoD Components shall annotate the 
notification when a cost comparison is planned at an activity listed in 
the report to Congress on core logistics (see section 169a.9(a)(1)(ii)). 
The DoD Component shall notify the ADS(P&L) of any such intent at least 
5 working days before the Congressional notification. The cost 
comparison process begins on the date of Congressional notification.
    (ii) DoD employee notification. DoD Components shall, in accordance 
with 10 U.S.C. 2467(b), at least monthly during the development and 
preparation of

[[Page 736]]

the performance work statement (PWS) and management study, consult with 
DoD civilian employees who will be affected by the cost comparison and 
consider the views of such employees on the development and preparation 
of the PWS and management study. DoD Components may consult with such 
employees more frequently and on other matters relating to the cost 
comparison. In the case of DoD employees represented by a labor 
organization accorded exclusive recognition under 5 U.S.C. 7111, 
consultation with representatives of the labor organization satisfies 
the consultation requirement. Consultation with nonunion DoD civilian 
employees may be through such means as group meetings. Alternatively, 
DoD civilian employees may be invited to designate one or more 
representatives to speak for them. Other methods may be implemented if 
adequate notice is provided to the nonunion DOD civilian employees and 
the right to be represented during the consultations is ensured.
    (iii) Local notification. It is suggested that upon starting the 
cost comparison process, the installation make an announcement of the 
cost comparison, including a brief explanation of the cost-comparison 
process to the employees of the activity and the community. The 
installations' labor relations specialist also should be apprised to 
ensure appropriate notification to employees and their representatives 
in accordance with applicable collective bargaining agreements. Local 
Interservice Support Coordinators (ISCs) and the Chair of the 
appropriate Joint Interservice Regional Support Group (JIRSG) also 
should be notified of a pending cost comparison.
    (2) Performance Work Statement (PWS). (i) The PWS and its Quality 
Assurance Plan shall be prepared in accordance with part II of the 
Supplement to OMB Circular No. A-76 5 for full cost comparison, 
simplified cost comparisons, and direct conversions of DoD personnel 
commercial activities. The PWS shall include reasonable performance 
standards that can be used to ensure a comparable level of performance 
for both Government and contractor and a common basis for evaluation. 
Employees and/or their bargaining unit representatives should be 
encouraged to participate in preparing or reviewing the PWS.
    (ii) Each DoD Component shall:
    (A) Prepare PWSs that are based on accurate and timely historical or 
projected workload data and that provide measurable and verifiable 
performance standards.
    (B) Monitor the development and use of prototype PWSs.
    (C) Review and initiate action to correct disagreements on PWS 
discrepancies.
    (D) Approve prototype PWSs for Component-wide use.
    (E) Coordinate these efforts with the other DoD Components to avoid 
duplication and to provide mutual assistance.
    (iii) Guidance on Government Property:
    (A) For the purposes of this instruction, Government property is 
defined in accordance with the 48 CFR part 45.
    (B) The decision to offer or not to offer Government property to a 
contractor shall be determined by a cost-benefit analysis justifying 
that the decision is in the government's best interest. The 
determination on Government property must be supported by current, 
accurate, complete information and be readily available for the 
independent reviewing activity. The design of this analysis shall not 
give a decided advantage or disadvantage to either in-house or contract 
competitors. The management of Government property offered to the 
contractor shall also be in compliance with 48 CFR part 45.
    (iv) If a commercial activity provides critical or sensitive 
services, the PWS shall include sufficient data for the in-house 
organization and commercial sources to prepare a plan for expansion in 
emergency situations.
    (v) DoD Components that provide interservice support to other DoD 
Components or Federal agencies through interservice support agreements 
or other arrangements shall ensure that the PWS includes this work load 
and is coordinated with all affected Dod Components and Federal 
Agencies.
    (vi) If there is a requirement for the commercial source to have 
access to

[[Page 737]]

classified information in order to provide the product or service, the 
commercial source shall be processed for a facility security clearance 
under the Defense Industrial Security Program in accordance with DoD 
Directive 5220.22 \10\ and DoD Regulation 5220.22-R.\11\ However, if no 
bona fide requirement for access to classified information exists, no 
action shall be taken to obtain security clearance for the commercial 
source.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 169a.1(a).
    \11\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 169a.1(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (vii) Employees of commercial sources who do not require access to 
classified information for work performance, but require entry into 
restricted areas of the installation, may be authorized unescorted entry 
only when the provisions of DoD Regulation 5200.2-R \12\ apply.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 169a.1(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Management Study. A management study shall be performed to 
analyze completely the method of operation necessary to establish the 
most efficient and cost-effective in-house organization (MEO) needed to 
accomplish the requirements in the PWS. The MEO must reflect only 
approved resources for which the commercial activity has been 
authorized. As a part of the management study, installations should 
determine if specific requirements can be met through an Inter/
Intraservice Support Agreement (ISA) with other activities or Government 
Agencies which have excess capacity or capability.
    (i) The commercial activity management study is mandatory. Part III 
of the Supplement to OMB Circular No. A-76 provides guidance on how to 
conduct the management study. The study shall identify essential 
functions to be performed, determine performance factors, organization 
structure, staffing, and operating procedures for the most efficient and 
cost effective in-house performance of the commercial activity. The MEO 
becomes the basis of the Government estimate for the cost comparison 
with potential contractors. In this context, ``efficient'' (or cost-
effective) means that the required level of workload (output, as 
described in the performance work statement) is accomplished with as 
little resource consumption (input) as possible without degradation in 
the required quality level of products or services.
    (ii) DoD Components have formal programs and training for the 
performance of management studies, and those programs are appropriate 
for teaching how to conduct commercial activity management studies. Part 
III of the Supplement to OMB Circular No. A-76 does not purport to 
replace the DoD Component's own management techniques, but merely to 
establish the basic criteria and the interrelationship between the 
management study and the PWS.
    (iii) If a commercial activity provides critical or sensitive 
services, the management study shall include a plan for expansion in 
emergency situations.
    (iv) Early in the management study, management will solicit the 
views of the employees in the commercial activity under review, and/or 
their representatives for their recommendations as to the MEO or ways to 
improve the method of operation.
    (v) The management study will be the basis on which the DoD 
Component certifies that the Government cost estimate is based on the 
most efficient and cost effective organization practicable.
    (vi) Implementation of the MEO shall be initiated no later than 1 
month after cancellation of the soliciation and completed within 6 
months. DoD Components shall take action, within 1 month, to schedule 
and conduct a subsequent cost comparison when the MEO is not initiated 
and completed as prescribed above. Subsequent cost comparisons may be 
delayed by the DoD Component's central point of contact office, when 
situations outside the control of the DoD Component prevent timely or 
full implementation of the MEO. This authority may not be redelegated.
    (vii) DoD Components shall establish procedures to ensure that the 
in-house operation, as specified in the MEO, is capable of performing in 
accordance with the requirements of the PWS. The procedures also shall 
ensure that the resources (facilities, equipment, and personnel) 
specified in the MEO are available to the in-house operation and that 
in-house performance remains

[[Page 738]]

within the requirements and resources specified in the PWS and MEO for 
the period of the cost comparison, unless documentation to support 
changes in workload/scope is available.
    (viii) A management study is not required for simplified cost 
comparisons however, a MEO analysis and certification is required.
    (4) Cost Comparisons. Cost comparisons shall include all significant 
costs of both Government and contract performance. Common costs; that 
is, costs that would be the same for either in-house or contract 
operation, need not be computed, but the basis of those common costs 
must be identified and included in the cost comparison documentation. 
Part IV of the Supplement to OMB Circular A-76 (Cost Comparison 
Handbook) provides the basic guidance for conducting full cost 
comparisons. Appendix D provides guidance for conducting simplified cost 
comparisons. The supplemental guidance contained below is intended to 
establish uniformity and to ensure all factors are considered when 
making cost comparisons. Deviation from the guidance contained in part 
IV of the Supplement to OMB Circular A-76, will not be allowed, except 
as provided in the following subparagraphs.
    (i) In-house Cost Estimate. (A) The in-house cost estimate shall be 
based on the most efficient and cost-effective in-house organization 
needed to accomplish the requirements in the PWS.
    (B) Heads of DoD Components or their designees shall certify that 
the in-house cost estimate is based on the most efficient and cost-
effective operation practicable. Such certification shall be made before 
the bid opening or the date for receipt of initial proposals.
    (C) The ASD(P&L) shall provide inflation factors for adjusting costs 
for the first and subsequent performance periods. These factors shall be 
the only acceptable factors for use in cost comparisons. Inflation 
factors for outyear (second and subsequent) performance periods will not 
be applied to portions of the in-house estimate that are comparable with 
those portions of the contract estimate subject to economic price 
adjustment clauses.
    (D) Military positions in the organization under cost comparison 
shall be converted to civilian positions for costing purposes. Civilian 
grades and series shall be based on the work described in the PWS and 
the MEO, determined by the management study rather than on the current 
organization structure.
    (E) DoD Components shall not use the DLA Wholesale Stock Fund Rate 
and/or the DLA Direct Delivery rate for supplies and materials as 
reflected in paragraph 3.a. (1) and (2) of part IV of the Supplement to 
OMB Circular No. A-76. The current standard and pricing formula includes 
full cost under the Defense Business Operations Fund (DBOF). No further 
mark-up is required.
    (F) DoD Components shall assume for the purpose of depreciation 
computations that residual value is equal to the disposal values listed 
in Appendix C of part IV of the Supplemental to OMB Circular No. 76 
(Cost Comparison Handbook) if more precise figures are not available 
from the official accounting records or other knowledgeable authority. 
Therefore, the basis for depreciation shall be the original cost plus 
the cost of capital improvements (if any) less the residual value. The 
original cost plus the cost of capital improvements less the residual 
value shall be divided by the useful life (as projected for the 
commercial activity cost comparison) to determine the annual 
depreciation.
    (G) Purchased services which augment the current in-house work 
effort and that are included in the PWS should be included in line 3 
(other specifically attributable costs). When these purchased services 
are long-term and contain labor costs subject to economic price 
adjustment clauses, then the applicable labor portion will not be 
escalated by outyear inflation factors. In addition, purchased services 
shall be offset for potential Federal income tax revenue by applying the 
appropriate rate in Appendix D of part IV of the Supplement to OMB 
Circular A-76 (Cost Comparison Handbook) to total cost of purchased 
services.
    (H) Overhead costs shall be computed only when such costs will not 
continue in the event of contract performance. This includes the cost of 
any position (full time, part time, or intermittent) that is dedicated 
to providing support

[[Page 739]]

to the activity(ies) under cost comparison regardless of the support 
organization's location. Military positions provided overhead support 
shall be costed using current military composite standard rates that 
include PCS costs multiplied by the appropriate support factor.
    (ii) Cost of Contract Performance. (A) The contract cost estimate 
shall be based on firm bids or negotiated proposals solicited in 
accordance with the FAR and the DoD FAR Supplement (DFARS) for full cost 
comparisons. Existing contract prices (such as those from GSA Supply 
Schedules) will not be used in a cost comparison. For simplified cost 
comparisons, the guidance in Appendix C of this part applies.
    (B) Standby costs are costs incurred for the upkeep of property in 
standby status. Such costs neither add to the value of the property nor 
prolong its life, but keep it in efficient operating condition or 
available for use. When an in-house activity is terminated in favor of 
contract performance and an agency elects to hold Government equipment 
and facilities on standby solely to maintain performance capability, 
this is a management decision, and such standby costs will not be 
charged to the cost of contracting.
    (C) A specific waiver is required to use contract administration 
factors that exceed the limits established in Table 3-1 of part IV of 
the Supplement to OMB Circular No. A-76 (Cost Comparison Handbook). The 
reason for the deviation from the limits, the supporting alternative 
computation, and documentation supporting the alternative method, shall 
be provided to the DoD Component's central point of contact office for 
advance approval on a case-by-case basis. The authority may not be 
redelegated. ASD(A&L) shall be notified within 30 days of any such 
decisions.
    (D) The following guidance pertains to one-time conversion costs:
    (1) Material Related Costs. The cost factors below shall be used, if 
more precise costs are not known, to estimate the cost associated with 
disposal/transfer of excess government material which result from a 
conversion to contract performance:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                  Percentage of current
                                                     replacement cost
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Packing, crating , and handling (PCH)..........                      3.5
Transportation.................................                     3.75
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Labor-Related Costs. If unique circumstances prevail when a 
strict application of the 2 percent factor for computation of severance 
pay results in a substantial overstatement or understatement of this 
cost, an alternative methodology may be employed. The reason for the 
deviation from this standard, the alternative computation, and 
documentation supporting the alternative method shall be provided to the 
appropriate DoD Component's central point of contact office for advance 
approval on a case-by-case basis. This authority may not be redelegated.
    (3) Other Transition Costs. Normally, government personnel 
assistance after the contract start date (to assist in transition from 
in-house performance to contract performance) should not be necessary. 
When transition assistance will not be made available, this condition 
should be stated clearly in the solicitation so that contractors will be 
informed that they will be expected to meet full performance 
requirements from the first date of the contract. Also, when 
circumstances require full performance on the contract start date, the 
solicitation shall state that time will be made available for contractor 
indoctrination prior to the start date of the contract. The inclusion of 
personnel transition costs in a cost comparison requires advance 
approval of the DoD Component's central point of contact office. This 
authority may not be redelegated.
    (E) Gain or Loss on Disposal/Transfer of Assets. If more precise 
costs are not available from the Defense Reutilization and Marketing 
Office or appropriate authority, then:
    (1) The same factors for PCH and transportation costs as prescribed 
in Sec. 169a.12E(ii)(D)(1) for the costs associated with disposal/
transfer of materials may be used.
    (2) The estimated disposal value may be calculated from the net book 
value as derived from the table in Appendix C of part IV of the 
Supplement to OMB Circular No. A-76 (Cost Comparison Handbook), minus 
the disposal/transfer

[[Page 740]]

costs. This figure shall be entered as a gain or loss on line 11 or line 
13 of the cost comparison form as appropriate.

    Note: If a cost-benefit analysis, as prescribed in Sec. 
169a.12(B)(iii), indicates that the retention of Government-owned 
facilities, equipment, or real property for use elsewhere in the 
Government is cost advantageous to the Government, then the cost 
comparison form shall reflect a gain to the Government and therefore a 
decrease to the cost of contracting on line 11 or line 13 of the cost 
comparison form as appropriate.

<R05>
Sec. 169a.16  Independent review.

    (a) The estimates of in-house and contracting costs that can be 
computed before the cost comparison shall be reviewed by a qualified 
activity, independent of the Task Group preparing the cost comparison. 
This review shall be completed far enough in advance of the bid or 
initial proposal opening date to allow the DoD Component to correct any 
discrepancies found before sealing the in-house cost estimate.
    (b) The independent review shall substantiate the currency, 
reasonableness, accuracy, and completeness of the inhouse estimate. The 
review shall ensure that the in-house cost estimate is based on the same 
required services, performance standards, and workload contained in the 
solicitation. The reviewer shall scrutinize and attest to the adequacy 
and authenticity of the supporting documentation. Supporting 
documentation shall be sufficient to require no additional 
interpretation.
    (c) The purpose of the independent review is to ensure costs have 
been estimated and supported in accordance with provisions of this 
Instruction. If no (or only minor) discrepancies are noted during this 
review, the reviewer indicates the minor discrepancies, signs, dates, 
and returns the CCF to the preparer. If significant discrepancies are 
noted during the review, the discrepancies shall be reported to the 
preparer for recommended correction and resubmission.
    (d) The independent review is not required for simplified cost 
comparisons.

[50 FR 40805, Oct. 7, 1985, as amended at 57 FR 29210, July 1, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 169a.17  Solicitation considerations.

    (a) Every effort must be made to avoid postponement or cancellation 
of CA solicitations even if there are significant changes, omissions, or 
defects in the Government's in-house cost estimate. Such corrections 
shall be made before the expiration of bids or proposals and may require 
the extensions of bids or proposals. When there is no alternative, 
contracting officers must clearly document the reason(s).
    (b) Bidders or offerers shall be informed that an in-house cost 
estimate is being developed and that a contract may or may not result.
    (c) Bids or proposals shall be on at least a 3-year multi-year basis 
(when appropriate) or shall include prepriced renewal options to cover 2 
fiscal years after the initial period.
    (d) All contracts awarded as a result of a conversion (whether or 
not a cost comparison was performed) shall comply with all requirements 
of the FAR and DFARS.
    (e) Solicitations shall be restricted for preferential procurement 
when the requirements applicable to such programs (such as, small 
business set-asides or other required sources of supplies and services) 
are met, in accordance with the FAR.
    (f) Solicitations will not be restricted for preferential 
procurement unless the contracting officer determines that there is a 
reasonable expectation that the commercial prices will be fair and 
reasonable, in accordance with the FAR.
    (g) Contract defaults may result in temporary performance by 
Government personnel or other suitable means; such as, an interim 
contract source. Personnel detailed to such a temporary assignment 
should be clearly informed that they will return to their permanent 
assignment when a new contract is awarded. If the default occurs within 
the first year of contract performance, the following procedures apply:
    (1) If the Government was the next lowest bidder/offerer, and in-
house performance is still feasible, the function may be returned to in-
house performance. If in-house performance is no longer feasible, the 
contracting officer

[[Page 741]]

shall obtain the requirement by contract in accordance with the 
requirements of the FAR, 48 CFR part 49. A return to in-house 
performance under the above criteria shall be approved by the DoD 
Component's central point of contact office. This authority may not be 
redelegated.
    (2) If the contract wage rates are no longer valid or if the 
contracting officer, after a review of the availability of the next 
lowest responsible and responsive bidders/offerers, determines that 
resolicitation is appropriate, the Government may submit a bid for 
comparison with other bids/offers from the private sector. Submission of 
a Government bid requires a determination by the DoD Component that 
performance by DoD employees is still feasible and that a likelihood 
exists that such performance may be more economical than performance by 
contract. In such cost comparisons, the conversion differentials will 
not be applied to the costs of either in-house or contract performance.
    (h) If contract default occurs during the second or subsequent year 
of contract performance, the procedures of Sec. 169a.8(b)(2)(i) of this 
part apply.
    (1) Grouping of Commercial Activities.
    (i) The installation commander shall determine carefully which CAs 
should be grouped in a single solicitation. The installation commander 
should keep in mind that the grouping of commercial activities can 
influence the amount of competition (number of commercial firms that 
will bid or submit proposals) and the eventual cost to the Government.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (2) The installation commander shall consider the adverse impacts 
that the grouping of commercial activities into a single solicitation 
may have on small and small disadvantaged business concerns. Commercial 
activities being performed wholly by small or small disadvantaged 
businesses will not be incorporated into a cost comparison unless 
consolidation is necessary to meet mission requirements. Actions must be 
taken to ensure that such contractors are not displaced merely to 
accomplish consolidation. Similarly, care must be taken so that 
nonincumbent small and small disadvantaged business contractors are not 
handicapped or prejudiced unduly from competing effectively at the prime 
contractor level.
    (3) In developing solicitations for commercial activities, the 
procurement plan should reflect an analysis of the advantages and 
disadvantages to the Government that might result from making more than 
one award. The decision to group commercial activities should reflect an 
analysis of all relevant factors including the following:
    (A) The effect on competition.
    (B) The duplicative management functions and costs to be eliminated 
through grouping.
    (C) The economies of administering multifunction vs. single function 
contracts, including cost risks associated with the pricing structure of 
each.
    (D) The feasibility of separating unrelated functional tasks or 
groupings.
    (E) The effect grouping will have on the performance of the 
functions.
    (4) When the solicitation package includes totally independent 
functions which are clearly divisible, severable, limited in number, and 
not price interrelated, they shall be solicited on the basis of an ``any 
or all'' bid or offer. Commerical bidders or offerors shall be permitted 
to submit bids or offers on one or any combination of the functions 
being solicited. These bids or offers shall be evaluated to determine 
the lowest aggregate contract cost to the Government. This lowest 
aggregate contract cost then will be compared to the in-house cost 
estimate based on the MEO for performance of the functions in the single 
solicitation. The procedures in part IV of the Supplement to OMB 
Circular No. A-76 (Cost Comparison Handbook) apply.
    (5) There are instances when this approach to contracting for CAs 
may not apply; such as, situations when physical limitations of site 
(where the activities are to be performed) preclude allowing more than 
one contractor to perform, when the function cannot be divided for 
purposes of performance accountability, or for other national security 
considerations. However, if an ``all or none'' solicitation is issued, 
the decision to do so must include a cost analysis to reflect that the 
``all or none'' solicitation is less costly to the

[[Page 742]]

Government or an analysis indicating it is otherwise in the best 
interest of the Government, all factors considered.
    (6) It is recognized that in some cases, decisions will result in 
the elimination of prime contracting opportunities for small business. 
In such cases special measures shall be taken. At a minimum, small and 
small disadvantaged business concerns shall be given preferential 
consideration by all competing prime contractors in the award of 
subcontracts. For negotiated procurements the degree to which this is 
accomplished will be a weighted factor in the evaluation and source 
selection process leading to contract award.
    (7) The contract files shall be documented fully to demonstrate 
compliance with these procedures.
    (i) If no bids or proposals, or no responsive or responsible bids or 
proposals are received in response to a solicitation, the in-house cost 
estimate shall remain unopened. The contracting officer shall examine 
the solicitation to ascertain why no responses were received. Depending 
on the results of this review, the contracting officer shall consider 
restructuring the requirement, if feasible and reissue it under 
restricted or unrestricted solicitation procedures, as appropriate.
    (j) Continuation of an in-house CA for lack of a satisfactory 
commercial source will not be based upon lack of response to a 
restricted solicitation.
    (k) The guidance of subparagraph E.3.f. applies to sumplified cost 
comparisons and direct conversions of military personnel CAs.
    (l) To ensure that bonds and/or insurance requirements are being 
used in the best interest of the Government, as a general rule, 
requirements (for other than construction related services) above the 
levels established in the FAR and DFARS should not be included in 
acquisitions.

<R05>
Sec. 169a.18  Administrative appeal procedures.

    (a) Appeals of Cost Comparison Decisions. (1) Each DoD Component 
shall establish an administrative appeals procedure to resolve questions 
from directly affected parties relating to determinations resulting from 
cost comparisons performed in compliance with this part. The appeal 
procedure will not apply to questions concerning the following:
    (i) Award to one contractor in preference to another;
    (ii) DoD management decisions.
    (2) The appeals procedure is to provide an administrative safeguard 
to ensure that DoD Component decisions are fair, equitable, and in 
accordance with procedures in this part. The procedure does not 
authorize an appeal outside the DoD Component or a judicial review.
    (3) The appeals procedure shall be independent and objective and 
provide for a decision on the appeal within 30 calendar days of receipt 
of the appeal. The decision shall be made by an impartial official at a 
level organizationally higher than the official who approved the cost 
comparison decision. The appeal decision shall be final, unless the DoD 
Component procedures provide for further discretionary review within the 
DoD Component.
    (4) All detailed documentation supporting the initial cost 
comparison decision shall be made available to directly affected parties 
upon request when the initial decision is announced. The detailed 
documentation shall include, at a minimum, the following: the in-house 
cost estimate with detailed supporting documentation (see Sec. 
169a.5(c)(ii) of this part), the completed CCF, name of the tentative 
winning contractor (if the decision is to contract), or the price of the 
bidder whose bid or proposal would have been most advantageous to the 
Government (if the decision is to perform in-house). If the 
documentation is not available when the initial decision is announced, 
the time alloted for submission of appeals shall be extended the number 
of days equal to the delay.
    (5) To be considered eligible for review under the DoD Component 
appeals procedures, appeals shall:
    (i) Be received by the DoD Component in writing within 15 working 
days after the date the supporting documentation is made available to 
directly affected parties.

[[Page 743]]

    (ii) Address specific line items on the CCF and the rationale for 
questioning those items.
    (iii) Demonstrate that the result of the appeal may change the 
decision.
    (b) Appeals of Simplified Cost Comparisons and Direct Conversions.
    (1) Directly affected parties may appeal decision to convert to 
contract based on a simplified cost comparison involving 11-45 DoD 
civilian employees or a direct conversion involving 10 or fewer DoD 
civilian employees. The appeal must address reasons why fair and 
reasonable prices will not be obtainable.
    (2) Each DoD Component shall establish an administrative appeal 
procedure that is independent and objective; Installation Commanders 
must make available, upon request, the documentation supporting the 
decision to directly convert activities; appeals of direct conversions 
must be filed within 30 calendar days after the decision is announced in 
the Commerce Business Daily and/or Federal Register, and the supporting 
documentation is made available; an impartial official one level 
organizationally higher than the official who approved the direct 
conversion decision shall hear the appeal; officials shall provide an 
appeal decision within 30 calendar days of receipt of the appeal.
    (c) Since the appeal procedure is intended to protect the rights of 
all directly affected parties, the DoD Component's procedures, as well 
as the decision upon appeal, will not be subject to negotiation, 
arbitration, or agreement.
    (d) DoD Components shall include administrative appeal procedures as 
part of their implementing documents.

respect to a single function activity or 48 months after initiation of 
such study for a multi-function activity.

Sec. 169a.21  Reporting requirements.

    (a) Inventory and Review Schedule (Report Control Symbol DD-A&T(A) 
1540). See Sec. 169a.8(a) of this part.
    (b) Commercial Activities Management Information System (CAMIS) 
(Report Control Symbol DD-A&T(Q) 1542). (1) The purpose of CAMIS is to 
maintain an accurate DoD data base of commercial activities that undergo 
an OMB Circular A-76 cost comparison and CAs that are converted directly 
to contract without a cost comparison. The CAMIS is used to provide 
information to the Congress, Office of Management Budget (OMB), General 
Accounting Office (GAO), OSD, and others. The CAMIS is divided into two 
parts. Part I contains data on CAs that undergo cost comparison. Part II 
contains data on commercial activities converted to contract without a 
full cost comparison.
    (2) The CAMIS report shall be submitted in accordance with the 
procedures in Appendix C.
    (c) Congressional Data Reports on CA (Report Control Symbol DD-
A&T(A&AR) 1949) and Reports on savings on Costs from Increased Use of 
DoD Civilian Personnel (Report Control Symbol DD-A&T(AR) 1950). To 
insure consistent application of the requirements stated in 10 U.S.C. 
2461 and 2463, the following guidance is provided:
    (1) The geographic scope of section 10 U.S.C. 2461 applies to the 
United States, its territories and possessions, the District of 
Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
    (2) Section 10 U.S.C. 2461 applies to proposed conversions of DoD 
CAs that on October 1, 1980, were being performed by more than forty-
five DoD civilian employees. 10 U.S.C. 2463 applies to conversions from 
contract to in-house involving 50 or more contractor employees.
    (3) DoD Components must not proceed with a CA study until 
notification to Congress, as required by 10 U.S.C.

[[Page 744]]

2461. DoD Components shall notify the ASD(ES) of any such intent at 
least 5 working days before congressional notification.
    (4) DoD Components shall annotate announcements to Congress when a 
cost comparison is planned at an activity listed in the report to 
Congress on Core Logistics (see Sec. 169a.8(b)(1)(i)(2) of this part).
    (5) The DoD Components shall notify Congress, at least 5 working 
days before sending the detailed summary report required by 10 U.S.C. 
2461 to Congress. The detailed summary of the cost shall include: the 
amount of the offer accepted for the performance of the activity by the 
private contractor; the costs and expenditures that the Government will 
incur because of the contract; the estimated cost of performance of the 
activity by the most efficient Government organization; a statement 
indicating the life of the contract; and certifications that the entire 
cost comparison is available, and that the Government calculation for 
the cost of performance of such function by DoD employees is based on an 
estimate of the most efficient and cost-effective organization for 
performance of such function by DoD employees.
    (6) The potential economic effect on the employees affected, the 
local community, and the Federal Government of contracting for 
performance of the function shall be included in the report to accompany 
the above certifications, if more than 75 total employees (including 
military and civilian, both permanent and temporary) are potentially 
affected. It is suggested that the Army Corps of Engineers' model (or 
equivalent) be used to generate this information. The potential impact 
on affected employees shall be included in the report, regardless of the 
number of employees involved. Also include in the report a statement 
that the decision was made to convert to contractor performance, the 
projected date of contract award, the projected contract start date, and 
the effect of contracting the function on the military mission of that 
function.
    (7) By December 15th of each year, each DoD Component shall submit 
to the ASD(P&L) the data required by 10 U.S.C. 2461(c). In describing 
the extent to which CA functions were performed by DoD contractors 
during the preceding fiscal year, include the estimated number of work 
years for the in-house operation as well as for contract operation 
(including percentages) by major OSD functional areas in Appendix A to 
this part; such as, Social Services, Health Services, Installation 
Services, etc. For the estimate of the percentage of CA functions that 
will be performed in-house and those that will be performed by contract 
during the fiscal year during which the report is submitted, include the 
estimated work years for in-house CAs as well as for contracted CAs and 
the rationale for significant changes when compared to the previous 
year's data. Also, include the number of studies you expect to complete 
in the next fiscal year showing total civilian and military FTEs.

[50 FR 40805, Oct. 7, 1985, as amended at 57 FR 29210, July 1, 1992; 60 
FR 67329, Dec. 29, 1995]

     Appendix C to Part 169a--Simplified Cost Comparison and Direct 
                            Conversion of CAs

    A. This appendix provides guidance on procedures to be followed in 
order to convert a commercial activity employing 45 or fewer DoD 
civilian employees to contract performance without a full cost 
comparison. DoD Components may directly convert functions with 10 or 
fewer civilian employees without conducting a simplified cost 
comparison. Simplified cost comparisons may only be conducted on 
activities with 45 or fewer DoD civilian employees.
    B. Direct conversions with 10 or fewer DoD civilian employees must 
meet the following criteria:
    1. The activity is currently performed by 10 or fewer civilian 
employees.
    2. The direct conversion makes sense from a management or 
performance standpoint.
    3. The direct conversion is cost effective.
    4. The installation commander should attempt to place or retrain 
displaced DoD civilian employees by
    a. Placing or retraining employees in available permanent vacant 
positions, or
    b. Assigning displaced employees to valid temporary or over-hire 
positions in similar activities for gainful employment until permanent 
vacancies are available. The type of employee appointment (e.g., career, 
career-conditional, etc., or change from competitive to excepted service 
or vice versa) must not change, or
    c. Where no vacancies exist or are projected, offer employees 
retraining opportunities under the Job Training Partnership Act or 
similar retraining programs for transitioning into the private sector.
    5. The function to be directly converted does not include any DoD 
civilian positions that were as a result of DoD Component streamlining 
plans and/or were removed with buyout offers that satisfied Section 5 of 
the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act requirements.
    C. The following provides general guidance for completion of a 
simplified cost comparison:
    1. Estimated contractor costs should be based on either the past 
history of similar contracts at other installations or on the 
contracting officer's best estimate of what would constitute a fair and 
reasonable price.
    2. For activities small in total size (45 or fewer civilian and 
military personnel):
    a. Estimated in-house cost generally should not include overhead 
costs, as it is unlikely that they would be a factor for a small 
activity.
    b. Similarly, estimated contractor costs generally should not 
include contract administration, on-time conversion costs, or other 
contract price add-ons associated with full cost comparisons.
    3. For activities large in total size (including those with a mix of 
civilian and military personnel) all cost elements should be considered 
for both in-house and contractor estimated costs.
    4. In either case, large or small, the 10 percent conversion 
differential contained in part IV of the Supplement to OMB Circular No. 
A-76 should be applied.
    5. Part IV of the Supplement to OMB Circular No. A-76 shall be 
utilized to define the specific elements of cost to be estimated.
    6. Clearance for CA simplified cost comparison decisions are 
required for Agencies without their own Legislative Affairs (LA) and 
Public Affairs (PA) offices. Those Agencies shall submit their draft 
decision brief to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense 
(Installations) room 3E813, the Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301 for 
release to Congress.
    7. Provide CA simplified cost comparison approvals containing a 
certification of the MEO analysis, a copy of the approval to convert, a 
copy of the cost comparison, with back-up data, before conversion to the 
following:
    a. Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and 
the Senate (11-45 civilian employees only).
    b. Copies of the following:
    (1) Assistant Secretary of Defense (LA), room 3D918, the Pentagon, 
Washington, DC 20301.
    (2) Assistant Secretary of Defense (PA), room 2E757, the Pentagon, 
Washington, DC 20301.
    (3) Office of Economic Adjustment, room 4C767, the Pentagon, 
Washington, DC 20301.
    (4) Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, (Installations), room 
3E813, the Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301. (exception--no copies 
required from Agencies that do not have legislative and public affairs 
offices).
    8. Most Efficient and Cost-Effective Analysis for Contractor 
Performance of an Activity (Report Control Symbol DD-A&T(AR) 1951. The 
installation commander must certify that the estimated in-house cost for 
activities involving 11 to 45 DoD civilian employees are based on a 
completed most efficient and cost effective organization analysis. 
Certification of this MEO analysis, as required by Public Law 103-139, 
shall be provided to the Committee on Appropriations of the House of

 Appendix D to Part 169a--Commercial Activities Management Information 
                             System (CAMIS)

    Each DoD Component shall create and manage their CAMIS data base. 
The CAMIS data base shall have a comprehensive edit check on all input 
data in the computerized system. All data errors in the CAMIS data base 
shall be corrected as they are found by the established edit check 
program. The data elements described in this appendix represents the DoD 
minimum requirements.
    On approval of a full cost comparison, a simplified cost comparison, 
or a direct conversion CA, the DoD Component shall create the initial 
entry using the data elements in part I for full cost comparisons and 
data elements in part II for all other conversions. Within 30 days of 
the end of each quarter the DoD Component shall submit a floppy 
diskette. Data files must be in American Standard Code Information 
Interchange text file format on a MicroSoft-Disk Operating System 
formatted 3.5 inch floppy diskette. Provide submissions in the Defense 
Utility Energy Reporting System format. The data shall be submitted in 
the Director, Installations Management (D,IM), 400 Army Navy Drive, Room 
206, Arlington, VA 22202-2884 at least 60 days prior to the end of the 
quarter. The D,IM shall use the automated data to update the CAMIS. If 
the DoD Component is unable to provide data in an automated format, the 
D,IM shall provide quarterly printouts of cost comparison records (CCR) 
and conversion and/or comparison records (DCSCCR) that may be annotated 
and returned within 30 days of the end of each quarter to the D,IM. The 
D,IM then shall use the annotated printouts to update the CAMIS.

                         Part I--Cost Comparison

    The record for each cost comparison is divided into six sections. 
Each of these sections contains information provided by the DoD 
Components. The first five sections are arranged in a sequence of 
milestone events occurring during a cost comparison. Each section is 
completed immediately following the completion of the milestone event. 
These events are as follows:
    1. Cost comparison is approved by DoD Component.
    2. Solicitation is issued.
    3. In-house and contractor costs are compared.
    4. Contract is awarded/solicitation is canceled.
    5. Contract starts.
    The events are used as milestones because upon their completion some 
elements of significant information concerning the cost comparison 
become known.
    A sixth section is utilized for CCRs that result in award of a 
contract. This section contains data elements on contract cost and 
information on subsequent contract actions during the second and third 
year of contract operation.
    The data elements that comprise these six sections are defined in 
this enclosure.

       Part II--Direct Conversions and Simplified Cost Comparisons

    The record for each direct conversion and simplified cost comparison 
is divided into six sections. Each of the first five sections is 
completed immediately following the completion of the following events:
    1. DoD Component approves CA action.
    2. The solicitation is issued.
    3. In-house and contractor costs are compared.
    4. Contract is awarded or solicitation is canceled.
    5. Contract starts.
    A sixth section is utilized for tracking historical data after the 
direct conversion or simplified cost comparison is completed. This 
section contains data elements on contracts and cost information during 
the second and third performance period. The data elements that comprise 
the six sections in part II, of this Appendix, are defined in the CAMIS 
Entry and Update Instruction, Part II--Direct Conversions and Simplified 
Cost Comparisons.

                   Camis Entry and Update Instructions

                        Part I--Cost Comparisons

    The bracketed number preceding each definition in sections one 
through five is the DoD data element number. All date fields should be 
in the format MMDDYY (such as, June 30, 1983 = 063083).

    [15] Revised and/or original cost comparison number. When a 
consolidation occurs, create a new CCR containing the attributes of the 
consolidated cost comparison. In the CCR of each cost comparison being 
consolidated, enter the cost comparison number of the new CCR in this 
data element and code ``Z'' in data element [12] of this attachment. In 
the new CCR, this data element should be blank and data element [12] of 
this attachment should denote the current status of the cost comparison. 
Once the consolidation has occurred, only the new CCR requires future 
updates. When a single cost comparison is being broken into multiple 
cost comparisons, create a new CCR for each cost comparison broken out 
from the original cost comparison. Each new CCR shall contain its own 
unique set of attributes; in data element [15] of this attachment enter 
the cost comparison number of the original cost comparison from which 
each was derived, and in data element [12] of this attachment enter the 
current status of each cost comparison. For the original cost 
comparison, data element [15] of this attachment, should be blank and 
data element [12] of this attachment should have a code ``B'' entry. 
Only the derivative record entries require future updates. When a 
consolidation or a breakout occurs, an explanatory remark shall be 
entered in data element [57] of this attachment (such as, ``part of SW 
region cost comparison,'' or, ``separated into three cost 
comparisons'').

                               Section Two

                    Event: The Solicitation is Issued

    The entries in this section of the CCR provide information on the 
personnel authorized to perform the workload in the PWS, the number of 
workyears used to accomplish the workload in the PWS, and the type and 
kind of solicitation.
    The DoD Component shall enter the following data elements at the 
first quarterly update subsequent to the issuance of the solicitation:
    [17] [Reserved]
    [18] Solicitation-Type Code. A one-character alpha designator that 
identifies the type of solicitation used to obtain contract bids or 
offers. Use either the CBD as the source document or information 
received from the contracting officer for this entry. Solicitations 
under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act are negotiated. Enter one 
of the following codes:

S--Sealed Bid
N--Negotiated

    [19] Solicitation Kind Code. A one-character (or two-character, if 
``W'' suffix is used) alpha designator indicating whether the 
competition for the contract has been limited to a specific class of 
bidders or offerors. Use either the CBD as the source document or 
information received from the contracting officer to enter one of the 
following codes:

A--Restrict to small business
B--Small Business Administration 8(a) Set Aside
C--Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (JWOD)
D--Other mandatory sources

    [20] Current Authorized Civilians and [21] Current Authorized 
Military. The number of civilian and military authorizations allocated 
on the DoD Component's manpower documents to perform the work described 
in the PWS. This number refines the initial authorization estimate 
(section one, data elements [13] and [14]).
    [22] Baseline Annual Workyears Civilian and [23] Baseline Annual 
Workyears Military. The number of annual workyears it has taken to 
perform the work described by the PWS before the DoD Component conducts 
the MEO study of the in-house organizations; do not include contract 
monitor requirements. Military workyears include assigned, borrowed, 
diverted, and detailed personnel.
    An annual workyear is the use of 2,087 hours (including authorized 
leave and paid time off for training). For example, when full-time 
employees whose work is completely within the PWS are concerned, ``one 
workyear'' normally is comparable to ``one employee'' or two part-time 
employees, each working 1,043 hours in a fiscal year. Also include in 
this total the workyears for full-time employees who do not work on a 
full-time basis on the work described by the PWS. For example, some 
portion of the workload is performed by persons from another work center 
who are used on an ``as needed'' basis. Their total hours performing 
this workload is 4,172 hours. This would be reflected as two workyears. 
Less than one-half year of effort should be rounded down, and one-half 
year or more should be rounded up.
    These workyear figures shall be the baseline for determining the 
manpower savings identified by the management study.

offer and is subject to preaward surveys and resolution of all appeals 
and protests. In a sealed bid procurement, the initial decision is 
announced at bid opening. In a negotiated procurement, the initial 
decision is announced when the cost comparison is made between the in-
house estimate and the proposal of the selected offeror.
    [25] Cost Comparison Preliminary Results Code. A one-character alpha 
designator indicating the results of the cost comparison as announced by 
the contracting officer at the time the bids or offers are compared. The 
entries are limited to two possibilities:

was canceled (when the contracting officer publishes an amendment to the 
solicitation canceling it).
    [29] Cost Comparison Final Result Code. A one-character alpha 
designator identifying the final result of the comparison between in-
house and contractor costs; the contracting officer either awards the 
contract or cancels the solicitation. Enter one of the following codes:

I--In-house
C--Contract

    [30] Decision Rationale Code. A one-character alpha designator that 
identifies the rationale for awarding a contract or canceling the 
solicitation. The work shall be performed in-house or by contractor, 
based on cost, or the work shall be performed in-house because no 
satisfactory commercial source was available (no bids or offers were 
received or the preaward survey resulted in the determination that no 
commercial sources were responsive or responsible). Enter one of the

Secretary of Defense prior to sale that the person or entity is capable 
of meeting the terms and conditions of a contract to deliver fire 
retardant by air.
    (a) Prior to sales offerings of aircraft or aircraft parts, the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) must provide to the Defense 
Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS), in writing, a list of 
persons or entities eligible to bid under this Act, including expiration 
date of each USDA contract, and locations covered by the USDA contract.

Sec. 171.5  Sale procedures.

    Disposal of aircraft and aircraft parts must be in accordance with 
the provisions of Chapter 4 of DOD 4160.21-M, paragraph B2, and with 
other pertinent parts of this manual, with the following changes and 
additions:
    (a) Sales shall be limited to the aircraft types listed in 
Attachment 1 of Chapter 4 of DOD 4160.21-M, and parts thereto (i.e., no 
aircraft or aircraft parts listed as Munitions List Items on the State 
Department's U.S. Munitions List).
    (b) Sales shall be made at fair market value (FMV), as determined by 
the Secretary of Defense and, to the extent practicable, on a 
competitive basis.
    (1) DRMS must conduct sales utilizing FMVs that are either provided 
by the Military Services on the Disposal Turn-In Documents (DTIDs) or 
based on DRMS' professional expertise and knowledge of the market. 
Advice regarding FMV shall be provided to DRMS by USDA, as appropriate.
    (2) If the high bid for a sale item does not equal or exceed the 
FMV, DRMS is vested with the discretion to reject all bids and reoffer 
the item:
    (i) On another wildfire suppression sale if there is indication that 
reoffer may be successful, or,
    (ii) With DLA concurrence, as normal surplus under the FPMR if there 
is no such indication.

[[Page 771]]

    (3) Disposition of proceeds from sale of aircraft under the Act will 
be as prescribed in guidance from the Under Secretary of Defense 
(Comptroller).
    (c) Purchases shall certify that aircraft and aircraft parts will be 
used only in accordance with conditions stated in Sec. 171.3.
    (1) Sales solicitations will require bidders to submit end-use 
certificates with their bids, stating the intended use and proposed 
areas of operations.
    (2) The completed end-use certificates shall be used in the bid 
evaluation process.
    (d) Sales contracts shall include terms and conditions for verifying 
and enforcing the use of the aircraft and aircraft parts in accordance 
with provisions of this guidance.
    (1) The DRMS Sales Contracting Officer (SCO) is responsible for 
verifying and enforcing the use of aircraft and aircraft parts in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of the sales contract.
    (i) Sales contracts include provisions for on-site visits to the 
purchaser's place(s) of business and/or worksite(s).
    (ii) Sales contracts require the purchaser to make available to the 
SCO, upon his or her request, all records concerning the use of aircraft 
and aircraft parts.
    (2) USDA shall nominate in writing, and the SCO shall appoint, 
qualified Government employees (not contract employees) to serve as 
Contracting Officer's Representatives (CORs) for the purpose of 
conducting on-site verification and enforcement of the use of aircraft 
and aircraft parts for those purposes permitted by the sales contract.
    (i) COR appointments must be in writing and must state the COR's 
duties, the limitations of the appointment, and the reporting 
requirements.
    (ii) USDA bears all COR costs.
    (iii) The SCO may reject any COR nominee for cause, or terminate any 
COR appointment for cause.
    (3) Sales contracts require purchasers to comply with the Federal 
Aviation Agency (FAA) requirements in Chapter 4 of DOD 4160.21-M, 
paragraphs B 2 b (4)(d)2 through (40)(d)5.
    (4) Sales contracts require purchasers to comply with the Flight 
Safety Critical Aircraft Parts regime in Chapter 4 of DOD 4160.21-M, 
paragraph B 26 c and d, and in Attachment 3 of Chapter 4 of DOD 4160.21-
M.
    (5) Sales contracts require purchasers to obtain the prior written 
consent of the SCO for resale of aircraft or aircraft parts purchased 
from DRMS under this Act. Resales are only permitted to other entities 
which, at time of resale, meet the qualifications required of initial 
purchasers. The SCO must seek, and USDA must provide, written assurance 
as to the acceptability of a prospective repurchaser before approving 
resale. Resales will normally be approved for airtanker contracts which 
have completed their contracts, or which have had their contracts 
terminated, or which can provide other valid reasons for seeking resale 
which are acceptable to the SCO.
    (i) If it is determined by the SCO that there is no interest in the 
aircraft or aircraft parts being offered for resale among entities 
deemed qualified repurchasers by USDA, the SCO may permit resale to 
entities outside the airtanker industry.
    (ii) When an aircraft or aircraft parts are determined to be 
uneconomically repairable and suitable only for cannibalization and/or 
scrapping, the purchaser shall advise the SCO in writing and provide 
evidence in the form of a technical inspection document from a qualified 
FAA airframe and powerplant mechanic, or equivalent.
    (iii) The policy outlined in paragraph (d)(5) of this section also 
applies to resales by repurchasers, and to all other manner of proposed 
title transfer (including, but no limited to, exchange and barters).
    (iv) Sales of aircraft and aircraft parts under the Act are intended 
for principals only. Sales offerings will caution prospective purchasers 
not to buy with the expectation of acting as brokers, dealers, agents, 
or middlemen for other interested parties.
    (6) The failure of a purchaser to comply with the sales contract 
terms and conditions may be cause for suspension and/or debarment, in 
addition to other administrative, contractual, civil, and criminal 
(including, but not limited to, 18 U.S.C. 1001) remedies which may be 
available to DOD.

[[Page 772]]

    (7) Aircraft parts will be made available in two ways:
    (i) DRMS may, based on availability and demand, offer for sale under 
the Act whole unflyable aircraft, aircraft carcasses for 
cannibalization, or aircraft parts, utilizing substantially the same 
provisions outlined in paragraphs (a) through (d)(6) of this section for 
flyable aircraft.
    (A) If USDA directs that DRMS set aside parts for sale under the 
Act, USDA must provide listings of parts required, by National Stock 
Number and Condition Code.
    (B) Only qualified airtanker operators which fly the end-term 
aircraft will be allowed to purchase unflyable aircraft, aircraft 
carcasses, or aircraft parts applicable to that end-item.
    (C) FMVs are not required for aircraft parts. DRMS must utilize 
historic prices received for similar parts in making sale 
determinations.
    (ii) As an agency of the Federal Government, USDA remains eligible 
to receive no-cost transfers of excess DOD aircraft parts under the 
FPMR.


<R05>
Sec. 171.6  Reutilization and transfer procedures.

    Prior to any sales effort, the Secretary of Defense shall, to the 
maximum extent practicable, consult with the Administrator of GSA, and 
with the heads of other Federal departments and agencies as appropriate, 
regarding reutilization and transfer requirements for aircraft and 
aircraft parts under this Act (see Chapter 4 of DOD 4160.21-M, 
paragraphs B 2 b (1) through B 2 b (3)).
    (a) DOD reutilization:
    (1) USDA shall notify Army, Navy, and/or Air Force, in writing, of 
their aircraft requirements as they arise, by aircraft type listed in 
Attachment 1 of Chapter 4 of DOD 4160.21-M.
    (2) If a DOD requirement exists, the owning Military Service shall 
advise USDA, in writing, that it will be issuing the aircraft to satisfy 
the DOD reutilization requirement. If USDA disputes the validity of the 
DOD requirement, it shall send a written notice of dispute to the owning 
Military Service and ADUSD(L&MR/SCI) within thirty (30) days of its 
notice from the Military Service. ADUSD(L&MR/SCI) shall then resolve the 
dispute, in writing. The aircraft may not be issued until the dispute 
has been resolved.
    (b) Federal agency transfer:
    (1) The Military Service must report aircraft which survive 
reutilization screening to GSA Region 9 on a Standard Form 120. GSA 
shall screen for Federal agency transfer requirements in accordance with 
the FPMR.
    (2) If a Federal agency requirement exists, GSA shall advise USDA, 
in writing, that it will be issuing the aircraft to satisfy the Federal 
agency requirement. If USDA disputes the validity of the Federal 
requirement, it shall send a written notice of dispute to the owning 
Military Service and ADUSD(L&MR/SCI) within thirty (30) days of its 
notice from the Military Service. ADUSD(L&MR/SCI) shall then resolve the 
dispute, in writing. The aircraft cannot be issued until the dispute has 
been resolved.
    (c) The Military Services shall:
    (1) Report aircraft which survive transfer screening and are ready 
for sale to Headquarters, Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service, 
ATTN: DRMS-LMI, Federal Center, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle 
Creek, Michigan 49017-3092. The Military Services must use a DD Form 
1348-1A, DTID, for this purpose.
    (2) Transfer excess DOD aircraft to the Aerospace Maintenance and 
Regeneration Center (AMARC), Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ, and place the 
aircraft in an ``excess'' storage category while aircraft are undergoing 
screening and/or wildfire suppression aircraft sale. Aircraft shall not 
be available nor offered to airtanker operators from the Military 
Service's airfield. The Military Service shall be responsible for the 
AMARC aircraft induction charges. The gaining customer will be liable 
for all AMARC withdrawal charges, to include any aircraft preparation 
required from AMARC. Sale of parts required for aircraft preparation is 
limited to those not required for the operational mission forces, and 
only if authorized by specific authority of the respective Military 
Service's weapon system program manager.

<R05>
Sec. 172.1  Purpose.

    This document provides revised and expanded instructions on the 
collection and disposition of cash and cash equivalents received by the 
DoD Components for the DoD sale of surplus personal property.


<R05>
Sec. 172.2  Applicability and scope.

    This part:
    (a) Applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the 
Military Departments, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) and the Joint 
Staff, the Unified and Specified Commands, the Inspector General of the 
Department of Defense (IG, DoD), the Defense Agencies, and DoD Field 
Activities (hereafter referred to collectively as ``DoD Components'').
    (b) Applies to the proceeds resulting from sales made under 
authority of Public Law 152 and to the following:
    (1) Personal property governed by DoD 4160.21-M.
    (2) Surplus Government-owned personal property in the possession of 
contractors, as described in FAR subpart 45.6.
    (3) Recyclable material governed by 10 U.S.C. 2577. Such materials 
would otherwise be sold as scrap or discarded as waste, but are capable 
of being reused after undergoing some type of physical or chemical 
processing. The recycling of hazardous materials or hazardous waste 
shall be accomplished with due recognition of the types of materials 
being processed and the applicable regulation governing the handling and 
disposal of such materials. Qualified recyclable materials do not 
include the following:
    (i) Precious metal-bearing scrap and those items that may be used 
again for their original purposes or functions without any special 
processing; e.g., used vehicles, vehicle or machine parts, bottles (not 
scrap glass), electrical components, and unopened containers of oil or 
solvent.
    (ii) Ships, planes, or weapons that must undergo demilitarization or 
mutilation before sale.
    (iii) Scrap generated from DoD industrial fund (IF) operations that 
has been routinely sold with the proceeds being used to offset customer 
costs.

[[Page 774]]

    (iv) Bones, fats, and meat trimmings generated by a commissary store 
or exchange.


<R05>
Sec. 172.3  Policy.

    (a) Cash or cash equivalents in the prescribed amounts shall 
accompany bid deposits for a bid to be considered responsive. Similarly, 
cash or cash equivalents for the total sales price shall be received by 
the DoD Components or, in authorized cases, by contractors before the 
transfer of physical possession to the successful bidder.
    (b) Amounts collected by the DoD Components in connection with the 
sale of excess and surplus property shall be deposited promptly to the 
U.S. Treasury accounts prescribed in accordance with this instruction. 
The use of suspense accounts shall be minimal. If the account, 
ultimately to be credited with the proceeds of a sale, can be determined 
reasonably at the time funds are collected, the deposit shall be made 
immediately to that account.
    (c) The Secretary of each Military Department shall establish 
qualified recycling programs. The effort associated with the collecting, 
processing and selling of recyclable material is in appendix A to this 
part.
    (1) Proceeds from the sale of recyclable material shall be used to 
reimburse installation-level costs incurred in operation of the 
recyclable program.
    (2) After reimbursement of the cost incurred by the installation to 
operate the recycling program, installation commanders may use up to 50 
percent of remaining sale proceeds for pollution abatement, energy 
conservation, and occupational safety and health activities. A project 
may not be carried out for an amount greater than 50 percent of the 
amount established by law as the maximum amount for a minor construction 
project.
    (3) Any sale proceeds remaining after paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of 
this section may be transferred to installation morale or welfare 
activities.


<R05>
Sec. 172.4  Responsibilities.

    The Heads of DoD Components that sell surplus personal property 
shall implement the procedures prescribed in this part for the 
disposition of cash and cash equivalents received in connection with 
such sales.


<R05>
Sec. 172.5  Procedures.

    (a) Required bid deposits. When a sale conducted by a DoD Component 
provides for bid deposit with subsequent removal, the following 
procedures shall apply:
    (1) Term bid. This type of bid deposit is applicable when the sale 
involves the purchase of scrap or disposable material that will be 
generated over time with periodic removal by the successful bidder. The 
amount of the bid deposit required to accompany such bids is the average 
estimated quantity of such material to be generated during a 3 month 
period multiplied by 20 percent of the bid price. The calculation is 
illustrated, as follows:

Estimated quantity of material to be        3,000
 generated each quarter (pounds).
Bid price--$1.00 per pound................  x $1.00
                                           -----------------------------
      Subtotal............................  $3,000
20 percent of bid price...................  20
                                           -----------------------------
      Amount to accompany bid.............  $600
 

    (2) Other than term bid. With the exception of term bids, payment in 
the amount of 20 percent of the bid shall accompany the bid.
    (b) Payment terms. When a sale conducted by a DoD Component provides 
for immediate pickup, the entire amount of the sales price shall be 
collected from the buyer at the conclusion of the sale. If the sale 
provides for a bid deposit, the balance of the bid price shall be paid 
before removal of the property.
    (c) Form of payment--(1) Cash and certified checks. When a sale is 
conducted by a DoD Component, cash or its equivalent shall be collected 
for bid deposits and for remaining amounts due. Guaranteed negotiable 
instruments, such as cashiers checks, certified checks, travelers 
checks, bank drafts, or postal money orders are acceptable as a cash 
equivalent.
    (2) Personal checks. Personal checks may be accepted by a DoD 
Component only when a performance bond or a bank letter of credit is on 
hand that will cover the amount due. If the check is dishonored, amounts 
due shall be

[[Page 775]]

collected from the issuer of the performance bond or letter of credit.
    (i) If a bidder intends to use a bond or letter of credit without an 
accompanying personal check, the claim against the performance bond or 
letter of credit shall be made for any amounts due.
    (ii) If personal checks are used, the bond or letter of credit shall 
be returned intact after the applicable personal checks are honored, 
unless other instructions have been received from the bidder.
    (2) Credit cards. Approved credit cards may be accepted by a DoD 
Component for payment.
    (i) Before initiating any credit card transactions, the selling DoD 
Component shall enter into an agreement with a network commercial bank. 
Currently, the Treasury has approved the use of ``Master Card'' and 
``Visa'' charge cards. Changes or additions to approved credit cards are 
announced in Comptroller of the Department of Defense (C, DoD) memoranda 
or in changes to the TFM. Except for equipment and communication costs, 
the Treasury pays any fees normally charged to sellers. If the Treasury 
policy of paying such charges is changed, any charges for the processing 
of approved credit card transactions shall be assessed to the buyer.
    (ii) If a credit card is used for the bid deposit and authorization 
is declined, the bid shall be rejected as nonresponsive and other 
bidders considered.
    (iii) Approval for charges against credit cards shall be processed 
as follows:
    (A) The credit card presented shall be passed through the DoD 
installation's credit card swiper. The swiper is connected 
electronically with the network commercial bank selected by the DoD 
Component, and keys are provided to enter the proposed charge amount. If 
the charge is approved, the swiper will provide an approval number that 
shall be recorded on the charge slip.
    Note: A swiper is an electronic device that is used to capture the 
magentic information contained on a credit card and transmit it to the 
network commercial bank for validation and authorization of a sale. The 
information captured normally includes the account number, issuing bank, 
date of expiration of the card, and any credit restrictions that may 
apply.
    (B) The bidder shall sign a standard credit card charge form at the 
sale contracting office. A copy of this form shall be returned to the 
card holder at that time. A copy of the charge slip shall be retained by 
the selling DoD activity as a record of the sale. On the following 
business day, the installation finance and accounting officer or the 
activity providing accounting support shall submit the signed credit 
card forms with a supporting cover sheet showing the total charges to 
the network commercial bank. Accounting control must be maintained over 
such in-transit deposits.
    (C) On receipt of the credit card charge forms, the network 
commercial bank shall charge the bidder's credit card account and 
deposit the funds to the Treasury general account. The network 
commercial bank also is required to forward a copy of the deposit slip 
to the DoD installation making the sale within 1 business day. On 
receipt of the deposit slip, the in-transit account shall be cleared and 
appropriate accounts credited following the procedures in paragraph (d) 
of this section:
    (iv) If a contractor's bid is provided by message, mail, or 
telephone to the U.S. Government using a credit card instead of other 
forms of payment, the following information is required:
    (A) Account number.
    (B) Bidders name, as it appears on the credit card.
    (C) Date of expiration of the card.
    (D) Issuing bank.
    (E) Type of card.

Any additional cost incurred by the Department of Defense in connection 
with the use of the charge card, such as telephone calls to obtain 
approval from the network bank, shall be billed to the purchaser as an 
additive charge.
    (d) Disposition of proceeds. (1) Proceeds from the sale of surplus 
personal property shall be deposited by the collecting DoD Component 
promptly to the U.S. Treasury accounts prescribed in appendix B to this 
part. The use of suspense accounts shall be minimal. If the account 
ultimately to be credited with the proceeds of a sale can be determined 
reasonably at the time the

[[Page 776]]

funds are collected, the deposit shall be made immediately to that 
account.
    (2) See paragraph (f) of this section for special instructions on 
the processing of proceeds resulting from the sale of recyclable 
material.
    (e) Return of bid deposits to unsuccessful bidders. (1) Cash 
collected from unsuccessful bidders by a DoD Component shall be 
deposited to account X6875, ``Suspense,'' and a check shall be drawn on 
that account to reimburse unsuccessful bidders.
    (2) Normally, noncash bid deposits shall be returned to unsuccessful 
bidders by DoD Components through the mail. However, when a bidder has 
requested expedited return and has provided the name of a carrier and a 
charge account number, the designated carrier shall be called to pick up 
the deposit with the explicit condition that applicable carrier costs 
will be charged to the bidder's account.
    (f) Sales of recyclable material. The efforts associated with 
collection and processing of recyclable material are reflected in 
appendix A to this part. The following transactions for others (TFO) 
procedures apply:
    (1) Proceeds from the sale of recyclable material shall be deposited 
in F3875, ``Budget Clearing Account (Suspense).'' The deposit to F3875 
shall identify the fiscal station and the name of the installation (use 
the full name and do not abbreviate) that is to receive the proceeds. 
Deposits that do not provide the necessary information shall be referred 
formally to the property disposal cashier for the required information.
    (2) The Military Department's finance and accounting office 
receiving the sales proceeds shall mail a copy of the cash collection 
voucher to the fiscal station shown on the collection voucher. This 
advance copy shall be used by the fiscal station to record the 
collection of proceeds to its account and shall be used for followup 
purposes, as necessary. The copy received through the financial network 
shall be used to clear the undistributed collection. These vouchers 
shall be mailed in the weekly TFO cycle.
    (3) The Military Department's finance and accounting office shall:
    (i) Report weekly transactions to the responsible fiscal station 
cited on the collection voucher.
    (ii) Report the collections within the same month in the ``Statement 
of Transactions'' to the Treasury.
    (g) Contractor sales of surplus Government-furnished property. (1) 
DFARS Sec. 245.610 provides overall direction for crediting proceeds 
from contractor conducted sales of surplus Government furnished 
property. Paragraph (g)(5) of this section provides the procedures that 
shall be used to ensure proper accounting for such proceeds.
    (2) The contractor making the sale may follow normal company policy 
on bid deposits and form of payment. However, any loss associated with 
dishonored payment shall be the contractor's responsibility.
    (3) The plant clearance officer (PLCO) is responsible for notifying 
the appropriate accounting office of the amounts collected by the 
contractor. The PLCO shall also notify the accounting office whether 
such collections:
    (i) Represent an increase in the dollar value of the applicable 
contract(s).
    (ii) Were made instead of disbursements on the applicable 
contract(s).
    (iii) Were returned to miscellaneous receipt account 972651, ``Sale 
of Scrap and Salvage, Materials, Defense.''
    (4) The accounting office for the contract is identified in the 
accounting classification code. See DoD 7220.9-M, chapter 17 for 
additional information.
    (5) The accounting office shall prepare the source documents 
necessary to account properly for the transaction. The value of 
applicable Government property general-ledger-asset accounts shall be 
reduced for each alternative set forth in paragraph (g)(3) of this 
section. Additionally, for alternatives (addressed in paragraph 
(g)(3)(i) or (g)(3)(ii) of this section, an accounting entry shall be 
made to reflect the creation of reimbursable obligational authority and 
the use of such authority.

PART 173_COMPETITIVE INFORMATION CERTIFICATE AND PROFIT REDUCTION 
CLAUSE--Table of Contents




Sec.
173.1 Scope.
173.2 Competitive Information Certification.
173.3 Profit reduction clause.

Appendix to Part 173--List of Contractors for Whom Certification is 
          Required

    Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2202.

    Source: 53 FR 42948, Oct. 25, 1988, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 173.1  Scope.

    (a) The purpose of the Competitive Information Certificate is to 
provide the Contracting Officer sufficient information and assurance to 
support award of a contract in those circumstances where certification 
is required.
    (b) Although a Competitive Information Certificate provides 
reasonable assurance to the Government, the possibility remains that 
even a diligent internal review by the contractor may fail to identify 
illegal or improper actions. The purpose of the Profit Reduction Clause 
is to ensure effective protection of the Government's interest in making 
contract awards when a Competitive Information Certification is 
required. The Profit Reduction Clause is required in all competitively 
awarded new contracts over $100,000 when a Competitive Information 
Certificate is required prior to award.


<R05>
Sec. 173.2  Competitive Information Certification.

    (a) The Competitive Information Certificate is required prior to 
award of all competitively awarded new contracts of a value exceeding 
$100,000 to contractors subject to the requirement.
    (1) Corporate activities required to provide the Certificate are 
corporations or corporate divisions which have been the subject of 
search warrants, or as to which other official information indicates 
such certification should be required, and their subsidiaries and 
affiliates. A list of contractors from whom certification is required is 
maintained and published as required under authority of the Department 
of Defense Procurement Task Force.
    (2) The requirement to provide the Certificate may be further 
limited to certain divisions or subsidiaries, contracts or programs upon 
the basis of official information, furnished by the contractor or 
otherwise, sufficient to establish to the satisfaction of the Department 
of Defense that the investigation is so limited. Such information may 
include copies of search warrants, subpoenas and affidavits from 
corporate officials concerning the scope and conduct of the 
investigation. The sufficiency of such information is solely within the 
discretion of the Department of Defense.
    (3) Contractors from whom certification in certain instances is 
required

[[Page 780]]

will be relieved of the certification requirement when the Department of 
Defense determines that information developed in the ``Ill Wind'' 
investigation has been resolved in such a manner that certification is 
no longer required to protect the interests of the Government.
    (4) A Certificate will not be required prior to the exercise of 
options or noncompetitive award of contracts. This does not limit in any 
manner the Government's ability to inquire into, or require information 
concerning, the circumstances surrounding an underlying competitive 
award.
    (b) With respect to information disclosed under paragraph (1) of the 
Certificate, the offeror must attach to the Certificate a written 
statement detailing what information was obtained, and how, when, and 
from whom it was obtained. This information shall be evaluated at the 
levels prescribed by the contracting component to determine whether 
award of the contract should be made to the offeror. If during this 
review it is determined that the offeror may have obtained an unfair 
competitive advantage from the information and that there is no other 
reason for denying award to the offeror, the reviewing authority shall 
consider whether action may be taken to neutralize the potential unfair 
competitive advantage. Any decision to deny award to an offeror based 
upon information disclosed in the Certificate shall be reviewed and 
approved by the Service Acquisition Executive.
    (c) This certificate and any accompanying statements required, must 
be executed by the offeror's corporate president or his designee at no 
more than one level below the president's level.
    (d) If a contractor from whom certification is required is uncertain 
as to whether competitive information otherwise required to be disclosed 
was generally available to offerors, the uncertainty should be resolved 
by disclosure.
    (e) Contracting Officers may continue to accept Certificates of 
Business Ethics and Integrity complying with the Interim rule in lieu of 
Competitive Information Certificates.
    (f) The Competitive Information Certificate shall be in the 
following form:

                   Competitive Information Certificate

    (1) (Name of the offeror) certifies, to the best of its knowledge 
and belief, that
    (i) With the exception of any information described in an attachment 
to this certificate, and any information the offeror reasonably believes 
was made generally available to prospective offerors, the offeror has 
not knowingly obtained, directly or indirectly from the Government, any 
written information or oral extract or account thereof relating to this 
solicitation which was
    (A) Submitted to the Government by offerors or potential offerors in 
response to the Government's solicitation for bid or proposal;
    (B) Marked by an offeror or potential offeror to indicate the 
information was submitted to the Government subject to an assertion of 
privilege against disclosure;
    (C) Marked or otherwise identified by the Government pursuant to law 
or regulation as classified, source selection sensitive, or for official 
use only; or
    (D) The disclosure of which to the offeror or potential offeror by a 
Government employee would, under the circumstances, otherwise violate 
law or regulation.
    (ii) The offeror named above
    (A) Determined the prices in its offer independently, without, for 
the purpose of restricting competition, any consultation, 
communications, or agreement, directly or indirectly, with any other 
offeror or competitor relating to (1) those prices, (2) the intention to 
submit an offer, or (3), the methods or factors used to calculate the 
prices offered;
    (B) Has not knowingly disclosed the prices in its offer, directly or 
indirectly, to any other offeror or competitor before bid opening (in 
the case of a sealed bid solicitation) or contract award (in the case of 
a negotiated solicitation) unless otherwise required by law;
    (C) Has not attempted to induce any other concern to submit or not 
to submit an offer for the purpose of restricting competition.

[[Page 781]]

    (iii) The offeror has attached an accurate description of the 
internal review forming the basis for the certifications provided 
herein.

Corporate President or Designee.

Sec. 173.3  Profit reduction clause.

    The following profit reduction clause is required in all 
competitively awarded new contracts over $100,000 when a Competitive 
Information Certificate is required prior to award.
    Profit Reduction for Illegal or Improper Activity
    (a) The government, at its election, may reduce the contract price

    (b) Implements 107 Stat. 1909, National Defense Authorization Act 
for Fiscal Year 1994, Title XXIX and The Base Closure Community 
Redevelopment and Homeless Assistance Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-421).
    (c) Authorizes the publication of DoD 4165.66-M, ``Base Reuse 
Implementation Manual,'' in accordance with DoD 5025.1-M, ``DoD 
Directive System Procedures,'' August 1994.


<R05>
Sec. 174.2  Applicability.

    This part applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the 
Military Departments, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the 
Unified Combatant Commands, the Defense Agencies, and the DoD Field 
Activities (hereafter referred to collectively as ``the DoD 
Components'').


<R05>
Sec. 174.3  Definitions.

    (a) Closure. All missions of the installation have ceased or have 
been relocated. All personnel positions (military, civilian and 
contractor) have either been eliminated or relocated, except for 
personnel required for caretaking, conducting any ongoing environmental 
cleanup, and disposal of the base, or personnel remaining in authorized 
enclaves.
    (b) Relaignment. Any action that both reduces and relocates 
functions and DoD civilian personnel positions, but does not include a 
reduction in force resulting from workload adjustments, reduced 
personnel or funding levels, skill imbalances, or other similar cause. A 
realignment may terminate the DoD requirement for the land and 
facilities on part of an installation. That part of the installation 
shall be treated as ``closed'' for purposes of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 174.4  Policy.

    It is DoD policy to:
    (a) Help communities impacted by base closures and realignments 
achieve rapid economic recovery through effective reuse of the assets of 
closing and realigning bases--more quickly, more effectively and in ways 
based on local market conditions and locally developed reuse plans. This 
will be accomplished by quickly insuring that communities and the 
Military Departments communicate effectively and work together to 
accomplish mutual goals of quick property disposal and rapid job 
generation.
    (b) This part does not create any rights or remedies and may not be 
relied upon by any person, organization, or other entity to allege a 
denial of any rights or remedies other than those provided by Title XXIX 
of Pub. L. 103-160, or Pub. L. 103-421.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 175.7  Procedures.

    (a) Identification of interest in real property. (1) To speed the 
economy recovery of communities affected by closures and realignments, 
it is DoD policy to identify DoD and federal interests in real property 
at closing and realigning military bases as quickly as possible. The 
Military Department having responsibility for the closing or realigning 
base shall identify such interests. The Military Department will keep 
the Local Redevelopment Authority (LRA) informed of these interests. 
This section establishes a uniform process, with specified timelines, 
for identifying real property which is excess to the Military Department 
for use by other Departments of Defense (DoD) Components and other 
federal agencies, and for the disposal of surplus property for various 
purposes.
    (2) Upon the President's submission of the recommendations for base 
closures and realignments to the Congress in accordance with the Defense 
Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-510), the Military 
Department shall send out a notice of potential availability to the 
other DoD Components, and other federal agencies. The notice of 
potential availability is a public document and should be made available 
in a timely basis, upon request. Federal agencies are encouraged to 
review this list, and to evaluate whether they may have a requirement 
for the listed properties. The notice of potential availability should 
describe the property and buildings that may be available for transfer. 
Installations which wholly or in part are comprised of withdrawn and 
reserved public domain lands should implement paragraph (a)(12) of this 
section at the same time.
    (3) Military Departments should consider LRA input in making 
determinations on the retention of property (size of cantonment area), 
if provided. Generally, determinations on the retention of property (or 
size of the cantonment area) should be completed prior to the date of 
approval of the closure or realignment.
    (4) Within one week of the date of approval of the closure or 
realignment, the Military Department shall issue a formal notice of 
availability to other DoD Components and federal agencies covering 
closing and realigning installation buildings and property available for 
transfer to other DoD Components and federal agencies. Withdrawn public 
domain lands, which the Secretary of the Interior has determined are 
suitable for return to his jurisdiction, will not be included in the 
notice of availability.
    (5) Within 30 days of date of the notice of availability, any DoD 
Component or federal agency is required to provide a written, firm 
expression of interest for buildings and property. An expression of 
interest must explain the intended use and the corresponding requirement 
for the buildings and property.
    (6) Within 60 days of the date of the notice of availability, the 
DoD Component or federal agency expressing interest in buildings or 
property must submit an application for transfer of such property to the 
Military Department or federal agency.
    (i) Within 90 days of the notice of availability, the FAA should 
survey the air traffic control and air navigation equipment at the 
installation to determine what is needed to support the air traffic 
control, surveillance, and communications functions supported by the 
Military Department, and to identify the facilities needed to support 
the National Airspace System. FAA requests for property to manage the 
National Airspace System will not be governed by paragraph (a)(9) of 
this section. Instead, such requests will be governed by the 
requirements of 41 CFR 101-47.308-2, to determine the transfer of 
property necessary for control of the airspace being relinquished by the 
Military Department.

[[Page 787]]

    (7) The Military Department will keep the LRA informed of the 
progress in identifying interests. At the same time, the LRA is 
encouraged to contact federal agencies which sponsor public benefit 
transfers for information and technical assistance. The Military 
Department will provide points of contact at the federal agencies to the 
LRA.
    (8) Federal agencies and DoD Components are encouraged to discuss 
their plans and needs with the LRA, if an LRA exists. DoD Components and 
federal agencies are encouraged to notify the Military Department of the 
results of this non-binding consultation. The Military Departments, the 
Base Transition Coordinator, and the Office of Economic Adjustment 
Project Manager are available to help facilitate communication between 
the federal agencies, DoD Components, and the LRA.
    (9) A request for property from a DoD Component or federal agency 
must contain the following information:
    (i) A completed GSA Form 1334, Request for Transfer (for requests 
from other DoD Components a DD Form 1354 is required). This must be 
signed by the head of the Component of the Department or Agency 
requesting the property. If the authority to acquire property has been 
delegation, a copy of the delegation must accompany the form;
    (ii) A statement from the head of the requesting Component or agency 
that the request does not establish a new program (i.e., one that has 
never been reflected in a previous budget submission or Congressional 
action);
    (iii) A statement that the requesting Component or agency has 
reviewed its real property holdings and cannot satisfy this requirement 
with existing property. This review must include all property under the 
requester's accountability, including permits to other federal agencies 
and outleases to other organizations;
    (iv) A statement that the requested property would provide greater 
long-term economic benefits than acquisition of a new facility or other 
property for the program;
    (v) A statement that the program for which the property is requested 
has long-term viability;
    (vi) A statement that considerations of design, layout, geographic 
location, age, state of repair, and expected maintenance costs of the 
requested property clearly demonstrate that the transfer will prove more 
economical over a sustained period of time than acquiring a new 
facility;
    (vii) A statement that the size of the property requested is 
consistent with the actual requirement;
    (viii) A statement that fair market value reimbursement to the 
Military Department will be made within two years of the initial request 
for the property, unless this obligation is waived by the Office of 
Management and Budget and the Secretary of the Military Department or a 
public law specifically provides for a non-reimbursable transfer. 
However, requests from the Military Departments or DoD Components do not 
need an Office of Management and Budget waiver; and
    (ix) A statement that the requesting DoD Component or federal agency 
agrees to accept the care and custody costs for the property on the date 
the property is available for transfer, as determined by the Military 
Department.
    (10) The Military Department will make it decision on a request from 
a federal agency, Military Department, or DoD Component based upon the 
following factors, from the Federal Property Management Regulations (41 
CFR 101-47.201-2):
    (i) The paramount consideration shall be the validity and 
appropriateness of the requirement upon which the proposal is based;
    (ii) The proposed federal use is consistent with the highest and 
best use of the property;
    (iii) The requested transfer will not have an adverse impact on the 
transfer of any remaining portion of the base;
    (iv) The proposed transfer will not establish a new program or 
substantially increase the level of an agency's existing programs;
    (v) The application offers fair market value for the property, 
unless waived;
    (vi) The proposed transfer addresses applicable environmental 
responsibilities to the satisfaction of the Military Department; and
    (vii) The proposed transfer is in the best interest of the 
Government.

[[Page 788]]

    (11) When there are more than one acceptable applications for the 
same building or property, the Military Department responsible for the 
installation should first consider the needs of the military to carry 
out its mission. The Military Department should then consider the 
proposal's economic development and job creation potential and the LRA's 
comments, as well as the other factors in the determination of highest 
and best use.
    (12) Closing or realigning installations may contain ``public domain 
lands'' which have been withdrawn by the Secretary of the Interior from 
operation of the public land laws and reserved for the Defense 
Department's use. Lands deemed suitable for return to the public domain 
are not real property governed by the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 472), and are 
not governed by the property management and disposal provisions of the 
Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-526) and Defense 
Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-510). Public 
domain lands are under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior 
and administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) unless the 
Secretary of the Interior has withdrawn the lands and reserved them for 
another federal agency's use.
    (i) The Military Department responsible for a closing or realigning 
installation will provide the BLM with the notice of potential 
availability, as well as information about which, if any, public domain 
lands will be affected by the installation's closing.
    (ii) The BLM will review the notice of potential availability to 
determine if any installations contain withdrawn public domain lands. 
Before the date of approval of the closure or realignment, the BLM will 
review its land records to identify any withdrawn public domain lands at 
the closing installations. Any records discrepancies between the BLM and 
Military Departments should be resolved within this time period. The BLM 
will notify the Military Departments as to the final agreed upon 
withdrawn and reserved public domain lands at installations.
    (iii) Upon agreement as to what withdrawn and reserved public domain 
lands are affected at closing installations, the BLM will initiate a 
screening of DOI agencies to determine if these lands are suitable for 
programs of the Secretary of the Interior.
    (iv) Military Departments will transmit a Notice of Intent to 
Relinquish (see 43 CFR part 2372) to the BLM as soon as it is known that 
there is no DoD Component interest in reusing the public domain lands. 
The BLM will complete the suitability determination screening process 
within 30 days of receipt of the Military Department's Notice of Intent 
to Relinquish. If a DoD Component is approved to reuse the public domain 
lands, the BLM will be notified and BLM will determine if the current 
authority for military use of these lands needs to be modified/amended.
    (v) If BLM determines the land is suitable for return, they shall 
notify the Military Department that the intent of the Secretary of the 
Interior is to accept the relinquishment of the Military Department.
    (vi) If BLM determines the land is not suitable, the land should be 
disposed of pursuant to base closure law.
    (13) The Military Department should make its surplus determination 
within 100 days of the issuance of the notice of availability, and shall 
inform the LRA of the determination. If requested by the LRA, the 
Military Department may postpone the surplus determination for a period 
of no more than six months after the date of approval of the closure of 
realignment.
    (i) In unusual circumstances, extensions beyond six months can be 
granted by the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Industrial Affairs and 
Installations).
    (ii) Extensions of the surplus determination should be limited to 
the portions of the installation where there is an outstanding interest, 
and every effort should be made to make decisions on as much of the 
installation as possible, within the specified timeframes.
    (14) Once the surplus determination has been made, the Military 
Department shall:

    (i) Follow the procedures outlined in paragraph (b) of this section, 
if applicable.
    (ii) Or, for installations approved for closure or realignment after 
October 25, 1994, and installations approved for closure or realignment 
prior to October 25, 1994, that have elected, prior to December 24, 
1994, to come under the process outlined in the Base Closure Community 
Redevelopment and Homeless Assistance Act of 1994, follow the procedures 
outlined in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (15) Following the surplus determination, but prior to the disposal 
of property, the Military Department may, at its discretion, withdraw 
the surplus determination and evaluate a federal agency's late request 
for excess property.
    (i) Transfers under this paragraph shall be limited to special 
cases, as determined by the Secretary of the Military Department.
    (ii) Requests shall be made to the Military Department, as specified 
under paragraphs (a)(8) and (a)(9) of this section, and the Military 
Department shall notify the LRA of such late request.
    (iii) Comments received from the LRA and the time and effort 
invested by the LRA in the planning process should be considered when 
the Military Department is reviewing a late request.
    (b) Homeless screening for properties not covered by the Base 
Closure Community Redevelopment and Homeless Assistance Act of 1994. (1) 
This section outlines the procedure created for the identification of 
real property to fulfill the needs of the homeless by section 2905(b)(6) 
of Pub. L. 101-510, as amended by Public Law 103-160 (referred to as the 
Pryor Amendment). It applies to BRAC 88, 91 and 93 bases if the LRA did 
not elect to be subject to the alternate homeless assistance screening 
procedure contained in the Base Closure Community Redevelopment and 
Homeless Assistance Act of 1994.
    (2) The Military Department shall sponsor a workshop or seminar in 
the communities which have closing or realigning bases, unless such a 
workshop or seminar has already been held. These workshops or seminars 
will be conducted prior to the Federal Register publication by HUD of 
available property to assist the homeless.
    (i) Not later than the date upon which the determination of surplus 
is made, the Military Department shall complete any determinations or 
surveys necessary to determine whether any building is available to 
assist the homeless. The Military Department shall then submit the list 
of properties available to assist the homeless to HUD.
    (ii) HUD shall make a determination of the suitability of each 
property to assist the homeless in accordance with the Stewart B. 
McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 11411, (the McKinney Act). 
Within 60 days from the date of receipt of the information from the 
Department of Defense, HUD shall publish a list of suitable properties 
that shall become available when the base closes or realigns.
    (iii) The listing of properties in the Federal Register under this 
procedure shall contain the following statement. (The listing of 1988 
base closure properties that will be reported to HUD shall refer to 
section 204(b)(6) of Public Law 100-526 instead of section 2905(b)(6) of 
Public Law 101-510):

    The properties contained in this listing are closing and realigning 
military installations. This report is being accomplished pursuant to 
section 2905(b)(6) of Public Law 101-510, as amended by Public Law 103-
160. In accordance with section 2905(b)(6), this property is subject to 
a one-time publication under the McKinney Act after which property not 
provided to homeless assistance providers will not be published again 
unless there is no expression of interest submitted by the local 
redevelopment authority in the one-year period following the end of the 
McKinney screening process pursuant to this publication.

    (3) Providers of assistance to the homeless shall then have 60 days 
in which to submit expressions of interest to HHS in any of the listed 
properties. If a provider indicates an interest in a listed property, it 
shall have an additional 90 days after submission of its written 
expression of interest to submit a formal application to HHS, a period 
which HHS can extend. HHS shall then have 25 days after receipt of a 
completed application to review and complete all actions on such 
applications.

[[Page 790]]

    (4) During this screening process (from 60 to 175 days following the 
Federal Register publication, as appropriate), disposal agencies shall 
take no final disposal action or allow reuse of property that HUD has 
determined suitable and that may become available for homeless 
assistance unless and until:
    (i) No timely expressions of interest from providers are received by 
HHS;
    (ii) No timely applications from providers expressing interest are 
received by HHS; or,
    (iii) HHS rejects all applications received for a specific property.
    (5) The Military Department should promptly inform the affected LRA, 
the Governor of the State, local governments, and agencies which support 
public benefit conveyances of the date the surplus property will be 
available for community reuse if:
    (i) No provider expresses an interest to HHS in a property with the 
allotted 60 days;
    (ii) There are expressions of interest by homeless assistance 
providers, but no application is received by HHS from such a provider 
within the subsequent 90-day application period (or within the longer 
application period if HHS has granted an extension); or
    (iii) HHS rejects all applications for a specific property at any 
time during the 25 day HHS review period.
    (6) The LRA shall have 1 year from the date of notification under 
paragraph (b)(5) of this section to submit a written expression of 
interest to incorporate the remainder of the property into a 
redevelopment plan.
    (7) During the allotted 1-year period for the LRA to submit a 
written expression of interest for the property, surplus properties not 
already approved for homeless reuse shall not be available for homeless 
assistance. The surplus properties will also not be advertised by HUD as 
suitable during these 1-year periods. The surplus property may be 
available for interim leases consistent with paragraph (g) of this 
section.
    (8) If the LRA does not express in writing its interest in a 
specific property during the allotted 1-year period or it notifies the 
Military Department it is not interested in the property, the disposal 
agency shall again notify HUD of the date of availability of the 
property for homeless assistance. HUD may then list the property in the 
Federal Register as suitable and available after the base closes 
following the procedures of the McKinney Act.
    (c) Reserved. Additional regulations will be promulgated in a 
publication of the Departments of Defense and Housing and Urban 
Development to address state and local screening and approval of 
redevelopment plans for installations covered by the Base Closure 
Community Redevelopment and Homeless Assistance Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 
103-421).
    (d) Local Redevelopment Authority and the Redevelopment Plan. (1) 
The LRA should have broad-based membership, including, but not limited 
to, representatives from those jurisdictions with zoning authority over 
the property. Generally, there will be one recognized LRA per 
installation.
    (2) The LRA should focus primarily on developing a comprehensive 
redevelopment plan based upon local needs. The plan should recommend 
land uses based upon an exploration of feasible reuse alternatives. If 
applicable, the plan should consider notices of interest received under 
the provisions of the Base Closure Community Redevelopment and Homeless 
Assistance Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-421). This section shall not be 
construed to require a plan that is enforceable under state and local 
land use laws, nor is it intended to create any exemption from such 
laws.
    (3) The Military Department will develop a disposal plan and 
complete the appropriate environmental documentation no later than 12 
months from receipt of the redevelopment plan. The local redevelopment 
plan will generally be used as the basis for the proposed action in 
conducting environmental analyses required by under the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), (42 U.S.C. 4332 et seq.). The 
disposal plan will specifically address the methods for disposal of 
property at the installation, including conveyances for homeless 
assistance, public benefit transfers, public sales, Economic Development 
Conveyances and other disposal methods.

[[Page 791]]

    (i) In the event there is no LRA recognized by DoD and/or if a 
redevelopment plan is not received from the LRA within 15 months from 
the determination of surplus under paragraph (a)(13) of this section, 
(unless an extension of time has been granted by the Deputy Under 
Secretary of Defense (Industrial Affairs and Installations)), the 
applicable Military Department shall proceed with the disposal of 
property under applicable property disposal and environmental laws and 
regulations.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (e) Economic development conveyances. (1) Section 2903 of Public Law 
103-160 gives the Secretary of Defense the authority to transfer 
property to local redevelopment authorities for consideration in cash or 
in kind, with or without initial payment, or with only partial payment 
at time of transfer, at or below the estimated present fair market value 
of the property. This authority creates an additional tool for local 
communities to help spur economic opportunity through a new real 
property conveyance method specifically designed for economic 
development, referred to as the ``Economic Development Conveyance'' 
(EDC).
    (2) The EDC can only be used when other surplus federal property 
disposal authorities for the intended land use cannot be used to 
accomplish the necessary economic redevelopment.
    (3) An LRA is the only entity able to receive property under an EDC.
    (4) A properly completed application will be the basis for a 
decision on whether an LRA will be eligible for an EDC. An application 
should be submitted by the LRA after a Redevelopment Plan is adopted by 
the LRA. The Secretary of the Military Departments shall establish a 
reasonable time period for submission of the EDC application after 
consultation with the LRA. The Military Departments will review the 
applications and make a decision whether to make an EDC based on the 
criteria specified in paragraph (e)(7) of this section. The terms and 
conditions of the EDC will be negotiated between the Military 
Departments and the LRA. Bases in rural areas shall be conveyed with no 
consideration if they meet the standards in paragraph (f)(5) of this 
section.
    (5) The application should explain why an EDC is necessary for 
economic redevelopment and job creation. In addition to the elements in 
paragraph (e)(5) of this section, after Military Department review of 
the application, additional information may be requested to allow for a 
better evaluation of the application. The application should also 
contain the following elements:
    (i) A copy of the adopted redevelopment plan.
    (ii) A project narrative including the following:
    (A) A general description of property requested.
    (B) A description of the intended uses.
    (C) A description of the economic impact of closure or realignment 
on the local communities.
    (D) A description of the financial condition of the community and 
the prospects for redevelopment of the property.
    (E) A statement of how the EDC is consistent with the overall 
Redevelopment Plan.
    (iii) A description of how the EDC will contribute to short- and 
long-term job creation and economic redevelopment of the base and 
community, including projected number, and type of new jobs it will 
assist in creating.
    (iv) A business/operational plan for the EDC parcel, including such 
elements as:
    (A) A development timetable, phasing schedule and cash flow 
analysis.
    (B) A market and financial feasibility analysis describing the 
economic viability of the project, including an estimate of net proceeds 
over a fifteen-year period, the proposed consideration or payment to the 
Department of Defense, and the estimated present fair market value of 
the property.
    (C) A cost estimate and justification for infrastructure and other 
investments needed for the development of the EDC parcel.
    (D) Local investment and proposed financing strategies for the 
development.
    (v) A statement describing why other authorities--such as public or 
negotiated sale and public benefit transfers for education, parks, 
public health, aviation, historic monuments, prisons,

[[Page 792]]

and wildlife conservation--cannot be used to accomplish the economic 
development and job creation goals.
    (vi) If a transfer is requested for less than the estimated present 
fair market value (``FMV''), with or without initial payment at the time 
of transfer, then a statement should be provided justifying the 
discount. The statement should include the amount and form of the 
proposed consideration, a payment schedule, the general terms and 
conditions for the conveyance, and projected date of conveyance.
    (vii) A statement of the LRA's legal authority to acquire and 
dispose of the property.
    (6) Upon receipt of an application for an EDC, the Secretary of the 
Military Department will determine whether an EDC is needed to spur 
economic development and job creation and examine whether the terms and 
conditions proposed are fair and reasonable. The Military Department may 
also consider information independent of the application, such as views 
of other federal agencies, appraisals, caretaker costs and other 
relevant material. The Military Department may propose and negotiate any 
alternative terms or conditions that it considers necessary.
    (7) The following factors will be considered, as appropriate, in 
evaluating the application and the terms and conditions of the proposed 
transfer, including price, time of payment and other relevant methods of 
compensation to the federal government.
    (i) Adverse economic impact of closure or realignment on the region 
and potential for economic recovery after an EDC.
    (ii) Extent of short- and long-term job generation.
    (iii) Consistency with overall Redevelopment Plan.
    (iv) Financial feasibility of the development, including market 
analysis and need and extent of proposed infrastructure and other 
investments.
    (v) Extent of state and local investment, level of risk incurred, 
and the LRA's ability to implement the plan.
    (vi) Current local and regional real estate market conditions.
    (vii) Incorporation of other federal agency interests and concerns, 
and applicability of, and conflicts with, other federal surplus property 
disposal authorities.
    (viii) Relationship to the overall Military Department disposal plan 
for the installation.
    (ix) Economic benefit to the federal government, including 
protection and maintenance cost savings and anticipated consideration 
from the transfer.
    (x) Compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws and 
regulations.
    (8) Before making an EDC, the Military Department must prepare an 
estimate of the present fair market value of the property, which may be 
expressed as a range of values. The Military Department shall consult 
with the LRA on valuation assumptions, guidelines and on instructions 
given to the person(s) making the estimation of value. The Military 
Department is fully responsible for completion of the valuation. The 
Military Department, in preparing the estimate of present fair market 
value shall include, to the extent practicable, the uses identified in 
the local redevelopment plan.
    (f) Consideration for economic development conveyances. (1) For 
conveyances made pursuant to Sec. 175.7(e), Economic development 
conveyances, the Secretary of the Military Department will review the 
application for an EDC and negotiate the terms and conditions of each 
transaction with the LRA. The Military Departments will have the 
discretion and flexibility to enter into agreements that specify the 
form, amount, and payment schedule. The consideration may be at or below 
the estimated present fair market value, with or without initial 
payment, in cash or in-kind and paid over time.
    (2) An EDC must be one of the two following types of agreements:
    (i) Consideration within the estimated range of present fair market 
value, as determined by the Secretary of the Military Department.
    (ii) Consideration below the estimated range of present fair market 
value, when proper justification is provided and when the Secretary of 
the Military Department determines that a discount is necessary for 
economic redevelopment and job creation.
    (3) If the consideration under an EDC is within the range of value 
listed in

[[Page 793]]

paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, the amount paid in the future 
should take into account the time value of money and include repayment 
of interest. Any transaction that waives or delays interest payments 
will be considered as a transaction below the present fair market value 
under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, and as such must be 
justified as necessary for economic development and job creation.
    (4) Additional provisions may be incorporated in the conveyance 
documents to protect the Department's interest in obtaining the agreed 
upon compensation, including such items as predetermined release prices, 
or other appropriate clauses designed to ensure payment and protect 
against fraudulent transactions.
    (5) In a rural area, as defined by this rule, any EDC approved by 
the Secretary of the Military Department shall be made without 
consideration if the base closure will have a substantial adverse impact 
on the economy of the communities in the vicinity of the installation 
and on the prospect for their economic recovery.
    (6) In those instances in which an EDC is made for consideration 
below the range of the estimated present fair market value of the 
property--or if the estimated present fair market value is expressed as 
a range of values, below the lowest value in that range--the Military 
Department shall prepare a written explanation of why the estimated 
present fair market value was not obtained. Additionally, the Military 
Departments must prepare a written statement explaining why other 
federal property transfer authorities could not be used to generate 
economic redevelopment and job creation.
    (g) Leasing of real property. (1) Leasing of real property prior to 
the final disposition of closing and realigning bases may facilitate 
state and local economic adjustment efforts and encourage economic 
redevelopment.
    (2) In addition to leasing property at fair market value, to assist 
local redevelopment efforts the Secretaries of the Military Departments 
may also lease real and personal property located at a military 
installation to be closed or realigned under a base closure law, pending 
final disposition, for less than fair market value if the Secretary 
concerned determines that:
    (i) A public interest will be served as a result of the lease; and
    (ii) The fair market value of the lease is unobtainable, or not 
compatible with such public benefit.
    (3) Pending final disposition of an installation, the Military 
Departments may grant interim leases which are short-term leases that 
make no commitment for future use or ultimate disposal. When granting an 
interim lease, the Military Department will generally lease to the LRA 
but can lease property directly to other entities. If the interim lease 
is entered into prior to completion of the final disposal decisions 
under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process, the term may 
be for up to five years, including options to renew, and may contain 
restrictions on use. Leasing should not delay the final disposal of the 
property. After completion of the final disposal decisions, the term of 
the lease may be longer than five years.
    (4) If the property is leased for less than fair market value to the 
LRA and the interim lease permits the property to be subleased, the 
interim lease shall provide that rents from the subleases will be 
applied by the lessee to the protection, maintenance, repair, 
improvement and costs related to the property at the installation 
consistent with 10 U.S.C. 2667.
    (h) Personal property. (1) This section outlines procedures to allow 
transfer of personal property to the LRA for the effective 
implementation of a community reuse plan.
    (2) Each Military Department and DoD Component, as appropriate, will 
take an inventory of the personal property, including its condition, 
within 6 months after the date of approval of closure or realignment. 
This inventory will be limited to the personal property located on the 
real property to be disposed of by the Military Department or DoD 
Component. The inventory will be taken in consultation with LRA 
officials. If there is no LRA, the Military Department will offer to 
provide a consultation for the local government in whose jurisdiction 
the installation is wholly located or for a local government agency or a 
state government

[[Page 794]]

agency designated for that purpose by the chief executive officer of the 
state. Based on these consultations, the base commander will determine 
the items or category of items that have the potential to enhance the 
reuse of the real property.
    (3) Except for property subject to the exemptions in paragraph 
(h)(5) of this section, personal property with potential to enhance the 
reuse of the real estate shall remain at a base being closed or 
realigned until disposition is otherwise determined by the Military 
Department. This determination will be made no earlier than 90 days 
after the Military Department receives an adopted redevelopment plan or 
when notified by the LRA that there will be no redevelopment plan.
    (4) National Guard property demonstrably identified as being 
purchased with state funds is not available for reuse planning or 
subject to transfer for redevelopment purposes, unless so identified by 
the state property officer. National Guard property purchased with 
federal funds is subject to inventory and may be made available for 
redevelopment planning purposes.
    (5) Personal property may be removed upon approval of the base 
commander or higher authority, within and as prescribed by the Military 
Department, after the inventory required in paragraph (h)(2) of this 
section has been sent to the redevelopment authority, when:
    (i) The property, other than ordinary fixtures, is required for the 
operation of a transferring unit, function, component, weapon, or 
weapons system;
    (ii) The property is required for the operation of a unit, function, 
component, weapon, or weapon system at another installation within the 
Military Department, subject to the following conditions:
    (A) Ordinary fixtures, including but not limited to such items as 
blackboards, sprinklers, lighting fixtures, and electrical and plumbing 
systems, shall not be removed under paragraph (h)(5)(ii) of this 
section; and,
    (B) Other personal property may be removed under paragraph 
(h)(5)(ii) of this section only after the Military Department has 
consulted with the LRA and, with respect to disputed items, upon the 
approval of an Assistant Secretary of the Military Department.
    (iii) The property is uniquely military in character and is likely 
to have no civilian use (other than use for its material content or as a 
source of commonly used components). This property consists of 
classified items; nuclear, biological, chemical items; weapons and 
munitions; museum property or items of significant historic value that 
are maintained or displayed on loan; and similar military items;
    (iv) The property is not required for the reutilization or 
redevelopment of the installation (as jointly determined by the Military 
Department concerned and the redevelopment authority);
    (v) The property is stored at the installation for distribution 
(including spare parts or stock items). This property includes materials 
or parts used in a manufacturing or repair function but does not include 
maintenance spares for equipment to be left in place;
    (vi) The property meets known requirements of an authorized program 
of another federal department or agency that would have to purchase 
similar items, and the property is the subject of a written request 
received from the head of the other Department or Agency. If the 
authority to acquire personal property has been delegated, a copy of the 
delegation must accompany the request. In this context, purchase means 
the federal department or agency intends to obligate funds in the 
current quarter or next six fiscal quarters. The federal department or 
agency must pay packing, crating, handling, and transportation charges 
associated with such transfers of personal property;
    (vii) The property belongs to nonappropriated fund instrumentalities 
(NAFI) and other non-Defense Department activities. Such property may be 
removed at the Military Departments' discretion because it does not 
belong to the Defense Department and, therefore, it may not be 
transferred to the redevelopment authority under this section. For NAFI 
property, separate arrangements for communities to purchase such 
property are possible and may be negotiated with the Military Department 
concerned; and,
    (viii) The property is needed elsewhere in the national security 
interest

[[Page 795]]

of the United States as determined by the Secretary of the Military 
Department concerned. This authority may not be redelegated below the 
level of an Assistant Secretary. In exercising this authority, the 
Secretary may transfer the property to any entity of the Department of 
Defense or other federal agency.
    (6) In addition to the exemptions in paragraph (h)(5) of this 
section, the Military Department or DoD Component is authorized to 
substitute an item similar to one requested by the redevelopment 
authority.
    (7) Personal property not subject to the exemptions in paragraph 
(h)(5) of this section may be conveyed to the redevelopment authority as 
part of an economic development conveyance for the real property if the 
Military Department makes a finding that the personal property is 
necessary for the effective implementation of the redevelopment plan.
    (8) Personal property may also be conveyed separately to the LRA 
under an economic development conveyance for personal property. This 
type of economic development conveyance can be made if the Military 
Department determines that the transfer is necessary for the effective 
implementation of a redevelopment plan with respect to the installation. 
Such determination shall be based on the LRA's timely application for 
the property, which should be submitted to the Military Department upon 
completion of the redevelopment plan. The application must include the 
LRA's agreement to accept the personal property after a reasonable 
period. The transfer will be subject to reasonable limitations and 
conditions on use.
    (i) The Military Department will restrict the LRA's ability to 
acquire personal property at less than fair market value solely for the 
purpose of releasing or reselling it, unless the LRA will lease or sell 
the personal property to entities which will place it into productive 
use in accordance with the redevelopment plan. The LRA must retain 
personal property conveyed under an EDC for less than fair market value 
for at least one year if it is valued at less than $5,000, or at least 
two years if valued at more than $5,000. Any proceeds from such leases 
or sales must be used to pay for protection, maintenance, repair or 
redevelopment of the installation. The LRA will be required to certify 
its compliance with the provisions of this section at the end of each 
fiscal year for no more than two years after transfer. The certification 
may be subject to random audits by the Government.
    (9) Personal property that is not needed by the Military Department 
or a federal agency or conveyed to a redevelopment authority (or a state 
or local jurisdiction in lieu of a local redevelopment authority) will 
be transferred to the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office for 
processing in accordance with 41 CFR parts 101-43 through 101-45, 
``Federal Property Management Regulations,'' and DoD 4160.21-M.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Copies may be obtained from the Defense Logistics Agency, Attn: 
DLA-XPD, Alexandria, VA 22304-6100.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (10) Useful personal property determined to be surplus to the needs 
of the federal government by the Defense Reutilization and Marketing 
Office and not qualifying for transfer to the redevelopment authority 
under an economic conveyance may be donated to the community or 
redevelopment authority through the appropriate State Agency for Surplus 
Property (SASP). Personal property donated under this procedure must 
meet the usage and control requirements of the applicable SASP. Property 
subsequently not needed by the community or redevelopment authority 
shall be disposed of as required by its SASP.
    (i) Maintenace, utilities, and services. (1) Facilities and 
equipment located on bases being closed are often important to the 
eventual reuse of the base. This section provides maintenance procedures 
to preserve and protect those facilities and items of equipment needed 
for reuse in an economical manner that facilitates based redevelopment.
    (2) In order to ensure quick reuse, the Military Department, in 
consultation with the LRA, will establish initial levels of maintenance 
and repair needed to aid redevelopment and to protect the property for 
the time periods set forth below. Where agreement between

[[Page 796]]

the Military Department and the LRA cannot be reached, the Secretary of 
the Military Department will determine the required levels of 
maintenance and repair and its duration. In no case will these initial 
levels of maintenance:
    (i) Exceed the standard of maintenance and repair in effect on the 
date of closure or realignment approval;
    (ii) Be less than maintenance and repair required to be consistent 
with federal government standards for excess and surplus properties 
(i.e., 41 CFR 101-47.402 and 41 CFR 101-47.4913); or,
    (iii) Require any property improvements, including construction, 
alteration, or demolition, except when the demolition is required for 
health, safety, or environmental purposes, or is economically justified 
in lieu of continued maintenance expenditures.
    (3) The initial levels of maintenance and repair shall be tailored 
to the redevelopment plan, and shall include the following provisions:
    (i) The facilities and equipment that are likely to be utilized in 
the near term will be maintained at levels that shall prevent undue 
deterioration and allow transfer to the LRA.
    (ii) The scheduled closure or realignment date of the installation 
will not be delayed.
    (4) The Military Department will not reduce the agreed upon initial 
maintenance and repair levels unless it establishes a new arrangement 
(e.g., termination of caretaking upon leasing of property) in 
consultation with the LRA.
    (5) The Military Department will determine the length of time it 
will maintain the initial levels of maintenance and repair for each 
closing or realigning base. This determination will be based on factors 
such as the closure/realignment date and the timing of the completion of 
the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documentation on the 
proposed disposal (such as a finding of no significant impact and 
disposal decision following an environmental assessment or the record of 
decision following an environmental impact statement).
    (i) For a base that has not closed prior to the publication of this 
rule, and where the Military Department has completed the NEPA analysis 
on the proposed disposal before the operational closure of that base, 
the time period for the initial levels of maintenance and repair 
normally will extend no longer than one year after operational closure 
of the base.
    (ii) For a base that has not closed prior to the publication of this 
rule, and where the base's operational closure precedes the completion 
of the NEPA analysis on the proposed disposal, the time period for the 
initial levels of maintenance and repair will normally extend no longer 
than one year after operational closure or 180 days after the Secretary 
of the Military Department approves the NEPA analysis.
    (iii) For a based that closed prior to the publication of this rule, 
the time period for the existing levels of maintenance will normally 
extend no longer than one year from the date of the publication of this 
rule or six years after the date of approval of the closure or 
realignment (whichever comes first).
    (6) The Military Department may extend the time period for the 
initial levels of maintenance and repair for property still under its 
control for an additional period, if the Secretary of the Military 
Department determines that the Local Redevelopment Authority is actively 
implementing its redevelopment plan, and such levels of maintenance are 
justified.
    (7) Once the time period for the initial or extended levels of 
maintenance and repair elapses, the Military Department will reduce the 
levels of maintenance and repair to levels consistent with federal 
government standards for excess and surplus properties (i.e., 41 CFR 
101-47.402 and 41 CFR 101-47.4913).
    (j) [Reserved]
    (k) Leaseback of real property at base closure and realignment 
sites. (1) Section 2905(b)(4)(c) of Public Law 101-510, 10 U.S.C. 2687 
note (BRAC 1990), as added by section 2837 of Public Law 104-106, gives 
the Secretary of Defense the authority to transfer real property that is 
still needed by a Federal Department or Agency to an LRA provided the 
LRA agrees to lease the property back to the Federal Department or 
Agency in accordance with all statutory and regulatory guidance. The 
purpose of this

[[Page 797]]

authority, hereinafter referred to as a ``leaseback,'' is to enable the 
LRA to obtain ownership of the property pursuant to the BRAC process 
while still ensuring that the Federal need for use of the property is 
accommodated.
    (2) Subject to BRAC 1990 and this part, the decision whether to 
transfer property pursuant to a leaseback rests with the relevant 
military department. However, a military department may only transfer 
property via a leaseback if the Federal entity that needs the property 
agrees to the leaseback arrangement.
    (3) If for any reason property cannot be transferred pursuant to a 
leaseback (e.g., the relevant Federal Agency prefers ownership, the LRA 
and the Federal entity cannot agree on terms of the lease, or the 
military department determines that a leaseback would not be in the 
Federal interest), such property shall remain in Federal ownership 
unless and until the relevant landholding entity determines that it is 
surplus pursuant to the Federal Property Management Regulations.
    (4) If a building or structure is proposed for transfer under this 
authority, that which is leased back to the Federal Department or Agency 
may be all or a portion of that building or structure.
    (5) The leaseback authority may be used at all installations 
approved for closure or realignment under BRAC 1990.
    (6) Transfers under this authority must be to an LRA.
    (7) Transfers under this authority may be by lease in furtherance of 
conveyance or deed. A lease in furtherance of conveyance is appropriate 
only in those circumstances where deed transfer cannot be accomplished 
because the requirements of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. 9601, et seq.) for 
such transfer have not been met. The lease in furtherance of conveyance 
or accompanying contract shall include a provision stating that the LRA 
agrees to take title to the property when requirements for the transfer 
have been satisfied.
    (8) The leaseback authority can be used to transfer property that is 
needed either by existing Federal tenants or by Federal Departments or 
Agencies desiring to locate onto the property after operational closure. 
The Military Department that is closing or realigning the installation 
may not transfer property to an LRA under this authority and lease it 
back unless:
    (i) The Military Department is acting in an Executive Agent capacity 
on behalf of a Defense Agency that certifies that a leaseback is in the 
interest of that Defense Agency; or,
    (ii) The Secretary of the Military Department certifies that a 
leaseback is in the best interest of the Military Department and that 
use of the property by the Military Department is consistent with the 
obligation to close or realign the installation in accordance with the 
recommendations of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.
    (9) Property eligible for a leaseback is not surplus because it is 
still needed by a Federal entity. However, notwithstanding that the 
property is not surplus and that the LRA would not otherwise have to 
include such property in its redevelopment plan, the LRA should include 
the proposed leaseback of property in its redevelopment plan, taking 
into account the planned Federal use of such property.
    (10) The terms of the LRA's lease to the Federal entity should 
afford the Federal Department or Agency rights as close to those 
associated with ownership of the property as is practicable. The 
requirements of the General Services Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) (48 
CFR Part 570) are not applicable to the lease, but provisions in the 
GSAR may be used to the extent they are consistent with this part. The 
terms of the lease are negotiable subject to the following:
    (i) The lease shall be for a term of no more than 50 years, but may 
provide for options for renewal or extension of the term at the request 
of the Federal Department or Agency concerned. The lease term should be 
based on the needs of the Federal entity.
    (ii) The lease, or any renewals or extensions thereof, shall not 
require rental payments.
    (iii) The lease shall not require the Federal Government to pay the 
LRA or

[[Page 798]]

other local government entity for municipal services including fire and 
police protection.
    (iv) The Federal Department or Agency concerned may be responsible 
for services such as janitorial, grounds keeping, utilities, capital 
maintenance, and other services normally provided by a landlord. 
Acquisition of such services by the Federal Department or Agency is to 
be accomplished through the use of Federal Acquisition Regulation 
procedures or otherwise in accordance with applicable statutory and 
regulatory requirements.
    (v) The lease shall include a provision prohibiting the LRA from 
transferring fee title to another entity during the term of the lease, 
other than one of the political jurisdictions that comprise the LRA, 
without the written consent of the Federal Department or Agency 
occupying the leaseback property.
    (vi) The lease shall include a provision specifying that if the 
Federal Department or Agency concerned no longer needs the property 
before the expiration of the term of the lease, the remainder of the 
lease term may be satisfied by the same or another Federal Department or 
Agency that needs property for a similar use.
    (A) Prior to exercising this option, the Federal tenant shall 
consult with the LRA concerned or other property owner if the property 
has been conveyed by the LRA to another entity in accordance with Sec. 
175.7(k)(10)(v) of this part.
    (B) If the Federal tenant decides to exercise this option after 
consulting with the LRA or other property owner, it shall notify the 
appropriate General Services Administration regional office that the 
property is available for use by a Federal Department or Agency. The 
General Services Administration regional office shall have 60 days from 
the date of notification in which to identify a Federal Department or 
Agency to serve out the term of the lease and to notify the LRA or other 
property owner of the new tenant. If the regional office does not notify 
the LRA or other property owner of a new tenant within 60 days from the 
date of notification, the property is available for use by the LRA or 
other property owner.
    (C) If the Federal tenant decides not to exercise this option after 
consulting with the LRA or other property owner, the property is 
available for use by the LRA or other property owner.
    (vii) The terms of the lease shall provide that the Federal 
Department or Agency may repair and improve the property at its expense 
after consultation with the LRA.
    (11) Conveyance to an LRA under this authority shall be in one of 
the following ways:
    (i) Lease back property that will be conveyed under an Economic 
Development Conveyance (EDC) shall be conveyed as part of the EDC in 
accordance with the existing EDC procedures and Sec. 
175.7(k)(11)(ii)(B)(4). The LRA shall submit the following in addition 
to the application requirements outlined in Sec. 175.7(e)(5):
    (A) A description of the parcel or parcels the LRA proposes to have 
transferred to it and then to lease back to a Federal Department or 
Agency;
    (B) A written statement signed by an authorized representative of 
the Federal entity that it agrees to accept a leaseback of the property; 
and,
    (C) A statement explaining why a leaseback is necessary for the 
long-term economic redevelopment of the installation property.
    (ii) Leaseback property not associated with property to be conveyed 
under an EDC shall be conveyed in accordance with the following 
procedures:
    (A) As soon as possible after the LRA's submission of its 
redevelopment plan to the DoD and HUD, the LRA shall submit a request 
for a leaseback to the Military department. The Military Department may 
impose additional requirements as necessary, but at a minimum, the 
request shall contain the following:
    (1) A description of the parcel or parcels the LRA proposes to have 
transferred to it and then to lease back to a Federal Department or 
Agency;
    (2) A written statement signed by an authorized representative of 
the Federal entity that it agrees to accept a leaseback of the property; 
and,
    (3) A statement explaining why a leaseback is necessary for the 
long-

[[Page 799]]

term economic redevelopment of the installation property.
    (B) The transfer may be for consideration at or below the estimated 
present fair market value. In those instances in which the property is 
conveyed for consideration below the estimated present fair market 
value, the Military Department shall prepare a written explanation of 
why the estimated present fair market value was not obtained.
    (1) In a rural area, the transfer shall comply with Sec. 
175.7(f)(5).
    (2) Payment may be in cash or in-kind.
    (3) The Military Department shall determine the estimated present 
fair market value of the property before transfer under this authority.
    (4) The exact amount of consideration, or the formula to be used to 
determine that consideration, as well as the schedule for payment of 
consideration must be agreed upon in writing before transfer under this 
authority.

Sec. 176.1  Purpose.

    This part implements the Base Closure Community Redevelopment and 
Homeless Assistance Act, as amended (10 U.S.C. 2687 note), which 
instituted a new community-based process for addressing the needs of the 
homeless at base closure and realignment sites. In this process, Local 
Redevelopment Authorities (LRAs) identify interest from homeless 
providers in installation property and develop a redevelopment plan for 
the installation that balances the economic redevelopment and other 
development needs of the communities in the vicinity of the installation 
with the needs of the homeless in those communities. The Department of 
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) reviews the LRA's plan to see that 
an appropriate balance is achieved. This part also implements the 
process for identifying interest from State and local entities for 
property under a public benefit transfer. The LRA is responsible for 
concurrently identifying interest from homeless providers and State and 
local entities interested in property under a public benefit transfer.

Sec. 176.10  Applicability.

    (a) General. This part applies to all installations that are 
approved for closure/realignment by the President and Congress under 
Pub. L. 101-510 after October 25, 1994.
    (b) Request for inclusion under this process. This part also applies 
to installations that were approved for closure/realignment under either 
Public Law 100-526 or Public Law 101-510 prior to October 25, 1994 and 
for which an LRA submitted a request for inclusion under this part to 
DoD by December 24, 1994. A list of such requests was published in the 
Federal Register on May 30, 1995 (60 FR 28089).
    (1) For installations with Title V applications pending but not 
approved before October 25, 1994, the LRA shall consider and 
specifically address any application for use of buildings and property 
to assist the homeless that were received by HHS prior to October 25, 
1994, and were spending with the Secretary of HHS on that date. These 
pending requests shall be addressed in the LRA's homeless assistance 
submission.
    (2) For installations with Title V applications approved before 
October 25, 1994 where there is an approved Title V application, but 
property has not been assigned or otherwise disposed of by the Military 
Department, the LRA must ensure that its homeless assistance submission 
provides the Title V applicant with:
    (i) The property requested;
    (ii) Properties, on or off the installation, that are substantially 
equivalent to those requested;
    (iii) Sufficient funding to acquire such substantially equivalent 
properties;
    (iv) Services and activities that meet the needs identified in the 
application; or,
    (v) A combination of the properties, funding, and services and

closure or realignment under either Public Law 100-526 or Public Law 
101-510 prior to October 25, 1994, for which there was no request for 
consideration under this part, are covered by the process stipulated 
under Title V. Buildings or property that were transferred or leased for 
homeless use under Title V prior to October 25, 1994, may not be 
reconsidered under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 176.15  Waivers and extensions of deadlines.

    (a) After consultation with the LRA and HUD, and upon a finding that 
it is in the interest of the communities affected by the closure/
realignment of the installation, DoD, through the Director of the Office 
of Economic Adjustment, may extend or postpone any deadline contained in 
this part.
    (b) Upon completion of a determination and finding of good cause, 
and except for deadlines and actions required on the part of DoD, HUD 
may waive any provision of Sec. Sec. 176.20 through 176.45 of this part 
in any particular case, subject only to statutory limitations.

[[Page 802]]


<R05>
Sec. 176.20  Overview of the process.

    (a) Recognition of the LRA. As soon as practicable after the list of 
installations recommended for closure or realignment is approved, DoD, 
through OEA, will recognize an LRA for the installation. Upon 
recognition, OEA shall publish the name, address, and point of contact 
for the LRA in the Federal Register and in a newspaper of general 
circulation in the communities in the vicinity of the installation.
    (b) Responsibilities of the Military Department. The Military 
Department shall make installation properties available to other DoD 
components and Federal agencies in accordance with the procedures set 
out at 32 CFR part 175. The Military Department will keep the LRA 
informed of other Federal interest in the property during this process. 
Upon completion of this process the Military Department will notify HUD 
and either the LRA or the Chief Executive Officer of the State, as 
appropriate, and publish a list of surplus property on the installation 
that will be available for reuse in the Federal Register and a newspaper 
of general circulation in the communities in the vicinity of the 
installation.
    (c) Responsibilities of the LRA. The LRA should begin to conduct 
outreach efforts with respect to the installation as soon as is 
practicable after the date of approval of closure/realignment of the 
installation. The local reuse planning process must begin no later than 
the date of the Military Department's Federal Register publication of 
available property described at Sec. 176.20(b). For those installations 
that began the process described in this part prior to August 17, 1995, 
HUD will, on a case-by-case basis, determine whether the statutory 
requirements have been fulfilled and whether any additional requirements 
listed in this part should be required. Upon the Federal Register 
publication described in Sec. 176.20(b), the LRA shall:
    (1) Publish, within 30 days, in a newspaper of general circulation 
in the communities in the vicinity of the installation, the time period 
during which the LRA will receive notices of interest from State and 
local governments, representatives of the homeless, and other interested 
parties. This publication shall include the name, address, telephone 
number and the point of contact for the LRA who can provide information 
on the prescribed form and contents of the notices of interest. The LRA 
shall notify DoD of the deadline specified for receipt of notices of 
interest. LRAs are strongly encouraged to make this publication as soon 
as possible within the permissible 30 day period in order to expedite 
the closure process.
    (i) In addition, the LRA has the option to conduct an informal 
solicitation of notices of interest from public and non-profit entities 
interested in obtaining property via a public benefit transfer other 
than a homeless assistance conveyance under either 40 U.S.C. 471 et. 
seq. or 49 U.S.C. 47151-47153. As part of such a solicitation, the LRA 
may wish to request that interested entities submit a description of the 
proposed use to the LRA and the sponsoring Federal agency.
    (ii) For all installations selected for closure or realignment prior 
to 1995 that elected to proceed under Public Law 103-421, the LRA shall 
accept notices of interest for not less than 30 days.
    (iii) For installations selected for closure or realignment in 1995 
or thereafter, notices of interest shall be accepted for a minimum of 90 
days and not more than 180 days after the LRA's publication under Sec. 
176.20(c)(1).
    (2) Prescribe the form and contents of notices of interest.
    (i) The LRA may not release to the public any information regarding 
the capacity of the representative of the homeless to carry out its 
program, a description of the organization, or its financial plan for 
implementing the program, without the consent of the representative of 
the homeless concerned, unless such release is authorized under Federal 
law and under the law of the State and communities in which the 
installation concerned is located. The identity of the representative of 
the homeless may be disclosed.
    (ii) The notices of interest from representatives of the homeless 
must include:
    (A) A description of the homeless assistance program proposed, 
including the purposes to which the property or

[[Page 803]]

facility will be put, which may include uses such as supportive 
services, job and skills training, employment programs, shelters, 
transitional housing or housing with no established limitation on the 
amount of time of residence, food and clothing banks, treatment 
facilities, or any other activity which clearly meets an identified need 
of the homeless and fills a gap in the continuum of care;
    (B) A description of the need for the program;
    (C) A description of the extent to which the program is or will be 
coordinated with other homeless assistance programs in the communities 
in the vicinity of the installation;
    (D) Information about the physical requirements necessary to carry 
out the program including a description of the buildings and property at 
the installation that are necessary to carry out the program;
    (E) A description of the financial plan, the organization, and the 
organizational capacity of the representative of the homeless to carry 
out the program; and,
    (F) An assessment of the time required to start carrying out the 
program.
    (iii) The notices of interest from entities other than 
representatives of the homeless should specify the name of the entity 
and specific interest in property or facilities along with a description 
of the planned use.
    (3) In addition to the notice required under Sec. 176.20(c)(1), 
undertake outreach efforts to representatives of the homeless by 
contacting local government officials and other persons or entities that 
may be interested in assisting the homeless within the vicinity of the 
installation.
    (i) The LRA may invite persons and organizations identified on the 
HUD list of representatives of the homeless and any other 
representatives of the homeless with which the LRA is familiar, 
operating in the vicinity of the installation, to the workshop described 
in Sec. 176.20(c)(3)(ii).
    (ii) The LRA, in coordination with the Military Department and HUD, 
shall conduct at least one workshop where representatives of the 
homeless have an opportunity to:
    (A) Learn about the closure/realignment and disposal process;
    (B) Tour the buildings and properties available either on or off the 
installation;
    (C) Learn about the LRA's process and schedule for receiving notices 
of interest as guided by Sec. 176.20(c)(2); and,
    (D) Learn about any known land use constraints affecting the 
available property and buildings.
    (iii) The LRA should meet with representatives of the homeless that 
express interest in discussing possible uses for these properties to 
alleviate gaps in the continuum of care.
    (4) Consider various properties in response to the notices of 
interest. The LRA may consider property that is located off the 
installation.
    (5) Develop an application, including the redevelopment plan and 
homeless assistance submission, explaining how the LRA proposes to 
address the needs of the homeless. This application shall consider the 
notices of interest received from State and local governments, 
representatives of the homeless, and other interested parties. This 
shall include, but not be limited to, entities eligible for public 
benefit transfers under either 40 U.S.C. 471 et. seq., or 49 U.S.C. 
47151-47153; representatives of the homeless; commercial, industrial, 
and residential development interests; and other interests. From the 
deadline date for receipt of notices of interest described at Sec. 
176.20(c)(1), the LRA shall have 270 days to complete and submit the LRA 
application to the appropriate Military Department and HUD. The 
application requirements are described at Sec. 176.30.
    (6) Make the draft application available to the public for review 
and comment periodically during the process of developing the 
application. The LRA must conduct at least one public hearing on the 
application prior to its submission to HUD and the appropriate Military 
Department. A summary of the public comments received during the process 
of developing the application shall be included in the application when 
it is submitted.
    (d) Public benefit transfer screening. The LRA should, while 
conducting its outreach efforts, work with the Federal agencies that 
sponsor public benefit

[[Page 804]]

transfers under either 40 U.S.C. 471 et. seq. or 49 U.S.C. 47151-47153. 
Those agencies can provide a list of parties in the vicinity of the 
installation that might be interested in and eligible for public benefit 
transfers. The LRA should make a reasonable effort to inform such 
parties of the availability of the property and incorporate their 
interests within the planning process. Actual recipients of property are 
to be determined by sponsoring Federal agency. The Military Departments 
shall notify sponsoring Federal agencies about property that is 
available based on the community redevelopment plan and keep the LRA 
apprised of any expressions of interest. Such expressions of interest 
are not required to be incorporated into the redevelopment plan, but 
must be considered.


<R05>
Sec. 176.25  HUD's negotiations and consultations with the LRA.

    HUD may negotiate and consult with the LRA before and during the 
course of preparation of the LRA's application and during HUD's review 
thereof with a view toward avoiding any preliminary determination that 
the application does not meet any requirement of this part. LRAs are 
encouraged to contact HUD for a list of persons and organizations that 
are representatives of the homeless operating in the vicinity of the 
installation.


<R05>
Sec. 176.30  LRA application.

    (a) Redevelopment plan. A copy of the redevelopment plan shall be 
part of the application.
    (b) Homeless assistance submission. This component of the 
application shall include the following:
    (1) Information about homelessness in the communities in the 
vicinity of the installation.
    (i) A list of all the political jurisdictions which comprise the 
LRA.
    (ii) A description of the unmet need in the continuum of care system 
within each political jurisdiction, which should include information 
about any gaps that exist in the continuum of care for particular 
homeless subpopulations. The source for this information shall depend 
upon the size and nature of the political jurisdictions(s) that comprise 
the LRA. LRAs representing:
    (A) Political jurisdictions that are required to submit a 
Consolidated Plan shall include a copy of their Homeless and Special 
Needs Population Table (Table 1), Priority Homeless Needs Assessment 
Table (Table 2), and narrative description thereof from that 
Consolidated Plan, including the inventory of facilities and services 
that assist the homeless in the jurisdiction.
    (B) Political jurisdictions that are part of an urban county that is 
required to submit a Consolidated Plan shall include a copy of their 
Homeless and Special Needs Population Table (Table 1), Priority Homeless 
Needs Assessment Table (Table 2), and narrative description thereof from 
that Consolidated Plan, including the inventory of facilities and 
services that assist the homeless in the jurisdiction. In addition, the 
LRA shall explain what portion of the homeless population and 
subpopulations described in the Consolidated Plan are attributable to 
the political jurisdiction it represents.
    (C) A political jurisdiction not described by Sec. 
176.30(b)(1)(ii)(A) or Sec. 176.30(b)(1)(ii)(B) shall submit a 
narrative description of what it perceives to be the homeless population 
within the jurisdiction and a brief inventory of the facilities and 
services that assist homeless persons and families within the 
jurisdiction. LRAs that represent these jurisdictions are not required 
to conduct surveys of the homeless population.
    (2) Notices of interest proposing assistance to homeless persons 
and/or families.
    (i) A description of the proposed activities to be carried out on or 
off the installation and a discussion of how these activities meet a 
portion or all of the needs of the homeless by addressing the gaps in 
the continuum of care. The activities need not be limited to expressions 
of interest in property, but may also include discussions of how 
economic redevelopment may benefit the homeless;
    (ii) A copy of each notice of interest from representatives of the 
homeless for use of buildings and property and a description of the 
manner in which the LRA's application addresses the need expressed in 
each notice of interest. If the LRA determines that a particular

[[Page 805]]

notice of interest should not be awarded property, an explanation of why 
the LRA determined not to support that notice of interest, the reasons 
for which may include the impact of the program contained in the notice 
of interest on the community as described in Sec. 176.30(b)(2)(iii); 
and,
    (iii) A description of the impact that the implemented redevelopment 
plan will have on the community. This shall include information on how 
the LRA's redevelopment plan might impact the character of existing 
neighborhoods adjacent to the properties proposed to be used to assist 
the homeless and should discuss alternative plans. Impact on schools, 
social services, transportation, infrastructure, and concentration of 
minorities and/or low income persons shall also be discussed.
    (3) Legally binding agreements for buildings, property, funding, 
and/or services.
    (i) A copy of the legally binding agreements that the LRA proposes 
to enter into with the representative(s) of the homeless selected by the 
LRA to implement homeless programs that fill gaps in the existing 
continuum of care. The legally binding agreements shall provide for a 
process for negotiating alternative arrangements in the event that an 
environmental analysis conducted under Sec. 176.45(b) indicates that 
any property identified for transfer in the agreement is not suitable 
for the intended purpose. Where the balance determined in accordance 
with Sec. 176.30(b)(4) provides for the use of installation property as 
a homeless assistance facility, legally binding agreements must provide 
for the reversion or transfer, either to the LRA or to another entity or 
entities, of the buildings and property in the event they cease to be 
used for the homeless. In cases where the balance proposed by the LRA 
does not include the use of buildings or property on the installation, 
the legally binding agreements need not be tied to the use of specific 
real property and need not include a reverter clause. Legally binding 
agreements shall be accompanied by a legal opinion of the chief legal 
advisor of the LRA or political jurisdiction or jurisdictions which will 
be executing the legally binding agreements that the legally binding 
agreements, when executed, will constitute legal, valid, binding, and 
enforceable obligations on the parties thereto;
    (ii) A description of how buildings, property, funding, and/or 
services either on or off the installation will be used to fill some of 
the gaps in the current continuum of care system and an explanation of 
the suitability of the buildings and property for that use; and,
    (iii) Information on the availability of general services such as 
transportation, police, and fire protection, and a discussion of 
infrastructure such as water, sewer, and electricity in the vicinity of 
the proposed homeless activity at the installation.
    (4) An assessment of the balance with economic and other development 
needs.
    (i) An assessment of the manner in which the application balances 
the expressed needs of the homeless and the needs of the communities 
comprising the LRA for economic redevelopment and other development; and
    (ii) An explanation of how the LRA's application is consistent with 
the appropriate Consolidated Plan(s) or any other existing housing, 
social service, community, economic, or other development plans adopted 
by the jurisdictions in the vicinity of the installation.
    (5) A description of the outreach undertaken by the LRA. The LRA 
shall explain how the outreach requirements described at Sec. 
176.20(c)(1) and Sec. 176.20(c)(3) have been fulfilled. This 
explanation shall include a list of the representatives of the homeless 
the LRA contacted during the outreach process.
    (c) Public comments. The LRA application shall include the materials 
described at Sec. 176.20(c)(6). These materials shall be prefaced with 
an overview of the citizen participation process observed in preparing 
the application.


<R05>
Sec. 176.35  HUD's review of the application.

    (a) Timing. HUD shall complete a review of each application no later 
than 60 days after its receipt of a completed application.
    (b) Standards of review. The purpose of the review is to determine 
whether the

[[Page 806]]

application is complete and, with respect to the expressed interest and 
requests of representatives of the homeless, whether the application:
    (1) Need. Takes into consideration the size and nature of the 
homeless population in the communities in the vicinity of the 
installation, the availability of existing services in such communities 
to meet the needs of the homeless in such communities, and the 
suitability of the buildings and property covered by the application for 
use and needs of the homeless in such communities. HUD will take into 
consideration the size and nature of the installation in reviewing the 
needs of the homeless population in the communities in the vicinity of 
the installation.
    (2) Impact of notices of interest. Takes into consideration any 
economic impact of the homeless assistance under the plan on the 
communities in the vicinity of the installation, including:
    (i) Whether the plan is feasible in light of demands that would be 
placed on available social services, police and fire protection, and 
infrastructure in the community; and,
    (ii) Whether the selected notices of interest are consistent with 
the Consolidated Plan(s) of any other existing housing, social service, 
community economic, or other development plans adopted by the political 
jurisdictions in the vicinity of the installation.
    (3) Legally binding agreements. Specifies the manner in which the 
buildings, property, funding, and/or services on or off the installation 
will be made available for homeless assistance purposes. HUD will review 
each legally binding agreement to verify that:
    (i) They include all the documents legally required to complete the 
transactions necessary to realize the homeless use(s) described in the 
application;
    (ii) They include all appropriate terms and conditions;
    (iii) They address the full range of contingencies including those 
described at Sec. 176.30(b)(3)(i);
    (iv) They stipulate that the buildings, property, funding, and/or 
services will be made available to the representatives of the homeless 
in a timely fashion; and,
    (v) They are accompanied by a legal opinion of the chief legal 
advisor of the LRA or political jurisdiction or jurisdictions which will 
be executing the legally binding agreements that the legally binding 
agreements will, when executed, constitute legal, valid, binding, and 
enforceable obligations on the parties thereto.
    (4) Balance. Balances in an appropriate manner a portion or all of 
the needs of the communities in the vicinity or the installation for 
economic redevelopment and other development with the needs of the 
homeless in such communities.
    (5) Outreach. Was developed in consultation with representatives of 
the homeless and the homeless assistance planning boards, if any, in the 
communities in the vicinity of the installation and whether the outreach 
requirements described at Sec. 176.20(c)(1) and Sec. 176.20(c)(3) have 
been fulfilled by the LRA.
    (c) Notice of determination. (1) HUD shall, no later than the 60th 
day after its receipt of the application, unless such deadline is 
extended pursuant to Sec. 176.15(a), send written notification both to 
DoD and the LRA of its preliminary determination that the application 
meets or fails to meet the requirements of Sec. 176.35(b). If the 
application fails to meet the requirements, HUD will send the LRA:
    (i) A summary of the deficiencies in the application;
    (ii) An explanation of the determination; and,
    (iii) A statement of how the LRA must address the determinations.
    (2) In the event that no application is submitted and no extension 
is requested as of the deadline specified in Sec. 176.20(c)(5), and the 
State does not accept within 30 days a DoD written request to become 
recognized as the LRA, the absence of such application will trigger an 
adverse determination by HUD effective on the date of the lapsed 
deadline. Under these conditions, HUD will follow the process described 
at Sec. 176.40.
    (d) Opportunity to cure. (1) The LRA shall have 90 days from its 
receipt of

[[Page 807]]

the notice of preliminary determination under Sec. 176.35(c)(1) within 
which to submit to HUD and DoD a revised application which addresses the 
determinations listed in the notice. Failure to submit a revised 
application shall result in a final determination, effective 90 days 
from the LRA's receipt of the preliminary determination, that the 
redevelopment plan fails to meet the requirements of Sec. 176.35(b).
    (2) HUD shall, within 30 days of its receipt of the LRA's 
resubmission send written notification of its final determination of 
whether the application meets the requirements of Sec. 176.35(b) to 
both DOD and the LRA.


<R05>
Sec. 176.40  Adverse determinations.

    (a) Review and consultation. If the resubmission fails to meet the 
requirements of Sec. 176.35(b) or if no resubmission is received, HUD 
will review the original application, including the notices of interest 
submitted by representatives of the homeless. In addition, in such 
instances or when no original application has been submitted, HUD:
    (1) Shall consult with the representatives of the homeless, if any, 
for purposes of evaluation the continuing interest of such 
representatives in the use of buildings or property at the installation 
to assist the homeless;
    (2) May consult with the applicable Military Department regarding 
the suitability of the buildings and property at the installation for 
use to assist the homeless; and,
    (3) May consult with representatives of the homeless and other 
parties as necessary.
    (b) Notice of decision. (1) Within 90 days of receipt of an LRA's 
revised application which HUD determines does not meet the requirements 
of Sec. 176.35(b), HUD shall, based upon its reviews and consultations 
under Sec. 176.40(a):
    (i) Notify DoD and the LRA of the buildings and property at the 
installation that HUD determines are suitable for use to assist the 
homeless, and;
    (ii) Notify DoD and the LRA of the extent to which the revised 
redevelopment plan meets the criteria set forth in Sec. 176.35(b).
    (2) In the event that an LRA does not submit a revised redevelopment 
plan under Sec. 176.35(d), HUD shall, based upon its reviews and 
consultations under Sec. 176.40(a), notify DoD and the LRA of the 
buildings and property at the installation that HUD determines are 
suitable for use to assist the homeless, either
    (i) Within 190 days after HUD sends its notice of preliminary 
adverse determination under Sec. 176.35(c)(1), if an LRA has not 
submitted a revised redevelopment plan; or
    (ii) Within 390 days after the Military Department's Federal 
Register publication of available property under Sec. 176.20(b), if no 
redevelopment plan has been received and no extension has been approved.


<R05>
Sec. 176.45  Disposal of buildings and property.

    (a) Puglic benefit transfer screening. Not later than the LRA's 
submission of its redevelopment plan to DoD and HUD, the Military 
Development will conduct an official public benefit transfer screening 
in accordance with the Federal Property Management Regulations (41 CFR 
101-47.303-2) based upon the uses identified in the redevelopment plan. 
Federal sponsoring agencies shall notify eligible applicants that any 
request for property must be consistent with the uses identified in the 
redevelopment plan. At the request of the LRA, the Military Department 
may conduct the official State and local public benefit screening at any 
time after the publication of available property described at Sec. 
176.20(b).
    (b) Environmental analysis. Prior to disposal of any real property, 
the Military Department shall, consistent with NEPA and section 2905 of 
the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, as amended (10 
U.S.C. 2687 note), complete an environmental impact analysis of all 
reasonable disposal alternatives. The Military Department shall consult 
with the LRA throughout the environmental impact analysis process to 
ensure both that the LRA is provided the most current environmental 
information available concerning the installation, and that the Military 
Department receives the most

[[Page 808]]

current information available concerning the LRA's redevelopment plans 
for the installation.
    (c) Disposal. Upon receipt of a notice of approval of an application 
from HUD under Sec. 176.35(c)(1) or Sec. 176.35(d)(2), DoD shall 
dispose of buildings and property in accordance with the record of 
decision or other decision document prepared under Sec. 176.45(b). 
Disposal of buildings and property to be used as homeless assistance 
facilities shall be to either the LRA or directly to the 
representative(s) of the homeless and shall be without consideration. 
Upon receipt of a notice from HUD under Sec. 176.40(b), DoD will 
dispose of the buildings and property at the installation in 
consultation with HUD and the LRA.
    (d) LRA's responsibility. The LRA shall be responsible for the 
implementation of and compliance with legally binding agreements under 
the application.
    (e) Reversions to the LRA. If a building or property reverts to the 
LRA under a legally binding agreement under the application, the LRA 
shall take appropriate actions to secure, to the maximum extent 
practicable, the utilization of the building or property by other 
homeless representatives to assist the homeless. An LRA may not be 
required to utilize the building or property to assist the homeless.

Executive Agent, and will be limited either to the requirements of a 
specified interagency planning process or to a specified geographic area 
or emergency. (The DoD

[[Page 811]]

Executive Agent also may delegate authority to designate DCOs to any DoD 
Planning Agent specified in this part.)
    Defense Emergency Response Fund. Established by Pub. L. 101-165 
(1989). That law provides that, ``The Fund shall be available for 
providing reimbursement to currently applicable appropriations of the 
Department of Defense for supplies and services provided in anticipation 
of requests from other Federal departments and agencies and from State 
and local governments for assistance on a reimbursable basis to respond 
to natural or manmade disasters. The Fund may be used upon a 
determination by the Secretary of Defense that immediate action is 
necessary before a formal request for assistance on a reimbursable basis 
is received.'' The Fund is applicable to Foreign Disaster Assistance 
under DoD Directive 5100.46 \6\ and to MSCA under the authority of this 
part.

to distinguish them from any one of the various regional alignments of 
other Federal Departments and Agencies, all of which are circumscribed 
by FEMA's coordination authority. Today, there are ten Federal Regions, 
but the term is used generally to facilitate MSCA regardless of the 
number of Federal Regions at any time.
    Federal response plan. The inter-departmental planning mechanism, 
developed under FEMA leadership, by which the Federal Government 
prepares for and responds to the consequences of catastrophic disasters.

national mutual aid system developed by Federal departments and agencies 
to provide for the medical needs of victims of major disasters, and to 
provide backup support for medical systems of the Departments of Defense 
and Veterans Affairs in caring for casualties from military conflicts. 
The Department of Health and Human Services serves as the lead Federal 
agency for administering NDMS, and would coordinate NDMS operations in 
response to civil emergencies. The Department of Defense could activate 
and coordinate NDMS operations in support of military contingencies.
    National security emergency. Any occurrence, including natural 
disaster, military attack, technological emergency, or other emergency, 
that seriously degrades or seriously threatens the national security of 
the United States (E.O. 12656).
    Planning agent. A military or civilian official of any DoD 
Component, who has been designated by the head of that Component to 
exercise delegated authority for MSCA planning for the entire Component 
(i.e., ``principal planning agent'') or for certain subordinate elements 
or a specified geographic area (e.g., ``regional planning agents''). 
Authority and responsibilities of each planning agent will be defined by 
the Component, and may include MSCA response as well as planning at the 
election of any Component. The actual authority of planning agents will 
be communicated to others, as determined by the DoD Component, or when 
requested by the DoD Executive Agent.
    Regional Military Emergency Coordinator (RMEC). An individual, 
designated on behalf of the Secretary of Defense and the DoD Executive 
Agent, to perform coordination, information exchange, and liaison 
functions on behalf of the Department of Defense with any Federal 
emergency management structure established at the Region level. 
Alternate RMECs are designated by other DoD Components, as required, in 
accordance with this part; and the RMECs and alternates collectively are 
referred to as ``RMEC Teams.''
    Residual Capability Assessment (RECA). An assessment of the effects 
of a nuclear or conventional attack on U.S. resources, or of a major 
peacetime disaster that results in the declaration of a national 
security emergency. Such an assessment is made (through all appropriate 
means) to determine the remaining capabilities of the United States with 
emphasis on military preparedness.
    Resource claimancy. The procedure, employed during any period of 
attack or national security emergency, whereby authorized Federal 
agencies determine definitive requirements and justify the allocation of 
civil government and civil resources needed to support programs under 
their cognizance. It does not imply procurement activity, nor does it 
involve the Government as an intermediary in the normal mechanisms of 
trade other than in expediting essential activities and ensuring 
equitable distribution of civil resources. Resource claimancy occurs at 
both the national and regional levels.
    State Area Commands (STARCs). Specific headquarters units of the 
Army National Guard for each State, the District of Columbia, Guam, 
Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.


<R05>
Sec. 185.4  Policy.

    (a) National policy. (1) Planning and preparedness by the Federal 
Government for civil emergencies and attacks are important due to the 
severity of the consequences of emergencies for the nation and the 
population, and to the sophistication of means of attack on the United 
States and its territories.
    (2) Under the Stafford Act, as amended, it is the policy of the 
Federal Government to provide an orderly and continuing means of 
supplemental assistance to State and local governments in their 
responsibilities to alleviate the suffering and damage that result from 
major disasters or emergencies. Upon

[[Page 813]]

declaring a major disaster or emergency under the Stafford Act, the 
President may direct any agency of the Federal Government to undertake 
missions and tasks (on either a reimbursable or non-reimbursable basis) 
to provide assistance to State and local agencies. The President 
appoints a Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO) to operate in the affected 
area, and delegates authority to the FCO. The President has delegated to 
the Director of FEMA the authority to appoint FCOs; and FEMA officials 
frequently serve as FCOs.
    (3) In accordance with the Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950, as 
amended, the national civil defense policy is to have a civil defense 
program to develop capabilities common to all catastrophic emergencies 
and those unique to attack emergencies, which will support all-hazard 
emergency management at State and local levels, in order to protect the 
population and vital infrastructure. Under the national civil defense 
policy, the Department of Defense will support civil authorities in 
civil defense, to include facilitating the use of the National Guard in 
each State for response in both peacetime disasters and national 
security emergencies.
    (4) Under E.O. 12656, it is the policy of the Federal Government to 
have sufficient capabilities at all levels of government to meet 
essential defense and civilian needs during any national security 
emergency.
    (b) Scope. This part governs all planning and response by DoD 
Components for civil defense or other assistance to civil authorities, 
with the exception of military support to law enforcement operations 
under DoD Directive 3025.12 and contingency war plans.
    (c) Delegations of authority. The Secretary of Defense shall be 
assisted in executing his responsibility for MSCA by the following:
    (1) The Secretary of the Army shall be the DoD Executive Agent and 
shall act for the Secretary of Defense in accordance with this part and 
any supplemental direction or guidance received from the Secretary of 
Defense. In that capacity, the DoD Executive Agent will develop planning 
guidance, plans, and procedures for MSCA in accordance with this part. 
The DoD Executive Agent has the authority of the Secretary of Defense to 
task the DoD Components to plan for and to commit DoD resources, in 
response to requests from civil authorities under MSCA. The Secretary of 
the Army shall coordinate with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
any commitment of military forces assigned to the Unified and Specified 
Commands.
    (2) The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall communicate to 
the Commanders of the Unified and Specified Commands appropriate 
guidance issued by the Secretary of the Army for their compliance with 
this part, and also shall assist the DoD Executive Agent in developing 
MSCA planning guidance for all conditions of war or attacks on the 
United States or its territories.
    (3) The Commander in Chief, Forces Command (CINCFOR); the Commander 
in Chief, U.S. Atlantic Command (USCINCLANT); and the Commander in 
Chief, U.S. Pacific Command (USCINCPAC), shall serve as ``DoD Planning 
Agents'' for MSCA. Pursuant to guidance issued by the DoD Executive 
Agent, after coordination with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, the DoD Planning Agents shall conduct MSCA planning, and shall 
lead MSCA planning activities of all DoD Components within the following 
geographic areas:
    (i) CINCFOR (48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia).
    (ii) USCINCLANT (Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands).
    (iii) USCINCPAC (Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. possessions and 
territories in the Pacific area).
    (4) The Commanders of the Unified and Specified Commands shall 
provide MSCA response, as directed by the DoD Executive Agent.
    (5) The Secretary of Defense reserves the authority to modify or 
terminate the executive agency established by this part if operational 
needs so require in a particular situation.
    (d) MSCA policy.
    (1) MSCA shall include (but not be limited to) support similar to 
that described for immediate response (paragraph (e) of this section), 
in either civil emergencies or attacks, during any period of peace, war, 
or transition to war.

[[Page 814]]

It shall include response to civil defense agencies, but shall not 
include military assistance for civil law enforcement operations.
    (i) DoD Directive 3025.12 governs use of military resources in the 
event of civil disturbances, which may include providing physical 
security for DoD Key Assets, as defined in DoD Directive 5160.54.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See footnote 4 to Sec. 185.1(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Material, logistic, communications, and other assistance to law 
enforcement (especially during enforcement operations) is provided under 
DoD Directive 5525.5\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ See footnote 4 to Sec. 185.1(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) The DoD Components shall respond to requirements of the DoD 
Executive Agent and DoD Planning Agents for MSCA, as authorized by this 
part.
    (3) To ensure sound management of DoD resources, MSCA planning will 
stress centralized direction of peacetime planning with civil 
authorities, with decentralized planning by DoD Components with civil 
agencies, where appropriate, and decentralized execution of approved 
plans in time of emergency.
    (4) Subject to priorities established by the President or the 
Secretary of Defense, all DoD resources are potentially available for 
MSCA. MSCA planning and execution will encourage and adhere to the 
following premises:
    (i) That civil resources are applied first in meeting requirements 
of civil authorities.
    (ii) That DoD resources are provided only when response or recovery 
requirements are beyond the capabilities of civil authorities (as 
determined by FEMA or another lead Federal agency for emergency 
response).
    (iii) That specialized DoD capabilities requested for MSCA (e.g., 
airlift and airborne reconnaissance) are used efficiently.
    (iv) Generally, military operations other than MSCA will have 
priority over MSCA, unless otherwise directed by the Secretary of 
Defense.
    (5) MSCA shall provide a mechanism to facilitate continuous and 
cooperative civil and military planning and preparedness to mobilize all 
appropriate resources and capabilities of the civil sector and the 
Department of Defense, whenever required for any form of national 
security emergency.
    (6) DoD planning shall recognize that:
    (i) Army and Air National Guard forces, acting under State orders 
(i.e., not in Federal service), have primary responsibility for 
providing military assistance to State and local government agencies in 
civil emergencies.
    (ii) The Army National Guard State Area Command (STARC), when 
ordered to Federal Active Duty, will be the DoD focal point for delivery 
of MSCA at State and local levels in time of war.
    (iii) Plans and preparedness measures of MSCA must foster close and 
continuous coordination for efficient employment of DoD resources of the 
National Guard (whether employed under State or Federal authority), as 
well as resources of the DoD Components, in time of peace, war, or 
transition to war.
    (iv) In the event of an attack on the United States, its 
territories, or possessions, the scope of MSCA in each geographical area 
will depend upon the commitment of military resources to military 
operations, the extent of damage sustained by the civilian communities, 
and the status of Active and Reserve Component forces.
    (7) DoD Components shall augment staffs responsible for MSCA, as 
appropriate, with personnel from Reserve components of all Military 
Services who are specifically trained for civil-military planning and 
emergency liaison duties. (See enclosure 3 in DoD Directive 1215.6.) \9\ 
The Military Services also shall ensure that all Active or Reserve 
component military personnel assigned or attached to FEMA are 
appropriately trained and employed to enhance DoD capabilities for MSCA 
in time of war or attack on the United States or its territories.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ See footnote 4 to Sec. 185.1(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (8) The DoD Components ordinarily shall provide DoD resources in 
response to civil emergencies on a cost reimbursable basis. However, see 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section for circumstances in which an inability 
or unwillingness

[[Page 815]]

of a requester to commit to reimbursement will not preclude action by 
DoD components.
    (i) The DoD Components shall comply with legal and accounting 
requirements for the loan, grant, or consumption of DoD resources for 
MSCA, as necessary, to ensure reimbursement of costs to the DoD 
Components under the Stafford Act, as amended; the Defense Emergency 
Response Fund established by Public Law 101-165 (1989); or other 
applicable authority.
    (ii) The DoD Components shall not procure or maintain any supplies, 
material, or equipment exclusively for providing MSCA in civil 
emergencies, unless otherwise directed by the Secretary of Defense.
    (iii) Planning for MSCA during any time of attack on the United 
States shall assume that financial requirements will be met through 
appropriate legal processes.
    (9) Military forces employed in MSCA activities shall remain under 
military command and control under the authority of the DoD Executive 
Agent at all times.
    (10) The DoD Components shall not perform any function of civil 
government unless absolutely necessary on a temporary basis under 
conditions of Immediate Response. Any commander who is directed, or 
undertakes, to perform such functions shall facilitate the 
reestablishment of civil responsibility at the earliest time possible.
    (e) Immediate Response. (1) Imminently serious conditions resulting 
from any civil emergency or attack may require immediate action by 
military commanders, or by responsible officials of other DoD Agencies, 
to save lives, prevent human suffering, or mitigate great property 
damage. When such conditions exist and time does not permit prior 
approval from higher headquarters, local military commanders and 
responsible officials of other DoD Components are authorized by this 
part, subject to any supplemental direction that may be provided by 
their DoD component, to take necessary action to respond to requests of 
civil authorities. All such necessary action is referred to in this part 
as ``Immediate Response.''
    (2) While Immediate Response should be provided to civil agencies on 
a cost-reimbursable basis if possible, it should not be delayed or 
denied because of the inability or unwillingness of the requester to 
make a commitment to reimburse the Department of Defense.
    (3) Any commander or official acting under the Immediate Response 
authority of this Directive shall advise the DoD Executive Agent through 
command channels, by the most expeditious means available, and shall 
seek approval or additional authorizations as needed.
    (4) Immediate Response may include DoD assistance to civil agencies 
in meeting the following types of need:
    (i) Rescue, evacuation, and emergency medical treatment of 
casualties, maintenance or restoration of emergency medical 
capabilities, and safeguarding the public health.
    (ii) Emergency restoration of essential public services (including 
fire-fighting, water, communications, transportation, power, and fuel).
    (iii) Emergency clearance of debris, rubble, and explosive ordnance 
from public facilities and other areas to permit rescue or movement of 
people and restoration of essential services.
    (iv) Recovery, identification, registration, and disposal of the 
dead.
    (v) Monitoring and decontaminating radiological, chemical, and 
biological effects; controlling contaminated areas; and reporting 
through national warning and hazard control systems.
    (vi) Roadway movement control and planning.
    (vii) Safeguarding, collecting, and distributing food, essential 
supplies, and material on the basis of critical priorities.
    (viii) Damage assessment.
    (ix) Interim emergency communications.
    (x) Facilitating the reestablishment of civil government functions.
    (f) Military cooperation with civil agencies. (1) Under E.O. 12148 
(44 FR 43239, 3 CFR 1979 Comp., p. 412) and E.O. 12656, FEMA is 
responsible for coordinating Federal plans and programs for response to 
civil emergencies at the national and regional levels, and for Federal 
assistance to the States in civil

[[Page 816]]

emergencies. Other Federal departments and agencies have specific 
responsibilities for emergency planning and response under E.O. 12656, 
and under statutory authorities not listed in this part. The DoD 
Executive Agent shall ensure:
    (i) Coordination of MSCA plans and procedures with FEMA, and with 
other civil agencies as appropriate, at the national and Federal Region 
level.
    (ii) Facilitation of direct planning for MSCA by DoD facilities and 
installations with their local communities, and with their respective 
STARCs, as appropriate.
    (2) The DoD Executive Agent also shall provide appropriate guidance 
to facilitate MSCA planning and response with the American Red Cross and 
other civilian disaster and emergency assistance organizations where 
authorized by law.
    (g) Response under other authorities. DoD response to emergencies 
under authorities not cited in this Directive also may be directed, 
coordinated, or supplemented by the DoD Executive Agent, as 
circumstances require. For example:
    (1) The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) or the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) will coordinate Federal response to oil or hazardous 
material spills, other than those occurring within DoD jurisdictions. 
The DoD Executive Agent will provide MSCA to the USCG or the EPA; but 
responsibilities of DoD Components in areas under DoD jurisdiction are 
covered by DoD Directive 5030.41 \10\.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ See footnote 4 to Sec. 185.1(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Emergencies or other incidents involving radiological materials 
shall be handled in accordance with DoD Directive 5100.52 \11\.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ See footnote 4 to Sec. 185.1(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) The Secretary of the Army shall ensure the implementation of DoD 
responsibilities for emergency water requirements, as specified in E.O. 
12656, and response to flooding, as provided in Public Law 84-99 (1941), 
as amended.
    (4) Forest fire emergencies are responsibilities of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture or Interior. The Boise Interagency Fire Center 
(BIFC) may request DoD assistance; and specific details regarding DoD 
support are covered by agreements between the Department of Defense and 
the BIFC that are administered by the DoD Executive Agent.
    (5) The DoD Executive Agent is delegated the authority to direct DoD 
Components in planning for and responding to any civil emergency that 
may arise out of any mass immigration by aliens into the land territory 
of the United States, its territories and possessions, consistent with 
applicable law and this part. The DoD Executive Agent should ensure 
appropriate coordination with Federal law enforcement authorities in 
exercising this authority.
    (6) Use of DoD transportation resources in response to a non-
declared civil emergency shall be directed by the DoD Executive Agent 
under this part. (See also DoD Directive 4500.9 \12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ See footnote 4 to Sec. 185.1(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (h) Non-declared emergencies. The DoD Executive Agent may direct DoD 
Components to respond to any emergency, based on authority that is 
provided by this part or obtained from the Secretary or Deputy Secretary 
of Defense. If an emergency of any kind or size requires a response on 
behalf of the Department of Defense, where there has not been any 
declaration of major disaster or emergency by the President, or if 
reimbursement of funds to the Department of Defense is otherwise not 
certain, the DoD Executive Agent shall ascertain the authority necessary 
to commit DoD resources for response to requests from civil authorities.
    (1) Authorizations by the DoD Executive Agent under this paragraph 
shall include (but not be limited to) commitment of funds from the 
Defense Emergency Response Fund in anticipation of reimbursements to 
that fund.
    (2) The DoD Executive Agent shall obtain authorization from the 
Secretary of Defense or Deputy Secretary of Defense to provide support 
in those cases in which DoD response is not clearly required by Federal 
law or by DoD plans approved by the DoD Executive Agent.
    (i) Emergency priorities. When guidance cannot be obtained from 
higher headquarters on a timely basis, due to

[[Page 817]]

attack on the United States or other emergency circumstances, the DoD 
Components should apply DoD resources to MSCA in the following order of 
priority:
    (1) To save human life and mitigate human suffering, and to protect 
essential U.S. Government capabilities, including:
    (i) Continuity of the U.S. Government.
    (ii) Protection of U.S. Government officials.
    (iii) Prevention of loss or destruction to Federal property.
    (iv) Restoration of essential Federal functions.
    (2) To preserve or restore services of State and local government.

Components and directly applicable to lifesaving, survival, and 
immediate recovery aspects of MSCA.
    (ii) Forces to be included in the DODRDB are those that are based in 
the United States and its territories and most capable of supporting 
civil emergency functions. Those forces include (but are not limited to) 
construction, airlift, medical, signal, transportation, and military

Sec. 187.1  Purpose.

    Executive Order 12114 provides the exclusive and complete 
requirement for taking account of considerations with respect to actions 
that do significant harm to the environment of places outside the United 
States. This part provides policy and procedures to enable Department of 
Defense (DoD) officials to be informed and take account of environmental 
considerations when authorizing or approving certain major Federal 
actions that do significant harm to the environment of places outside 
the United States. Its sole objective is to establish internal 
procedures to achieve this purpose, and nothing in it shall be construed 
to create a cause of action. Guidance for taking account of 
considerations with respect to the environment of places within the 
United States is set out in 32 CFR part 188 (under rev.) That guidance 
is grounded on legal and policy requirements different from those 
applicable to this part.

[44 FR 21786, Apr. 14, 1979. Redesignated and amended at 56 FR 64481, 
Dec. 10, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 187.2  Applicability.

    The provisions of this part apply to the Office of the Secretary of 
Defense, the Military Departments, the Organization of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, the Unified and Specified Commands, and the Defense Agencies 
(hereafter referred to as ``DoD components'').


<R05>
Sec. 187.3  Definitions.

    (a) Environment means the natural and physical environment, and it 
excludes social, economic, and other environments. Social and economic 
effects do not give rise to any requirements under this part.
    (b) Federal Action means an action that is implemented or funded 
directly by the United States Government. It does not include actions in 
which the United States participates in an advisory, information-
gathering, representational, or diplomatic capacity but does not 
implement or fund the action; actions taken by a foreign government or 
in a foreign country in which the United States is a beneficiary of the 
action, but does not implement or fund the action; or actions in which 
foreign governments use funds derived indirectly from United States 
funding.
    (c) Foreign Nation means any geographic area (land, water, and 
airspace) that is under the jurisdiction of one or more foreign 
governments; any area under military occupation by the United States 
alone or jointly with any other foreign government; and any area that is 
the responsibility of an international organization of governments. 
``Foreign nation'' includes contiguous zones and fisheries zones of 
foreign nations. ``Foreign government'' in this context includes 
governments regardless of whether recognized by the United States, 
political factions, and organizations that exercise governmental power 
outside the United States.
    (d) Global Commons are geographical areas that are outside the 
jurisdiction of any nation, and include the oceans outside territorial 
limits and Antarctica. Global commons do not include contiguous zones 
and fisheries zones of foreign nations.
    (e) Major Action means an action of considerable importance 
involving substantial expenditures of time, money,

[[Page 822]]

and resources, that affects the environment on a large geographic scale 
or has substantial environmental effects on a more limited geographical 
area, and that is substantially different or a significant departure 
from other actions, previously analyzed with respect to environmental 
considerations and approved, with which the action under consideration 
may be associated. Deployment of ships, aircraft, or other mobile 
military equipment is not a major action for purposes of this part.
    (f) United States means all States, territories, and possessions of 
the United States; and all waters and airspace subject to the 
territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The territories and 
possessions of the United States include the Virgin Islands, American 
Samoa, Wake Island, Midway Island, Guam, Palmyra Island, Johnston Atoll, 
Navassa Island, and Kingman Reef.


<R05>
Sec. 187.4  Policy.

    (a) Executive Order 12114 is based on the authority vested in the 
President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States. The 
objective of the Order is to further foreign policy and national 
security interests while at the same time taking into consideration 
important environmental concerns.
    (b) The Department of Defense acts with care in the global commons 
because the stewardship of these areas is shared by all the nations of 
the world. The Department of Defense will take account of environmental 
considerations when it acts in the global commons in accordance with 
procedures set out in Enclosure 1 and its attachment.
    (c) The Department of Defense also acts with care within the 
jurisdiction of a foreign nation. Treaty obligations and the sovereignty 
of other nations must be respected, and restraint must be exercised in 
applying United States laws within foreign nations unless Congress has 
expressly provided otherwise. The Department of Defense will take 
account of environmental considerations in accordance with Enclosure 2 
and its attachments when it acts in a foreign nation.
    (d) Foreign policy considerations require coordination with the 
Department of State on communications with foreign governments 
concerning environmental agreements and other formal arrangements with 
foreign governments concerning environmental matters under this part.

Informal working-level communications and arrangements are not included 
in this coordination requirement. Consultation with the Department of 
State also is required in connection with the utilization of additional 
exemptions from this part as specified in paragraph C.3.b. of Enclosure 
2. Coordination and consultation with the Department of State will be 
through the Assistant Secretary of Defense (International Security 
Affairs).
    (e) Executive Order 12114, implemented by this part prescribes the 
exclusive and complete procedural measures and other actions to be taken 
by the Department of Defense to further the purpose of the National 
Environmental Policy Act with respect to the environment outside the 
United States.

Sec. 187.6  Information requirements.

    The documents to be prepared under Sec. 187.5(d) and Enclosures 1 
and 2, ``Requirements for Environmental Considerations--Global 
Commons,'' and ``Requirements for Environmental Considerations--Foreign 
Nations and Protected Global Resources,'' respectively, are assigned 
Report Control Symbol DD-M(AR) 1327.

[44 FR 21786, Apr. 14, 1979. Redesignated and amended at 56 FR 64481,

   Enclosure 1--Requirements for Environmental Considerations--Global 
                                 Commons

    A. General. This enclosure implements the requirements of Executive 
Order 12114 with respect to major Department of Defense actions that do 
significant harm to the environment of the global commons. The focus is 
not the place of the action, but the location of the environment with 
respect to which there is significant harm. The actions prescribed by 
this enclosure are the exclusive and complete requirement for taking 
account of environmental considerations with respect to Department of 
Defense activities that affect the global commons.
    B. Actions included. The requirements of this enclosure apply only 
to major Federal actions that do significant harm to the environment of 
the global commons.
    C. Environmental Document Requirements--1. General. When an action 
is determined to be a major Federal action that significantly harms the 
environment of the global commons, an environmental impact statement, as 
described below, will be prepared to enable the responsible decision-
making official to be informed of pertinent environmental 
considerations. The statement may be a specific statement for the 
particular action, a generic statement covering the entire class of 
similar actions, or a program statement.
    2. Limitations on Actions. Until the requirements of this enclosure 
have been met with respect to actions involving the global commons, no 
action concerning the proposal may be taken that does significant harm 
to the environment or limits the choice of reasonable alternatives.
    3. Emergencies. Where emergency circumstances make it necessary to 
take an action that does significant harm to the environment without 
meeting the requirements of this enclosure, the DoD component concerned 
shall consult with the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Reserve 
Affairs, and Logistics). This includes actions that must be taken to 
promote the national defense or security and that cannot be delayed, and 
actions necessary for the protection of life or property.
    4. Combining Documents. Environmental documents may be combined with 
other agency documents to reduce duplication. If an environmental impact 
statement for a particular action already exists, regardless of what 
Federal agency prepared it, no new statement is required by this part.
    5. Collective Statements. Consideration should be given to the use 
of generic and program statements. Generic statements may include 
actions with relevant similarities such as common timing, environmental 
effects, alternatives, methods of implementation, or subject matter.
    6. Tiering. Consideration should be given to tiering of 
environmental impact statements to eliminate repetitive discussions of 
the same issue and to focus the issues. Tiering refers to the coverage 
of general matters in broader environmental impact statements, with 
succeeding narrower statements or environmental analyses that 
incorporate by reference the general discussion and concentrate only on 
the issues specific to the statement subsequently prepared.

[[Page 824]]

    7. Lead Agency. When one or more other Federal agencies are involved 
with the Department of Defense in an action or program, a lead agency 
may be designated to supervise the preparation of the environmental 
impact statement. In appropriate cases, more than one agency may act as 
joint lead agencies. The following factors should be considered in 
making the lead agency designation:
    a. The magnitude of agency involvement;
    b. Which agency or agencies have project approval and disapproval 
authority;
    c. The expert capabilities concerning the environmental effects of 
the action;
    d. The duration of agency involvement; and
    e. The sequence of agency involvement.
    8. Categorical Exclusions. The Department of Defense may provide 
categorical exclusions for actions that normally do not, individually or 
cumulatively, do significant harm to the environment. If an action is 
covered by a categorical exclusion no environmental assessment or 
environmental impact statement is required. Categorical exclusions will 
be established by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Reserve 
Affairs, and Logistics) and will be identified in Attachment 1 to this 
enclosure, to be entitled, ``Categorical Exclusions--Global commons. 
``DoD components identifying recurring actions that have been 
determined, after analysis, not to do significant harm to the 
environment should submit recommendations for cateorical exclusions and 
accompanying justification to the Assistant Secretary of Defense 
(Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and Logistics).
    9. Environmental Assessments. The purpose of an environmental 
assessment is to assist DoD components in determining whether an 
environmental impact statement is required for a particular action. The 
assessment should be brief and concise but should include sufficient 
information on which a determination can be made whether the proposed 
action is major and Federal, and whether it significantly harms the 
environment of the global commons. As a minimum, the assessment should 
include consideration of the need for the proposed action and the 
environmental effect of the proposed action. The environmental 
assessment will be made available to the public in the United States 
upon request, but there is no requirement that it be distributed for 
public comment.
    D. Environmental Impact Statements. 1. General. Environmental impact 
statements will be concise and no longer than necessary to permit an 
informed consideration of the environmental effects of the proposed 
action on the global commons and the reasonable alternatives. If an 
action requiring an environmental impact statement also has effects on 
the environment of a foreign nation or on a resource designated as one 
of global importance, the statement need not consider or be prepared 
with respect to these effects. The procedures for considering these 
effects are set out in Enclosure 2, of this part.
    2. Draft Statement. Environmental impact statements will be prepared 
in two stages and may be supplemented. The first, or draft statement, 
should be sufficiently complete to permit meaningful analysis and 
comment. The draft statement will be made available to the public, in 
the United States, for comment. The Department of State, the council on 
environmental Quality, and other interested Federal agencies will be 
informed of the availability of the draft statement and will be afforded 
an opportunity to comment. Contacts with foreign governments are 
discussed in Sec. 187.4(d) and subsection D.11. of this enclosure.
    3. Final statement. Final statements will consider, either 
individually or collectively, substantive comments received on the draft 
statement. The final statement will be made available to the public in 
the United States.
    4. Supplemental statement. Supplements to the draft or final 
statement should be used when substantial changes to the proposed action 
are made relative to the environment of the global commons or when 
significant new information or circumstances, relevant to environmental 
concerns, bears on the proposed action or its environmental effects on 
the global commons. Supplemental statements will be circulated for 
comment as in subsection 2. of this enclosure unless alternative 
procedures are approved by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, 
Reserve Affairs, and Logistics).
    5. Statement content. The statement will include: A section on 
consideration of the purpose of and need for the proposed action; a 
section on the environmental consequences of the proposed action and 
reasonable alternatives; a section that provides a succinct description 
of the environment of the global commons affected by the proposed action 
and reasonable alternatives; and a section that analyzes, in comparative 
form, the environmental effects on the global commons of the proposed 
action and reasonable alternatives.
    6. Incomplete Information. The statement should indicate when 
relevant information is missing due to unavailability or scientific 
uncertainty.
    7. Hearings. Public hearings are not required. consideration should 
be given in appropriate cases to holding or sponsoring public hearings. 
Factors in this consideration include: Foreign relations sensitivities; 
whether the hearings would be an infringement or create the appearance 
of infringement on the sovereign responsibilities of another government; 
requirements of domestic and foreign governmental confidentiality; 
requirements of national security; whether meaningful information could 
be obtained through hearings; time considerations; and

[[Page 825]]

requirements for commercial confidentiality. There is no requirement 
that all factors listed in this section be considered when one or more 
factors indicate that public hearings would not produce a substantial 
net benefit to those responsible for authorizing or approving the 
proposed action.
    8. Decision. Relevant environmental documents developed in 
accordance with this enclosure will accompany the proposal for action 
through the review process to enable officials responsible for 
authorizing or approving the proposed action to be informed and to take 
account of environmental considerations. One means of making an 
appropriate record with respect to this requirement is for the decision-
maker to sign and date a copy of the environmental impact statement 
indicating that it has been considered in the decision-making process. 
Other means of making an appropriate record are also acceptable.
    9. Timing. No decision on the proposed action may be made until the 
later of 90 days after the draft statement has been made available and 
notice thereof published in the Federal Register, or 30 days after the 
final statement has been made available and notice thereof published in 
the Federal Register. The 90-day period and the 30-day period may run 
concurrently. Not less than 45 days may be allowed for public comment. 
The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and 
Logistics) may, upon a showing of probable important adverse effect on 
national security or foreign policy, reduce the 30-day, 45-day, and 90-
day periods.
    10. Classified Information. Environmental assessments and impact 
statements that address classified proposals will be safeguarded and 
classified information will be restricted from public dissemination in 
accordance with Department of Defense procedures (32 CFR part 159) 
established for such information under Executive Order 12065. The 
requirements of that Executive Order take precedence over any 
requirement of disclosure in this part. Only unclassified portions of 
environmental documents may be disseminated to the public.
    11. Foreign Governments. Consideration will be given to whether any 
foreign government should be informed of the availability of 
environmental documents. Communications with foreign governments 
concerning environmental agreements and other formal arrangements with 
foreign governments concerning environmental matters under this part 
will be coordinated with the Department of State. Informal, working-
level communications and arrangements are not included in this 
coordination requirement. Coordination with the Department of State will 
be through the Assistant Secretary of Defense (International Security 
Affairs).

  Enclosure 2--Requirements for Environmental Considerations--Foreign 
                 Nations and Protected Global Resources

    A. General. This enclosure implements the requirements of Executive 
Order 12114 to provide for procedural and other actions to be taken to 
enable officials to be informed of pertinent environmental 
considerations when authorizing or approving certain major Department of 
Defense actions that do significant harm to the environment of a foreign 
nation or to a protected global resource.
    B. Actions included. 1. The requirements of this enclosure apply 
only to the following actions:
    a. Major Federal actions that significantly harm the environment of 
a foreign nation that is not involved in the action. The involvement of 
the foreign nation may be directly by participation with the United 
States in the action, or it may be in conjunction with another 
participating nation. The focus of this category is on the geographical 
location of the environmental harm and not on the location of the 
action.
    b. Major Federal actions that are determined to do significant harm 
to the environment of a foreign nation because they provide to that 
nation: (1) A product, or involve a physical project that produces a 
principal product, emission, or effluent, that is prohibited or strictly 
regulated by Federal law in the United States because its toxic effects 
on the environment create a serious public health risk; or (2) a 
physical project that is prohibited or strictly regulated in the United 
States by Federal law to protect the environment against radioactive 
substances. Included in the category of ``prohibited or strictly 
regulated'' are the following: asbestos, vinyl chloride, acrylonitrile, 
isocyanates, polychlorinated biphenyls, mercury, beryllium, arsenic, 
cadmium, and benzene.
    c. Major Federal actions outside the United States that 
significantly harm natural or ecological resources of global importance 
designated for protection by the President or, in the case of such a 
resource protected by international agreement binding on the United 
States, designated for protection by the Secretary of State. Such 
determinations by the President or the Secretary of State to be listed 
in Attachment 1 to this enclosure, entitled, ``Protected Global 
Resources''.
    2. The actions prescribed by this enclosure are the exclusive and 
complete requirement

[[Page 826]]

for taking account of environmental considerations with respect to 
Federal actions that do significant harm to the environment of foreign 
nations and protected global resources as described in subsection B.1., 
of this enclosure. No action is required under this enclosure with 
respect to Federal actions that affect only the environment of a 
participating or otherwise involved foreign nation and that do not 
involve providing products or physical projects producing principal 
products, emissions, or effluents that are prohibited or strictly 
regulated by Federal law in the United States, or resources of global 
importance that have been designated for protection.
    C. Environmental Document Requirements.
    1. General. a. There are two types of environmental documents 
officials shall use in taking account of environmental considerations 
for actions covered by this enclosure:
    (1) Environmental studies--bilateral or multilateral environmental 
studies, relevant or related to the proposed action, by the United 
States and one or more foreign nations or by an international body or 
organization in which the United States is a member or participant; and
    (2) Environmental reviews--concise reviews of the environmental 
issues involved that are prepared unilaterally by the United States.
    b. This section identifies the procedures for the preparation of 
environmental studies or reviews when required by this enclosure and the 
exceptions from the requirement to prepare environmental studies or 
reviews. If an environmental document already exists for a particular 
action, regardless of what Federal agency prepared it, no new document 
is required by this enclosure.
    2. Lead Agency. When one or more other Federal agencies are involved 
with the Department of Defense in an action or program, a lead agency 
may be designated to supervise the preparation of environmental 
documentation. In appropriate cases, more than one agency may act as 
joint lead agencies. The following factors should be considered in 
making the lead agency designation:
    a. The magnitude of agency involvement;
    b. Which agency or agencies have project approval and disapproval 
authority;
    c. The expert capabilities concerning the environmental effects of 
the action;
    d. The duration of agency involvement; and
    e. The sequence of agency involvement.
    3. Exemptions. There are general exemptions from the requirements of 
this enclosure provided by Executive Order 12114, and the Secretary of 
Defense has the authority to approve additional exemptions.
    a. General Exemptions. The following actions are exempt from the 
procedural and other requirements of this enclosure under general 
exemptions established for all agencies by Executive Order 12114:
    (1) Actions that the DoD component concerned determines do not do 
significant harm to the environment outside the United States or to a 
designated resource of global importance.
    (2) Actions taken by the President. These include: Signing bills 
into law; signing treaties and other international agreements; the 
promulgation of Executive Orders; Presidential proclamations; and the 
issuance of Presidental decisions, instructions, and memoranda. This 
includes actions taken within the Department of Defense to prepare or 
assist in preparing recommendations, advice, or information for the 
President in connection with one of these actions by the President. It 
does not include actions taken within the Department of Defense to 
implement or carry out these instruments and issuances after they are 
promulgated by the President.
    (3) Actions taken by or pursuant to the direction of the President 
or a cabinet officer in the course of armed conflict. The term ``armed 
conflict'' refers to: hostilities for which Congress has declared war or 
enacted a specific authorization for the use of armed forces; 
hostilities or situations for which a report is prescribed by section 
4(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution, 50 U.S.C.A. 1543(a)(1) (Supp. 
1978); and other actions by the armed forces that involve defensive use 
or introduction of weapons in situations where hostilities occur or are 
expected. This exemption applies as long as the armed conflict 
continues.
    (4) Actions taken by or pursuant to the direction of the President 
or a cabinet officer when the national security or national interest is 
involved. The determination that the national security or national 
interest is involved in actions by the Department of Defense must be 
made in writing by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Reserve 
Affairs, and Logistics).
    (5) The activities of the intelligence components utilized by the 
Secretary of Defense under Executive Order 12036, 43 FR 3674 (1978). 
These components include the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National 
Security Agency, the offices for the collection of specialized 
intelligence through reconnaissance programs, the Army Office of the 
Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, the Office of Naval 
Intelligence, and the Air Force Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff 
for Intelligence.
    (6) The decisions and actions of the Office of the Assistant 
Secretary of Defense (International Security Affairs), the Defense 
Security Assistance Agency, and the other responsible offices within DoD 
components with respect to arms transfers to foreign nations. The term 
``arms transfers'' includes the grant, loan, lease, exchange, or sale of

[[Page 827]]

defense articles or defense services to foreign governments or 
international organizations, and the extension or guarantee of credit in 
connection with these transactions.
    (7) Votes and other actions in international conferences and 
organizations. This includes all decisions and actions of the United 
States with respect to representation of its interests at international 
organizations, and at multilateral conferences, negotiations, and 
meetings.
    (8) Disaster and emergency relief actions.
    (9) Actions involving export licenses, export permits, or export 
approvals, other than those relating to nuclear activities. This 
includes: Advice provided by DoD components to the Department of State 
with respect to the issuance of munitions export licenses under section 
38 of the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778 (1976); advice 
provided by DoD components to the Department of Commerce with respect to 
the granting of export licenses under the Export Administration Act of 
1969, 50 U.S.C. App. 2401-2413 (1970 & Supp. V 1975); and direct exports 
by the Department of Defense of defense articles and services to foreign 
governments and international organizations that are exempt from 
munitions export licenses under section 38 of the Arms Export Control 
Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778 (1976). The term ``export approvals'' does not mean 
or include direct loans to finance exports.
    (10) Actions relating to nuclear activities and nuclear material, 
except actions providing to a foreign nation a nuclear production or 
utilization facility, as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended, or a nuclear waste management facility.
    b. Additional Exemptions. The Department of Defense is authorized 
under Executive Order 12114 to establish additional exemptions that 
apply only to the Department's operations. There are two types of 
additional exemptions: Case-by-case and class.
    (1) Case-by-Case Exemptions. Exemptions other than those specified 
above may be required because emergencies, national security 
considerations, exceptional foreign policy requirements, or other 
special circumstances preclude or are inconsistent with the preparation 
of environmental documentation and the taking of other actions 
prescribed by this enclosure. The following procedures apply for 
approving these exemptions:
    (a) Emergencies. This category includes actions that must be taken 
to promote the national defense or security and that cannot be delayed, 
and actions necessary for the protection of life or property. The heads 
of the DoD components are authorized to approve emergency exemptions on 
a case-by-case basis. The Department of Defense is required to consult 
as soon as feasible with the Department of State and the Council on 
Environmental Quality with respect to emergency exemptions. The 
requirement to consult as soon as feasible is not a requirement of prior 
consultation. A report of the emergency action will be made by the DoD 
component head to the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Reserve 
Affairs, and Logistics), who, with the Assistant Secretary of Defense 
(International Security Affairs), shall undertake the necessary 
consultations.
    (b) Other Circumstances. National security considerations, 
exceptional foreign policy requirements, and other special circumstances 
not identified in paragraph C.3.a. of this enclosure, may preclude or be 
inconsistent with the preparation of environmental documentation. In 
these circumstances, the head of the DoD component concerned is 
authorized to exempt a particular action from the environmental 
documentation requirements of this enclosure after obtaining the prior 
approval of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Reserve 
Affairs, and Logistics), who, with the Assistant Secretary of Defense 
(International Security Affairs), shall consult, before approving the 
exemption, with the Department of State and the Council on Environmental 
Quality. The requirement for prior consultation is not a requirement for 
prior approval.
    (2) Class Exemptions. Circumstances may exist where a class 
exemption for a group of related actions is more appropriate than a 
specific exemption. Class exemptions may be established by the Assistant 
Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and Logistics), who, 
with the Assistant Secretary of Defense (International Security 
Affairs), shall consult, before approving the exemption, with the 
Department of State and the Council on Environmental Quality. The 
requirement for prior consultation is not a requirement for prior 
approval. Requests for class exemptions will be submitted by the head of 
the DoD component concerned to the Assistant Secretary of Defense 
(Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and Logistics) after coordination with other 
interested DoD components. Notice of the establishment of a class 
exemption will be issued as Attachment 2 to this enclosure to be 
entitled, ``Class Exemptions--Foreign Nations and Protected Global 
Resources.''
    4. Categorical Exclusions. The Department of Defense is authorized 
by Executive Order 12114 to provide for categorical exclusions. A 
categorical exclusion is a category of actions that normally do not, 
individually or cumulatively, do significant harm to the environment. If 
an action is covered by a categorical exclusion, no environmental 
document is required. Categorical exclusions will be established by the 
Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and 
Logistics), and will be identified in Attachment 3 to this enclosure to 
be entitled, ``Categorical Exclusions--Foreign Nations and Protected 
Global

[[Page 828]]

Resources.'' DoD components identifying recurring actions that have been 
determined, after analysis, not to do significant harm to the 
environment should submit requests for categorical exclusions and 
accompanying justification to the Assistant Secretary of Defense 
(Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and Logistics).
    D. Environmental studies. 1. General. Environmental studies are one 
of two alternative types of documents to be used for actions described 
by section B. of this enclosure.
    a. An environmental study is an analysis of the likely environmental 
consequences of the action that is to be considered by DoD components in 
the decision-making process. It includes a review of the affected 
environment, significant actions taken to avoid environmental harm or 
otherwise to better the environment, and significant environmental 
considerations and actions by the other participating nations, bodies, 
or organizations.
    b. An environmental study is a cooperative action and not a 
unilateral action undertaken by the United States. It may be bilateral 
or multilateral, and it is prepared by the United States in conjunction 
with one or more foreign nations, or by an international body or 
organization in which the United States is a member or participant. The 
environmental study, because it is prepared as a cooperative 
undertaking, may be best suited for use with respect to actions that 
provide strictly regulated or prohibited products or projects to a 
foreign nation (B.l.b.) and actions that affect a protected global 
resource (B.l.c.).
    2. Department of State Coordination. Communications with foreign 
governments concerning environmental studies and other formal 
arrangements with foreign governments concerning environmental matters 
under this directive will be coordinated with the Department of State. 
Informal, working-level communications and arrangements are not included 
in this coordination requirement. Coordination with the Department of 
State will be through the Assistant Secretary of Defense (International 
Security Affairs).
    3. Whether to Prepare an Environmental Study. The judgment whether 
the action is one that would do significant harm to one of the 
environments covered by this enclosure normally will be made in 
consultation with concerned foreign governments or organizations. If a 
negative decision is made, the file will be documented with a record of 
that decision and the decision-makers who participated. If a decision is 
made to prepare a study then, except as provided by this enclosure, no 
action concerning the proposal may be taken that would do significant 
harm to the environment until the study has been completed and the 
results considered.
    4. Content of the Study. The document is a study of the 
environmental aspects of the proposed action to be considered in the 
decision-making process. The precise content of each study must be 
flexible because of such considerations as the sensitivity of obtaining 
information from foreign governments, the availability of useful and 
understandable information, and other factors identified under 
``Limitations,'' (subsection D.6., of this enclosure). The study should, 
however, include consideration of the following:
    a. A general review of the affected environment;
    b. The predicted effect of the action on the environment;
    c. Significant known actions taken by governmental entities with 
respect to the proposed action to protect or improve the environment; 
and
    d. If no actions are being taken to protect or enhance the 
environment, whether the decision not to do so was made by the affected 
foreign government or international organization.
    5. Distribution of the Study. Except as provided under 
``Limitations,'' (subsection D.6., of this enclosure), and except where 
classified information is involved, environmental studies will be made 
available to the Department of State, the Council on Environmental 
Quality, other interested Federal agencies, and, on request, to the 
public in the United States. Interested foreign governments also may be 
informed of the studies, subject to the ``Limitations'' (subsection 
D.6., of this enclosure) and controls on classified information, and 
furnished copies of the documents. No distribution is required prior to 
the preparation of the final version of the study or prior to taking the 
action that caused the study to be prepared.
    6. Limitations. The requirements with respect to the preparation, 
content, and distribution of environmental studies in the international 
context must remain flexible. The specific procedures must be determined 
on a case-by-case basis and may be modified where necessary to:
    a. Enable the component to act promptly. Considerations such as 
national security and foreign government involvement may require prompt 
action that must take precedence in the environmental review process;
    b. Avoid adverse impacts on relations between the United States and 
foreign governments and international organizations;
    c. Avoid infringement or the appearance of infringement on the 
sovereign responsibilities of another government. The collection of 
information and the preparation and distribution of environmental 
documentation for actions in which another nation is involved, or with 
respect to the environment and resources of another nation, unless done 
with proper regard to the sovereign authority of that nation, may be 
viewed by that nation as an interference in its internal affairs

[[Page 829]]

and its responsibility to evaluate requirements with respect to the 
environment;
    d. Ensure consideration of:
    (1) Requirements of governmental confidentiality. This refers to the 
need to protect sensitive foreign affairs information and information 
received from another government with the understanding that it will be 
protected from disclosure regardless of its classification;
    (2) National security requirements. This refers to the protection of 
classified information and other national security interests;
    (3) Availability of meaningful information. Information on the 
environment of foreign nations may be unavailable, incomplete, or not 
susceptible to meaningful evaluation, particularly where the affected 
foreign nation is not a participant in the analysis. This may reduce or 
change substantially the normal content of the environmental study;
    (4) The extent of the participation of the DoD component concerned 
and its ability to affect the decision made. The utility of the 
environmental analysis and the need for an in-depth review diminishes as 
DoD's role and control over the decision lessens; and
    (5) International commercial, commercial confidentiality, 
competitive, and export promotion factors. This refers to the 
requirement to protect domestic and foreign trade secrets and 
confidential business information from disclosure. Export promotion 
factors includes the concept of not unnecessarily hindering United 
States exports.
    7. Classified Information. Classified information will be 
safeguarded from disclosure in accordance with the Department of Defense 
procedures (32 CFR 159) established for such information under Executive 
Order 12065. The requirements of that Executive Order take precedence 
over any requirement of disclosure in this directive.
    E. Environmental Reviews. 1. General. Environmental reviews are the 
second of the two alternative types of documents to be used for actions 
covered by section B. of this enclosure.
    a. An environmental review is a survey of the important 
environmental issues involved. It includes identification of these 
issues, and a review of what if any consideration has been or can be 
given to the environmental aspects by the United States and by any 
foreign government involved in taking the action.
    b. An environmental review is prepared by the DoD component 
concerned either unilaterally or in conjunction with another Federal 
agency. While an environmental review may be used for any of the actions 
identified by section B., it may be uniquely suitable, because it is 
prepared unilaterally by the United States, to actions that affect the 
environment of a nation not involved in the undertaking (B.l.a.).
    2. Department of State Coordination. Communications with foreign 
governments concerning environmental agreements and other formal 
arrangements with foreign governments concerning environmental matters 
under this enclosure will be coordinated with the Department of State. 
Informal working-level communications and arrangements are not included 
in this coordination requirement. Coordination with the Department of 
State will be through the Assistant Secretary of Defense (International 
Security Affairs).
    3. Whether to Prepare an Environmental Review. Sufficient 
information will be gathered, to the extent it is reasonably available, 
to permit an informed judgment as to whether the proposed action would 
do significant harm to the environments covered by this enclosure. If a 
negative decision is made, a record will be made of that decision and 
its basis. If a decision is made to prepare a review, then, except as 
provided by this enclosure, no action concerning the proposal may be 
taken that would do significant environmental harm until the review has 
been completed.
    4. Content of the Review. An environmental review is a survey of the 
important environmental issues associated with the proposed action that 
is to be considered by the DoD component concerned in the decision-
making process. It does not include all possible environmental issues 
and it does not include the detailed evaluation required in an 
environmental impact statement under Enclosure 1 of this part. There is 
no foreign government or international organization participation in its 
preparation, and the content therefore may be circumscribed because of 
the availability of information and because of foreign relations 
sensitivities. Other factors affecting the content are identified under 
``Limitations,'' (subsection E.6., of this enclosure). To the extent 
reasonably practical the review should include consideration of the 
following:
    a. A statement of the action to be taken including its timetable, 
physical features, general operating plan, and other similar broad-guage 
descriptive factors;
    b. Identification of the important environmental issues involved;
    c. The aspects of the actions taken or to be taken by the DoD 
component that ameliorate or minimize the impact on the environment; and
    d. The actions known to have been taken or to be planned by the 
government of any participating and affected foreign nations that will 
affect environmental considerations.
    5. Distribution. Except as provided under ``Limitations,'' 
(subsection E.6., of this enclosure), and except where classified 
information is involved, environmental reviews will be made available to 
the Department of

[[Page 830]]

State, the Council on Environmental Quality, other interested Federal 
agencies, and, on request, to the public in the United States. 
Interested foreign governments also may be informed of the reviews and, 
subject to the ``Limitations'' (subsection E.6., of this enclosure) and 
controls on classified information, will be furnished copies of the 
documents on request. This provision for document distribution is not a 
requirement that distribution be made prior to taking the action that is 
the subject of the review.
    6. Limitations. The requirements with respect to the preparation, 
content, and distribution of environmental reviews in the international 
context must remain flexible. The specific procedures must be determined 
on a case-by-case basis and may be modified where necessary to:
    a. Enable the component to act promptly. Considerations such as 
national security and foreign government involvement may require prompt 
action that must take precedence in the environmental review process;
    b. Avoid adverse impacts on relations between the United States and 
foreign governments and international organizations;
    c. Avoid infringement or the appearance of infringement on the 
sovereign responsibilities of another government. The collection of 
information and the preparation and distribution of environmental 
documentation for actions in which another nation is involved or with 
respect to the environment and resources of another nation, unless done 
with proper regard to the sovereign authority of that nation, may be 
viewed by that nation as an interference in its internal affairs and its 
prerogative to evaluate requirements with respect to the environment; 
and
    d. Ensure consideration of:
    (1) Requirements of governmental confidentiality. This refers to the 
need to protect sensitive foreign affairs information and information 
received from another government with the understanding that it will be 
protected from disclosure regardless of its classification;
    (2) National security requirements. This refers to the protection of 
classified information;
    (3) Availability of meaningful information. Information on the 
environment of foreign nations may be unavailable, incomplete, or not 
susceptable to meaningful evaluation, and this may reduce or change 
substantially the normal content of the environmental review;
    (4) The extent of the participation of the DoD component concerned 
and its ability to affect the decision made. The utility of the 
environmental analysis and the need for an in-depth review diminishes as 
the role of the Department of Defense and control over the decision 
lessens; and
    (5) International commercial, commercial confidentiality, 
competitive, and export promotion factors. This refers to the 
requirements to protect domestic and foreign trade secrets and 
confidential business information from disclosure. Export promotion 
factors includes the concept of not unnecessarily hindering United 
States exports.
    7. Classified Information. Classified information will be 
safeguarded from disclosure in accordance with the DoD procedures (32 
CFR 159) established for such information under Executive Order 12065. 
The requirements of that Executive Order take precedence over any 
requirement of disclosure in this part.

<R05>
Sec. 190.4  Policy.

    (a) The Department of Defense shall act responsibly in the public 
interest in managing its lands and natural resources. There shall be a 
conscious and active concern for the inherent value of natural resources 
in all DoD plans, actions, and programs.
    (b) Natural resources under control of the Department of Defense 
shall be managed to support the military mission, while practicing the 
principles of multiple use and sustained yield, using scientific methods 
and an interdisciplinary approach. The conservation of natural resources 
and the military mission need not and shall not be mutually exclusive.
    (c) Watersheds and natural landscapes, soils, forests, fish and 
wildlife, and protected species shall be conserved and managed as vital 
elements of DoD's natural resources program.
    (d) DoD actions that affect natural resources in the United States 
shall comply with the policy and requirements of 32 CFR part 188 and the 
more stringent of applicable Federal or local laws. DoD actions that 
influence natural resources in foreign countries or global commons shall 
conform to requirements of 32 CFR part 187 applicable laws, treaties, 
and agreements.
    (e) Integrated natural resources management plans that incorporate 
applicable provisions of the Appendix to this part shall be maintained 
for DoD lands.
    (f) DoD decisionmakers and commanders shall keep informed of the 
conditions of natural resources, the objectives of natural resources 
management plans, and potential or actual conflicts between DoD actions 
and management plans and the policies and procedures herein.
    (g) DoD lands shall be available to the public and DoD employees for 
enjoyment and use of natural resources, except when a specific 
determination has been made that a military mission prevents such access 
for safety or security reasons or that the natural resources will not 
support such usage. The determination shall be addressed in the 
applicable natural resources management plan. To assist in the 
management, study, or monitoring of natural resources, Federal, State 
and local officials and natural resources management professionals shall 
be permitted access to natural resources after proper safety and 
security measures are taken.
    (h) The management and conservation of natural resources under DoD 
stewardship is an inherently governmental function. Therefore, 32 CFR 
part 169 does not apply to the management, implementation, planning, or 
enforcement of DoD natural resources programs. However, support to the 
natural resources program when it is severable from management of 
natural resources may be subject to 32 CFR part 169.
    (i) If natural resources under DoD control are damaged by a 
hazardous substance released by another party, that party is potentially 
liable. The funds recovered by the Department of Defense as a result of 
natural resources damage claims shall be used for restoration, 
replacement, or acquisition of equivalent natural resources.
    (j) Enforcement of laws primarily aimed at protecting natural 
resources and recreation activities that depend on natural resources is 
an integral part of a natural resources progam and shall be coordinated 
with or under the direction of the natural resources manager for the 
affected area.

Sec. 190.7  Information requirements.

    Information requirements of the ASD(P&L) shall be met by the Heads 
of the Military Services each year by January 15 under Report Control 
Symbol DD-P&L(A)1485.

      Appendix to Part 190--Integrated Natural Resources Management

                         A. Integrated Planning

    1. Integrated natural resources management plans shall be maintained 
for properties under DoD control. These plans shall guide planners and 
implementors of mission activities as well as natural resources 
managers.
    2. The plans shall be coordinated with appropriate Federal, State, 
and local officials with interest or jurisdiction in accordance with 32 
CFR part 243 and with planners of DoD activities that impact on the 
natural resources. Conversely, new and continuing mission activities 
that impact on natural resources shall be coordinated with appropriate 
natural resources managers.
    3. Natural resources management plans shall be continually 
monitored, reviewed annually, and revised by DoD natural resources 
management professionals. They shall be approved in accordance with DoD 
Components' procedures at least every 5 years.
    4. The natural resources management planning process shall invite 
public participation.
    5. An integrated natural resources management plan shall meet the 
following criteria:
    a. Natural resources and areas of critical or special concern are 
adequately addressed from both technical and policy standpoints.
    b. The natural resources management methodologies shall sustain the 
capabilities of the natural resources to support military requirements.
    c. The plan includes current inventories and conditions of natural 
resources; goals; management methods; schedules of activities and 
projects; priorities; responsibilties of installation planners and 
decisionmakers; monitoring systems; protection and enforcement systems; 
and land use restrictions, limitations, and capabilities.
    d. Each plan segment or component (i.e., land, forest, fish and 
wildlife, and outdoor recreation) exhibits compatible methodologies and 
goals.
    e. The plan is compatible with the installation's master plan and 
pest management program under DoD Directive 4150.7.\1\

    \1\ Copies may be obtained, at cost, from the National Technical 
Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    6. A determination that the public may not have access to use 
natural resources under DoD control shall be included and explained in 
the applicable integrated natural resources management plan.
    7. The environmental impact analysis for any proposed activity or 
project shall include an analysis of the compatibility of the proposal's 
impacts with affected natural resources management plans and objectives. 
Only after necessary revisions to management plans are made shall the 
new activity begin.
    8. The planning requirements of DoD Directive 4710.1 \2\ may be met 
within the integrated natural resources plan.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ See footnote 2 to paragraph A.5.e.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    9. Integrated natural resources management plans shall be a primary 
consideration during the master planning process and for land use and 
development decisions.

                  B. Natural Resources Management Plan

    The integrated natural resources plan shall implement the following 
policies and requirements for each applicable program area:

                           1. Land Management

    a. DoD lands shall be managed to support military activities, 
improve the quality of land and water resources, protect wetlands and 
floodplains and their functions, abate nonpoint sources of water 
pollution, conserve lands suitable for agriculture, control noxious 
weeds, and control erosion.
    b. Costs for maintaining grounds shall be minimized by providing the 
least amount of mowed areas and special plantings necessary to 
accomplish management objectives and by the use of low maintenance 
species, agricultural outleases, wildlife habitat, and tree plantings.
    c. Land management is an important use of appropriated funds. Also, 
pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2667(d) revenues from the agriculture and grazing 
outlease program are available for:
    (1) Administrative expenses of agricultural leases.
    (2) Initiation, improvement, and perpetuation of agricultural 
outleases.
    (3) Preparation and revisions of natural resources management plans.
    (4) Implementation of integrated natural resources management plans.
    d. When appropriate, land management plans shall address soils, 
water resources, soil and water conservation, wetlands and

[[Page 835]]

floodplains, grounds maintenance, landscaping, agricultural uses and 
potential, fire management, rangeland conditions and trends, areas of 
special interest, and management for multiple use.
    e. Soil capabilities, water management, landscaping, erosion 
control, and conservation of natural resources shall be included in all 
site feasibility studies and in project planning, design, and 
construction. Appropriate conservation work and associated costs shall 
be included in project proposals and construction contracts and 
specifications. Such studies and work shall be coordinated with 
appropriate natural resources management professionals and plans.
    f. Irrigation shall be limited to areas where it is essential to 
establish and maintain required vegetation or when an agricultural 
outlease contract allows it.
    g. Appropriate natural resources conservation measures shall be 
included in outlease provisions.
    h. Landscaping shall be functional in nature, simple and informal in 
design, compatible with adjacent surroundings, and complimentary to the 
overall natural setting of the area.
    i. Land conditions, soil capability, and erosion status shall be 
monitored for all lands subject to disturbance (e.g., maneuver areas, 
commercial forest areas, and agricultural outleased areas). The data and 
analyses obtained shall be used in planning, environmental analyses, and 
decisionmaking at all levels of command.

                          2. Forest Management

    a. DoD forest lands shall be managed for sustained yield of quality 
forest products, watershed protection, wildlife habitat, and other uses 
that can be made compatible with mission activities.
    b. Commercial forestry activities shall be commensurate with 
potential financial returns.
    c. Forest products shall not be given away, abandoned, carelessly 
destroyed, used to offset costs of contracts, or traded for products, 
supplies, or services. Forest products may be used for military 
training. Individuals may be allowed to collect noncommercial or edible 
forest products if that use is addressed in the management plan for the 
areas involved. Forest products may be harvested to generate electricity 
or heat only if the Military Department's forestry account is paid fair 
market value.
    d. Planned forest products sales shall continue on land reported as 
excess until actual disposal or transfer occurs. When forested areas are 
slated to be public parks or used for outdoor recreation, clearcutting 
is prohibited. However, thinning, intermediate cuttings, and salvage 
cuttings shall be accomplished if the management plan calls for such 
activity within the next 5 years. That portion of the proceeds from 
sales of land that is attributable to the value of standing timber on 
the land sold shall be deposited in the Military Department's forestry 
account.
    e. Accounting and reporting for the proceeds and costs of the 
commercial forestry program are contained in DoD Instruction 7310.5.\3\ 
Costs associated with management of all forested areas (noncommercial 
and commercial) are valid uses of appropriated funds as well as proceeds 
from agricultural outleases and forest product sales.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See footnote 2 to paragraph A.5.e.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    f. When appropriate, natural resources management plans shall 
include current forest inventories, conditions, trends, and potential 
uses; analysis of soil data for forest potential; goals; protection and 
enforcement methods; maintenance of forested areas and access roads; 
improvement methods; harvesting and reforestation methods and schedules; 
and management for multiple use.

                     3. Fish and Wildlife Management

    a. Lands and waters suitable for management of fish and wildlife 
resources shall be managed to conserve wildlife resources for the 
benefit of the public. Nongame as well as game species shall be 
considered when planning activities.
    b. Endangered and threatened species and their habitats shall be 
protected and managed according to the Endangered Species Act and 
implementing U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) regulations and 
agreements. Management plans for installations with endangered species 
shall include:
    (1) Coordinated protection and mitigation measures.
    (2) Appropriate affirmative methods and procedures necessary to 
enhance the population of endangered species.
    (3) Procedures and responsibilities for consulting with the FWS 
prior to funding or conducting any action likely to affect a listed 
species or its critical habitat.
    c. The Sikes Act provides a mechanism whereby the Departments of 
Defense and the Interior and host States cooperate to plan, maintain, 
and manage fish and wildlife on military installations. Agreement by all 
3 parties regarding the fish and wildlife management plan for an 
installation makes that plan a cooperative plan pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 
670 et seq. A cooperative plan shall be adopted by an installation 
commander only after ensuring its compatibility with the rest of the 
integrated natural resources management plan.
    d. Hunting, fishing, and trapping may be permitted within the 
carrying capacity of wildlife habitats. Harvesting of wildlife from DoD 
installations or facilities shall be done according to the fish and game 
laws of the State or territory in which it is located and

[[Page 836]]

under 10 U.S.C. 2671. Special permits shall be issued, in addition to 
required State and Federal permits or licenses, for fishing, hunting, or 
trapping on DoD property.
    e. Hunting, fishing, and trapping fees may be collected under the 
authority of the Sikes Act to recover expenses of implementing a 
cooperation plan. The same Sikes Act fee shall be charged for a 
particular use to all users at a particular installation except senior 
citizens, children, and the physically handicapped. Exceptions to this 
policy may be granted by the Heads of Military Services. Additional 
recreation fees may be collected under policies in DoD Directive 1015.6 
\4\ and DoD Instruction 1015.2.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See footnote 2 to paragraph A.5.e.
    \5\ See footnote 2 to paragraph A.5.e.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    f. Criteria and procedures for hunting, fishing, and trapping 
permits and fees shall be included in management plans. Fees collected 
under the authority of 16 U.S.C. 670 et seq. shall be used only to 
defray the costs of the fish and wildlife management program at the 
installation collecting the fees. Collected fees shall be accounted for 
and reported according to instructions from the Comptroller, Department 
of Defense (C, DoD), under a special fund entitled ``Wildlife 
Conservation''--X5095. Unobligated balances shall be accumulated with 
current fee collections, and the total amount accumulated at an 
installation shall be available for obligation as apportioned by the 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
    g. Whenever hunting, fishing, or trapping is allowed on DoD 
installations, enforcement of wildlife laws shall be addressed in the 
fish and wildlife management plan and carried out by trained enforcement 
officials under the direction of or in coordination with the wildlife 
manager.
    h. The suitability of a military installation for fish and wildlife 
management shall be determined after consulting with the FWS and host 
State. Each installation shall be classified as one of the following:
    (1) Category I--Installations with land and water resources suitable 
for fish and wildlife conservation. Each Category I installation shall 
maintain a wildlife management plan according to this part.
    (2) Category II--Installations that lack adequate land and water 
resources for feasible fish and wildlife conservation.
    i. The number of users of fish and wildlife resources may be limited 
on a daily or seasonal basis. Membership in an organization, including 
rod and gun clubs, shall not be a prerequisite for or get priority in 
receiving permits.
    j. Habitat management is the basic means of improving wildlife 
resources. Introduction and reintroduction of species shall occur only 
in coordination with appropriate agencies and in accordance with a 
cooperative plan. When predator or animal damage control is a necessary 
part of natural resources management or mission performance, it shall be 
accomplished according to the cooperative plan, relevant laws and 
regulations, and in coordination with adjoining land managers.
    k. Fish and wildlife conservation shall be considered in all site 
feasibility studies and project planning, design, and construction. 
Appropriate conservation work and associated funding shall be included 
in project proposals and construction contracts and specifications.
    l. Priority shall be given to entering into contracts for services 
that implement wildlife management or enforce wildlife laws with Federal 
and State Agencies with responsibility for wildlife conservation.
    m. Where appropriate, natural resources management plans shall 
address habitat management and enhancement, current wildlife and fish 
inventories and population trends, endangered and other special species 
management, game and nongame species management, access policy and user 
program, administration of user fee program, law enforcement, 
cooperating agencies' responsibilities, and multiple use management.

                          4. Outdoor Recreation

    a. Whenever practicable, DoD lands with suitable resources shall be 
managed to conserve and use natural resources for the outdoor recreation 
opportunities of present and future generations. The policies and 
procedures herein apply to outdoor recreation programs as defined in 
Sec. 190.3 and supersedes those in DoD Directive 1015.6 and DoD 
Instruction 1015.2.
    b. Conservation of outdoor recreation resources shall be considered 
in all plans, programs, site feasibility studies, and project planning 
and design.
    c. Installations having resources suitable for outdoor recreation 
other than hunting, fishing, and trapping are encouraged to develop 
cooperative agreements or plans with other Federal Agencies and 
appropriate State Agencies to facilitate the development and management 
of those programs.
    d. Public access to DoD properties for outdoor recreation shall be 
allowed whenever compatible with public safety and mission activities. 
User fees may be collected to recover expenses of managing natural 
resources for outdoor recreation, and access quotas may be established 
to reflect the carrying capacity of the areas involved. Public outdoor 
recreation opportunities shall be equitably distributed by impartial 
procedures, such as a first-come, first-served basis or by drawing lots. 
When public access must be

[[Page 837]]

withheld, that determination shall be explained in the natural resources 
management plan.
    e. Off-road vehicle use shall be managed to protect natural 
resources, promote safety, and avoid conflicts with other uses of DoD 
properties. Use of off-road vehicles shall be monitored and evaluated 
regularly by natural resources management professionals. All land and 
water areas shall be closed to such use unless an environmental impact 
analysis in accordance with 32 CFR part 188 has been completed and the 
use is specifically approved and regulated. Specific areas that shall 
not be used by recreational off-road vehicles are those:
    (1) Restricted for security or safety purposes.
    (2) Containing fragile geological and soil conditions, flora or 
fauna, or other natural characteristics.
    (3) With significant archeological, historical, paleontological 
resources.
    (4) Designated as wilderness or scenic areas.
    (5) Where noise would adversely affect other users, wildlife, or 
adjacent communities.
    f. Whenever appropriate, outdoor recreation plans shall address 
inventories, trends, and management of resources suitable for outdoor 
recreation; aesthetics; development of opportunities and potential uses; 
potential user groups and access policy; user fee program; user ethics 
programs; and multiple use management.

                            5. Special Areas

    Areas on DoD installations that contain natural resources that 
warrant special conservation efforts shall be identified. After 
appropriate study and coordination, such areas may be designated as 
Special Interest Areas. Upon such designation, the integrated natural 
resources management plan for the installation shall address the special 
management necessary for the area.
