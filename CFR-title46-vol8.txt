                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2009), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in eleven separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, Washington DC 20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities 
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an 
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in 
this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

<R05>
Sec. 201.72  Notice.

    Notice of any matter which may result in or involves the institution 
of a formal proceeding will be given by publication in the Federal

[[Page 14]]

allow for an opportunity to file petitions for leave to intervene.


<R05>
Sec. 201.73  Joinder of proceedings.

    (a) Two or more matters which have been set for hearing by the

be ordered upon petition of any party to said hearing or upon the 
initiative of the Administration.
    (b) A petition to consolidate shall be filed not later than the 
first prehearing conference in the proceeding with which consolidation 
is requested, and shall relate only to then pending applications. If 
made at such conference, the petition may be oral. A petition which is 
not timely filed shall be dismissed unless the petitioner shall clearly 
show good cause for the failure to file said petition on time. A 
petition which does not relate to an application pending at the time of 
or before a prehearing conference in a proceeding with which 
consolidation is requested, shall likewise be dismissed unless the 
petitioner shall clearly show good cause for a failure to file the 
application within the prescribed period.


<R05>
Sec. 201.74  Declaratory orders.

    Amendments or supplements to any pleading will be allowed or refused 
in the discretion of the Administration if the case has not been 
assigned for hearing, otherwise in the discretion of the presiding 
officer designated to conduct the hearing; Provided, That after a 
prehearing conference has been held no amendment shall be allowed which 
would substantially broaden the issues, unless an opportunity is 
afforded all parties to answer such amended pleadings and to prepare for 
hearing upon the broadened issues. The presiding officer may direct a 
party to state its case more fully and in more detail by way of 
amendment. If a response to an amended pleading is necessary, it may be 
filed and served. Amendments or supplements allowed prior to hearing 
will be served in the same manner as the original pleading. Whenever by 
the regulations in this part a pleading is required to be subscribed, 
the amendment or supplement shall also be subscribed.


<R05>
Sec. 201.78  Petition for leave to intervene.

    A petition for leave to intervene may be filed in any proceeding 
before the Administration. The petition will be granted by the presiding 
officer if the proposed intervenor establishes that it has a substantial 
interest in the proceeding and will not unduly broaden the issues 
therein or unduly delay the proceeding. All such petitions shall be 
filed prior to the opening of the prehearing conference, or if none is 
held, before the commencement of hearing, unless petitioner shows good 
cause for allowing the petition at a later time. Intervention petitions 
shall be served in the same manner as other petitions, and shall be 
subject to answer. Intervention petitions will be granted where

[[Page 15]]

necessary to protect substantial interests of the petitioner and where 
intervention will not materially broaden the issues. A person granted 
permission to intervene becomes a party to the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 201.79  Motions.

    All motions and requests for rulings shall state the relief sought, 
the authority relied upon, and the facts alleged. If made before or 
after the hearing, such motions shall be in writing. If made at the 
hearing, they may be stated orally: Provided, however, That the 
presiding officer may require that such motion be reduced to writing and 
filed and served in the same manner as a formal motion. Answers to 
formal motions shall comply with the requirements of Sec. 201.80. 
Motions and answers thereto shall be addressed to the presiding officer 
if the case is pending before such officer. Oral argument upon a written 
motion in which an answer has been filed may be granted within the 
discretion of the Administration or the presiding officer, as the case 
may be. A repetitious motion will not be entertained.


<R05>
Sec. 201.80  Answers to applications, petitions, or motions.

    A pleading filed in response to an application, petition, or motion 
is called an answer. An answer may be filed to any application, 
petition, motion or pleading which is required to be served on the 
answering party or noticed in the Federal Register. An answer to a 
written application, petition, or motion shall be in writing and shall 
be filed within ten days after service of the pleading which it answers.

<R05>
Sec. 201.102  Prehearing rulings.

    The presiding officer will, where practicable, issue prehearing

issues, summarizing the rulings made at the conference, specifying a 
schedule for the exchange of exhibits and written testimony, the date, 
time and place of hearing and specifying a time for the filing of 
exceptions to the rulings. The prehearing rulings shall be served upon 
all parties to the proceeding and any persons who participated in the 
conference. Exceptions to the prehearing rulings may be filed by any 
such party or person within the time specified therein. The presiding 
officer may serve amended rulings in the light of the exceptions 
presented. Such rulings and amendments, if any, shall constitute the 
official account of the conference and shall control the subsequent 
course of the proceeding, but they may be reconsidered and modified at 
any time to protect the public interest or to prevent injustice.


<R05>
Sec. 201.103  Opportunity for agreement of parties and settlement of case.

permit, all interested parties shall have the opportunity for submission 
to and consideration by the presiding officer of offers of settlement, 
or proposals of adjustment together with facts and/or arguments relevant 
to such offers or proposals without prejudice to the rights of the 
parties. The presiding officer need not be present at any negotiations 
of such nature. The presiding officer shall issue an initial or 
recommended decision thereon recommending approval or disapproval of 
such offer of settlement or proposal of adjustment to the Administration 
for final action thereon. No agreement, offer, or proposal shall be 
admissible in evidence over the objection of any party in any hearing on 
the matter. When any settlement does not dispose of the whole 
proceeding, the remaining issues shall be determined in accordance with 
sections 7 and 8 of the Administrative Procedure Act.


<R04>
              Subpart K_Discovery and Depositions (Rule 11)

constitute or contain evidence relating to any matter, not privileged, 
which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending 
proceeding, and which

[[Page 18]]

are in his possession, custody or control. The order shall specify the 
time, place, and manner of making the inspection and taking the copies 
and photographs and may prescribe such terms and conditions as are just.

and served upon all parties to a formal proceeding. Such exhibits may 
also, upon request of any party, be offered in evidence at a hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 201.110  Depositions: request for orders to take; time of filing.

    The Administration or presiding officer may, upon proper request of 
a party to a proceeding or under circumstances deemed proper, issue an 
order to take a deposition regarding any matter, not privileged, which 
is relevant to the subject matter involved in the proceedings. A motion 
to take a deposition shall be filed not less than fifteen (15) days 
before the proposed date for taking the deposition, unless a shorter 
period is fixed under Sec. 201.54, and shall set forth the reason for 
the deposition, the place and time of taking, the officer before whom it 
is to be taken, the name and address of each witness to be examined, if 
known, and, if the name is not known, a general description sufficient 
to identify him or the particular class or group to which he belongs, 
and whether the deposition is to be based upon written interrogatories 
or upon oral examination. If the deposition is to be based upon oral 
examination, the motion shall contain a statement of the matters 
concerning which each witness will testify. If the deposition is to be 
based on written interrogatories, the motion shall be accompanied by the 
interrogatories to be propounded, serially numbered. Copies of all 
motions to take depositions, and accompanying interrogatories, if any, 
shall conform to the requirements of subpart D of this part. Objection 
to the taking of such depositions may be made in an answer to such 
motion. Without prejudice to objection, the answer may also state 
objection to any individual interrogatory, and if the deposition is 
permitted, the presiding officer will rule upon such objections to 
interrogatories. A party served with an order to take a deposition on 
written interrogatories shall have ten (10) days after date of service 
of such order unless a shorter period is fixed under Sec. 201.54, 
within which to file and serve written cross interrogatories, which 
shall be served pursuant to subpart D of this part. Answers to 
applications for cross interrogatories may be filed in accordance with 
Sec. 201.80. Upon the issuance of an order by the Administration or the 
presiding officer for the taking of a deposition, the Docket Clerk shall 
mail a copy thereof to all parties, including the party who requested 
the deposition. An application to take a deposition in a foreign country 
will be entertained when necessary or convenient, and authority to take 
such deposition will be granted upon such notice and other terms and 
directions as are lawful and appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 201.111  Contents of order.

    The order issued authorizing the taking of a deposition will state 
the name and address of each witness or a general description sufficient 
to identify him or the particular class or group to which he belongs, 
the matters concerning which the witness may be questioned, the place 
where, the time when, and the officer before whom the deposition is to 
be taken, any or all of which may or may not be the same as set forth in 
the motion filed. If the deposition is to be taken upon written 
interrogatories, a list of the interrogatories will accompany the order.


<R05>
Sec. 201.112  Record of examination; oath; objections.

    The officer before whom the deposition is to be taken shall put the 
witness under oath and shall personally, or by someone acting under his 
direction and in his presence, record the testimony of the witness. The 
testimony shall be taken stenographically, shall be translated to 
English, if necessary, and shall be transcribed unless the parties agree 
otherwise. All objections made at the time of the examination to the 
qualifications of the officer taking the deposition, or to the manner of 
taking it, or to the evidence presented, or to the conduct of any party, 
and any other objections to the proceedings, shall be noted by the 
officer upon the

[[Page 19]]

deposition. Any party served with a notice to take an oral deposition 
may cross-examine a witness whose testimony is taken under such 
deposition. In lieu of cross-examination, parties served with notice of 
taking a deposition may transmit written interrogatories or cross-
interrogatories to the officer taking the deposition, who shall propound 
them to the witness and record the answers verbatim together with any 
objections interposed thereto by adverse parties.


<R05>
Sec. 201.113  Submission to witness, changes, signing.

    When the testimony is fully transcribed the deposition of each 
witness shall be submitted to him for examination and shall be read to 
or by him. Any changes in form or substance which the witness desires to 
make shall be entered upon the deposition by the officer with a 
statement of the reasons given by the witness for making them. The 
deposition shall then be signed by the witness, unless the parties by 
stipulation waive the signing or the witness is ill or cannot be found 
or refuses to sign. If the deposition is not signed by the witness, the 
officer shall sign it and state on the record the fact of the waiver or 
of the illness or absence of the witness or the fact of the refusal to 
sign, together with the reason, if any, given therefor; and the 
deposition may then be used as fully as though signed, unless upon 
objection the presiding officer holds that the reasons given for the 
refusal to sign require rejection of the deposition in whole or in part.


<R05>
Sec. 201.114  Certification and filing by officer; copies.

    The officer taking the deposition shall certify on the deposition 
that the witness was duly sworn by him and that the deposition is a true 
record of the testimony given by the witness, and that said officer is 
not of counsel or attorney to either of the parties and is not directly 
or indirectly interested in the outcome of the proceeding or 
investigation. He shall then securely seal the deposition in an envelope 
endorsed with the title of the proceeding and marked ``Deposition of 
(here insert name of witness)'', and shall promptly send the original 
and two copies thereof, together with the original and two copies of all 
exhibits, by registered mail to the Administration. Parties shall make 
their own arrangements with the officer taking the deposition for copies 
of the testimony and exhibits.


<R05>
Sec. 201.115  Waiver of objections and admissibility.

    Objections to the form of question and answer shall be made before 
the officer taking the deposition by parties or representatives present, 
and if not so made, shall be deemed waived. Depositions shall, when 
offered at the hearing, be subject to proper legal objections.

<R05>
Sec. 201.118  Witness fees; expenses of taking depositions.

    Witnesses whose depositions are taken pursuant to the regulations in 
this part, and the officer taking such deposition, shall severally be 
entitled to the same fees and mileage as are paid in the courts of the 
United States. All expenses of taking such depositions shall be paid by 
the party at whose instance the deposition is taken.

presiding officer. Such application need not be served upon all parties. 
All such applications, whether written or oral, shall contain a 
statement or showing of general relevance and reasonable scope of the 
evidence sought and shall be accompanied by an original and two copies 
of the subpoena sought which shall describe the documentary or tangible 
evidence to be subpoenaed with as much particularity as is feasible.


<R05>
Sec. 201.123  Standards for issuance of subpoena duces tecum.

    The officer considering any application for a subpoena duces tecum 
shall issue the subpoena requested if he is satisfied the application 
complies with this section and the request is not unreasonable, 
oppressive, excessive in scope or unduly burdensome. No attempt shall be 
made to determine the admissibility of evidence in passing upon an 
application for a subpoena duces tecum and no detailed or burdensome 
showing shall be required as a condition to the issuance of any 
subpoena.


<R05>
Sec. 201.124  Service and quashing of subpoenas.

    Subpoenas issued under this section may be served upon the person to 
whom directed in accordance with subpart D of this part. Any person upon 
whom a subpoena is served may within seven (7) days after service or at 
any time prior to the return date thereof, whichever is earlier, file a 
motion to quash or modify the subpoena with the officer who issued the 
subpoena for action by him, and serve a copy of such motion to quash 
upon the party requesting the subpoena. If the person to whom the motion 
to modify or quash the subpoena has been addressed or directed has not 
acted upon such a motion by the return date, such date shall be stayed 
pending his final action thereon. The Administration may at any time 
review, upon its own initiative, the ruling of the officer denying a 
motion to quash a subpoena. In such cases, the Administration may at any 
time order that the return date of a subpoena which it has elected to 
review be stayed pending Administration action thereon.


<R05>
Sec. 201.125  Attendance and mileage fees.

    Persons attending hearings under requirement of subpoenas are 
entitled to the same fees and mileage as in the courts of the United 
States, to be paid by the party at whose instance the persons are 
called.


<R05>
Sec. 201.126  Service of subpoenas.

    If service of subpoena is made by a United States marshal or his 
deputy, such service shall be evidenced by his return thereon. If made 
by any other person, such person shall make affidavit thereto, 
describing the manner in which service is made, and return such 
affidavit on or with the original subpoena. In case of failure to make 
service, the reasons for the failure shall be stated on the original 
subpoena. In making service the original subpoena shall be exhibited to 
the person served, shall be read to him if he is unable to read, and a 
copy thereof shall be left with him. The original subpoena, bearing or 
accompanied by required return, affidavit, or statement, shall be 
returned without delay to the Administration, or if so directed on the 
subpoena, to the presiding officer before whom the person named in the 
subpoena is required to appear.


<R05>
Sec. 201.127  Subpoena of Administration employees, documents, or things.

    No subpoena for the attendance of an Administration officer or 
employee, or for the production of Administration documents or things 
shall be complied with except upon written authorization of the General 
Counsel upon written application by the party requesting the subpoena.

<R04>
                 Subpart M_Hearing Procedures (Rule 13)


<R05>
Sec. 201.131  Presentation of evidence.

    (a) Testimony. Where appropriate, the Presiding officer may direct 
that the testimony of witnesses be prepared in written exhibit form and 
shall be served at designated dates in advance of the hearing. Evidence 
as to events occurring after the exhibit-exchange dates shall be 
presented by a revision of exhibits. Witnesses sponsoring exhibits shall 
be made available for cross-examination. However, unless authorized by 
the presiding officer, witnesses will not be permitted to read prepared 
testimony into the record. The evidentiary record shall be limited to 
factual and expert opinion testimony. Argument will not be received in 
evidence but rather should be presented in opening and/or closing 
statements of counsel and in briefs to the presiding officer 
subsequently filed.
    (b) Exhibits. All exhibits and responses to requests for evidence 
shall be numbered consecutively by the party submitting same and 
appropriately indexed as to number and title and shall be exchanged on 
dates prior to the hearing prescribed in the prehearing rulings. Written 
testimony should be identified alphabetically. Two copies shall be sent 
to each party and two to the presiding officer. No response to a request 
for evidence will be received into the record unless offered and 
received as an exhibit at the hearing. The exhibits, other than the 
written testimony, shall include appropriate footnotes or narrative 
material explaining the source of the information used and the methods 
employed in statistical compilations and estimates and shall contain a 
short commentary explaining the conclusions which the offeror draws from 
the data. Rebuttal exhibits should refer specifically to the exhibits 
being rebutted. Where one part of a multipage exhibit is based upon 
another part, appropriate cross-reference should be made. The principal 
title of each exhibit should state precisely what it contains and may 
also contain a statement of the purpose for which the exhibit is 
offered. However, such explanatory statement, if phrased in an 
argumentative fashion, will not be considered as a part of the 
evidentiary record. Additional exhibits pertinent to the issues may be 
submitted in a proceeding with the approval of the presiding officer.
    (c) Cooperation on basic data. Parties having like interests are 
specifically encouraged to cooperate with each other in joint 
presentations particularly in such items as basic passenger, cargo, and 
scheduling data compiled from official or semiofficial sources, and any 
other evidence susceptible to joint presentation. Duplicate presentation 
of the same evidence should be avoided wherever possible.
    (d) Authenticity. The authenticity of all documents submitted as 
proposed exhibits in advance of the hearing shall be deemed admitted 
unless written objection thereto is filed prior to the hearing, except 
that a party will be permitted to challenge such authenticity at a later 
time upon a clear showing of good cause for failure to have filed such 
written objection.
    (e) Statement of position and trial briefs. A written statement of 
position should be exchanged by all counsel with copies to all other 
parties prior to the beginning of the hearing: Provided, however, That 
Public Counsel or counsel for a public body which has intervened as its 
interests may appear, may offer his statement of position at the 
conclusion of the evidentiary hearing, unless such is impracticable. 
This statement should include a showing of the theory of the case of the 
party submitting the statement and will not be subject to cross-
examination. Trial briefs are acceptable but will not be required.


<R05>
Sec. 201.132  Conduct of the hearing.

    (a) Order of presentation. Normally the order of presentation at the 
hearing will be alphabetical in each of the following categories:
    (1) MarAd statistical material.
    (2) Shipper interests, United States and foreign government 
departments.
    (3) Applicants.
    (4) Intervenors.
    (5) Public counsel.

Normally, rebuttal should be presented without any adjournment in the 
proceedings.

[[Page 22]]

    (b) Burden of proof. The burden of proof shall be (1) upon an 
applicant for any form of government aid or grant; and (2) upon a 
proponent for the issuance of any rule or order within the jurisdiction 
of the Administration. The burden of going forward with rebuttal 
evidence in proceedings involving matters under paragraphs (b) (1) and 
(2) of this section shall fall upon opposing intervenors. Whenever an 
intervenor is permitted by the presiding officer to raise or advance a 
new issue in the proceeding, the burden of proof as to such issue shall 
fall upon such intervenor. If the burden of proof is met as to such new 
issue, the other parties shall have the burden of going forward with 
rebuttal evidence in such regard.
    (c) Requirement for submission of corrected copies of exhibits. Each 
party shall present three fully corrected copies of its exhibits to be 
offered in evidence, one for the docket and two for the presiding 
officer.
    (d) Offer of exhibits in evidence. The exhibits and written 
testimony sponsored by each witness shall be offered in evidence at the 
close of his direct examination to the extent practicable. After ruling 
upon motions to strike they shall be received in evidence subject to 
cross-examination. The presiding officer, in his discretion, may defer 
such ruling until after completion of cross-examination.
    (e)(1) Cross-examination. Cross-examination shall be limited to the 
scope of the direct examination and, except for Public Counsel and 
counsel for public bodies which have intervened as their interests may 
appear, to witnesses whose testimony is adverse to the party desiring to 
cross-examine--this being intended specifically to prohibit so-called 
``friendly cross-examination''. Cross-examination, which is not 
necessary to test the truth and completeness of the direct testimony and 
exhibits, will not be permitted.
    (2) Re-cross-examination. Second rounds of cross-examination 
normally will not be permitted unless it is necessary to cover new 
matters raised by a subsequent examination. Cross-examination of any 
particular witness shall be limited to one attorney for each party and 
shall not include subjects which are not germane to the interest 
represented by the cross-examiner.
    (f) Oral motions. Oral presentation on any motion or objection shall 
be limited to the party or parties making the motion or objection and 
the party or parties against which the motion or objection is directed 
and Public Counsel. Such presentation shall also be limited to one 
attorney for each party.
    (g) Official notice; public document items. Whenever there is 
offered (in whole or in part) a public document, such as an official 
report, decision, opinion, or published scientific or economic 
statistical data issued by any of the executive departments (or their 
subdivisions), legislative agencies or committees, or administrative 
agencies of the Federal Government (including Government-owned 
corporations), or a similar document issued by a State or its agencies, 
and such document (or part thereof) has been shown by the offerer to be 
reasonably available to the public, such document need not be produced 
or marked for identification, but may be offered for official notice as 
a public document item by specifying the document or relevant part 
thereof.
    (h) Oral argument at hearings. A request for oral argument at the 
close of testimony will be granted or denied by the presiding officer in 
his discretion.


<R05>
Sec. 201.133  Appeal from ruling of presiding officer.

    Rulings of presiding officers may not be appealed prior to, or 
during the course of, the hearing except where the presiding officer has 
granted a Motion for Summary Disposition under subpart I of this part, 
or in extraordinary circumstances where prompt decision by the 
Administration is necessary to prevent unusual delay, expense, or 
detriment to the public interest, in which instances the matter shall be 
referred forthwith by the presiding officer to the Administration. Any 
such appeal shall be filed within fifteen (15) days from the date of the 
ruling by the presiding officer.


<R05>
Sec. 201.134  Separation of functions.

    The separation of functions as required by section 5(c) of the

or unduly repetitious or cumulative evidence shall be excluded.


<R05>
Sec. 201.137  Rights of parties as to presentation of evidence.

    Every party shall have the right to present his case or defense by 
oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to 
conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true 
disclosure of the facts.


<R05>
Sec. 201.138  Unsponsored written material.

    (a) Material that may be deemed evidence. Where a formal hearing is 
held, a party shall be afforded an opportunity to participate through 
submission of relevant, material, reliable and probative written 
evidence including official notice matters covered in Sec. 201.132(g): 
Provided, That such evidence submitted by persons not present at the 
hearing will not be made a part of the record if opposed to by any party 
for good cause shown.
    (b) Material that may not be deemed evidence. Letters expressing 
views or urging action and other unsponsored written material in respect 
of matters embraced in, or related to, a formal hearing will be placed 
in the correspondence section of the docket of the proceeding. These 
data are not to be deemed part of the evidence or part of the record in 
the material unless sponsored at the public hearing by an authenticating 
and supporting witness.


<R05>
Sec. 201.139  Documents containing matter both material and not material.

    Where written matter offered in evidence is embraced in a document 
containing other matter which is not intended to be offered in evidence, 
the party offering shall present the original document to all parties at 
the hearing for their inspection, and shall offer a true copy of the 
matter which is to be introduced unless the presiding officer determines 
that the matter is short enough to be read into the record. Opposing 
parties shall be afforded an opportunity to introduce in evidence, or by 
stipulations other portions of the original document which are material 
and relevant.


<R05>
Sec. 201.140  Records in other proceedings.

    When any portion of the record before the Administration in any 
proceeding other than the one being heard is offered in evidence, a true 
copy of such portion shall be presented for the record in the form of an 
exhibit unless the parties represented at the hearing stipulate upon the 
record that such portion may be incorporated by reference.


<R05>
Sec. 201.141  Stipulations.

    The parties may, by stipulation in writing filed at the prehearing 
conference, or by written or oral stipulation presented at the hearing 
or by written stipulation subsequent to the hearing, agree upon any 
facts involved in the proceeding and include them in the record with the 
consent of the presiding officer. Proposed written stipulations shall be 
subscribed by the sponsors and served upon all parties of record. Only 
upon acceptance by all parties to the proceeding may a stipulation be 
noted for the record or received as evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 201.142  Further evidence required by presiding officer during hearing.

    At any time during the hearing the presiding officer may call for 
the production of further relevant and material evidence, reports, 
studies, and analyses upon any issue, and require such evidence, where 
available, to be presented by the party or parties concerned, either at 
the hearing or adjournment thereof in accordance with Sec. 201.132(b). 
Such material shall be received subject to appropriate motions, cross-
examination and/or rebuttal. If a witness refuses to testify or produce

[[Page 24]]

the evidence as requested, the presiding officer shall report such 
refusal to the Administration forthwith.


<R05>
Sec. 201.143  Exceptions to rulings of presiding officer unnecessary.

    Formal exceptions to rulings of the presiding officer are 
unnecessary. It is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling of 
the presiding officer is made or sought, makes known the action which he 
desires the presiding officer to take or his objection to an action 
taken, and his grounds therefor.


<R05>
Sec. 201.144  Offer of proof.

    An offer of proof made in connection with an objection taken to any 
ruling of the presiding officer rejecting or excluding proffered oral 
testimony shall consist of a statement of the substance of the evidence 
which counsel contends would be adduced by such testimony; and, if the 
excluded evidence consists of evidence in documentary or written form or 
of reference to documents or records, a copy of such evidence shall be 
marked for identification and shall accompany the record as the offer of 
proof.


<R04>

opportunity to comment thereon; and shall be received not later than ten 
(10) days after the close of the hearing except for good cause shown, 
and not less than ten (10) days prior to the date set for filing briefs. 
Exhibit numbers should be assigned by counsel or the party. In computing 
the time within which to file such documents or other writings the five

<R05>
Sec. 201.147  Official transcript.

    The Administration will designate the official reporter for all

available in any proceeding under the regulations in this section, and 
will be supplied by the official reporter to the parties and to the 
public except when required for good cause to be held confidential, at 
rates not to exceed the maximum rates fixed by the contract between the 
Administration and the reporter.


<R05>
Sec. 201.148  Corrections of transcript.

    Motions made at the hearing to correct the record will be acted upon 
by the presiding officer. Motions made after the hearing to correct the 
record as to matters of substance rather than form, shall be filed with 
the presiding officer within ten (10) days after receipt of the 
transcript, unless otherwise directed by the presiding officer, and 
shall be served on all parties. Such motions may be in the form of a 
letter and shall certify the date when the transcript was received. If 
no objections are received within ten (10) days after date of service, 
the transcript will, upon approval of the presiding officer, be changed 
to reflect such corrections. If objections are received, the motion will 
be acted upon with due consideration of the stenographic record of the 
hearing.


<R05>

on the same record, including the initial decision of the presiding 
officer.


<R05>
Sec. 201.151  Objections to public disclosure of information.

presiding officer, the witness shall disclose such information only in 
the presence of the presiding officer, official reporter and such 
attorneys or representatives of each party with demonstrated interests, 
as the presiding officer shall determine and after all present have been 
sworn to secrecy. The transcript of testimony shall be held 
confidential. Within five (5) days after such testimony is given, or 
document received, the objecting party shall file with the presiding 
officer a verified written motion to withhold such information from 
public disclosure, setting forth sufficient identification of same and 
the basis upon which public disclosure should not be made. Copies of

<R04>
Subpart P_Briefs, Requests for Findings, Decisions, Exceptions (Rule 16)


<R05>
Sec. 201.155  Briefs; request for findings.

    The time for filing briefs to the presiding officer, and extensions 
thereof, shall be fixed by him. The period of time allowed shall be the 
same for all parties unless the presiding officer, for good cause shown, 
directs otherwise. Normally there shall be an opening brief by the 
moving parties, an answering brief by the proponents of a contrary 
conclusion and a short reply by the moving parties. Briefs and 
statements of position as authorized, shall be served upon all parties 
pursuant to subpart D of this part. Briefs shall include a summary of

and conclusions in serially numbered paragraphs.


<R05>
Sec. 201.156  Requests for extension of time for filing briefs.

    Requests for extension of time within which to file briefs shall

Sec. 201.157  Reopening of a case by presiding officer prior to decision.

    At any time prior to the filing of his initial or recommended 
decision, the presiding officer, either upon petition or upon his own 
initiative may, for good cause shown and upon reasonable notice, reopen 
the case for the receipt of further evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 201.158  Decisions, authority to make and kinds.

    To the presiding officer is delegated the authority to render 
initial or recommended decisions in all proceedings before him, 
including motions, petitions and other pleadings. Tentative or final 
decisions will be rendered by the Administration. The same officers who 
preside at the reception of evidence pursuant to section 7 of the 
Administrative Procedure Act shall render the initial or recommended 
decisions except where such officers become unavailable to the 
Administration, in which case another Presiding Officer will be 
designated to make such decision or certify the record to the 
Administration. Where the Administration requires the entire record in 
the case to be certified to it for initial decision, the Presiding 
Officer shall first recommend a decision, except that in rule making:
    (a) In lieu thereof the Administration may issue a tentative 
decision or any of its responsible officers may recommend a decision or 
(b) any such procedure may be omitted in any case in which the 
Administration finds upon the record that due and timely execution of 
its functions in the public interest imperatively and unavoidably so 
requires.


<R05>
Sec. 201.159  Decisions; contents and service.

    All initial, recommended, tentative, and final decisions, whether 
rendered

[[Page 26]]

orally or in writing shall include a statement of findings and 
conclusions, as well as the reasons or bases therefor, upon the material 
issues presented, as well as a statement of the appropriate rule, order, 
sanction, relief to be imposed, or the denial thereof. A copy of each 
decision when issued or when transcribed if orally rendered (and all 
orally presented decisions shall be stenographically recorded) shall be 
served on the parties to the proceeding, and furnished to interested 
persons upon request.


<R05>
Sec. 201.160  Decision based on official notice.

    Official notice may be taken of such matters as might be judicially 
noticed by the courts, or of technical or scientific facts within the 
general or specialized knowledge of the Administration as an expert body 
or of a document required to be filed with or published by a duly 
constituted governmental body: Provided, That where a decision or part 
thereof rests on the official notice of a material fact not appearing in 
the evidence of the record, the fact of official notice shall be so 
stated in the decision, and any party, on timely request, shall be 
afforded an opportunity to show the contrary.


<R05>
Sec. 201.161  Exceptions to, and review by the Administration of initial or recommended decisions.

    Within twenty (20) days after the service date of the initial or 
recommended decision, whether oral or in writing, unless a shorter 
period is fixed under Sec. 201.54, any party may file exceptions to any 
conclusions, findings, or statements contained in such decision, and a 
brief in support of such exceptions. Such exceptions and brief shall 
constitute one document, shall indicate with particularity alleged 
errors, shall indicate pages of transcript and exhibit numbers when 
referring to the record, and shall be served on all parties pursuant to 
subpart D of this part. Whenever the presiding officer renders an 
initial decision, in the absence of the filing of exceptions thereto, or 
notice of review thereof by the Administration, such decision, shall 
upon the issuance of an appropriate order by the Administration, become 
the decision of the Administration. Upon the filing of exceptions to, or 
notice of review of, an initial or recommended decision, such decision 
shall become inoperative until the Administration determines the matter. 
Where exceptions are filed to, or the Administration reviews, an initial 
or recommended decision, the Administration, except as it may limit the 
issues upon notice or by rule, will have all the powers which it would 
have in making the initial decision. Whenever the Administration shall 
determine to review an initial or recommended decision on its own 
initiative, notice of such intention shall be served upon the parties 
within thirty (30) days after the date when the initial or recommended 
decision is orally rendered and, if in writing, served.


<R05>
Sec. 201.162  Replies to exceptions.

    Any party may file and serve a reply to exceptions within twenty 
(20) days after date of service thereof, unless a shorter period is 
fixed pursuant to Sec. 201.54. Such reply shall indicate pages of the 
transcript and exhibit numbers when referring to the record.


<R05>
Sec. 201.163  Request for extension of time for filing exceptions and replies thereto.

    Requests for extension of time within which to file exceptions, and 
briefs in support thereof, or replies to exceptions shall conform to the 
applicable provisions of subpart E of this part. Except for good cause 
shown, such requests shall be filed and served not later than five (5) 
days before the expiration of the time fixed for the filing of such 
documents.


<R05>
Sec. 201.164  Certification of record by presiding officer.

    The presiding officer shall certify and transmit the entire record 
to the Administration when: (a) Exceptions are filed or the time 
therefor has expired, (b) notice is given by the Administration that the 
initial or recommended decision will be reviewed on its own initiative, 
or (c) the Administration requires the case to be certified to it for 
initial decision.

<R04>
     Subpart Q_Oral Argument; Submittal for Final Decision (Rule 17)


<R05>
Sec. 201.166  Oral argument.

    If oral argument before the Administration is desired on exceptions 
or replies to exceptions to an initial, recommended, or tentative 
decision, or on a motion, petition, or application, a request therefor 
shall be made in writing properly addressed to the Administration. Any 
party may make such request irrespective of his filing exceptions or 
replies. If a brief on exceptions or replies thereto are filed, the 
request for oral argument shall be incorporated therein. Requests for 
oral argument on any motion, petition, or application shall be made in 
the motion, petition, or application or in the reply thereto. Requests 
for oral argument will be granted or denied in the discretion of the 
Administration, and, if granted, the notice of oral argument will set 
forth the order of presentation and the amount of time to be allotted. 
Those who appear before the Administration for oral argument should 
confine their argument to points of controlling importance and shall 
limit their argument to points upon which exceptions have been filed. 
Where the facts of a case are adequately and accurately dealt with in 
the initial, recommended, or tentative decision, parties should, as far 
as possible, address themselves in argument to the conclusions. Effort 
should be made by parties taking the same position to agree in advance 
of the argument upon those who are to present their side of the case. 
The names of persons who will argue and the amount of time requested by 
each should be received by the Administration not later than ten (10) 
days before the date set for the argument. Ordinarily, consolidation of 
appearances at oral argument will permit the parties' interests to be 
presented more effectively in the time allotted.


<R05>
Sec. 201.167  Submission to Administration for final decision.

    A proceeding will be deemed submitted to the Administration for its 
determination as follows: (a) If oral argument is had, on the date of 
completion thereof, or if memoranda on points of law are permitted to be 
filed after argument, the last date of such filing; (b) if oral argument 
is not had, the last date when exceptions or replies thereto are filed, 
or if exceptions are not filed, the expiration date for such exceptions 
or the date when all parties have stated that no exceptions will be 
filed; (c) in the case of an initial decision, the date of notice of the 
Administration to review the decision, if such notice is given.

<R05>
Sec. 201.171  Stay of Administration's decision.

    The Administration's decision or order shall be stayed pending 
resolution by the Administration of a petition for reopening, duly 
filed, and for so long as such Administration's action has not been 
finally disposed of in accordance with the provisions of section 7 of 
Department of Commerce Order 117 (Revised).


<R05>
Sec. 201.172  Time for filing petition to reopen.

    Except for good cause shown, and upon leave granted, petition to 
reopen under Sec. 201.174, shall be filed with the Administration

Administration's decision or order in the proceeding, unless a different 
period is fixed under Sec. 201.54.

Sec. 201.173  Reopening by Administration and modification or setting aside of decision.

    Upon petition and a showing of compelling cause, filed in accordance 
with Sec. 201.174, or on its own motion, the Administration may at any 
time reopen any proceeding under the regulation in this part for 
rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration in whole or in part. After 
reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing or such other procedure as 
the Administration may direct, the Administration may alter, modify or 
set aside in whole or in part its decision therein if it finds such 
action is required by changed conditions in fact or law or by the public 
interest.

such evidence was not available at the time of the prior hearing. If the 
petition be for reargument or reconsideration, the matter claimed to 
have been erroneously decided shall be specified and the alleged errors 
briefly stated. In case of exceptional circumstances, satisfactorily

<R04>
           Subpart S_Judicial Standards of Practice (Rule 19)


<R05>
Sec. 201.181  General matters.

    (a) In general, the functions of the Administration involve hearing 
procedures comparable to those of a court and accordingly parties to 
proceedings before the Administration and persons representing these 
parties are expected to conduct themselves with honor and dignity. For 
the same reasons, the members of the Administration and those of its 
employees who participate with the Administration in the determination 
of formal proceedings are expected to conduct themselves with the same 
fidelity to standards of propriety that characterizes a court and its 
staff. The standing and the effectiveness of the Administration are in 
direct relation to the observance by it, its staff and the parties and 
attorneys appearing before it of the highest of judicial and 
professional ethics.
    (b) It is essential in cases to be determined after notice and 
hearing and upon a record, or in any other cases which the 
Administration by order may designate, that the judicial character of 
the Administration be recognized and protected. As a consequence, from 
the time of the filing of an application or a petition which can be 
granted by the Administration only after notice and opportunity for 
hearing, or in the case of other matters from the time of notice by the 
Administration that such matters shall be determined after notice and 
opportunity for hearing, no ex parte communications, as hereinafter 
defined, are to constitute or be considered part of the record on which 
the final decision is to be predicated.


<R05>
Sec. 201.182  Improper pressures.

    It is determined to be improper that there be any effort by any 
person interested in a case before the Administration to attempt to sway 
the judgment of the Administration by undertaking to bring pressure or 
influence to bear upon the Administration, its staff, or the presiding 
officer assigned to the proceeding. It is further determined to be 
improper that such interested persons or any member of the 
Administration's staff or the presiding officer directly or indirectly 
give statements to the press or radio, by paid advertisements or 
otherwise, designed to influence the Administration's judgment in the 
matter. In addition, it is further determined to be improper that any 
person solicit communications to the Administration or any of its 
members, its staff or the presiding officer in the case other than by 
counsel of record who shall serve copies thereof on all other parties to 
the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 201.183  Ex parte communications.

    (a) Requests for expeditious treatment of matters pending with the 
Administration are deemed communications on the merits and as such are 
improper except when forwarded from parties to a proceeding and served 
upon all other parties thereto. Such communications from parties to a 
proceeding should be in the form of a motion and are to be dealt with as 
such by the Administration, the presiding officer, and

[[Page 29]]

the parties to the proceeding. Any such request which is not made as a 
motion shall be placed in the public correspondence file and will not be 
considered by the Administration or any of its staff members or the 
presiding officer in connection with the disposition of the case.
    (b) Written or oral communications involving any substantive or 
procedural issue in a matter subject to public hearing directed to a 
Member of the Administration, its staff, or the presiding officer in the 
case, from any individual in private or public life shall be deemed a 
private communication in respect of the merits of the case. These 
communications, unless otherwise provided for by law or a published rule 
of the Administration are deemed ex parte communications and are not to 
be considered part of any record or the basis for any official action by 
the Administration, members of its staff or the presiding officer: 
Provided, however, That this prohibition shall not be determined to 
apply to informal petitions or applications filed with the 
Administration; the usual informal communications between counsel 
including discussions directed toward the development of a stipulation 
or settlement between parties; communications of a nature deemed proper 
in proceedings in U.S. Federal courts; and communications which merely 
inquire as to the status of a proceeding without discussing issues or 
expressing points of view. Any prohibited communications in writing 
received by a Member of the Administration, its staff or the presiding 
officer shall be made public by placing it in the correspondence file of 
the docket which is available for public inspection and will not be 
considered by the Administration or the presiding officer as part of the 
record for decision. If the ex parte communication is received orally, a 
memorandum setting forth the substance of the conversation shall be made 
and filed in the correspondence section of the appropriate public 
docket.

    The regulations in this part shall become effective October 23, 
1964, and shall apply only to cases which are designated for hearing on 
or after October 23, 1964: Provided, however, That the regulations in

or after that date. All other cases designated for hearing prior to 
October 23, 1964, shall be governed by the rules in effect immediately

<R05>
Sec. 202.1  Purpose.

    The rules of this part prescribe procedures relating to Secretarial 
review of any decision, report, order or action of the Maritime Subsidy 
Board (Board) pursuant to Department Order 117-A (31 FR 8087, 15331). 
Section 6 of Department Order 117-A is reprinted here for the 
convenience of the public.

    Sec. 6. Review and finality of actions by Maritime Subsidy Board. 
.01 The Secretary of Transportation (hereinafter referred to as 
``Secretary'') may, on his own motion or on the basis of a petition 
filed as hereinafter

[[Page 30]]

provided, review any decision, report and/or order of the Maritime 
Subsidy Board based on a hearing held pursuant to (a) statutory 
requirements or (b) Board order, by entering a written order stating 
that he elects to review the action of the Board. Copies of all orders 
for review shall be served on all parties of record (which phrase 
includes the Board). Petitions for review under this paragraph may be 
filed by parties of record, shall be in writing, and shall state the 
grounds upon which petitioner relies. Ten (10) copies of such petitions 
for review, together with proof of service thereof on all parties of 
record, shall be filed with the Secretary within fifteen (15) days after 
the date of the service of the Board's decision, report or order. 
Parties of record may file replies in writing thereto. Ten (10) copies 
of such replies, together with proof of service thereof on the 
petitioner and all other parties of record, shall be filed with the 
Secretary within ten (10) days after the date the petition for review is 
timely filed. Petitions for review and replies thereto shall be limited 
to the record before the Board. If a petition for review is filed within 
the time prescribed, a decision, report or order of the Board shall be 
final fifteen (15) days after expiration of the time prescribed for 
filing a reply thereto unless the Secretary, prior to expiration of the 
fifteen (15) days, enters a written order granting the petition for 
review. If no petition for review is filed within the time prescribed, a 
decision, report or order of the Board shall be final twenty (20) days 
after the date of service of the decision unless the Secretary, prior to 
expiration of the twenty (20) days, enters a written order stating that 
he elects to review the action of the Board. If upon any review the 
decision of the Secretary rests on official notice of a material fact 
not appearing in the evidence in the record, any party of record shall, 
if request is made within ten (10) days after the date of service of the 
Secretary's decision on said party, be afforded an opportunity to show 
the contrary. The said ten (10) days shall constitute the period for a 
``timely request'' within the meaning of section 7(d) of the 
Administrative Procedure Act.
    .02 The Secretary may on his own motion review all actions of the 
Maritime Subsidy Board other than those referred to in paragraph .01 of 
this section by entering a written order stating that he elects to 
review the action of the Board. Any person having an interest in any 
action of the Board under this paragraph shall have the privilege of 
submitting to the Secretary within ten (10) days after the date of such 
Board action, a request that the Secretary undertake such review. Such 
request shall be in writing and shall state the grounds upon which the 
person submitting the same relies and his interest in the action for 
which review is requested. Ten (10) copies of such requests shall be 
submitted to the Secretary. Any other person having an interest in such 
matter shall have the privilege of submitting within fifteen (15) days 
after the date of the Board's action, a written request that the 
Secretary not exercise such review. Copies of request that the Secretary 
undertake or not exercise review will be open for public inspection at 
the office of the Secretary of the Board. If either a request that the 
Secretary undertake review or a request that he not exercise review is 
submitted within the time prescribed, an action of the Board shall be 
final in ten (10) days after expiration of the time prescribed for 
submission of a request that review not be exercised unless the 
Secretary, prior to the expiration of the ten (10) days, enters a 
written order stating that he elects to review the action of the Board. 
If neither a request that the Secretary undertake review nor a request 
that he not exercise review is submitted within the time prescribed, an 
action of the Board shall be final in twenty (20) days after the date of 
such action unless the Secretary, prior to expiration of the twenty (20) 
days, enters a written order stating that he elects to review the action 
of the Board. Copies of all orders for review shall be served upon the 
Board, and upon all persons filing requests as herein described.
    .03 If a timely petition for reconsideration is filed under the 
rules prescribed by the Board, the time for filing a petition or request 
for review by the Secretary under paragraph .01 or .02 of this section, 
respectively, or the entry of an order by the Secretary on his own 
motion electing to review an action of the Board under paragraph .01 or 
.02 of this section, shall, in the case of actions under paragraph .01 
of this section run from the date of service of the Board's action and, 
in the case of actions under paragraph .02 of this section, run from the 
date of the Board's action, finally disposing of the issues presented by 
the petition for reconsideration.
    .04 In computing any period of time under this section, the time 
begins with the day following the act, event, or default, and includes 
the last day of the period unless it is Saturday, Sunday, or national 
legal holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next 
day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or such holiday. The prescribed 
time for action by the Secretary in a proceeding in which additional 
days have been added pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph shall 
be extended by the total of such additional days.
    .05 Petitions and requests for review by the Secretary shall not be 
filed:
    a. Unless the petitioner shall have first exhausted his 
administrative remedies (other than a petition for reconsideration) 
before the Maritime Subsidy Board; nor

[[Page 31]]

    b. With respect to interlocutory decisions of the Maritime Subsidy 
Board in actions or proceedings referred to in paragraphs .01 and .02 of 
this section.
    .06 The Secretary may, for good cause and/or in order to prevent 
undue hardship in any particular case, waive or modify any procedural 
provision of this section by written order.

    (a) The provisions of this part apply to applications which involve 
statutorily mandated hearings under sections 605(c) and 805(a) of the 
Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 U.S.C. app. 1175(c), 1223(a)), 
hereinafter referred to as the ``Act'', conducted by the Maritime

    (b) The provisions of this part are to be construed consistently 
with the Administration Rules of Practice and Procedure in 46 CFR part 
201. If this part and 46 CFR part 201 conflict, this part shall govern.


<R05>
Sec. 203.2  Applications.

    (a) Notice of all applications subject to this part shall be 
published in the Federal Register, in accordance with the provisions of 
46 CFR 201.72.
    (b) All applications under section 605(c) of the Act shall specify,

protected by a confidentiality ruling, if justified. If the application 
is one for additional service on a route in which the applicant has an 
established service, or for an existing service, then the applicant must 
include information on its previous three years of operation. Applicants 
for permission under section 805(a) of the Act must describe clearly the 
scope of permission sought, including details of proposed domestic 
service and existing or proposed foreign service, as well as the 
applicant's operating structure.
    (c) Applications under section 605(c) of the Act shall be filed on 
Form MA-964, in accordance with the instructions annexed thereto. Copies 
of Form MA-964 may be obtained on request from the Secretary of the 
Administration.
    (d) Applications for permission under section 805(a) of the Act 
shall be submitted in accordance with the procedures set forth in 46 CFR 
part 380, and shall comply with all of the requirements of that part.


<R05>
Sec. 203.3  Opposition to applications.

    (a) Required documents. A person seeking to oppose an application 
shall file with the Secretary of the Administration, and concurrently 
serve upon the applicant, a petition for leave to intervene, together 
with an answer, within the time period specified in the Federal Register 
notice of the application. Normally, twenty days will be provided.
    (b) Petition for leave to intervene. The petition for leave to 
intervene shall specify the basis upon which such person asserts a right 
to intervene and shall set forth with particularity:
    (1) The number and type of U.S.-flag vessels currently operated by 
the person seeking intervention in the trade or trade route to which the 
application pertains.

[[Page 34]]

    (2) The frequency of sailings of vessels operated by such person in 
the trade or trade route to which the application pertains in the 36 
calendar months immediately preceding the date of the application.
    (3) The specific ports of call conducted by such person in the trade 
or trade route to which the application pertains in the 36 calendar 
months immediately preceding the date of the application.
    (4) The average annual carriage by such person for the past 36 
months on the trade route to which the application pertains.
    (5) If applicable, specific information detailing firm and definite 
plans for the inauguration of a new service, including, as appropriate, 
but not limited to, approval by the board of directors or general 
partners, membership in applicable conference agreements, office 
openings or the retention of agents in the proposed service area, 
acquisition of vessels and related equipment, subsidy applications, 
applications for any needed Government approvals or advertisement for 
the proposed service.
    (6) Such other information as the person believes should be 
considered in a determination of such person's right to intervene.
    (c) Answer. (1) The answer shall be simultaneously filed with the 
petition for leave to intervene and shall specify the basis upon which 
such person asserts the application should be denied or granted subject 
to modifications.
    (2) The answer shall set forth with particularity:
    (i) The ground upon which opposition is based;
    (ii) The factual matters which such person believes must be 
determined by the Administration;
    (iii) The legal matters which such person believes must be 
determined by the Administration;
    (iv) For each factual and legal matter raised such person's position 
and basis therefor; and
    (v) The precise nexus between each factual and legal matter raised 
and the decision of the Administration.
    (d) Right to intervene in Opposition to applications. (1) Leave to 
intervene in opposition to applications under section 605(c) of the Act 
will only be granted to operators of U.S.-flag vessels, and only to the 
extent, as demonstrated by the petition for leave to intervene, that 
such person provides an existing service, or that such person has firm 
and definite plans to provide a service, by a showing that its vessels 
operate in the same trade or on the same trade route as that proposed by 
the applicant and so operate in a manner competitive with the specific 
service proposed by the applicant. Although persons seeking intervention 
need not call at the same specific ports proposed by the applicant by 
direct vessel calls, any filing based on intermodal service in 
opposition to an application shall demonstrate that such person 
regularly competes by intermodal service for cargo moving to or from 
ports in the service proposed by the applicant. The burden of 
demonstrating competition between the vessels of the person seeking 
intervention and those of the applicant will be with the person seeking 
such intervention. Leave to intervene will not be granted to those 
conducting a competing service on an intermittent or de minimis basis.
    (2) Leave to intervene in opposition to applications under section 
805(a) of the Act will be granted, as provided in the statute, to every 
person, firm, or corporation ``having any interest'' in such 
application.


<R05>
Sec. 203.4  Replies.

    Within ten (10) days after the date for filing answers, the 
applicant may file a reply specifically addressed to the issues raised 
in the answers and to oppose the grant to any petitioner of leave to 
intervene.


<R05>
Sec. 203.5  Types of hearings.

    (a) Oral Evidentiary Hearing: If, upon review of the application, 
answers, petitions to intervene and replies, the Administration 
determines that the proceeding involves a disputed issue of material 
fact which cannot be resolved on the basis of available information of 
record, and that the case is anticipated to involve the submission of 
extensive evidence, or the Administration determines that it is 
otherwise appropriate, the Administration may issue an order referring 
the case to an Administrative

[[Page 35]]

Law Judge for oral evidentiary hearing. Such hearing shall be conducted 
in accordance with the procedures set out in 46 CFR part 201. The 
Administration may resolve issues of intervention in such order or refer 
such issues to the Administrative Law Judge. The burden of establishing 
that there is a disputed issue of material fact is upon the party 
seeking the oral evidentiary hearing.
    (b) Hearing on Submission of Written Evidence and Argument: If, upon 
review of the application, answers, petitions to intervene and replies, 
the Administration determines that the proceeding involves a disputed 
issue of material fact which cannot be resolved on the basis of 
available information of record, but which is not anticipated to involve 
the submission of extensive evidence, the Administration may fulfill the 
hearing requirement in sections 605(c) and 805(a) of the Act by 
rendering a decision solely on the merits of papers submitted, provided 
that a full and true disclosure of the facts is made and such procedure 
is fair to all parties. The Administration may, in its discretion, 
direct the submission of briefs on legal issues together with evidence 
in written form, and/or the holding of oral argument before the 
Administration prior to issuing its final decision on the proceeding.
    (c) Show Cause Proceeding: If, upon review of the application, 
answers, petitions to intervene and replies, the Administration 
determines that the proceeding does not or is not likely to involve a 
disputed issue of material fact or that if such facts exist they can be 
resolved on the basis of available information subject to official 
notice, and if the case is not anticipated to involve the submission of 
extensive evidence, the Administration may determine to handle the 
matter by show-cause proceeding. In that event, it will issue a decision 
setting out its tentative conclusions on all of the matters of fact and 
law at issue in the proceeding. A Notice summarizing such decision shall 
be published in the Federal Register in accordance with 46 CFR 201.72. 
Interested persons may file comments, including support or rebuttal for 
any matter officially noticed, within 30 days of the date of service of 
the tentative decision and responses to such comments shall be filed 
within ten days thereafter unless a shorter or longer period is provided 
by the Administration for such comments and answers.

representative, an executed Standard Form 95, ``Claims for Damage, 
Injury, or Death,'' or written notification of an incident, together 
with a claim for money damages in a sum certain, for death, personal 
injury, or damage to or loss of real or personal property. When a claim

authority shall inform the claimant by certified or registered mail of 
the final denial of the claim. Notification of final denial shall 
include a statement that a claimant who does not accept or is 
dissatisfied with the action may institute suit against the United 
States not later than six months after the date of mailing of the notice 
of final denial.
    (c) A claimant may regard the failure of the Maritime Administration 
to make a final disposition of a claim within six months after the date 
of receipt of the claim by the Maritime Administration as a final denial 
for the purpose of filing suit.

<R05>
Sec. 221.15  Approval for transfer of registry or operation under authority of a foreign country or for scrapping in a foreign country.

    In no case will approval be granted to place under foreign registry 
or to operate under the authority of a foreign country a Fishing Vessel, 
Fish Processing Vessel, or Fish Tender Vessel that has had its fishery 
endorsement revoked pursuant to Appendix D of Public Law 106-554, 114 
Stat 2763. Subject to this exclusion, approval requests will be 
considered as set forth in this section.
    (a) Vessels of under 1,000 gross tons. (1) The Maritime 
Administrator hereby grants approval for the Transfer to foreign 
registry and flag or Operation Under the Authority of a Foreign Country 
or for scrapping in a foreign country of Documented Vessels or vessels 
the last documentation of which was under the laws of the United States 
and which are of under 1,000 gross tons if at the time of such Transfer 
there are no liens or encumbrances recorded against the vessel in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Documentation Office at its last U.S. port of record.
    (2) This approval shall not apply if the vessel is to be placed 
under the registry, or operated under the authority of, or scrapped in 
any country listed in Sec. 221.13(a)(4) of this part.
    (3) This approval shall not apply to any such Transfer proposed to 
be made during any period when the United States is at war or during any 
national emergency, the existence of which has invoked the provisions of 
section 37 of the Shipping Act, 1916, as amended (46 App. U.S.C. 835), 
or to any such Transfer proposed to be made to a citizen of any country 
when such transfer would be contrary to the foreign policy of the United 
States as declared by an executive department of the United States.

[[Page 44]]

    (b) Vessels of 1,000 gross tons or more. (1) Applications for 
approval of Transfer to foreign registry and flag or Operation Under the 
Authority of a Foreign Country or for scrapping in a foreign country of 
Documented Vessels or vessels the last documentation of which was under 
the laws of the United States and which are of 1,000 gross tons or more 
will be evaluated in light of--
    (i) The type, size speed, general condition, and age of the vessel;
    (ii) The acceptability of the owner, proposed transferee and the 
country of registry or the country under the authority of which the 
vessel is to be operated; and
    (iii) The need to retain the vessel under U.S. documentation, 
ownership or control for purposes of national defense, maintenance of an 
adequate merchant marine, foreign policy considerations or the national 
interest.
    (2) If the application is found to be acceptable under the criteria 
of this paragraph, approval will be granted. For vessels of under 3,000 
gross tons, in the absence of unusual circumstances, no conditions will 
be imposed on the transfer. For vessels of 3,000 gross tons and above, 
approval will be granted upon acceptance by the owner of the terms and 
conditions referred to in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, as 
applicable. Additional terms deemed appropriate by the Maritime 
Administrator may be imposed. The terms and conditions shall be 
contained in an Approval Notice and Agreement (``Contract'') executed 
prior to issuance of the Transfer Order. Unless otherwise specified, the 
terms and conditions shall remain in effect for the period of the 
remaining economic life of the vessel or for the duration of a national 
emergency proclaimed by the President prior or subsequent to such 
Transfer, whichever period is longer. The economic life of a vessel for 
purposes of this regulation is deemed to be twenty (20) years for 
tankers and other liquid bulk carriers and twenty-five (25) years for 
other vessel types. This period is to be calculated from the date the 
vessel was originally accepted for delivery from the shipbuilder, but 
may be extended for such additional period of time as may be determined 
by the Maritime Administrator if the vessel has been substantially 
rebuilt or modified in a manner that warrants such extension.
    (c) Foreign transfer other than for scrapping. If the foreign 
Transfer of a vessel referred to in paragraph (b) of this section is 
other than for the purpose of scrapping the vessel and other than a 
Transfer to the government of an acceptable foreign country, and in the 
absence of unusual circumstances as determined by the Maritime 
Administrator (for example a Transfer to an entity controlled by the 
government of an acceptable foreign country), the following conditions 
will be imposed on the transferee:
    (1) Ownership. (i) Without the prior written approval of the 
Maritime Administrator, there shall be no further Transfer of ownership, 
change in the registry or Operation of such vessel Under the Authority 
of a Foreign Country; provided, however, that, if the Transfer of 
ownership is to a Citizen of the United States or other entity qualified 
under 46 U.S.C. 12102(a) to document a vessel and the vessel is 
thereafter documented under U.S. law, no prior written approval shall be 
required but the transferee shall notify the Vessel Transfer Officer in 
writing of such change in the ownership and the U.S. documentation 
within thirty (30) days after such change in ownership and 
documentation.
    (ii) The restrictions contained in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this 
section shall not be applicable to a change in ownership resulting from 
the death of the vessel owner, so long as notification of any such 
Transfer of ownership occurring by reason of death shall be filed with 
the Vessel Transfer Officer within 60 days from the date of such 
Transfer identifying with particularity the name, legal capacity, 
citizenship, current domicile or address of, or other method of direct 
communication with, the transferee(s).
    (2) Requisition. The vessel shall, if requested by the United 
States, be sold or Chartered to the United States on the same terms and 
conditions upon which a vessel owned by a Citizen of the United States 
or documented under U.S. law could be requisitioned for purchase or 
Charter pursuant to section 902 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936,

[[Page 45]]

as amended (46 App. U.S.C. 1242). If the vessel is under the flag of a 
country that is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO), the Maritime Administrator will consider this condition 
satisfied if the owner furnishes satisfactory evidence that the vessel 
is already in noncommercial service under the direction of the 
government of a NATO country.
    (3) Trade. Without the prior written approval of the Maritime 
Administrator, the vessel shall not carry cargoes of any kind to or 
from, or be operated commercially while within the waters of (as 
distinct from passage through), a country referred to in Sec. 
221.13(a)(4) of this part, nor shall there be any Charter or other 
Transfer of an interest in the vessel, other than to a Citizen of the 
United States, for carriage of cargoes of any kind to or from, or for 
commercial operation while within the waters of (as distinct from 
passage through), any such country.
    (4) Default. In the event of default under any or all of the 
conditions set forth in paragraphs (c) (1), (2) or (3) of this section, 
the owner shall pay to the Maritime Administration, without prejudice to 
any other rights that the United States may have, as liquidated damages 
and not as a penalty, the sum of not less than $25,000 or more than 
$1,000,000, as specified in the contract, and the vessel shall be 
subject to the penalties imposed by 46 App. U.S.C. 808 and 839. Pursuant 
to 46 App. U.S.C. 836, the Maritime Administrator may remit forfeiture 
of the vessel upon such conditions as may be required under the 
circumstances of the particular case, including the payment of a sum in 
lieu of forfeiture, and execution of a new agreement containing 
substantially the same conditions set forth above and such others as the 
Maritime Administrator may deem appropriate and which will be applicable 
to the vessel for the remaining period of the original agreement. In 
order to secure the payment of any such sums of money as may be required 
as a result of default, the transferee shall contractually agree, in 
form and substance approved by the Chief Counsel of the Maritime 
Administration, to comply with the above conditions and to provide a 
United States commercial surety bond or other surety acceptable to the 
Maritime Administrator for an amount not less than $25,000 and not more 
than $1,000,000, depending upon the type, size and condition of the 
vessel. ``Other surety'' may be any one of the following:
    (i) An irrevocable letter of credit, which is acceptable to the 
Maritime Administrator, issued or guaranteed by a Citizen of the United 
States or by a federally insured depository institution;
    (ii) A pledge of United States Government securities;
    (iii) The written guarantee of a friendly government of which the 
transferee is a national;
    (iv) A written guarantee or bond by a United States corporation 
found by the Maritime Administrator to be financially qualified to 
service the undertaking to pay the stipulated amount;
    (v) If the transferee is controlled in any manner by one or more 
Citizens of the United States, a contractual agreement in form and 
substance acceptable to the Chief Counsel of the Maritime Administration 
by the transferee and the Citizens of the United States with authority 
to exercise such control, if found by the Maritime Administrator to be 
financially qualified, jointly and severally to pay the stipulated 
amount, such agreement to be secured by the written guarantee of the 
transferee and each of the Citizens of the United States or other form 
of guarantee as may be required by the Maritime Administrator; or
    (vi) Any other surety acceptable to the Maritime Administrator and 
approved as to form and substance by the Chief Counsel of the Maritime 
Administration.
    (d) Foreign transfer for scrapping. If the transfer of control, 
whether or not there is a transfer of registry, of a vessel referred to 
in paragraph (b) of this section is for the purpose of scrapping the 
vessel abroad, the following conditions will be imposed on the 
transferee:
    (1) The vessel or any interest therein shall not be subsequently 
sold to any Person without the prior written approval of the Maritime 
Administrator, nor shall it be used for the carriage of cargo or 
passengers of any kind whatsoever.

[[Page 46]]

    (2) Within a period of 18 months from the date of approval of the 
sale, the hull of the vessel shall be completely scrapped, dismantled, 
dismembered, or destroyed in such manner and to such extent as to 
prevent the further use thereof, or any part thereof, as a ship, barge, 
or any other means of transportation.
    (3) The scrap resulting from the demolition of the hull of the 
vessel, the engines, machinery, and major items of equipment shall not 
be sold to, or utilized by, any citizen or instrumentality of a country 
referred to in Sec. 221.13(a)(4) of the part, nor may such scrap be 
exported to these countries. The engines, machinery and major items of 
equipment shall not be exported to destinations within the United 
States.
    (4) In the event of default under any or all of the conditions set 
forth in paragraphs (d) (1), (2) or (3) of this section, the transferee 
shall pay to the Maritime Administration, without prejudice to any other 
rights that the United States may have, as liquidated damages and not as 
a penalty, the sum of not less than $25,000 or more than $1,000,000, as 
specified in the contract, depending upon the size, type and condition 
of the vessel. This payment shall be secured by a surety company bond or 
other surety satisfactory to the Maritime Administrator. ``Other 
surety'' may be one of those set out in paragraph (c)(4) (i) through 
(vi) of this section.
    (5) There shall be filed with the Vessel Transfer Officer a 
certificate or other evidence satisfactory to the Chief Counsel of the 
Maritime Administration, duly attested and authenticated by a United 
States Consul, that the scrapping of the vessel (hull only) and disposal 
or utilization of the resultant scrap and the engines, machinery and 
major items of equipment have been accomplished in accord with 
paragraphs (d) (2) and (3) of this section.
    (e) Resident agent for service. (1) Any proposed foreign transferee 
shall, prior to the issuance and delivery of the Transfer Order covering 
the vessel or vessels to be transferred, designate and appoint a 
resident agent in the United States to receive and accept service of 
process or other notice in any action or proceeding instituted by the 
United States relating to any claim arising out of the approved 
transaction.
    (2) The resident agent designated and appointed by the foreign 
transferee shall be subject to approval by the Maritime Administrator. 
To be acceptable, the resident agent must maintain a permanent place of 
business in the United States and shall be a banking or lending 
institution, a ship-owner or ship-operating corporation or other 
business entity that is satisfactory to the Maritime Administrator.
    (3) Appointment and designation of the resident agent shall not be 
terminated, revoked, amended or altered without the prior written 
approval of the Maritime Administrator.
    (4) The foreign transferee shall file with the Vessel Transfer 
Officer a written copy of the appointment of the resident agent, which 
copy shall be fully endorsed by the resident agent stating that it 
accepts the appointment, that it will act thereunder and that it will 
notify the Vessel Transfer Officer in writing in the event it becomes 
disqualified from so acting by reason of any legal restrictions. Service 
of process or notice upon any officer, agent or employee of the resident 
agent at its permanent place of business shall constitute effective 
service on, or notice to, the foreign transferee.
    (f) Administrative provisions. (1) The subsequent Transfer of 
ownership or registry of vessels that have been Transferred to foreign 
ownership or registry or both, or to Operation Under the Authority of a 
Foreign Country, that remain subject to Maritime Administration 
contractual control as set forth above, will be subject to substantially 
the same Maritime Administration policy considerations that governed the 
original Transfer, including such changes or modifications that have 
subsequently been made and continued in effect. Approval of these 
subsequent Transfers will be subject to the same terms and conditions 
governing the foreign Transfer at the time of the previous Transfer, as 
modified (if applicable).
    (2) The authorization for all approved transactions, either by 
virtue of 46 App. U.S.C. 808, 835 and 839 or the Maritime 
Administration's Contract with

[[Page 47]]

the vessel owner, will be by notification in the form of a Transfer 
Order upon receipt of the executed Contract, the required bond or other 
surety, and other supporting documentation required by the Contract.
    (3) In order that the Maritime Administration's records may be 
maintained on a current basis, the transferor and transferee of the 
vessel are required to notify the Vessel Transfer Officer of the date 
and place where the approved transaction was completed, and the name of 
the vessel, if changed. This information relating to the completion of 
the transaction and any change in name shall be furnished as soon as 
possible, but not later than 10 days after the same has occurred.

    (a) A Documented Vessel may be sold by order of a district court 
only to a Person eligible to own a Documented Vessel or to a mortgagee 
of the vessel. Unless waived by the Maritime Administrator, a Person 
purchasing the vessel pursuant to court order or from a mortgagee not 
eligible to document a vessel who purchased the vessel pursuant to a 
court order must document the vessel under chapter 121 of title 46, 
United States Code.
    (b) A Person purchasing the vessel, pursuant to court order or from 
a mortgagee not eligible to document a vessel who purchased the vessel 
pursuant to a court order, and wishing to obtain waiver of the 
documentation requirement must submit a request including the reason 
therefor to the Vessel Transfer Officer.
    (c)(1) A mortgagee not eligible to own a Documented Vessel shall not 
operate, or cause operation of, the vessel in commerce. Except as 
provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the vessel may not be

to the extent necessary for the immediate safety of the vessel or for 
repairs, drydocking or berthing changes, but only under the command of a 
Citizen of the United States.

Sec. 221.19  Possession or sale of vessels by mortgagees or trustees other than pursuant to court order.

    (a) A mortgagee or a trustee of a preferred mortgage on a Documented 
Vessel that is not eligible to own a Documented Vessel does not require 
the express approval of the Maritime Administrator to take possession of 
the vessel in the event of default by the mortgagor other than by 
foreclosure pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 31329, if provided for in the mortgage 
or a related financing document, but in such event the vessel may not be 
operated, or caused to be operated, in commerce. The vessel may not, 
except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, be operated for any 
other purpose unless approved in writing by the Maritime Administrator, 
nor may the vessel be sold to a Noncitizen without the approval of the 
Maritime Administrator.
    (b) The Maritime Administrator hereby grants approval for such 
mortgagee or trustee to operate the vessel to the extent necessary for 
the immediate safety of the vessel, for its direct return to the United 
States or for its movement within the United States, or for repairs,

of the United States.
    (c) A Noncitizen mortgagee that has brought a civil action in rem 
for enforcement of a preferred mortgage lien on a citizen-owned 
Documented Vessel pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 31325(b)(1) may petition the 
court pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 31325(e)(1) for appointment of a receiver 
and, if the receiver is Person eligible to own a Documented Vessel, to 
authorize the receiver to operate the mortgaged vessel on such terms and 
conditions as the court deems appropriate. If the receiver is not a 
Citizen of the United States, the vessel may not be operated in 
coastwise trade without prior written approval of the Maritime 
Administrator.

                        Subpart E_Civil Penalties


<R05>
Sec. 221.61  Purpose.

    This subpart describes procedures for the administration of civil 
penalties that the Maritime Administration may assess under 46 U.S.C. 
31309 and 31330, and section 9(d) of the Shipping Act, 1916, as amended 
(46 App. U.S.C. 808(d)), pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 336.
    Note: Pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 31309, a general penalty of not more 
than $12,000 may be assessed for each violation of chapter 313 or 46 
U.S.C. subtitle III administered by the Maritime Administration, and the 
regulations in this part that are promulgated thereunder, except that a 
person violating 46 U.S.C. 31328 or 31329 and the regulations 
promulgated thereunder is liable for a civil penalty of not more than 
$30,000 for each violation. A person that charters, sells, transfers or 
mortgages a vessel, or an interest therein, in violation of 46 App. 
U.S.C. 808 is liable for a civil penalty of not more than $12,000 for 
each violation. These penalty amounts are in accordance with Pub. L. 
101-410, amended by Pub. L. 104-134. Criminal penalties may also apply 
to violations of these statutes.

[68 FR 33406, June 4, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 221.63  Investigation.

    (a) When the Vessel Transfer Office obtains information that a 
Person may have violated a statute or regulation for which a civil 
penalty may be assessed under this subpart, that Officer may investigate 
the matter and decide whether there is sufficient evidence to establish 
a prima facie case that a violation occurred.
    (b) If that Officer decides there is a prima facie case, then that 
Officer may enter into a stipulation with the Party in accordance with 
Sec. 221.67 of this subpart, or may refer the matter directly to a 
Hearing Officer for procedures in accordance with Sec. 221.73 to 221.89 
of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 221.65  Criteria for determining penalty.

    In determining any penalties assessed, the Vessel Transfer Officer 
under Sec. 221.67 and the Hearing Officer under Sec. Sec. 221.73 to 
221.89 of this part shall take into account the nature, circumstances, 
extent and gravity of the violation committed and, with respect to the 
Party, the degree of culpability, any history of prior offenses, ability 
to pay and other matters that justice requires.


<R05>
Sec. 221.67  Stipulation procedure.

    (a) When the Vessel Transfer Office decides to proceed under this 
section, that Office shall notify the Party in writing by registered or 
certified mail--
    (1) Of the alleged violation and the applicable statute and 
regulations;
    (2) Of the maximum penalty that may be assessed for each violation;
    (3) Of a summary of the evidence supporting the violation;
    (4) Of the penalty that the Vessel Transfer Officer will accept in 
settlement of the violation;
    (5) Of the right to examine all the material in the case file and 
have a copy of all written documents provided upon request;
    (6) That by accepting the penalty, the Party waives the right to 
have the matter considered by a Hearing Officer in accordance with 
Sec. Sec. 221.73 to 221.89 of this subpart, and that if the Party 
elects to have the matter considered by a Hearing Officer, the Hearing 
Officer may assess a penalty less than, equal to, or greater than that 
stipulated in settlement if the Hearing Officer finds that a violation 
occurred; and
    (7) That a violation will be kept on record and may be used by the 
Maritime Administration in aggravation of an assessment of a penalty for 
a subsequent violation by that Party.
    (b) Upon receipt of the notification specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section, a Party may within 30 days--
    (1) Agree to the stipulated penalty in the manner specified in the 
notification; or
    (2) Notify in writing the Vessel Transfer Officer that the Party 
elects to have the matter considered by a Hearing Officer in accordance 
with the

[[Page 49]]

procedure specified in Sec. Sec. 221.73 through 221.89 of this subpart.
    (c) If, within 30 days of receipt of the notification specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section, the Party neither agrees to the penalty 
nor elects the informal hearing procedure, the Party will be deemed to

issues certified financial statements following accounting policies 
different from those followed for the financial statement filed with the

Exchange Commission, public service commissions or other regulatory 
agencies, or reports using other acceptable accounting methods differing

participant shall clearly set forth the nature and amount of each 
adjustment necessary to reconcile the published statements with those 
filed with the Maritime Administration.

1993 and its requirements are mandatory for financial reports for 
accounting periods ending on or after December 31, 1993.

    (a) Purpose of accounts. A contractor shall use this chart of 
accounts as a guide for preparing the financial statements and for other 
required financial reports required to be submitted to the Maritime 
Administration. However, whenever there is a conflict between the 
meaning of any term used in the Chart of Accounts in this part 232 and 
that stated in any revision to generally accepted accounting principles, 
the meaning of the latter shall control and shall be followed.

in the industry of which the contractor is a part, shall be reported in 
this account. Generally, these transactions would be attributed to 
insurance proceeds from the total loss of a vessel or catastrophic 
losses to shore-based facilities, as well as from sales of damaged 
assets scrapped because of a natural catastrophe, and disposal of assets 
used primarily in a business segment which is being discontinued.
    (ii) Sufficient records shall be maintained to fully describe and 
account for all aspects of each item reported in this account, and when 
a firm commitment is made to dispose of an operating business segment, a

period from disposal of assets and winding down of operations of the 
discontinued segment shall be taken into income in the year the 
contractor makes the decision.
    (iii) Amounts in this account must be net of all taxes including 
Federal income taxes.

Sec. 232.6  Financial report filing requirement.

    (a) Reporting Frequency and Due Dates. The contractor shall file a 
semiannual financial report and an annual financial report, in the 
format referred to in Sec. 232.1(a)(2), which MARAD shall make 
available to the contractor. This Form MA-172 (Revised) shall be 
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and 
modified to the extent necessary to comply with this regulation. The 
annual financial report shall be reconciled to the financial statements 
audited by independent certified public accountants (CPAs) licensed to 
practice by a state or other political subdivision of the United States, 
or licensed public accountants licensed to practice by regulatory 
authority or other political subdivision of the United States on or 
before December 31, 1970. Both the annual and semiannual financial 
reports shall be due within 120 days after the close of the contractor's 
annual or semiannual accounting period. If certified (CPA) statements 
are not available when required, company certified statements are to be 
submitted within the due dates, and the CPA statements shall be 
submitted as soon as available. The respondent may, in place of any 
Schedule(s) contained in the Form MA-172, submit a schedule or schedules 
from its audited financial statements, or a computer print-out or 
schedule, consistent with the instructions provided in the MARAD 
formats. MARAD will accept electronic options (such as facsimile and 
Internet) for transmission of required information to MARAD, if 
practicable.
    (b) Certification. Annual and semiannual reports shall be approved 
by the Respondent and Official of Respondent whom MARAD may contact 
regarding the report in the reporting formats prescribed as the MA-172 
submission.
    (c) Presumption of confidentiality. MARAD will initially presume 
that each part of the financial reports or data submitted as prescribed 
by this Regulation, other than Schedule 101--Identity of Respondent and 
Schedules 102 and 103, only with respect to the

[[Page 61]]

names and titles of directors and principal officers and employees, is 
privileged or confidential within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4). In 
the event of a subsequent request for any portion of the reports or data 
under 5 U.S.C. 552, the submitter will be notified of such request and 
given the opportunity to comment. The contractor shall claim 
confidentiality at that time by memorandum or letter stating the basis, 
in detail, for such assertion of exemption, including but not limited to 
statutory and decisional authorities. Those parts not so claimed by the 
submitter to be confidential will be disclosed, and those parts so 
claimed will be subject to initial determination by the Freedom of 
Information Act Officer.

(46 App. U.S.C. 1114(b), 1279b); 49 CFR 1.66.

    Source: 53 FR 23119, June 20, 1988, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 249.1  Purpose.

    This part prescribes certain regulations governing the placement of 
marine hull insurance on vessels built or operated with subsidy or 
covered by vessel obligation guarantees issued pursuant to Title XI of 
the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (Act). (46 U.S.C. 1271-1279)


<R05>
Sec. 249.2  Policy.

    (a) It is the policy of the Maritime Administration (MARAD) that 
companies subject to requirements for the placement of marine hull 
insurance shall be afforded the widest possible opportunity to obtain 
the necessary coverage, with minimal regulatory constraints, with 
financially sound underwriters, and that such placement should not 
create any unnecessary impediments to competitive maritime operations.
    (b) It is also the policy of MARAD to require owners of vessels with 
ODS or Title XI obligation guarantees to allow the American marine 
insurance market the opportunity to compete for the marine hull 
insurance on their vessels before such insurance is placed. Consistent 
with sound business judgment, owners will be expected to place their 
insurance with the American market to the maximum extent possible when 
the rates, terms and conditions offered by American underwriters are 
competitive with those offered by foreign underwriters.


<R05>
Sec. 249.3  Amounts of insurance.

    MARAD will inform the owner of each vessel that is subsidized or 
covered by vessel obligation guarantees, prior to initial placement and 
at least annually thereafter, of the minimum amount of insurance 
required to be placed on the vessel.


<R05>
Sec. 249.4  Eligibility.

    In General. All required marine hull insurance must be placed with:
    (a) Underwriters licensed to do business in one or more of the 
United States;
    (b) Underwriters at Lloyds;
    (c) Member companies of the Institute of London Underwriters; or
    (d) Other underwriters specifically approved in advance by the 
Maritime Administration.


<R05>
Sec. 249.5  Eligibility criteria.

    (a) U.S. Underwriters. Underwriters licensed to do business in a 
state are eligible to participate without further consideration, 
provided they have at least a B security rating, as published in the 
latest edition of A.M. Best's Insurance Reports, and the amount of 
insurance does not exceed the limitation on risk prescribed in Sec. 
249.8.
    (b) Foreign Underwriters. (1) Underwriters at Lloyds are eligible to 
participate without further consideration.
    (2) Underwriters which are members of the Institute of London 
Underwriters (ILU) (i.e., member companies, not parents or affiliates of 
the member companies) are eligible to participate without further 
consideration, provided that the ILU member company actually 
underwriting the risk maintains a trust fund in the United States for 
the benefit of its U.S. policyholders in an amount at least equal to the 
minimum provided in Sec. 249.7(d), and the

[[Page 63]]

amount insured does not exceed the limitation on risk prescribed in 
Sec. 249.8. Parent companies or affiliates of the ILU member companies 
are treated as other foreign underwriters under subsection (c) of this 
section.
    MARAD reserves the right to review this eligibility at any time.
    (c) Other Foreign Underwriters. Foreign underwriters, other than 
those specified in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section, may also 
be eligible to participate in the writing of marine hull insurance on 
MARAD program vessels, if approved to do so in accordance with the 
procedures contained in Sec. Sec. 249.6 and 249.7.
    (d) Documentation of eligibility. It shall be the responsibility of 
the vessel owner and its broker to ensure that the requirements of this 
section are met, and they should be able to provide MARAD, upon request, 
with documentation to that effect.


<R05>
Sec. 249.6  Application procedures.

    (a) MARAD may grant specific approval for underwriters described in 
Sec. 249.5(c) to participate in the writing of marine hull insurance on 
MARAD program vessels, only in advance of any actual placement.
    (b) Only those foreign underwriters who have obtained a high rating 
(A or comparable) from an accepted international rating service may 
apply, and if approved, such approval will be contingent upon continued 
maintenance of such rating. MARAD will make available to interested 
parties the names of any accepted international rating service.
    (c) To seek approval, an applicant shall submit to MARAD:
    (1) Certified financial data for the five previous years in 
sufficient detail to enable MARAD to assess the financial strength and 
solvency of the applicant. Normally, this would be the same data which 
the underwriter must submit to the regulatory agency in its country of 
domicile. However, MARAD may request additional data if the applicant's 
submissions are considered inadequate;
    (2) A comprehensive description and English language version of the 
insurance regulatory regime that is in place in the insurer's country of 
domicile. (After review, MARAD may contact the foreign national 
regulatory authorities, as appropriate);
    (3) An affidavit in writing, executed by an agent of the applicant 
who is a domiciliary of the United States, and supported by appropriate 
documentation, to demonstrate that there is nothing in either law or 
practice to preclude a U.S. insurer from obtaining the same access to 
the applicant's home market as the applicant is seeking to the U.S. 
market, and
    (4) The details of its reinsurance program, if it wishes to write 
any risks in excess of five percent of its policyholders' surplus. These 
details shall be accompanied by a statement that clearly demonstrates 
the special circumstances and good cause by which MARAD should be 
persuaded to modify its general policy on limitation of risk described 
in Sec. 249.8.


<R05>
Sec. 249.7  Approval

    (a) Approval of the applicant will be based upon an assessment of 
the applicant's financial condition and solvency, its rating by an 
accepted international rating service, suitability of the regulatory 
regime under which the applicant must operate in its home country, and 
on the principle of reciprocal non-discrimination. MARAD will not 
approve access to the U.S. hull insurance market, if U.S. insurers are 
denied similar access to the hull insurance market in the applicant's 
home country.
    (b) MARAD will publish in the Federal Register each Notice of 
Application received from foreign underwriters described in Sec. 
249.5(c), affording interested persons an opportunity to bring to 
MARAD's attention any discriminatory laws or practices relating to the 
placement of marine hull insurance which might exist in the applicant's 
country of domicile.
    (c) In granting approval, MARAD will consider all materials 
available to it, and may impose reasonable terms and conditions upon any 
such approvals granted.
    (d) Upon approval, applicant will be required to establish and 
maintain for the benefit of its U.S. policyholders a U.S. trust fund in 
the amount of at least $1.5 million, such amount to be

[[Page 64]]

reviewed periodically (but not more frequently than annually), and 
adjusted as appropriate. This requirement may be satisfied by means of 
an appropriate irrevocable letter of credit.
    (e) All policies, at the time of issuance, shall contain the latest 
American Institute of Marine Underwriters' forms, or equivalent, as 
approved by MARAD.
    (f) All policies issued by foreign underwriters shall include New 
York Suable Clause or Service of Suit (USA) Clause.
    (g)(1) To maintain approval, foreign underwriters, other than those 
specified in Sec. 249.5(b), shall, in addition to retaining the high 
rating from an accepted international rating service, file annual 
financial statements in the same level of detail as required for 
original approval. Such statements shall be due within 120 days after 
the close of the underwriter's annual accounting period.
    (2) In addition, a new affidavit concerning the lack of 
discriminatory laws or practices related to hull insurance in the 
underwriter's home market, as described in Sec. 249.6(c)(3), shall be 
filed annually at the same time as the financial statements.
    (h) Since there is no annual reapproval required, foreign 
underwriters which are approved shall agree to submit additional 
information, as requested by MARAD, if it has reason to believe there 
has been a change in the underwriter's financial status or business 
practices which could affect the quality of its security. Failure to 
provide such information on a timely basis could result in immediate 
withdrawal of the authorization to write hull insurance on MARAD program 
vessels.


<R05>
Sec. 249.8  Limitation on risk.

    (a) Underwriters may take a line on any single risk in excess of 
five percent of its Policyholders' Surplus only with the prior approval 
of MARAD. MARAD will grant such approval to certain underwriters only in 
special circumstances, and for good cause shown. The standard to be 
applied in such cases shall be that the underwriter's net retention on 
any single risk may not exceed five percent of its Policyholders' 
Surplus, the gross amount of the risk may not exceed its surplus, and 
the reinsurers must have a high (A or comparable) rating from an 
accepted international rating service.
    (b) The vessel owner shall also provide MARAD with a mortgagee's 
interest policy in an amount equal to the difference between the net 
retention and the amount of the line taken by such underwriter.


<R05>
Sec. 249.9  American market participation.

    (a) Owners of vessels receiving ODS or Title XI vessel obligation 
guarantees, or their brokers, shall offer to the American marine 
insurance market the opportunity to compete for the placement of marine 
hull insurance on each vessel. Consistent with sound business judgment, 
owners will be expected to place their insurance with the American 
market to the maximum extent possible when the rates, terms and 
conditions offered by American underwriters are competitive with those 
offered by foreign underwriters. MARAD will make available a list of 
approved American underwriters and their capacities.
    (b) In the event that less than 50 percent of the placement is made 
with the American marine insurance market, the owners, or their brokers, 
shall file an affidavit confirming that the risk has been offered to a 
substantial portion of the American market. The affidavit shall list the 
American underwriters to which the risk was offered, and such 
underwriters shall account for at least 50 percent of the approved 
American market capacity, or 75 percent in the event that more than 75 
percent of the risk was placed in foreign markets.
    (c) Failure to comply with (a) or (b), above, may result in MARAD 
requiring that the risk be reoffered and that the existing placement be 
modified, as deemed appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 249.10  Non-discrimination policy.

    To administer effectively the policy regarding non-discrimination

Sec. 251.1  Applications for construction-differential subsidy under Title V, Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended.

    (a) Applications under section 501 of the Act for subsidy to aid in 
the construction of new vessels or the reconstruction of existing 
vessels, to be operated in the foreign commerce of the United States, 
shall be filed on form FMB-8 in accordance with the instructions annexed 
thereto. \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Copies of forms referred to may be obtained on request from the 
Secretary, Maritime Subsidy Board, Washington, D.C.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Applications for aid in the construction of new vessels to be 
operated in domestic trade shall be filed on Form VA-9 in accordance 
with the instructions annexed thereto. \1\

                         Appendix No. 1--Policy

    1. To the maximum practical extent as determined by the Maritime 
Subsidy Board applicants for construction-differential subsidy (CDS) 
under Title V of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, as amended, shall 
duplicate designs of ships previously approved by the Board for 
Subsidized Ship Construction.

[[Page 66]]

Such duplication contemplates retention of: Hull form; major structure, 
i.e., shell, transverse bulkheads, decks, girder systems; etc.; 
machinery horsepower and arrangement; and arrangement of deck house. 
However the Board will permit modifications such as changes to reefer 
cargo capacity, deep tankage, and cargo gear in a manner so as not to 
disrupt the basic configuration of the ship and without sacrificing 
gains that can be made from group production. New ship designs will be 
considered from any operator who has already constructed sufficient 
ships of a given design to have optimized the economy of standardized 
ship construction, when the applicant feels that a new design is 
necessary in exceptional cases and justifies this need to the Board. 
Where the Board concludes contrary to an applicant that a previously 
developed design can be satisfactorily adapted to requirements of the 
intended service at a substantial saving compared with building to a new 
design, invitations to bid shall be issued for both the standard design 
and the custom design of the owner's preference. Construction-
differential subsidy will be based on whichever design requires the 
least subsidy.
    2. The Board may require such variations from designs of ships 
previously approved as are necessary to optimize the economic 
utilization of mechanization and labor saving equipment with the 
potential of reducing operating-differential subsidy (ODS). Other 
nonstandard equipment or shipbuilding components shall be eligible for 
CDS, only if (a) their effect is to decrease the total sum of such CDS 
and ODS projected over the life of a ship, or (b) when it can be 
demonstrated with reasonable certainty that the added investment will 
produce a return to the owner of at least 10 percent per annum after 
taxes over the life of the investment.
    3. Value engineering provisions will be included in all 
construction-differential subsidy contracts and construction contracts. 
Value engineering items considered mandatory by the Board prior to or 
during the development of the bidding plans and specifications and 
during the actual ship construction period shall be incorporated in the 
plans and specifications or incorporated in the ship. If the mandatory 
items are not acceptable to the owner the difference in cost, as 
determined by the Board, between the value engineered and the installed 
item will be borne by the owner. This paragraph shall not be construed 
(a) as revising the present appeal rights of the shipowner, or (b) as 
imposing upon the shipbuilding contractor any requirement for employment 
of a specific number of value engineering personnel.
    4. Subsidy for changes under the construction contract will be 
allowed only when the net effect of the change will with reasonable 
certainty (a) comply with the standard in 2 (a) or (b) above, (b) 
correct a deficiency in design which is clearly essential, or (c) comply 
with a change in the requirement of a regulatory body which becomes 
effective after 30 days preceding bid opening. Any changes desired by 
the owner which do not adversely affect the safe, efficient or 
economical operation of the ship will be permitted, but without the 
benefit of subsidy. Subsidy for changes under category 2(b) shall be 
based on an estimate as to what the work would have cost if it had been 
included in the bidding specifications.
    5. Post-contract engineering costs incurred by the owner for 
engineering review and plan approval will be subsidized within a 
ceiling. The owner's expenses for such engineering and plan approval 
shall be limited for subsidy purposes to a maximum of 2 percent of the 
low bid for each of one ship in each contract. This limitation shall 
apply to liner cargo vessels of the break bulk type with no more than 
twelve passengers, but including special features such as mechanization, 
container carrying devices, special cargo handling equipment, 
refrigeration spaces and special deep tanks, etc. This upper limit shall 
be adjusted downward to take into account features including, but not 
limited to, standardized design, successive flights of ships in the same 
yard, or successive flights of ships in different yards.
    6. Construction-differential subsidy on owner's engineering expenses 
for inspection when only one ship is being built shall be limited to an 
amount equal to 1.3 percent of the bid price. For multiple ship 
construction the amount subsidizable will be 1.3 percent of the contract 
price per ship plus an additional increment of 0.36 percent for each 
vessel beyond the first. For example, the subsidizable amount for 
inspection on a four ship contract would be 1.3 percent plus 1.08 
percent (0.36x3) or 2.38 percent times the cost of the each of four ship 
bid price.
    This limitation shall apply to liner type cargo vessels of the break 
bulk type with no more than 12 passengers but including special features 
such as mechanization, container carrying devices, special cargo 
handling equipment, refrigeration spaces and special deep tanks, etc. 
This upper limitation shall be adjusted downward to take into account 
features including, but not limited to, standardized design, or other 
vessels for the same owner and in the same shipyard.
    7. Interior decorators' fees will be limited to a maximum of $10,000 
per contract.
    8. Construction-differential subsidy will not apply to owner 
furnished equipment. All material or equipment to which construction-
differential subsidy shall apply must be included in the plans and 
specifications upon which the competitive ship construction bids are 
based or included in authorized changes under contract.

[[Page 67]]

    9. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing limitations on subsidy the 
Board will in exceptional cases authorize subsidy or research and 
development grants for new ship concepts or individual ship features 
whose economic justification lie in the possibility of future major 
advances in ship construction or operation and which in the Board's 
judgment may lead to greater efficiency and economy.

               Appendix No. 2--Statement of General Policy

    1. The appropriations available for the payment of construction-
differential subsidy by the Maritime Subsidy Board necessarily are 
limited. Present replacement program schedules for individual operators 
repeatedly have been revised and extended in recent years in accordance 
with the operating-differential subsidy contracts. It is possible that 
further delay will occur in the replacement of some of the vessels 
required to be replaced pursuant to the existing contractual obligations 
of those operators under operating-differential subsidy contracts with 
the Government. These standards are designed to provide better guidance 
for the operators and the Government in making the judgments necessary 
in selecting from among competing applications for limited funds. This 
policy will apply to requests for and allocations of appropriations for 
fiscal year 1967 and thereafter. It furthermore applies only to awards 
of financial assistance in the construction of vessels for liner 
service.
    2. (a) To provide for the optimum development of the American 
Merchant Marine in number of vessels and in shipping capability, the 
Board will allocate federal financial assistance for construction or 
reconstruction of vessels so as to give priority to those proposals 
which, having met all requirements of Title V, Merchant Marine Act, 
1936, will in the Board's opinion utilize such assistance to obtain the 
greatest shipping capability and productivity possible. In making its 
determinations under this policy, the Maritime Subsidy Board will take 
into consideration the following factors:
    (1) Number of vessels proposed for construction by the applicant.
    (2) Cubic and deadweight capacities and speed of the proposed 
vessels.
    (3) Proposed cargo handling equipment and techniques for transfer of 
cargo in and out of vessels and to and from inland points. In this 
connection, the applicant will be required to set forth the estimated 
rate of loading and of discharge of cargo, as well as the adaptability 
of the proposed vessel to integrated systems of transportation embracing 
both ocean and overland transportation.
    (4) Estimated domestic cost of construction.
    (5) Estimated revenues and cost of operation; and with respect to 
wage cost, the proposed manning schedule on the proposed vessels.
    (6) The applicant's intention to seek operating subsidy and if so, 
the duration and amount of such subsidy payments.
    The Board will weigh the above factors in such a fashion as will 
measure the productivity of the vessel (i.e., its carrying capacity, 
speed, and rate of cargo handling) against the Government's cost of 
construction and operating aid. The Board will award aid (so far as 
funds are available) for the construction of those vessels otherwise 
eligible, as will give the greatest productivity for each dollar of 
Government aid.
    (b) The Board reserves for determination at a later time standards 
to be applied in the allocation of federal financial assistance for the 
construction of vessels to be used in non-liner operations.

  Appendix No. 3--Construction-Differential Subsidy for Machinery and 
                       Electric Plant Spare Parts

    1. The total cost of machinery and electric plant spare parts 
(whether shore-based or carried aboard ship), which are in addition to 
those spare parts required by all cognizant regulatory bodies (including 
ABS, Coast Guard and the FCC), which shall be eligible for CDS, shall 
not exceed the amount determined by application of the percentages shown

\2\ Cost of spare anchor, propeller, or tailshaft is not included in
  this allowance and is handled as a separate Maritime Subsidy Board
  action.

    3. This regulation shall be implemented in accordance with the 
following procedures and guidelines:
    (a) The allowance is to be calculated by the Maritime Administration 
and will be included in the contract price for all new contracts for 
which CDS is awarded after this regulation becomes effective. For ships 
under contract on the effective date of this regulation, the regulation 
shall form the basis for permitting a change under contract for 
additional spare parts to be subsidized, provided that a request for CDS 
participation is submitted to the Maritime Administration prior to 
delivery of the applicable ship.
    (b) The allowance is to be fixed and will not be escalated under the 
escalation provisions (if any), of the contract. For changes to existing 
contracts, the allowance will be computed based on the original contract 
price.
    (c) An audit, as deemed appropriate by the Maritime Administration, 
will be made at the end of the contract to determine total spare parts 
expenditures and a change under contract will be issued if actual 
expenditures are less than the allowance. The audit will be based on 
Maritime Administration review of a priced list, by shipyard purchase 
orders, of spare parts furnished pursuant to this Sec. 251.1.
    (d) Shipping and shipyard handling costs are to be included in the 
allowance.
    (e) If the cost of material in a cost class is increased or 
decreased by reason of a change under contract, the total spare parts 
allowance will not be increased or decreased unless included as part of 
the change under contract.
    (f) The actual expenditure of funds for spare parts by the Owner 
need not correspond to the percentages shown in the table which are used 
to determine the total amount eligible for CDS.
    (g) An owner may exceed the limit set by this regulation, provided 
such excess is for his sole account.

                           Subpart C_Operation


<R05>
Sec. 252.20  Subsidized and nonsubsidized voyages.

    (a) Subsidized voyages--(1) Minimum operation. The operator shall 
operate each subsidized vessel for a minimum of 335 days each year in 
the worldwide carriage of bulk cargo in the U.S. foreign commerce and in 
the carriage of such cargo between foreign ports.
    (2) Commencement. The first voyage shall commence at the time 
provided in the ODSA. All subsequent voyages shall commence at 0001 
hours local time of the day following the day of termination of the 
previous voyage or, in the event that a reduced crew period follows such 
termination, at 0001 hours local time of the day following the day on 
which such reduced crew period terminates.
    (3) Termination. A voyage shall terminate at 2400 hours local time:
    (i) In a U.S. port, on the day of completion of (a) paying off the 
crew from foreign articles, (b) discharge of cargo at the last U.S. port 
of discharge, or (c) voyage repairs, whichever event occurs last;
    (ii) In a foreign port, on the day (a) of completion of the 
discharge of cargo if the vessel loads cargo in such port of discharge, 
(b) prior to the day of commencement of loading cargo if the vessel 
departed its last port of cargo discharge in ballast;
    (iii) In the case of special circumstances such as strike or lack of 
cargo activity, on the day approved by the Region Director upon request 
for a variance by the operator; or
    (iv) On the final voyage, on the day provided in the ODSA for 
termination of the final voyage.
    (4) Periods of reduced crew, idleness, delay or lay-up--(i) Report 
by operator. The operator shall report promptly to the Region Director 
any reduced crew period and any period of idleness, lay-

[[Page 72]]

up or delay occurring during or between voyages and the facts and 
circumstances relating to any such period.
    (ii) Region Director's finding. The Region Director shall make a 
finding as to whether the period reported by the operator could have 
been avoided through the efficient and economical operation of the 
vessel and whether operating costs were reduced to a minimum in 
accordance with sound commercial practice. The Region Director shall, by 
means of a written report, promptly advise the operator and Contracting 
Officer of his finding.
    (iii) Contracting Officer's determination. The Contracting Officer 
shall consider the Region Director's finding and shall determine what 
costs, if any, shall be subsidized during the period reported by the 
operator. The Contracting Officer shall promptly advise the operator of 
his determination in writing.
    (b) Nonsubsidized voyages in the U.S. foreign commerce. (1) For any 
period of nonsubsidized service in the U.S. foreign commerce with 
respect to which the Board has granted prior authorization, a vessel 
shall go off subsidy after 2400 hours local time of the day of final 
discharge of cargo on the last subsidized voyage, or in the event the 
nonsubsidized voyage follows a subsidized period of reduced crew, 
idleness or lay-up, the vessel shall be deemed to be off subsidy at 0001 
hours local time of the day following the day on which such period of 
reduced crew, idleness or lay-up terminates. The vessel shall continue 
in this nonsubsidized service until 2400 hours local time of the day of 
final discharge of the nonsubsidized cargo after which time the vessel 
will resume subsidized status. In the event the vessel makes consecutive 
nonsubsidized voyages during any such period of nonsubsidized service, 
it will remain in nonsubsidized status until completion of the final 
nonsubsidized voyage.
    (2) For the purposes of meeting the requirements set forth in 
Sec. Sec. 252.20(a) and 252.21, any such nonsubsidized voyage will be 
considered in the same manner as a subsidized voyage.
    (3) Voyage reports shall be submitted upon the completion of each 
nonsubsidized voyage in the same manner as specified in Sec. 252.23(a) 
and shall clearly indicate that the voyage is nonsubsidized.

<R05>
Sec. 252.21  Essential service requirement.

    (a) Essential service. A vessel which is not subject to a charter, 
or a vessel subject to a charter which does not exceed 5 years duration 
and which may not be extended beyond 5 years duration by exercise of an 
option either within the charter or contained in a separate agreement, 
shall be deemed to be in an essential service, within the meaning of 
section 211(b) of the Act. The operator shall be entitled to the full 
amount of ODS payable under the operator's ODSA (less any reduction with 
respect to the carriage of cargo in the coastwise or intercoastal 
trades, as described in section 605(a) of the Act). A vessel subject to 
a charter which exceeds 5 years duration, or which may be extended 
beyond 5 years duration by exercise of an option (pursuant to provision 
of the charter or any separate agreement), shall not be deemed to be in 
an essential service unless such charter has been approved by the 
Maritime Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Approval of charters. Charters of vessels that exceed 5 years 
duration or that may be extended beyond 5 years duration by exercise of 
an option (pursuant to provision of the charter or any separate 
agreement) shall be submitted to the Maritime Administrator for review 
and approval at least 30 days prior to execution of such charter. 
Charters exceeding 5 years shall be approved if the Maritime 
Administrator finds that the vessel will probably be employed during a 
substantial portion of its economic life in carrying a significant 
volume of cargo in the U.S. foreign commerce. The Maritime Administrator 
shall base this finding on all relevant considerations, including but 
not limited to, the terms of the charter, the business of the charterer 
and the normal tendency for bulk operators to participate substantially 
in U.S. foreign commerce. When the Maritime Administrator has made this 
finding with respect to a vessel, its operations during

[[Page 73]]

any period of subsidized service while subject to that charter shall be 
deemed to be operation in an essential service. The payment of ODS for 
such period shall not be reduced because of any amendment to this 
section or any other provision in this part 252 made prior to expiration 
of the charter. ODSA default provisions shall be applicable to 
noncompliance with this requirement. Charters that do not exceed 5 years 
and do not provide for extension beyond 5 years do not have to be 
submitted for approval by the Maritime Administrator, unless otherwise 
required by the ODSA. Charters previously approved by the Maritime 
Administration under existing procedures are deemed approved for 
purposes of this section.
    (c) Modification of requirement. The Board shall have the authority 
to modify prospectively the provisions of this section as future 
circumstances may dictate. However, any such modification made by the 
Board shall apply only to charters that are executed on or after the 
date of the Board action, and the Board shall have discretion in 
determining whether such modification shall have general or limited 
applicability.
    (d) Applicability. This is a general requirement applicable to the 
payment of ODS to operators of all types of bulk cargo vessels. The 
provisions of any ODS regulations pertaining specifically to dry bulk 
cargo vessels as may be finally adopted by the Maritime Administration 
and set forth in title 46, Code of Federal Regulations, shall govern as 
to dry bulk cargo vessels where such provisions are inconsistent with 
those contained in this section.

<R05>
Sec. 252.22  Substantiality and extent of foreign-flag competition.

    (a) Type and tonnage groupings. Foreign-flag competition shall be 
determined, as of January 1 of the year preceding January 1 of the 
subsidized year, by surveying a data file known as ``Merchant Fleets of 
the World'' that is maintained by MARAD. All foreign-flag bulk cargo 
vessels included in this data file are divided by type and category, and 
further subdivided by class. Classes include, but are not limited to 
general tanker, chemical tanker, OBO, general dry bulk carrier and wood 
chip carrier. Each vessel class is further divided into deadweight 
tonnage ranges as follows:
    (1) Range A-vessels of less than 25,000 DWT;
    (2) Range B-vessels of 25,000 but less than 50,000 DWT;
    (3) Range C-vessels of 50,000 but less than 100,000 DWT; and
    (4) Range D-vessels of 100,000 or more DWT.
    (b) Competitive classes and range. The following classes of foreign-
flag vessels in the same tonnage range as the subsidized vessel shall be 
deemed to be competitive with the subsidized vessel:

                Subsidized Vessels and Foreign-flag Class

    (1) General tanker--general tanker
    (2) Chemical tanker--general and chemical tankers
    (3) OBO--general dry bulk carriers and tankers, OBO, bulk/oil, ore/
oil and ore carriers
    (4) General dry bulk carrier--general dry bulk carriers
    (c) Grouping and ranking competitive foreign-flags. The foreign-flag 
vessels deemed to be competitive with the subsidized vessel shall be 
grouped by nationality and ranked according to the total deadweight 
tonnage under each foreign-flag.
    (d) Competitive foreign flag. The competitive foreign flag shall be 
the flag with the greatest total tonnage in the range.
    (e) Largest foreign flag not competitor. In the event that the Board 
believes that the competitive foreign-flag so determined pursuant to 
this Sec. 252.22 is not a substantial competitor of any particular 
operator, the Board may determine the foreign-flag competition in a 
manner that more accurately reflects the true competition of the 
particular operator. In making this determination, the Board shall 
consider the written views of the operator and any other interested 
parties.

<R05>
Sec. 252.23  Financial and other reporting requirements.

    (a) Voyage report. The operator shall submit a voyage report to the 
Director,

[[Page 74]]

Office of Subsidy Administration, Maritime Administration, Washington, 
DC 20590, upon the completion of each subsidized voyage. Each voyage 
report shall include the following:
    (1) Name of vessel and voyage number.
    (2) Subsidy contract number.
    (3) Vessel activity, including the following:
    (i) Ports of voyage commencement and termination, including dates 
and times.
    (ii) Loading ports, including dates of arrival and departure and 
long tons of cargo loaded (specify commodity).
    (iii) Discharge ports, including dates of arrival and departure and 
long tons of cargo discharged.
    (iv) Other ports, ports of bunkering, emergency calls, etc., 
including dates of arrival and departure (specify reason for call).
    (4) All reduced crew periods, all periods of idleness, lay-up and 
delay, and all related correspondence with the Region Director.
    (b) Condition of vessels, inspection and repairs. In order that the 
Maritime Administration may participate in the inspection of vessels, in 
compliance with part 272 of this subchapter, the operator shall give at 
least 24 hours notice to the Region Director as to the time and place of 
vessel inspections.
    (c) Vessel insurance--(1) Policies. Upon the binding of any 
insurance policy with respect to a subsidized vessel, the operator shall 
submit promptly to the Director, Office of Marine Insurance, Maritime 
Administration, Washington, DC 20590, for approval of the Maritime 
Administration, a signed copy of each cover note issued by the 
operator's brokers, which, to the extent applicable, shall set forth as 
to such vessel the amounts covered by hull, increased value and other 
forms of total loss protection, as well as protection and indemnity 
insurance. Such cover notes shall include the rates, the amounts placed 
in the different markets, the participating underwriters, the amount 
underwritten by each underwriter, and the amounts of the deductibles. 
Upon request, copies of the policy shall be submitted to the Maritime 
Administration for examination.
    (2) Cancellation and policy changes. The operator shall advise the 
Maritime Administration promptly of the cancellation of any policy of 
insurance, any changes in the terms or underwriters of any policy of 
insurance, any period of lay-up that permits the collection of return 
premiums, and the occurrence of any major casualty or total loss covered 
by a policy of insurance.
    (d) Financial statements. The operator shall submit, in triplicate, 
to the Director, Office of Financial Approvals, Maritime Administration, 
Washington, DC 20590, the following reports, including management 
footnotes where necessary to make a fair financial presentation:
    (1) Not later than 120 days after the close of the operator's 
semiannual accounting period, a Form MA-172 on a semiannual basis, in 
accordance with 46 CFR 232.6.
    (2) Not later than 120 days after the close of the operator's annual 
accounting period an audited annual financial statement, in accordance 
with 46 CFR 232.6.

(Reporting requirements for paragraph (a) were approved by the Office of 
Management and Budget under control number 2133-0024 and reporting 
requirements for paragraph (d) were approved by the Office of Management 
and Budget under control number 2133-005)

Sec. 252.24  Continued eligibility for subsidy.

    Operators shall remain eligible for ODS so long as they are engaged 
in service which would, under this part and sections 601(a), 602, and 
605(c) of the Act, qualify for approval of an ODSA. The payment of ODS 
will be made only for carriage of commercial cargoes for which U.S.-flag 
vessels are in direct competition with foreign-flag vessels. An example 
of cargo that is excluded is bulk cargo reported by a shipper as the 
U.S.-flag share of cargoes subject to an agreement (including a 
unilateral commitment by a foreign government which has the effect of 
reserving cargoes for U.S.-flag vessels), between the United States and 
a foreign government in connection with

[[Page 75]]

any U.S. cash transfer foreign assistance program. In such a 
circumstance, there is no foreign-flag competitions for such cargoes.

                 Subpart D_Calculation of Subsidy Rates

    Source: 51 FR 40426, Nov. 7, 1986, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 252.30  Amount of subsidy payable.

    (a) Daily rates. Daily ODS rates shall be used to quantify the 
amount of ODS payable except for the ODS rates applicable to maintenance 
and repair expenses, as described separately in Sec. 252.32. The daily 
ODS rate represents the cost differential between the subsidized vessel 
and its foreign-flag competition. A daily rate shall be calculated for 
each subsidized item of expense identified in the ODSA (with the 
exception of ODS rates applicable to maintenance and repair expenses), 
and the total of all items is the daily amount of ODS payable for 
approved vessel operating days, excluding reduced crew periods.
    (b) Reduced crew periods. For reduced crew periods, as defined in 
Sec. 252.3 of this part, a man-day reduction amount, calculated 
separately for officers and unlicensed crew members, shall be used to 
reduce the daily wage ODS rate to conform to the complement remaining on 
the vessel. The man-day reduction amounts shall be determined by 
dividing the daily wage ODS for officers and unlicensed crew members by 
the number of subsidizable crew members in each category. For each day 
of a reduced crew period, the man-day amount shall be multiplied by the 
number of crew members missing for that day, and the resulting product 
shall be deducted from the daily ODS rate. The difference shall be the 
ODS payable for such day. (See illustration in Schedule C at Sec. 
252.41 of this part.)
    (c) Review of rates. Daily subsidy rates shall be reviewed every six 
months. For the item, ``wages of officers and crews,'' the daily rate 
shall be calculated for fiscal periods July 1 through June 30, in 
accordance with provisions of the Act. During the period January through 
June, adjustments--paid as a lump sum or as a daily amount--shall be 
made to wage ODS so that the correct amount of ODS for the full fiscal 
period is received by the operator. For other subsidizable items of 
expense, the daily rate shall be calculated for calendar years.
    (d) Negative rates. When an ODS rate in any category is less than 
zero, indicating that the subsidized operator is at an advantage rather 
than a disadvantage in such category, the negative rate shall be 
deducted from positive rates in determining the daily ODS amount 
payable.
    (e) Operator Comments. The operator shall have the opportunity to 
comment on each subsidy rate as calculated by MARAD. The operator and 
contracting officer shall make every effort to resolve disagreements 
that arise. In the event of a disagreement that cannot be resolved, 
comments received from the operator and the contracting officer's 
recommendation shall be presented to the Board for its consideration in 
determining subsidy rates.

<R05>
Sec. 252.31  Wages of officers and crews.

    (a) Definitions. When used in this part:
    (1) Base period. The first base period under the wage index systems, 
as provided in section 603 of the Act, is the period beginning July 1, 
1970 and ending June 30, 1971. Thereafter, base period means any annual 
period beginning July 1 and ending June 30, with respect to which the 
Board establishes a base period cost. At intervals of not less than two 
years, nor more than four years, the Maritime Subsidy Board shall 
establish a new base period. Base periods shall be announced by the 
Board prior to the December 31 date that would be included in the new 
base period.
    (2) Base period cost--(i) Initial base period. For the initial base 
period of subsidized service, the term base period cost means the 
collective bargaining cost as of January 1 of that base period.
    (ii) Subsequent base periods. For base periods subsequent to the 
initial base

[[Page 76]]

period, the term base period cost means the average of the collective 
bargaining cost as of January 1 of such fiscal year, and the base period 
cost of the previous base period, indexed to January 1 of the new base 
period by an index compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This 
index shall consist of the average annual change in wages and benefits 
placed into effect for employees covered by collective bargaining 
agreements, with equal weight to be given to changes affecting employees 
in the transportation industry (excluding the off-shore maritime 
industry) and to changes affecting employees in private non-agricultural 
industries other than transportation. However, such base period cost 
shall not be less than a minimum, nor more than a maximum amount, 
determined as a percentage of the collective bargaining cost computed 
for January 1 of such base period in accordance with the following 
schedule:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                  Minimum      Maximum
                                                   (pct)        (pct)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Base period following a:
  2 year cycle................................      97\1/2\     102\1/2\
  3 year cycle................................      96\1/4\     103\3/4\
  4 year cycle................................           95          105
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Collective bargaining cost (CBC) means the annual cost, 
calculated on the basis of the per diem rate of expense, as of January 1 
of the annual fiscal periods July 1 through June 30, of all items of 
expense required by the operator through a collective bargaining or 
other agreement, covering the employment of the approved manning 
complement of the subsidized vessel, including payments required by law 
to assure old-age pensions, unemployment benefits or similar benefits, 
and taxes or other governmental assessments on crew payrolls.
    (4) Approved manning complement means the complement approved by the 
Board for subsidy.
    (5) U.S. wage cost (WC) means the annual cost, calculated on the 
basis of the per diem rate of expense as of January 1 of the annual 
fiscal periods July 1 through June 30, of all items of expense required 
of the operator through a collective bargaining or other agreement, 
covering the employment of the normal manning complement of the 
subsidized vessel, including payments required by law to assure old-age 
pensions, unemployment benefits or similar benefits, and taxes or other 
governmental assessments on crew payrolls.
    (6) Normal manning complement means the crew complement established 
by a collective bargaining or other agreement with the officers and 
unlicensed crew of the vessel. When ratings of different salaries are in 
the same job during the year, the base wages of the rating carried most 
of the time shall be used.
    (7) Subsidizable wage cost means, (i) with respect to a base period, 
the base period cost, and (ii) in any fiscal period other than a base 
period, the most recent base period cost, increased or decreased by the 
change from January 1 of the base period to January 1 of the non-base 
period. The subsidizable wage cost shall not be less than 90 percent nor 
greater than 110 percent of the collective bargaining cost as of January 
1 of such period.
    (8) Unpredictably timed costs are collective bargaining costs that 
are not regularly incurred. Examples of unpredictably timed costs are 
such costs as severance pay, shortfalls, special assessments, and war 
zone bonuses.
    (b) Method of calculating collective bargaining cost (CBC). CBC 
shall be determined by pricing out, for the approved crew complement, 
the per diem total of fixed costs specified in the collective bargaining 
agreement and adding a per diem total of variable costs obtained from 
the cost experience of the subsidized vessel during the first nine 
months of the preceding calendar year.
    (1) Fixed Costs. The per diem total of fixed costs shall include all 
costs that are stated in specific or determinable amounts per time 
period and, based on operating experience, do not vary. In cases where a 
monthly amount is specified in the agreement, the per diem amount shall 
be determined by dividing the monthly amount by 30. When a daily amount 
is specified it shall be used. Examples of fixed costs are:
    (i) Base wages:
    (ii) Non-watch pay;
    (iii) Vacation pay (including contributions to vacation funds);
    (iv) Tool allowance;

[[Page 77]]

    (v) Clothing and uniform allowances; and
    (vi) Per diem contributions for pension, training, welfare, 
unemployment, including unallocated contributions placed in escrow.
    (2) Variable costs. Variable costs are regularly incurred employment 
costs which vary with ship operating experience. The per diem aggregate 
of variable costs as of January 1 shall be determined by applying a 
ratio to the per diem aggregate of base wage costs as of January 1, the 
numerator of which shall be the total of variable costs for the first 
nine months of the preceding calendar year and the denominator of which 
shall be the total of base wage costs for the first nine months of the 
preceding calendar year. Variable costs include but are not limited to:
    (i) Payroll taxes (including social security taxes);
    (ii) Overtime and penalty pay;
    (iii) Variable pension, training, welfare, unemployment, and 
vacation costs;
    (iv) Pay in lieu of time off;
    (v) Transportation and travel allowances;
    (vi) Payments to relief officers and crews;
    (vii) Wages and other expenses of USMMA cadets and extra messmen;
    (viii) Board and lodging allowances;
    (ix) Overlap in wages (a maximum of three days for officers and two 
days for unlicensed crew); and
    (x) Penalty cargo bonuses.
    (c) Method of calculating U.S. wage cost (WC). Two different 
calculations of WC are necessary--a per diem amount for every ship type 
on the service and a per month amount for the predominant ship type 
(most voyages) on the service. The purpose of the per month calculation 
is to make a comparison with the monthly foreign wage costs. The 
relationship of WC to foreign costs for the predominant ship is applied 
to the per diem WC for other ship types in the service to estimate 
comparable foreign costs for them.
    (1) Calculation of per diem WC. The per diem WC shall be calculated 
by the same method that applies to CBC, except that the normal manning 
complement shall be used.
    (2) Calculation of per month WC. The costs and manning level used in 
this calculation shall be the same as those used for the per diem WC.
    (d) Data submission requirements. For purposes of calculating CBC 
and WC the operator shall each year submit Form MA-790 and, as 
appropriate, current copies of all collective bargaining or other 
agreements, memoranda of understanding, and arbitration awards, which 
specify the fixed costs as of January 1. Schedule A of Form MA-790,

    (f) Method of calculating foreign wage costs. The foreign wage cost 
(FC) of the

[[Page 78]]

principal foreign-flag competitor and the comparable WC of the 
subsidized vessel are matched as of January 1 of the last fiscal year 
preceding the subsidized fiscal year for purposes of determining the 
wage cost of the principal foreign flags. The following procedures are 
used:
    (1) Manning. The foreign manning complement in number and 
nationality for the principal foreign-flag competitor shall be 
constructed for the subsidized vessel type using the manning scales and 
practice of the competitor as developed through an examination of alien 
crew manifests, payrolls, and other reliable information. The commonly 
used crew complement of the competitor shall be adjusted to fit the 
predominant vessel type, in recognition of differences in physical 
characteristics that would affect manning scales. Where the manning 
complement cannot be estimated with reasonable substantiation, it will 
be deemed to be identical with that of the subsidized vessel.
    (2) Method. The method of calculating FC shall be the same as that 
used for WC, provided that it is possible to obtain foreign cost data on 
the same basis as wage cost data. Preference shall be given to pricing 
out for fixed costs and to cost experience for variable costs. Where 
applicable, foreign currencies shall be converted into U.S. currency 
equivalents by using the average of end-month exchange rates for the 
period July through June that includes the January 1 for which FC is 
calculated. The exchange rates shall be obtained from the publication, 
``International Financial Statistics'', published monthly by the 
International Monetary Fund. If exchange rates for particular foreign 
currencies are not available in this publication, they shall be obtained 
from the United States Department of the Treasury.
    (3) Foreign wage costs. The per diem composite foreign wage cost is 
determined by multiplying the per diem WC for the U.S. ship type, 
calculated as of January 1 of the subsidized fiscal year, by the ratio 
of FC to WC, calculated as of January 1 of the last fiscal year 
preceding the subsidized fiscal year. The following is a sample 
calculation of the foreign percentage.

    (g) Determination of daily wage rate. The foreign wage cost is 
deducted from subsidizable wage costs to determine the daily wage 
subsidy rate. Table 1 is an example calculation of a daily wage subsidy 
rate using the procedures described in this section.
    (h) Unpredictably timed costs (UTC) are subsidized by calculating 
costs incurred during the previous six months and converting them into a 
daily rate. A lump sum amount would be paid for special lump sum 
assessments or for per man-day increases to benefits plans which become 
effective during the six months following the establishment of the daily 
rate. In either case, the percentage subsidy rate--which is the 
differential percentage between the subsidizable wage cost and the 
foreign wage cost--is used to establish the amount of subsidy payable 
for UTC incurred.
    (1) UTC expenses such as severance pay and area bonuses shall be 
eligible for subsidy payment without obtaining prior approval and 
subsidy shall be paid as a lump sum amount.
    (2) Expenses such as shortfalls in benefit fund contributions, 
special assessments for benefits funds, and retroactive wage increases 
may be treated as UTC if the cost increase was not negotiated. Such 
costs must be approved as UTC by the Director, Office of Ship Operating 
Costs. To the extent such expenses qualify for UTC, the Director shall 
determine the appropriate method of paying subsidy--added to the per 
diem wage subsidy rate and/or as a lump sum amount treated separately.

Sec. 252.32  Maintenance (upkeep) and repairs.

    (a) Subsidy items. The fair and reasonable maintenance and repair 
costs not compensated by insurance, if eligible for subsidy under the 
ODSA and the regulations in 46 CFR part 272, incurred by the operator 
during the calendar year.
    (b) Subsidy rate. The subsidy rate for maintenance and repair shall 
be the U.S.-foreign cost differential determined from price estimates of 
representative items of maintenance and repair work and by using the 
repair practices of the foreign-flag competition. See paragraph (b)(4) 
of this section for an example calculation.
    (1) Cost survey. MARAD shall select a sample of jobs which are 
representative of the various types of maintenance and repair work--
drydocking and underwater repairs, machinery repairs, hull and deck 
repairs, electrical repairs, exterior painting and interior painting, 
etc. The jobs shall be described fully and combined into a standard set 
of specifications based on a particular type of vessel. The same 
specifications shall be used for obtaining all price estimates. MARAD 
shall request reliable and mutually acceptable ship repair cost experts 
to ascertain the U.S. and foreign M&R prices. MARAD shall survey foreign 
countries during a three-year cycle. The survey year prices shall be 
adjusted in the years between surveys by price adjustments estimated by 
the ship repair cost experts.
    (2) Country cost differential. A country cost differential shall be 
determined for each country where work was performed on the competitive 
vessels. The country cost differential shall be 100 percent minus the 
ratio of the estimated foreign price to the U.S. price estimate. The 
U.S. price estimate shall be representative of the coastal area included 
in the subsidized service (for example East Coast) or, if more than one 
coast is served, the coast where the company is home based. For example:

Country Cost Differential (100-34)--66%.

    (3) Distribution of repairs. The distribution of repairs refers to 
the countries where M&R work was performed on the vessels of the 
foreign-flag competitor. When data on the repairing practices are 
obtained directly from the foreign competitor, they shall be used. If 
information about such practices is unavailable--or only partially 
available--data, published by the classification societies and Lloyd's 
Voyage Record, reporting the dates and localities of drydocking and 
completion of the various types of vessel surveys, shall be used for 
determining the geographical distribution of the unknown repairing 
practices. If such information is unavailable, repairing practices shall 
be determined on the basis of the industry as a whole.
    (4) M&R subsidy rate. The U.S.-foreign cost differential for the 
foreign-flag competitor shall be determined by multiplying the 
percentage distribution of repairs for each country where repair work 
was performed by the country cost differential for that country, and by 
adding the resulting weighted cost differential for all countries. For 
example:

Sec. 252.33  Hull and machinery insurance.

    (a) Subsidy items. The fair and reasonable net premium costs 
(including stamp taxes) of hull and machinery, increased value, excess 
general average, salvage, and collision liability insurance against 
risks and liabilities covered under the terms and conditions of policies 
approved as to form and coverage by MARAD, less lay-up returns, shall be 
eligible for subsidy and used for determining the U.S.-foreign cost 
differential. Port risk premiums are eligible for subsidy but not for 
determining the U.S.-foreign cost differential.
    (b) U.S.-foreign cost differential. A U.S.-foreign cost differential 
shall be calculated for the service. Due to the difficulty of comparing 
forms and costs of hull and machinery insurance coverages, the following 
assumptions shall be used for estimating the composite premium cost of 
the foreign-flag competitor.
    (1) Coverage. The foreign competitive vessels have the same types 
and amounts of insurance coverages and deductible averages as the 
subsidized vessels.
    (2) Premium rate. The foreign competitive vessels are insured in the 
British market and the rate for such vessels is the same as the British 
market rate for

[[Page 81]]

the subsidized vessels. If the operator carries all of its insurance in 
the American market, the American market rate shall be assumed to be the 
same as the British market rate.
    (3) Repairs. Insurable repairs of the foreign competitive vessels 
are performed in the same countries and in the same distribution as non-
insurable repairs, and the cost differential for such repairs shall be 
the same as the maintenance and repair percentage differential.
    (4) Particular average. The percentage of particular average repair 
claims for the foreign competitive vessels is the same as the percentage 
of particular average repair claims for the subsidized vessels. The 
particular average portion of the premium cost for the subsidized 
vessels shall be determined as follows:
    (i) Percentage. The particular average portion of the premium cost 
shall be determined by applying a percentage to the hull and machinery 
premium cost after deducting the estimated total loss premium. The 
percentage is based on insured claims experience. The percentage shall 
be determined by dividing the total of underwriter's absorptions for 
particular average domestic repair claims paid and estimated by the 
total of underwriter's absorptions for all claims paid and estimated 
(excluding total loss and constructive total loss claims) under the hull 
and machinery portion of the insurance coverage, except that such 
percentage shall not exceed eighty-five (85) percent. The percentage is 
based on the claims experience of the subsidized vessels for the five 
(5) calendar year period preceding the subsidized year. For subsidized 
operators that do not have five years of claims experience, the average 
percentage of particular average domestic repair claims for all similar 
subsidized vessels shall be used unless the operator can submit data to 
substantiate its own claims cost experience on similar vessels.
    (ii) Data submission requirement. The operator shall submit the five 
year claims experience, invoices showing net premium costs and coverages 
for the subsidized year, and lay-up returns for the previous year to the 
Director, Office of Ship Operating Costs, not later than sixty (60) days 
after the close of each calendar year.
    (c) Calculation. In calculating the subsidized premium cost, the 
following steps shall be taken:
    (1) The particular average portion of the premium cost shall be 
adjusted in order to give effect to the repair cost differential for the 
foreign competitive vessels by applying the complement of the 
maintenance and repairs percentage cost differential (100 percent minus 
the differential) to the particular average portion of the premium cost. 
The adjusted particular average foreign premium cost shall be added to 
the net premium cost excluding the particular average portion to 
determine the composite foreign premium cost.
    (2) The foreign premium cost shall be subtracted from the operator's 
total premium cost to determine the difference in dollars. The 
percentage differential is determined by dividing the dollar difference 
by the operator's total premium cost. An example calculation is included 
in Table 2.
    (3) The net premium cost of the subsidized vessels shall be divided 
by the number of days in the calendar year and the resultant daily 
insurance cost shall be multiplied by the U.S.-foreign cost differential 
percentage applicable to the most recent year to determine the daily 
amount of subsidy for hull and machinery insurance.

Sec. 252.34  Protection and indemnity insurance.

    (a) Subsidy items. Items eligible for determination of subsidizable 
costs and the U.S.-foreign cost differential are:
    (1) Premiums. The fair and reasonable net premium costs (including 
stamp taxes) of protection and indemnity, excess insurance, second 
seamen's insurance, ``tovalop'' or other forms of pollution insurance, 
bumbershoot (only that portion identified as applicable to P&I 
insurance), cargo liability if excluded from the primary policy, 
supplemental calls against liabilities covered under the terms and 
conditions of policies approved as to form and coverage by MARAD, less 
lay-up return premiums, shall be eligible for subsidy and used for 
determining the U.S.-foreign cost differential.
    (2) Deductibles. The fair and reasonable cost of crew claims paid by 
and pending with the operator under the deductible provision of the 
protection and indemnity insurance policy approved as to form and 
coverage by MARAD, to the extent that such cost would have been paid by 
the insurance underwriter under the terms of the policy, except for the 
fact that it did not exceed the deductible provision of the policy, 
shall be eligible for subsidy. For subsidy purposes, the deductible 
absorption shall not exceed $50,000 for each accident or occurrence, 
provided however, that benefits paid on unearned wages, if excluded from 
coverage under the protection and indemnity insurance policy, shall be 
eligible, notwithstanding that the deductible provisions of the policy 
may be exceeded.
    (b) Assumptions made in calculation. For purposes of determining 
subsidy for protection and indemnity insurance, it shall be assumed that 
the cost differential between the subsidized vessels and the foreign 
competitive vessels is limited to those portions of premium costs and 
deductible absorptions which are related to crew liability and that the 
cost of all other liabilities is the same for both the subsidized 
vessels and the foreign competitive vessels.
    (c) Calculation. The following is the method of calculating the 
U.S.-foreign cost differential for premiums:
    (1) General. A differential shall be calculated for the service of 
the vessels. Since the premium cost for all other liabilities is assumed 
to be the same for both the U.S. and foreign competitive vessels, the 
calculation of the differential for protection and indemnity insurance 
premiums is in effect based on the difference between U.S. and foreign 
premium costs for crew liabilities. Premium costs are determined in 
costs per gross registered ton (GRT).
    (2) Reporting requirement. The operator shall submit the total 
premium cost for the subsidized year, plus any supplemental calls and 
lay-up return premiums not previously reported, to the Director, Office 
of Ship Operating Costs, not later than 60 days after the beginning of 
such year. The data shall be supported by invoices from the insurance 
underwriter.
    (3) U.S. crew liability cost. the crew liability portion of the 
total premium cost shall be determined by applying a percentage to the 
total premium cost based on five (5) years of claims experience for the 
five years commencing six

[[Page 83]]

years prior to January 1 of the subsidized year. The percentage shall be 
determined by dividing the total of underwriter's absorptions for crew 
claims, paid and estimated, by the total of underwriter's absorptions 
for all claims, paid and estimated. The crew claims portion shall be 
limited to eighty-five (85) percent unless the operator can substantiate 
a higher percentage as a result of having crew liability and all other 
liabilities insured with different underwriters. The operator shall 
submit the five-year claims experience not later than 60 days following 
the close of each calendar year.
    (4) All other liabilities cost--U.S. and foreign. The all other 
liabilities portion of the U.S. premium cost shall be determined by 
subtracting the crew liability portion from the total premium cost. The 
same cost shall be used for the all other liabilities portion of the 
foreign-flag competitor's premium cost.
    (5) Foreign crew liability cost. The crew liability cost of each 
principal foreign-flag competitor shall be used, if reliable cost data 
can be obtained. If such data cannot be obtained for a principal 
competitor, and it is determined that such competitor has a non-national 
crew, the crew liability cost for similar vessels registered under the 
flag of the crew's nationality may be used, at the Board's discretion, 
provided reliable cost data are obtained. If no reliable cost data are 
obtained for a competitor, the crew liability cost for that competitor 
shall be estimated by multiplying the subsidized operator's crew 
liability portion of the total premium cost by the ratio of that 
competitor's wage costs (FC) to the subsidized operator's wage costs 
(WC), as determined in the calculation of the wage differential.
    (6) U.S.-Foreign cost differential. The U.S.-foreign cost 
differential shall be the excess of the operator's total premium cost 
over the principal foreign-flag competitor's estimated total premium 
cost, expressed as a percentage, calculated in the following manner.

\2\ Crew Liability data obtained by Maritime Administration.
Note: The unweighted percentage of foreign to U.S. wage costs would be
  used to estimate the foreign cost if the foreign crew liability data
  were not available.

    (d) Daily subsidy rate. The daily subsidy rate shall be calculated 
in the following manner:
    (1) Premiums. The net premium costs per calendar day for the 
subsidized year shall be multiplied by the U.S.-foreign cost 
differential percentage determined for the most recent year. The product 
shall be the daily amount of subsidy for P&I premiums.
    (2) Deductibles. (i) The eligible illness and injury crew claims 
paid and pending for each calendar year of a three-year period 
commencing six years prior to January 1 of the subsidized year, shall be 
recalculated, if necessary, to reflect the operator's current deductible 
levels. These expenses, after audit, shall be multiplied by the 
percentage wage differential, and determined in the calculation of wage 
subsidy for the appropriate fiscal period. The resulting calendar period 
P&I deductible subsidy for the three-year period shall be divided by the 
voyage days for the period to arrive at an aggregate daily P&I 
deductible subsidy. The aggregate fiscal period wage subsidy accrued for 
the three-year period shall be divided by the voyage days for the period 
to arrive at an aggregate daily wage subsidy amount. The aggregate daily 
P&I deductible subsidy for the three-year calendar period shall be 
divided by the aggregate daily wage subsidy for the three-year period. 
The P&I deductible differential shall be divided by the fiscal period 
wage differential in the service for the three-year period, and the 
resulting percentage shall be applied to the wage per diem calculated 
for each ship type in the service to derive the daily amount of subsidy 
for P&I

[[Page 84]]

deductibles. As to pending claims previously recognized in the 
historical period, only the amount of changes in cost with respect to 
such claims shall be subsequently recognized. The following methodology 
shall determine subsidy for P&I deductibles.

    (ii) In cases where national insurance schemes cover crew claims 
costs in their entirety, resulting in no cost to the foreign competitor 
for deductible absorptions, the composite percentage differential for 
wages shall be adjusted by substituting a zero cost for such foreign 
competitor in the calculation of the differential. The adjustment of the 
wage percentage differential shall not be used for Japan, where 
operators incur minimal costs for deductible absorptions, rather than no 
costs. For Japan, the insurance related costs which are normally 
included in the calculation of Japanese wage costs shall be excluded in 
adjusting the wage percentage differential for this purpose.
    (3) Data submission requirement. The operator is required to submit 
annually a certified statement of eligible and audited crew claims as 
identified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section for the historical period 
identified therein. The report shall be submitted to the Director, 
Office of Ship Operating Costs, no later than January 1 of the 
subsidized year.

Sec. 252.40  Payment of subsidy.

    (a) Submission of voucher. At the close of each calendar month, the 
subsidized operator may submit a voucher, and include for payment in 
such voucher the amount of ODS accrued for the voyages terminated during 
the period.
    (b) Maintenance and repair subsidy. In the case of payments for 
maintenance and repair subsidy only, the subsidized operator shall 
submit an initial voucher and include for payment in such voucher a 
percentage of the ODS payable for the period covered by the voucher, 
which percentage shall be negotiated between MARAD and the subsidized 
operator, but in no instance shall exceed 90 percent. Upon the 
completion of MARAD's determinations that the expenses are fair and 
reasonable, MARAD's computation of the ratio of subsidized vs. 
nonsubsidized days during the calendar year in which the last voyage 
terminated, and the Office of the Inspector General's audit of 
subsidizable expenses, the subsidized operator shall submit a final 
voucher for an adjustment of the amount of subsidy paid.

Sec. 272.24  Subsidy repair summaries.

    (a) Filing requirements. The Operator of an Eligible Vessel shall 
submit to the appropriate MARAD regional Ship Operations Office a 
Subsidy Repair Summary (Form MA-140) for each quarter of a calendar year 
in which one or more of the Operator's Eligible Vessels (including any 
vessel which has been temporarily withdrawn from subsidized service) 
terminates a voyage. This quarterly report shall include supporting 
documents and information, as described in paragraph (c) of this 
section. This summary may be for either a single voyage or multiple 
voyages, and shall be filed not later than 120 days after:
    (1) The close of the calendar quarter in which a voyage is 
terminated, or
    (2) The date the reported vessel is temporarily or permanently 
withdrawn from subsidized service.
    (b) Form requirements. MARAD will make available one copy of Form 
MA-140 upon request. Each Operator shall furnish its own supply of the 
form and prepare each form for submission. Information on any Form MA-
140 shall pertain to only one vessel. The Operator's superintendent 
engineer or other responsible official shall certify every summary 
submitted by an Operator in the following manner:

This is to certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, and 
based on recorded entries through (Date), this is a true and correct 
statement of repair and maintenance expenditures for the period stated, 
and that the repair and maintenance items indicated as eligible for 
subsidy participation are reasonably attributable to service subsequent 
to commencement of the first voyage under the Operating-Differential 
Subsidy Agreement and were necessary, satisfactorily completed, and the 
price is fair and reasonable (exceptions are listed on separate page).

    (c) Categorization. The Operator shall exercise due diligence in 
identifying each item in the Form MA-140 within the following three 
separate categories:
    (1) Claimed for subsidy. This includes the following:
    (i) M&R
    (ii) Spare Parts
    (iii) Improvements
    (2) Marine loss. If any M&R expense is incurred because of marine 
loss, the Operator shall list such an M&R expense under this separate 
category, and shall exclude such expense from the totals for the 
``Claimed for Subsidy'' and ``Non-Subsidized Items'' categories provided 
for in this section.
    (3) Non-subsidized items. This category shall include builders' 
guarantee items, foreign repairs, and other items of M&R expense not 
claimed for subsidy.
    (d) Required supporting documents and information--(1) General. The 
Operator shall support every item in the Form MA-140 with documents or 
other information, in sufficient detail to permit MARAD to determine the 
fairness and reasonableness of the prices for the submitted work. With 
respect to any claims for M&R performed outside the United States, the 
Operator shall submit with the claim a certificate, signed

[[Page 93]]

either by the Operator (if it uses its own shore gang labor or materials 
from its own inventory) or by an official of the ship repair yard or the 
independent contractor performing the work, stating that the M&R were 
performed with materials, labor, or both, of Domestic Origin.
    (2) U.S. Independent contractors. If a U.S. independent contractor 
performed M&R work, the Operator shall support each such expense with 
one copy of the contractor's invoices covering the work performed. If an 
invoice is not itemized and fully descriptive of the work performed with 
item prices then the Operator shall attach to the contractor's invoice 
other supporting documentation, such as specifications, prepared in 
sufficient detail to permit a determination of the fairness and 
reasonableness of the prices for each segment of the work performed.
    (3) Operator's shore gang. If an Operator's own U.S. shore gang has 
performed any M&R work, the Operator shall submit with the Form MA-140 
specifications covering that work, prepared in sufficient detail 
(including the material and labor cost of each item) to permit a 
determination of the specific cost of each segment of work performed.
    (4) Operator furnished material. Whenever an Operator furnishes to a 
contractor material obtained either from the Operator's own ship stores 
or shoreside inventory, or by direct purchase for a specific job, the 
Operator shall include on the invoice, requisition form or other form of 
transfer memorandum the item number for which the material was used and 
the contract number covering the work performed.
    (5) Spare parts. The Operator shall ensure that the invoice covering 
any Spare Part for an Eligible Vessel which is to be used or installed 
as an integral, permanent part of the vessel, indicates the specific 
piece or part of the vessel's hull, machinery, or Equipment for which 
the Spare Part was obtained.
    (6) Foreign repairs. Operators receiving M&R subsidy shall submit 
copies of all U.S. Customs entry forms detailing foreign expenditures on 
behalf of Eligible Vessels. The copies shall include all expenditures 
made during the quarter.

<R05>
Sec. 272.25  Requirements for subsidy repayment.

    (a) Repayment of M&R subsidy for compensated marine or other loss. 
If an Operator eventually receives compensation from an insurer or any 
other person for a marine loss or any other loss for which M&R subsidy 
has been paid, the Operator shall repay to MARAD an amount equal to the 
amount of subsidy paid with respect to that loss.
    (b) Repayment of M&R subsidy for Improvements--three year service 
requirement. If, within three years after the completion of an 
Improvement for which M&R subsidy was paid, the Operator permanently 
withdraws the Eligible Vessel from the ODSA, the Operator shall repay to 
MARAD an amount equal to the amount of M&R subsidy paid with respect to 
that Improvement unless MARAD shall have determined that such action was 
beyond the control of the Operator.
    (c) Repayment of M&R subsidy due to allocation of costs. If the 
allocation of total M&R costs required by Sec. 272.41(e) of this part 
results in the allocation of a lesser amount of subsidizable M&R costs 
than were actually paid for during the calendar year, the Operator shall 
repay to MARAD the amount of ODS which was paid in excess of the 
allocated subsidizable costs.
    (d) Administrative action. If an Operator fails to repay an M&R 
subsidy required to be repaid by this section, MARAD may either reduce 
any ODS payable by the amount of M&R subsidy required to be repaid by 
this section, or take any other action necessary to secure repayment.


<R04>
                           Subpart D_Penalties


<R05>
Sec. 272.31  Determination of penalty.

    Operators whose Eligible Vessels have undergone foreign repairs, 
which MARAD determines are non-emergency in nature, may be subject to a 
penalty in an amount equal to the total cost (exclusive of applicable 
U.S. Customs duties) of such foreign repairs and purchases, such penalty 
to be effected by a

[[Page 94]]

deduction from the Operator's total ODS otherwise accrued. The Director, 
Office of Ship Operating Assistance, shall notify the Operator by letter 
with respect to:
    (a) MARAD's determination of a penalty and the reasons therefore; 
and
    (b) Whether the determination is final or subject to the submission 
of additional information.


<R05>
Sec. 272.32  Mitigation of penalty.

    The Director, Office of Ship Operating Assistance, may decide, after 
a non-emergency foreign repair occurs, to mitigate the penalty. Any 
mitigation of penalty shall be based on a determination that special 
circumstances existed at the time of repair. The Director shall not 
consider the difference in the price of foreign and domestic repair work 
in making this determination, and shall not grant prior approval of 
foreign repairs. In determining whether special circumstances existed, 
the Director shall consider, among others, the following factors:
    (a) The trading area of the vessel both before and after the repair 
was performed;
    (b) Loss of revenue and effect on vessel utilization if the vessel 
had returned to the United States for repairs;
    (c) The additional operating expense which would have resulted from 
a return to the United States to repair the vessel; and
    (d) Whether the repairs could have been deferred until return to the 
United States, taking into consideration the Coast Guard requirements 
for dry docking and special surveys.


<R05>
Sec. 272.33  Appeals.

    The Operator may appeal final penalty determinations of the 
Director, Office of Ship Operating Assistance, to the Board, as provided 
in Sec. 272.43(c) of this part.


<R04>
       Subpart E_Examination, Audit, Review and Appeal Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 272.41  Requirements for examination and allocation of M&R expenses.

    (a) Examination requirement. Pursuant to the specific limitations on 
M&R subsidy in section 603 of the Act, the Region Office shall examine 
the expenses submitted by an operator on Form MA-140 in order to 
determine eligibility to receive M&R subsidy and the reasonableness of 
such expenses.
    (b) Operator's responsibility. During the examination, the operator 
shall provide, at the request of the Director or other official of the 
Region Office, any further documentation or information necessary to 
support an M&R expense. If such documentation or information, including 
information required under paragraph (e) of this section, is not 
received at the Region Office on a timely basis, the Director or other 
official of the Region Office may disallow the M&R expense.
    (c) Notification of examination results. At the completion of the 
examination the Director or other appropriate official of the applicable 
Region Office shall notify the Operator by letter of the results of the 
examination, and shall state the reason for each disallowance of an item 
claimed for subsidy and/or each nonapproval of a marine loss item.
    (d) Record retention requirements. To facilitate an audit 
examination of M&R made pursuant to Sec. 272.42 of this part, the 
Operator shall maintain files arranged by vessel and voyage, which shall 
include, at a minimum, a copy of the Region Office notice letter, a copy 
of the Form MA-140 with all supporting documents submitted therewith, 
and the condition survey report. The Operator shall retain all the 
required materials in files for not less than 3 years after completion 
of the audit.
    (1) Limitation on approval. Any approval for payment of M&R subsidy 
for a marine loss item shall be subject to rescission or modification if 
the Operator subsequently receives insurance or other compensation for 
the item. The Region Finance Officer may at any time request 
verification that the Operator has not received such compensation.
    (2) Status report on approved marine loss items. The Operator shall 
advise the Region Finance Office by letter as to whether insurance or 
other compensation will be recovered for the marine loss item. The 
Operator is responsible for ensuring that the letter reaches the 
applicable Region Office within 120 days after:

[[Page 95]]

    (i) The date on which all repairs for damage attributed to the 
``Policy Voyage'' (as defined in the Operator's insurance policy) are 
completed, when the amount for such repairs does not exceed the 
franchise or deductible of the policy, or
    (ii) The date of the underwriter's rejection of the Operator's 
marine loss insurance claim or claims.

subsidizable expenses, the Office of the Inspector General, Department 
of Transportation, shall audit for MARAD the Operator's M&R costs, as 
necessary, for the determination of final subsidy rates. The Operator 
shall substantiate those costs recorded on the books of account which 
have been approved by the Administration.
    (b) Notification of audit results. Upon completion of the audit by 
the Office of Inspector General, the MARAD Office of Financial Approvals 
shall notify the Operator of the audit results, including any items 
disallowed and the reasons for such disallowance.

<R05>
Sec. 272.43  Review and appeal procedures.

    (a) Exclusive procedures. Notwithstanding the audit appeal 
procedures of part 205 of this chapter, the provisions of this section 
shall be the exclusive remedy available to an Operator for the review 
and appeal of any disallowance of subsidy for a M&R expense claimed or 
any penalty assessed pursuant to Sec. 272.31.
    (b) Request for review. An Operator may request review by:
    (1) The Director, Office of Ship Operations, with respect to any 
disallowance by the Region office of a claimed M&R expense, after 
receiving the notification required by Sec. 272.41(c); or
    (2) The Director, Office of Financial Approvals, with respect to any 
disallowance of a claimed M&R expense, after receiving the notification 
required by Sec. 272.42(b).
    (c) Timeliness of request. The Operator shall file all requests for 
review pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section within 60 days after 
the date of the audit notification. Any disallowance with respect to 
which the Operator fails to file a timely request for review shall be 
final and shall not be subject to appeal to the Board pursuant to 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (d) Notification of review determination. The appropriate MARAD 
Office Director shall notify the Operator by letter, with respect to 
each timely filed review request, of the Director's determination and 
the reasons for each disallowance and whether the determination is final 
or subject to the submission of additional information.
    (e) Appeal to the Maritime Subsidy Board--(1) Right to appeal. An 
Operator may appeal a MARAD Office Director's final determination issued 
pursuant to Sec. 272.32 (penalties) or Sec. 272.43 (review of claims 
disallowance or of audit results) of this section to the Board in 
writing.
    (2) Contents and timeliness. The Operator shall set forth in any 
appeal the reasons for the Operator's objection to a penalty or 
disallowance of M&R subsidy and shall file such appeal with the 
Secretary of the Board within 60 days after the date of the notification 
sent to the operator by the appropriate Director pursuant to paragraph 
(d) of this section or Sec. 272.33.


<R05>
Sec. 272.44  Dates.

    The dates noted on the letters or notifications sent to the Operator 
by officials of the Region Office, any Director or any other official or 
MARAD, pursuant to the provisions of this part, shall be conclusive for 
the purposes of determining the timeliness of any requests for review 
made under the provisions of this part.

    (a) At the tariff commodity rate published in a conference tariff or 
at the stated minimum level or floor rate for an open-rated commodity 
published in a conference tariff, Provided, That the international rate 
conference issuing such tariff commodity rate, stated minimum level, or 
floor rate has at least one foreign-flag carrier as a voting member, or
    (b) At a rate or tariff agreement rate, or at the stated minimum 
level or floor rate for an open-rated commodity, established by a rate 
making group other than an international rate conference, Provided, That 
such rate making group has at least one foreign-flag carrier as a voting 
member, or

[[Page 99]]

    (c) At a rate approximately the same as or less, or at a rate that 
the subsidized operator by use of indices or other mechanism can 
demonstrate is reasonably equated to or less, than a rate quoted or 
actually charged by a foreign-flag carrier for the same commodity with 
the same or a competitive origin and destination and within a reasonably 
similar time period. This paragraph is applicable to, but is not limited 
to, rates:
    (1) Established by a conference or other rate making group that has 
only U.S. flag carriers as voting members;
    (2) Quoted by an individual member of an international rate 
conference or other rate making group with permits an individual member 
to negotiate or otherwise establish its own rate; or
    (3) Quoted by a carrier and not published in any conference tariff.

    (d) Requirements for requesting confidentiality. (1) Except as 
otherwise provided in this paragraph, the information contained in any 
report submitted pursuant to this section or Sec. 280.9 is not entitled 
to be considered confidential for purposes of the Freedom of Information 
Act (5 U.S.C. 552).
    (2) If an operator desires confidential treatment of any information 
contained in such a submitted report, the operator is required to file 
concurrently with each such report a written request for a determination 
of confidentiality.
    (3) The operator shall include in any confidentiality request filed 
under this paragraph:
    (i) A precise, item-by-item specification of the information in the 
report that the operator asserts is within one of the exemptions from 
disclosure in 5 U.S.C. 552(b);

none will be asserted for an item of information included in a 
confidentiality request, the operator will be given a written statement 
of and reasons for that determination.


<R05>
Sec. 280.8  Certain ODS agreement provisions not affected.

    The provisions of this part are not intended to supersede 
contractual or other requirements dealing with sailings, and the 
carriage of full loads of military or bulk cargoes.


<R05>
Sec. 280.9  Special rules for last year of ODS agreement.

    (a) Reduction in payment of ODS. ODS payable during the last year of 
any ODS agreement shall be reduced, as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section, if on a cumulative basis for each quarter of the calendar year:
    (1) Less than 50 percent of the inbound gross freight revenue earned 
on the inbound leg of a service, or
    (2) Less than 50 percent of the outbound gross freight revenue 
earned on the outbound leg of a service, is earned from the carriage of 
competitive cargo. Any reduction required by this paragraph is in 
addition to any reduction in ODS payable for the preceding calendar year 
as required by paragraph (b) (3) of Sec. 280.4.
    (b) Amount and method of required reduction--(1) Quarterly voucher. 
As required by paragraph (a) of this section, the amount payable on the 
ODS voucher for the last month of any quarter of the last calendar year 
is to be reduced by an amount determined by applying the table in 
paragraph (b)(3) of Sec. 280.4 to the cumulative ODS payable.
    (2) Insufficient ODS payable--(i) Vouchers for subsequent months. If 
the total amount of reduction required to be made pursuant to (b)(3) of 
Sec. 280.4 or paragraph (b)(1) of this section or both, is greater than 
the amount of ODS payable on the ODS vouchers for the last month of the 
1st, 2nd, or 3rd quarter of the last calendar year, the operator shall 
carry an amount equal to this excess forward to one or more of the 
months subsequent to such quarter of the last calendar year as a 
reduction in the ODS payable on the ODS voucher for any such subsequent 
months.
    (ii) Voucher in the final quarter. If the amount of reduction 
required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section is greater than the amount 
of ODS payable on the ODS voucher for the last month of the final 
quarter of the last calendar year, the Maritime Administrator may apply 
an amount equal to this excess as a reduction of any outstanding ODS 
payable to the operator for the last calendar year or any preceding 
years.
    (c) Reporting requirements. During the last year of the ODS 
agreement, the operator shall submit a report to the Secretary (two 
copies) and to the Region Director (one copy) for each quarter of the 
calendar year, providing for each such quarter on a cumulative basis for 
the calendar year, the information required by paragraph (a) of Sec. 
280.7. The reports required by this paragraph shall be submitted 
concurrently with the operator's vouchers for the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th 
months of the calendar year. Each report submitted pursuant to this 
paragraph is also subject to the other applicable requirements of Sec. 
280.7.
    (d) Cumulative quarterly accounting. The calculations required under 
this section shall be made on the basis of the cumulative voyages 
terminated from the beginning of the calendar year through the reported 
quarterly period.
    (e) Special procedures. Whenever the Maritime Administrator, 
Department of Transportation determines that the provisions of this 
section may fail at any time to protect the interests of the

[[Page 101]]

Maritime Administration, the Maritime Administrator may take any 
measures necessary to ensure against an overpayment of ODS or to ensure 
the prompt repayment of any such overpayment.


<R05>
Sec. 280.10  Waiver.

    The Board has the power to waive the requirements of any provision 
of this part for a specific period of time under special circumstances 
and for good cause shown.


<R05>
Sec. 280.11  Example of calculation and sample report.

    (a) Example of calculation. The provisions of this part may be 
illustrated by the following example:

    Company A operates several vessels engaged in carrying cargo, 
passengers and mail from the west coast of the United States outbound to 
foreign ports in the Far East, cargo between the foreign ports in the 
Far East, and cargo from foreign ports in the Far East inbound to the 
west coast of the United States. Company A's operation on this service 
is subsidized under an ODS agreement made in accordance with Sec. 
280.3. Total annual subsidy payable for Company A's service is $1 
million. In 1976 Company A's total gross revenue was $10 million, 
computed as follows:

Outbound gross freight revenue.............................   $4,000,000
Inbound gross freight revenue..............................    4,000,000
Wayport gross freight revenue..............................    1,000,000
Miscellaneous gross revenue................................    1,000,000
                                                            ------------
    Total gross revenue....................................   10,000,000
 

    Of the $4 million outbound gross freight revenue $1,600,000, or 40 
percent, was earned from carriage of competitive cargo. Of the $4 
million inbound gross freight revenue $1,200,000, or 30 percent, was 
earned from carriage of competitive cargo. Accordingly, total ODS 
payable to Company A for voyages terminated during the calendar year 
1976 is reduced by $240,000, from $1 million to $760,000, as follows:

                         outbound leg of service
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
ODS payable................................................     $400,000
  (Outbound freight revenue, $4 million, divided by total
   gross revenue, $10 million, times total ODS payable for
   service, $1 million.)
Percent reduction of ODS payable...........................          20%
  (40% carriage of competitive cargo requires 20% reduction
   in ODS payable.)
Amount of reduction in ODS payable.........................      $80,000
  (20% of $400,000.)
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
                         inbound leg of service
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
ODS payable................................................     $400,000
  (Inbound freight revenue, $4 million, divided by total
   gross revenue, $10 million, times total ODS payable for
   service, $1 million.)
Percent reduction of ODS payable...........................          40%
  (30% carriage of competitive cargo requires 40% reduction
   in ODS payable.)
Amount of reduction in ODS payable.........................     $160,000
Total amount of reduction in ODS payable...................     $240,000
  ($80,000 plus $160,000.)
Total ODS payable for service in 1976 (after reduction)....     $760,000
  ($1 million minus $240,000.)

<R05>
Sec. 281.1  Information and procedure required under liner operating-differential subsidy agreements.

    In compliance with the terms of the operating-differential subsidy 
agreement, the following information shall be submitted to the Maritime 
Administration by each operator who is a party to any such agreement and 
operates liner type vessels pursuant to such agreement.
    (a) Sailing schedules, routes, etc. (1) One copy of a list of 
sailings is required to be submitted not later than the 5th day of each 
month, listing each outbound sailing during the preceding month. Such 
list shall show for each such sailing: (i) Vessel name; (ii) voyage 
number; (iii) last continental U.S. port; (iv) sailing date; and (v) the 
service on which the sailing took place.
    (2) A ``Final Report'' in five copies shall be submitted not later 
than 15 days after the end of the month in which the voyage is 
terminated and shall show: (i) The time and ports at which the voyage 
commenced and terminated; (ii) the arrival and sailing dates of the 
vessel at and from each United States and foreign port, including ports 
of call for bunkering and/or mail only; (iii) explanation of any delay 
in excess of 2 days at a United States or foreign port; (iv) appropriate 
notation of official authorization for any deviations from the service 
described in the applicable contract.
    (3) The procedures outlined in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this 
section shall be effective on the first of the month following 
publication in the Federal Register.
    (4) The sailing schedules and lists of sailings specified in this 
paragraph shall be sent to the Division of Trade Studies, Office of 
Subsidy Administration, Maritime Administration, Washington, DC 20590.
    (b) Condition of vessels, inspection and repairs. (1) In order that 
the Maritime Administration may have an opportunity to participate in 
the inspection of the vessels, the operator is required to give at least 
twenty-four hours' notice to the Maritime Administration as to the time 
and place of making inspections. In the event the Maritime 
Administration's representative is not available, the operator shall 
employ an independent surveyor, who shall be satisfactory to the 
Maritime Administration, and proceed with inspection, and a report 
thereof shall be made to the Maritime Administration on forms MA-55, MA-
56, MA-57, and MA-58, sworn to by persons making the inspection.
    (2) The operator shall give due notice to the local office of the 
Division of Maintenance and Repair, at the port at which the vessel is 
to be available, of the port, date and time for the making of repairs or 
replacements in the United States.

[[Page 103]]

    (3) In connection with further requirements, reference is made to 
General Order 20 (Part 271 of this chapter) and supplements thereto for 
more detailed instruction.
    (4) Vessel repairs are to be performed within the continental limits 
of the United States, except in emergency cases the necessity for which 
the operator should be prepared to justify upon audit.
    (c) Insurance. (1) Immediately upon the binding of any insurance 
with respect to any vessel covered by the operator's subsidy agreement, 
there shall be submitted to the Division of Insurance Office of the 
Comptroller, Maritime Administration, Washington, DC 20590, for the 
Maritime Administration's approval, a signed copy of each cover note 
issued by the operator's brokers, which, to the extent applicable, shall 
set forth as to such vessel the amounts covered by hull, disbursements 
and other forms of total loss protection, as well as P and I insurance. 
Such cover notes shall include the rates, the amounts placed in the 
different markets, the companies interested, the policy numbers and the 
amount underwritten by each policy; also, there shall be shown the 
amount of the deductible average, if any. Upon request, policies shall 
be submitted to the Maritime Administration for examination and return.
    (2) The Maritime Administration shall be advised promptly of any 
cancellation, changes in terms, or companies interested, and of any lay-
up periods which will permit of the collection of return premiums, and 
of any major casualty or total loss which may occur.
    (3) Insurance arranged in conformity with the requirements of 
applicable mortgages held by the United States will be deemed sufficient 
to comply with the requirements of the operator's operating-differential 
subsidy agreement.
    (4) The Maritime Administration furthermore, wishes to emphasize its 
desire that as much of the American Merchant Marine insurance coverage 
as is practicable be placed in the American insurance market. Therefore, 
when a renewal of policies or new insurance is under negotiation by an 
operator subject to the provisions of this order, it is urgently 
requested that particular attention be given to the Maritime 
Administration's desire as herein expressed with regard to markets in 
which such insurance may be placed, and that the Maritime Administration 
be notified in ample time to give consideration to the pertinent facts 
and circumstances of each case, so that prior to the attachment of such 
insurance, approval thereof or suggested changes may be indicated.
    (d) Inventories. Twenty-four hours' notice shall be given to the 
Maritime Administration as to the time and place of inventorying 
classification-required spare parts, ship's spare equipment, fuel and 
stores as are customarily inventoried and the cost of which is charged 
to the voyage accounts. If, upon giving the above-required notice, the 
Maritime Administration's representatives are not present, the operator 
is to proceed with his inventory in the normal way. The operator may use 
his own inventory forms, one copy of which shall be sworn to by the 
persons taking the inventory and included in the voyage accounting.
    (e) Partial payments on account. When partial payments are desired 
on account of operating-differential subsidy accruals, the operator 
should communicate with the Comptroller, Maritime Administration, 
Washington, DC 20590, who shall forward necessary instructions and forms 
to be used.
    (f) Current financial reports. Each operator shall prepare current 
financial reports as specified in this paragraph and shall submit one 
copy each to the appropriate Region Director of the Maritime 
Administration and three copies each to the Director, Office of 
Financial and Rate Approvals, Maritime Administration, Washington, DC 
20590. MARAD will accept electronic options (such as facsimile and 
Internet) for transmission of required information to MARAD, if 
practicable.
    (1) Internal management reports. Each month the operator shall 
submit copies of such portions of its internal management reports that 
provide an estimate of its current operating results.
    (2) Quarterly balance sheets. The operator shall prepare balance 
sheets as of March 31, June 30, and September 30 of each calendar year 
in conformity with

[[Page 104]]

section 282.6(A) of the Uniform System of Accounts (Part 282 of this 
chapter) and shall submit each as soon as practicable but not later than 
45 days after the end of the respective quarter.
    (3) Quarterly and cumulative income statements. The operator shall 
prepare income statements for the quarterly periods January 1, to March 
31, April 1 to June 30, and July 1 to September 30, and for cumulative 
periods from January 1 to the end of the second and third quarters of 
each calendar year in conformity with section 282.6(B) of the Uniform 
System of Accounts (Part 282 of this chapter) and shall submit each 
statement as soon as practicable but not later than 45 days after the 
end of the respective quarter.
    (4) Annual financial report. The operator shall submit Maritime 
Administration Form 172 for each calendar year by March 31 of the 
succeeding year. If the operator is unable to submit Form 172 by March 
31 of the succeeding year he shall, prior to such March 31, request an 
extension for the filing of Form 172 from the Director, Office of 
Financial and Rate Approvals and shall submit by such March 31:
    (i) A balance sheet for the year ending on December 31, in 
conformity with section 282.6(A) of the Uniform Systems of Accounts; and
    (ii) An income statement for the quarterly period October 1 to 
December 31 and an income statement for the year ending on December 31, 
in conformity with section 282.6(B) of the Uniform System of Accounts.
    (5) Vessel performance reports. Vessel performance reports shall be 
prepared for the period January 1 to March 31 of each calendar year, and 
from January 1 to the end of each succeeding quarter of the calendar 
year, in the form provided in Exhibit A of paragraph (f)(7) of this 
section and consistent with the allocation bases provided in paragraph 
(f)(6) of this section and shall include:
    (i) A grand summary of all terminated voyage results for the 
reporting period including any idle status period occurring during the 
reporting period and any additional charges or credits from prior 
terminated periods;
    (ii) Summaries of each service by vessel type, as indicated in 
Exhibit (D) of paragraph (7) of this section, as of December 31 of each 
year;
    (iii) Individual reports by vessel for each idle status period 
occurring during any reporting period.
    (A) Vessel performance reports shall be submitted with the quarterly 
balance sheets and income statements required under paragraphs (f)(2) 
and (3) of this section and must be reconciled with voyage revenue and 
expense from all operations as reported in the income statement.
    (B) ``Depreciation Vessels'' is an example of a reconciling item. 
Vessel performance reports which are properly prepared and filed will 
satisfy the reporting requirements for sub-schedules 3002 of the 
Maritime Administration Form 172.
    (6) Allocation bases. The allocation bases to be applied in 
preparation of vessel performance reports required by paragraph (f)(5) 
of this section are as follows:
    (i) Terminal expenses. Terminal expenses defined by accounts 855 
through 866 of the Uniform System of Accounts (Sec. 282.3(E) of this 
chapter), including depreciation accounts, for each terminal shall be 
allocated between terminated and unterminated voyages on the basis of 
freight payable tons loaded and discharged on each vessel and voyage 
during the reporting period, except that in the case of terminals 
handling only one cargo carriage technology type (CCTT), which can be 
expressed in common units such as twenty-foot equivalent container units 
(TEU's) or the number of individual barges, such common unit may be used 
for allocating terminal expenses by vessel and voyage for each terminal, 
as shown in Exhibit B of paragraph (f)(7) of this section.
    (ii) Container/barge expense--
    (A) Allocation of expense. Container/barge expense defined by 
accounts 867 through 899 of the Uniform System of Accounts (Sec. 
282.3(F) of this chapter), including depreciation accounts, shall be 
segregated between container and barge cost pools. Accounts 879, 880, 
and 894 shall be allocated between container and barge cost pools on an 
allocation basis developed by the operator.
    (B) Allocation of cost pools. Container and barge cost pools shall 
be allocated

[[Page 105]]

among vessels by voyage and idle status for each vessel in the same 
ratio that the total container or barge capacity of each vessel 
multiplied by vessel days bears to the total container or barge capacity 
of the operator's entire fleet multiplied by vessel days. Total 
container or barge capacity of a vessel means the total container or 
barge capacity of the vessel, expressed in TEU's for containers and 
single units for barges, multiplied by the total number of containers or 
barges acquired for each available container or barge slot on the 
vessel. Vessel days means the number of days in the period for which an 
allocation of cost pools is being made. Containers and barges purchased 
by an operator for utilization in a particular trade route shall be 
allocated by vessel capacity among the vessels in the trade route for 
which they were purchased. See Exhibit C of paragraph (f)(7) of this 
section.
    (iii) Administrative and general expenses. Administrative and 
general expenses defined by accounts 901 through 979 of the Uniform 
System of Accounts (Sec. 282.3(G) of this chapter) shall be allocated 
to terminated voyages for each vessel type by service or for each vessel 
by voyage, as required by paragraph (f)(5) of this section, based on the 
ratio that total terminated voyage operating expenses (accounts 701-773 
of the Uniform System of Accounts) plus total terminated voyage 
operating revenue (accounts 601-624 of the Uniform System of Accounts) 
for each bears to the total terminated voyage operating expense plus 
total terminated voyage operating revenue for the period, except that 
account 945 (advertising passengers) will be allocated directly to 
passenger vessels based on passengers carried, account 955 
(contributions to pools) may be allocated as an administrative and 
general expense or directly to vessel and voyage based on pool 
statements, and that portion of accounts 960 and 961 (interest expense) 
representing interest on vessels shall be allocated to vessels and 
voyages in the same ratio that depreciation is distributed among all 
vessels in the fleet. In addition to the above exceptions, significant 
interest expenses related to purchases of containers and barges should 
be charged directly to container and barge pools prior to allocation of 
the container and barge pools.

Sec. 281.2  Definitions.

    As used in Sec. Sec. 281.2 through 281.6 of these regulations, 
except as otherwise indicated by the context;
    (a) The word operator means an operator receiving operating-
differential subsidy under title VI of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as 
amended (Act), for

[[Page 107]]

a voyage on an essential service as described in section 211(a) of the 
Act;
    (b) The term Maritime Administrator means Maritime Administrator, 
Department of Transportation;
    (c) The term Region Director means the Region Director of the 
Maritime Administration having jurisdiction over the port or ports 
involved;
    (d) The term idle status means any period in port between or during 
voyages for which the vessel's normal crew complement is reduced by 10 
percent or more and division of wages is not paid for the missing men. 
The idle status period shall continue up to, but not including, the day 
that the vessel is remanned to the extent that the vessel's normal crew 
complement is restored to more than 90 percent or division of wages is 
paid for the missing men, or the vessel is temporarily or permanently 
withdrawn from subsidized service;
    (e) Normal crew complement means the basic crew complement which has 
been approved for operating-differential subsidy under the provisions of 
section 603 of the Act, or as established by collective bargaining or 
other agreement for the voyage involved, whichever is less.

[G.O. 27, Rev. 2, 37 FR 18466, Sept. 12, 1972]


<R05>
Sec. 281.3  Method of commencing and terminating voyages and of determining idle status.

    (a) Voyage commencements. Voyages shall commence as of 12:01 a.m. of 
the day that loading of cargo, stores, or fuel begins, or as of 12:01 
a.m. of the day following the termination of the prior voyage or, in the 
event that an idle status period follows a voyage termination, as of 
12:01 a.m. of the day following the day on which such idle status period 
ends.
    (b) Voyage termination. Voyages shall terminate at a U.S. port of 
call at midnight of the day of completion of paying off the crew from 
foreign articles, or the completion of final discharge of cargo or 
ballast at the last U.S. port of discharge, or the completion of voyage 
repairs, whichever event occurs last: Provided, however, That if a 
vessel sails outward on a new voyage prior to midnight of the same day, 
the inward voyage shall terminate as of midnight of that day, and the 
outward voyage shall commence as of 12:01 a.m. of the succeeding day; 
and that where a portion of any particular voyage overlaps a portion of 
the next succeeding voyage and the quantity of inward cargo remaining 
aboard at the port at which major cargo activities for the outward 
voyage are begun does not, in the opinion of the operator, justify 
extension of the inward voyage beyond that port, the operator shall 
immediately request the Region Director for permission to treat the 
inward voyage as having terminated at midnight of the day specified in 
such request and shall advise the Region Director what cargo has been 
and is still to be discharged and loaded at each port of the inward 
voyage; and that where, in the opinion of the operator, voyages as a 
general practice should terminate at the home or terminal port rather 
than at the last port of discharge, or a voyage should terminate on the 
day prior to commencement of an idle status period, or on the day that 
the voyage would have terminated had strikes not interfered with normal 
operations, application for such terminations may be made to the Region 
Director, and in such cases the voyage termination date shall be as 
approved by the Region Director. The Region Director shall promptly 
advise the operator of his determination approving or disapproving any 
request filed under this paragraph (b), and the Region Director's 
decision as to such termination shall prevail, provided that all 
terminations shall be as f midnight of the day specified.
    (c) Idle status periods. Idle status periods shall be identified 
separately, whether occurring during or between voyages, and, if 
occurring during a voyage shall be identified with the applicable voyage 
number. A separate accounting period shall be created to cover each idle 
status period, and all such periods shall be reported to the Region 
Director.
    (d) Excessive delays. Whenever a vessel is delayed in port for a 
period of 10 days or more in excess of its normal period of operations 
in said port, the operator immediately shall report said circumstances, 
together with all pertinent facts, to the Region Director. The Region 
Director shall determine whether or not said delay was justified

[[Page 108]]

and if operating costs for said period were reduced to a minimum in 
accordance with sound commercial practice.

[G.O. 27, Rev. 2, 37 FR 18466, Sept. 12, 1972]


<R05>
Sec. 281.4  Treatment of subsidy during idle status and off-hire period.

    During an idle status period, subsidy shall be payable only for such 
subsidizable items of expenses as are determined by the Maritime 
Administrator, after presentation by the operator of the facts relating 
to such idle status period, to be necessary for the maintenance, 
preservation, repair, or husbanding of the vessel during and under the 
circumstances involved; however, the Maritime Subsidy Board reserves the 
right to suspend at any time the payment of subsidy on idle vessels 
when, after consideration of the facts and circumstances regarding such 
period, it determines that an unreasonable period has elapsed or such 
idle period was not warranted: Provided, That as to a chartered ship 
operated under a ``Use Agreement'', operating-differential subsidy shall 
cease to accrue to the ship simultaneously with the time it goes ``off 
hire'' and subsidy shall not again accrue to said ship until it is 
reemployed in the subsidized service as determined in accordance with 
Sec. 281.3. Nothing herein shall limit any other rights of the United 
States with respect to the payment or nonpayment of subsidy.

[G.O. 27, Rev. 2, 37 FR 18466, Sept. 12, 1972]


<R05>
Sec. 281.5  Right of Maritime Administrator to recover subsidy for any period of idleness.

    The Maritime Administrator may, prior to payment of subsidy for any 
voucher period which includes a period of idleness, require the operator 
to establish to the satisfaction of the Maritime Administrator that such 
period of idleness could not have been prevented in whole or in part 
through efficient and economical operation. The Maritime Administrator 
may recover any payment of subsidy for any item of expense allocable to 
such period of idleness which in the opinion of the Maritime 
Administrator could have been avoided by efficient and economical 
operation.

[G.O. 27, Rev. 2, 37 FR 18466, Sept. 12, 1972]


<R05>
Sec. 281.6  Interpretation.

    All questions of interpretation arising under the sections of this 
part shall be submitted to the Maritime Administrator for determination, 
whose decision thereon shall be final.

    (o) Subsidized vessel means a vessel covered by an ODSA.
    (p) U.S. foreign commerce means the commerce or trade between the 
United States, its territories or possessions, or the District of 
Columbia, and a foreign country.
    (q) Vessel means subsidized vessel, unless otherwise specified.

Sec. 282.3  Waivers.

    In special circumstances and for good cause shown, the procedures 
prescribed in this part may be waived in writing, by mutual agreement of 
the parties, in keeping with the circumstances then present, so long as 
the procedures adopted are consistent with the Act and with the intent 
of these regulations.

                   Subpart B_Foreign-Flag Competition


<R05>
Sec. 282.10  Basis for determining foreign-flag competition.

    The foreign-flag competition shall form the basis for determining 
the cost disadvantage of operating the subsidized vessels in the 
essential service. The Maritime Administrator shall determine the 
foreign-flag competition from those countries that have carried a 
significant amount of cargo in the service by using the following 
procedures:
    (a) The primary source of information shall be commodity import/
export data compiled by the Bureau of the Census. Cargo data shall be 
compiled in long tons. Trade publications which show advertised sailings 
shall be used

[[Page 110]]

to verify the liner services offered by foreign-flag operators.
    (b) The U.S. import/export data shall be compiled by reference to 
countries actually served by the subsidized operator, using the 
subsidized operator's own competition data for each country to eliminate 
the flags which are not substantial competitors with the subsidized 
vessels. An example of the weighting procedure follows:

    (c) The principal foreign flags shall be those countries whose cargo 
carrying would rank the flag among those carriers that aggregate at 
least 50 percent of the total foreign-flag carryings.
    (d) The total cargo carryings of each principal foreign flag shall 
be expressed as a percentage of total cargo carryings of all principal 
flags on the service. The resultant ratio shall be applied to the costs 
of that principal flag for determining its portion of the composite 
foreign cost, which shall be used for establishing the cost disadvantage 
of U.S. vessels in the service.
    (e) The determination of the principal competitors and competition 
weight factors shall be based upon the import/export data for the twelve 
months of the penultimate calendar year preceding January 1 of the 
subsidized year to allow several months to collect foreign cost data.


<R05>
Sec. 282.11  Ranking of flags.

    The operators under each principal foreign flag shall be ranked as 
predominant, secondary, etc., for the purpose of establishing the 
priority of costs which are representative of the flag. For liner cargo 
vessels, the ranking of operators shall be based on the long tons of 
cargo carried.
    (a) If the predominant operator is an agent, charterer or a joint 
venture in which the vessels are owned by two or more lines, under the 
name of such agent, charterer or joint venture, the predominant operator 
shall be the owner whose vessels carried the most cargo.
    (b) If cost experience cannot be obtained for the foreign-flag 
operators in the subsidized service, MARAD may use the costs of another 
service, following the same ranking of operators, if possible.


<R04>
                 Subpart C_Calculation of Subsidy Rates


<R05>
Sec. 282.20  Amount of subsidy payable.

    (a) Daily Rates. Daily ODS rates shall be used to quantify the 
amount of ODS payable. The daily ODS rate represents the cost 
differential between the subsidized vessel and its foreign-flag 
competition. A daily rate shall be calculated for each subsidized item 
of expense identified in the ODSA, and the total of all items is the 
daily amount

[[Page 111]]

of ODS payable for approved vessel operating days, excluding reduced 
crew periods.
    (b) Reduced Crew Periods. For reduced crew periods, as defined in 
Sec. 282.3 of this part, a man-day reduction amount, calculated 
separately for officers and unlicensed crew members, shall be used to 
reduce the daily wage ODS rate to conform to the complement remaining on 
the vessel. The man-day reduction amounts shall be determined by 
dividing the daily wage ODS for officers and unlicensed crew members by 
the number of subsidizable crew members in each category. For each day 
of a reduced crew period, the man-day amount shall be multiplied by the 
number of crew members missing for that day, and the resulting product 
shall be deducted from the daily ODS rate. The difference shall be the 
ODS payable for such day. (See illustration in Schedule D at Sec. 
282.31 of this part.)
    (c) Review of Rates. Daily subsidy rates shall be reviewed every six 
months. For the item ``wages of officers and crews,'' the daily rate 
shall be calculated for fiscal periods July 1 through June 30, in 
accordance with provisions of the Act. During the period January through 
June, adjustments--paid as a lump sum or as a daily amount--shall be 
made to wage ODS so that the correct amount of ODS for the full fiscal 
period is received by the operator. For other subsidizable items of 
expense, the daily rate shall be calculated for calendar years.
    (d) Negative Rates. When an ODS rate in any category is less than 
zero, indicating that the subsidized operator is at an advantage rather 
than a disadvantage in such category, the negative rate shall be 
deducted from positive rates in determining the daily ODS amount 
payable.
    (e) Operator Comments. The operator shall have the opportunity to 
comment on each subsidy rate as calculated by the Maritime 
Administration. The operator and contracting officer shall make every 
effort to resolve disagreements that arise. In the event of a 
disagreement that cannot be resolved, comments received from the 
operator and the contracting officer's recommendation shall be presented 
to the Maritime Administrator for consideration in determining subsidy 
rates.


<R05>
Sec. 282.21  Wages of officers and crew.

    (a) Definitions. When used in this part.
    (1) Base period. The first base period under the wage index system, 
as provided in section 603 of the Act, is the period beginning July 1, 
1970 and ending June 30, 1971. Thereafter, base period means any annual 
period beginning July 1 and ending June 30, with respect to which the 
Maritime Administrator establishes a base period cost. At intervals of 
not less than two years, nor more than four years, the Maritime 
Administrator shall establish a new base period. Base periods shall be 
announced by the Maritime Administrator prior to the December 31 date 
that would be included in the new base period.
    (2) Base period cost--(i) Initial base period. For the initial base 
period of subsidized service, the term base period cost means the 
collective bargaining cost as of January 1 of that base period.
    (ii) Subsequent base periods. For base periods subsequent to the 
initial base period, the term base period cost means the averaged of the 
collective bargaining cost as of January 1 of such fiscal year, and the 
base period cost of the previous base period, indexed to January 1 of 
the new base period by an index compiled by the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics. This index shall consist of the average annual change in 
wages and benefits placed into effect for employees covered by 
collective bargaining agreements, with equal weight to be given to 
changes affecting employees in the transportation industry (excluding 
the off-shore maritime industry) and to changes affecting employees in 
private non-agricultural industries other than transportation. However, 
such base period cost shall not be less than a minimum, nor more than a 
maximum amount, determined as a percentage of the collective bargaining 
cost computed for January 1 of such base period in accordance with the 
following schedule:

[[Page 112]]

                                                    (percent)  (percent)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Base period following a:
    2-year cycle..................................    97\1/2\   102\1/2\
    3-year cycle..................................    96\1/4\   103\3/4\
    4-year cycle..................................         95        105
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Collective bargaining cost (CBC) means the annual cost, 
calculated on the basis of the per diem rate of expense, as of January 1 
of the annual fiscal periods July 1 through June 30, of all items of 
expense required by the operator through a collective bargaining or 
other agreement, covering the employment of the approved manning 
complement of the subsidized vessel, including payments required by law 
to assure old-age pensions, unemployment benefits or similar benefits, 
and taxes or other governmental assessments on crew payrolls.
    (4) Approved manning complement means the complement approved by the 
Board for subsidy.
    (5) U.S. wage cost (WC) means the annual cost, calculated on the 
basis of the per diem rate of expense as of January 1 of the annual 
fiscal periods July 1 through June 30, of all items of expense required 
of the operator through a collective bargaining or other agreement, 
covering the employment of the normal manning complement of the 
subsidized vessel, including payments required by law to assure old-age 
pensions, unemployment benefits or similar benefits, and taxes or other 
governmental assessments on crew payrolls.
    (6) Normal manning complement means the crew complement established 
by a collective bargaining or other agreement with the officers and 
unlicensed crew of the vessel. In cases where the complement may vary in 
number, the lowest number shall be the normal manning complement. When 
ratings of different salaries are in the same job during the year, the 
base wages of the rating carried most of the time shall be used.
    (7) Subsidizable wage cost means, (i) with respect to a base period, 
the base period cost, and (ii) in any fiscal period other than a base 
period, the most recent base period cost, increased or decreased by the 
change from January 1 of the base period to January 1 of the non-base 
period in the index described above. The subsidizable wage cost shall 
not be less than 90 percent nor greater than 110 percent of the 
collective bargaining cost as of January 1 of such period.
    (8) Unpredictably timed costs are collective bargaining costs that 
are not regularly incurred. Examples of unpredictably timed costs are 
such costs as severance pay, shortfalls, special assessments, and war 
zone bonuses.
    (b) Method of calculating collective bargaining cost (CBC). CBC 
shall be determined by pricing out, for the approved crew complement, 
the per diem total of fixed costs specified in the collective bargaining 
agreement and adding a per diem total of variable costs obtained from 
the cost experience of the subsidized vessel during the first nine 
months of the preceding calendar year.
    (1) Fixed Costs. The per diem total of fixed costs shall include all 
costs that are stated in specific or determinable amounts per time 
period and, based on operating experience, do not vary. In cases where a 
monthly amount is specified in the agreement, the per diem amount shall 
be determined by dividing the monthly amount by 30. When a daily amount 
is specified it shall be used. Example of fixed costs are:
    (i) Base wages;
    (ii) Non-watch pay;
    (iii) Vacation pay (including contributions to vacation funds);
    (iv) Tool allowance;
    (v) Clothing and uniform allowances; and
    (vi) Per diem contributions for pension, training, welfare, 
unemployment, including unallocated contributions placed in escrow.
    (2) Variable costs. Variable costs are regularly incurred employment 
costs which vary with ship operating experience. The per diem aggregate 
of variable costs as of January 1 shall be determined by applying a 
ratio to the per diem aggregate of base wage costs as of January 1, the 
numerator of which shall be the total of variable costs for the first 
nine months of the preceding calendar year and the denominator of which 
shall be the total of base wage costs for the first nine months of the 
preceding calendar year. Variable costs include but are not limited to:
    (i) Payroll taxes (including social security taxes);

[[Page 113]]

    (ii) Overtime and penalty pay;
    (iii) Variable pension, training, welfare, unemployment, and 
vacation costs;
    (iv) Pay in lieu of time off;
    (v) Transportation and travel allowances;
    (vi) Payments to relief officers and crews;
    (vii) Wages and other expenses of USMMA cadets and extra messmen;
    (viii) Board and lodging allowances;
    (ix) Overlap in wages (a maximum of two days); and
    (x) Penalty cargo bonuses.
    (c) Method of calculating U.S. wage cost (WC) Two different 
calculations of WC are necessary--a per diem amount for every ship type 
on the service and a per month amount for the predominant ship type 
(most voyages) on the service. The purpose of the per month calculation 
is to make a comparison with the monthly foreign wage costs. The 
relationship of WC to foreign costs for the predominant ship is applied 
to the per diem WC for other ship types in the service to estimate 
comparable foreign costs for them.
    (1) Calculation of per diem WC. The per diem WC shall be calculated 
by the same method that applies to CBC, except that the normal manning 
complement shall be used.
    (2) Calculation of per month WC. The costs and manning level used in 
this calculation shall be the same as those used for the per diem WC.
    (d) Data submission requirements. For purposes of calculating CBC 
and WC the operator shall each year submit Form MA-790 and, as 
appropriate, current copies of all collective bargaining or other 
agreements, memoranda of understanding, and arbitration awards, which 
specify the fixed costs as of January 1. Schedule A of Form MA-790, 
which covers wage costs on voyages terminated during the first nine 
months of the previous calendar year, shall be submitted by January 1 of 
the subsidized year. Schedule B of Form MA-790--normal manning 
complement, rates of pay, and contributions in effect on January 1 of 
the current year--shall be submitted by January 31. Form MA-790, 
Schedules A and B, shall be submitted to the Director, Office of Ship 
Operating Costs, Maritime Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., 
Washington, DC 20590.
    (e) Example calculation. The following is a sample of calculation of 
CBC and WC:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Normal manning complement.
\2\ Approved manning complement.

    (f) Method of calculating foreign wage costs. The foreign wage cost 
(FC) of the principal foreign-flag competitors and the comparable WC of 
the subsidized vessel are matched as of January 1 of the last fiscal 
year preceding the subsidized fiscal year for purposes of determining 
the wage cost of the principal foreign flags. The following procedures 
are used:
    (1) Manning. The foreign manning complement in number and 
nationality for the principal foreign-flag competitors shall be 
constructed for the subsidized vessel type using the manning scales and 
practices of the competitors as developed through an examination of 
alien crew manifests, payrolls, and other reliable information. The 
commonly used crew complement of the competitors shall be adjusted to 
fit the predominant vessel type, in recognition of differences in 
physical characteristics that would affect manning scales. Where the 
manning complement cannot be estimated with reasonable substantiation, 
it will be deemed to be identical with that of the subsidized vessel.

[[Page 114]]

    (2) Method. The method of calculating FC shall be the same as that 
used for WC, provided that it is possible to obtain foreign cost data on 
the same basis as wage cost data. Preference shall be given to pricing 
out for fixed costs and to cost experience for variable costs. Where 
applicable, foreign currencies shall be converted into U.S. currency 
equivalents by using the average of end-month exchange rates for the 
period July through June that includes the January 1 for which FC is 
calculated. The exchange rates shall be obtained from the publication, 
``International Financial Statistics,'' published monthly by the 
International Monetary Fund. If exchange rates for particular foreign 
currencies are not available in this publication, they shall be obtained 
from the United States Department of the Treasury.
    (3) Foreign wage costs. The per diem composite foreign wage cost is 
determined by multiplying the per diem WC for the U.S. ship type, 
calculated as of January 1 of the subsidized fiscal year, by the ratio 
of FC to WC, calculated as of January 1 of the last fiscal year 
preceding the subsidized fiscal year. The following is a sample 
calculation of the foreign cost percentage.

    (g) Determination of daily wage rate. The foreign wage cost is 
deducted from subsidizable wage costs to determine the daily wage 
subsidy rate. Table 1 is an example calculation of a daily wage subsidy 
rate using the procedures described in this section.
    (h) Unpredictably timed costs (UTC) are subsidized by calculating 
costs incurred during the previous six months and converting them into a 
daily rate or, in the alternative, a lump sum amount will be paid for 
special lump sum assessments or for per man-day increases to benefit 
plans which become effective during the six months following the 
establishment of the daily rate. In either case, the percentage subsidy 
rate--which is the differential percentage between the subsidizable wage 
cost and the foreign wage cost--is used to establish the amount of 
subsidy payable for UTC incurred.
    (1) UTC expenses such as severance pay and area bonuses are eligible 
for subsidy payment without obtaining prior approval and subsidy shall 
be paid as a lump sum amount.
    (2) Expenses such as shortfalls in benefit fund contributions, 
special assessments for benefit funds, and retroactive wage increases 
may be treated as UTC if the cost increase was not negotiated. Such 
costs must be approved as UTC by the Director, Office of Ship Operating 
Costs. To the extent such expenses qualify for UTC, the Director shall 
determine the appropriate method of paying subsidy--added to the per 
diem wage subsidy rate and/or as a lump sum amount treated separately.

Sec. 282.22  Maintenance (upkeep) and repairs.

    (a) Basis for subsidy. The fair and reasonable maintenance and 
repair costs not compensated by insurance, if eligible for subsidy under 
the ODSA and the regulations in 46 CFR part 272, shall be used for 
determining the daily amount of subsidy. The U.S.-foreign cost 
differential shall be determined from price estimates of representative 
items of maintenance and repair work and by using the repair practices 
of the foreign-flag competition.
    (b) U.S.-foreign cost differential. MARAD shall use the following 
procedures for calculating the U.S.-foreign cost differential for M&R.
    (1) Cost Survey. MARAD shall select a sample of jobs which are 
representative of the various types of maintenance and repair work--
drydocking and underwater repairs, machinery repairs, hull and deck 
repairs, electrical repairs, exterior painting and interior painting, 
etc. The jobs shall be described fully and combined into a standard set 
of specifications based on a particular type of vessel. The same 
specifications shall be used for obtaining all price estimates. MARAD 
shall request reliable and mutually acceptable ship repair cost experts 
to ascertain the U.S. and foreign M&R prices. MARAD shall survey foreign 
countries during a three-year cycle. The survey year prices shall be 
adjusted in the years between surveys by price adjustments estimated by 
the ship repair cost experts.
    (2) Country cost differential. A country cost differential shall be 
determined for each country where work was performed on the competitive 
vessels. The country cost differential shall be 100 percent minus the 
ratio of the estimated foreign price to the U.S. price estimate. The 
U.S. price estimate shall be representative of the coastal area included 
in the subsidized service (for example East Coast) or, if more than one 
coast is served, the coast where the company is home based. For example:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Distribution of repairs. The distribution of repairs refers to 
the countries where M&R work was performed on the vessels of the 
foreign-flag competitor. When data on the repairing practices are 
obtained directly from the foreign competitor, they be used. If 
information about such practices is unavailable--or only partially 
available--data, published by the classification societies and Lloyd's 
Voyage Record, reporting the dates and localities of drydocking and 
completion of the various types of vessel surveys, shall be used for 
determining the geographical distribution of the unknown repairing 
practices. For diesel vessels, there are three basic types of surveys--
drydocking, machinery, and hull. For steam vessels, there is a fourth 
survey--boiler--in addition to the other three surveys. Since these 
surveys may be performed in different countries, they are weighted in 
order to determine the distribution of repairs. The weighting factors 
shall be: drydocking--20 percent, machinery--40 percent (10 percent 
allocated to boiler survey on steam vessels), and hull--40 percent.
    (4) Proportionate cost differential. A proportionate cost 
differential for each principal foreign-flag competitor shall be 
determined by multiplying the percentage distribution of repairs for 
each country where repair work was performed by the country cost 
differential for that country and by adding the resulting weighted 
percentages for all countries where repair work was performed.
    (5) U.S.-foreign cost differential. The U.S.-foreign cost 
differential shall be

[[Page 117]]

determined by multiplying the proportionate cost differential for each 
principal foreign-flag competitor by the competition weight factor for 
that competitor, and by adding the resulting differentials for all 
principal foreign-flag competitors, as shown in the following example.

    (c) Calculation. The appropriate U.S.-foreign cost differential 
shall be applied to the subsidizable and audited maintenance and repair 
costs for the three-year period, discussed in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, to establish a relationship of the cost differentials between 
M&R and wages. This relationship shall be used to establish the M&R 
subsidy on a current basis by applying the percentage relationship to 
the per diem wage subsidy rate.
    (1) Historical period. The relationship of calendar period M&R 
subsidy to fiscal period wage subsidy shall be measured for the three-
year period commencing five years prior to January 1 of the subsidized 
year. The M&R subsidy and the wage subsidy shall be expressed as an 
amount per voyage day for purposes of establishing the relationship. 
This ratio shall be established for each subsidized service and applied 
to the per diem wage rate of each ship type in the service to factor a 
daily amount of subsidy for M&R. The following is an example of the 
determination of the relationship and the daily amount of subsidy for 
M&R.

    (2) Data submission requirement. The operator is required to submit 
annually a certified statement of eligible and audited M&R expenses, 
segregated by service, for the historical period referred to in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The report shall be submitted to the 
Director, Office of Ship Operating Costs no later than January 1 of the 
subsidized year.

Sec. 282.23  Hull and machinery insurance.

    (a) Subsidy items. The fair and reasonable net premium costs 
(including stamp taxes) of hull and machinery, increased value, excess 
general average, salvage, and collision liability insurance against 
risks and liabilities covered under the terms and conditions of policies 
approved as to form and coverage by MARAD, less lay-up returns, shall be 
eligible for subsidy and used for determining the U.S.-foreign cost 
differential. Port risk premiums are eligible for subsidy but not for 
determining the U.S.-foreign cost differential.
    (b) U.S.-foreign cost differential. A U.S.-foreign cost differential 
shall be calculated for each service. Due to the difficulty of comparing 
forms and costs of hull and machinery insurance coverages, the following 
assumptions shall be used for estimating the composite premium cost of 
the foreign-flag competitor.
    (1) Coverage. The foreign competitive vessels have the same types 
and amounts of insurance coverages and deductible averages as the 
subsidized vessels.
    (2) Premium rate. The foreign competitive vessels are insured in the 
British market and the rate for such vessels is the same as the British 
market rate for the subsidized vessels. If the operator carries all of 
its insurance in the American market, the American market rate shall be 
assumed to be the same as the British market rate.
    (3) Repairs. Insurable repairs of the foreign competitive vessels 
are performed in the same countries and in the same distribution as non-
insurable repairs, and the cost differential for such repairs shall be 
the same as the maintenance and repair percentage differential.
    (4) Particular average. The percentage of particular average repair 
claims for the foreign competitive vessels is the same as the percentage 
of particular average repair claims for the subsidized vessels. The 
particular average portion of the premium cost for the subsidized 
vessels shall be determined as follows:
    (i) Percentage. The particular average portion of the premium cost 
shall be determined by applying a percentage to the hull and machinery 
premium cost after deducting the estimated total loss premium. The 
percentage is based on insured claims experience. The percentage shall 
be determined by dividing the total of underwriter's absorptions for 
particular average domestic repair claims paid and estimated by the 
total of underwriter's absorptions for all claims paid and estimated 
(excluding total loss and constructive total loss claims) under the hull 
and machinery portion of the insurance coverage, except that such 
percentage shall not exceed eighty-five (85) percent. The percentage is 
based on the claims experience of the subsidized vessels for the five 
(5) calendar year period preceding the subsidized year. For subsidized 
operators that do not have five years of claims experience, the average 
percentage of particular average domestic repair claims for all similar 
subsidized vessels shall be used unless the operator can submit data to 
substantiate its own claims cost experience on similar vessels.
    (ii) Data submission requirement. The operator shall submit the five 
year claims experience, invoices showing net premium costs and coverages 
for

[[Page 119]]

the subsidized year, and lay-up returns for the previous year to the 
Director, Office of Ship Operating Costs, not later than sixty (60) days 
after the cost of each calendar year.
    (c) Calculation. In calculating the subsidized premium cost, the 
following steps shall be taken:
    (1) The particular average portion of the premium cost shall be 
adjusted in order to give effect to the repair cost differential for the 
foreign competitive vessels by applying the complement of the 
maintenance and repairs percentage cost differential (100 percent minus 
the differential) to the particular average portion of the premium cost. 
The adjusted particular average foreign premium cost shall be added to 
the net premium cost excluding the particular average portion to 
determine the composite foreign premium cost.
    (2) The foreign premium cost shall be substracted from the 
operator's total premium cost to determine the difference in dollars. 
The percentage differential is determined by dividing the dollar 
difference by the operators' total premium cost. An example calculation 
is included in Table 2.
    (3) The net premium cost of the subsidized vessels shall be divided 
by the number of days in the calendar year and the resultant daily 
insurance cost shall be multiplied by the U.S.-foreign cost differential 
percentage applicable to the most recent year to determine the daily 
amount of subsidy for hull and machinery insurance.

Sec. 282.24  Protection and indemnity insurance.

    (a) Subsidy items. Items eligible for determination of subsidizable 
costs and the U.S.-foreign cost differential are:
    (1) Premiums. The fair and reasonable net premium costs (including 
stamp taxes) of protection and indemnity, excess insurance, second 
seamen's insurance, ``tovalop'' or other forms of pollution insurance, 
bumbershoot (only that portion identified as applicable to P&I 
insurance), cargo liability if excluded from the primary policy, 
supplemental calls against liabilities covered under the terms and 
conditions of policies approved as to form and coverage by MARAD, less 
lay-up return premiums, shall be eligible for subsidy and used for 
determining the U.S.-foreign cost differential.
    (2) Deductibles. The fair and reasonable cost of crew claims paid by 
and pending with the operator under the deductible provision of the 
protection and indemnity insurance policy approved as to form and 
coverage by MARAD, to the extent that such cost would have been paid by 
the insurance underwriter under the terms of the policy, except for the 
fact that it did not exceed the deductible provision of the policy, 
shall be eligible for subsidy. For subsidy purposes, the deductible 
absorption shall not exceed $50,000 for each accident or occurrence, 
provided however, that benefits paid on unearned wages, if excluded from 
coverage under the protection and indemnity insurance policy, shall be 
eligible, notwithstanding that the deductible provisions of the policy 
may be exceeded.
    (b) Assumption made in calculation. For purposes of determining 
subsidy for protection and indemnity insurance, it shall be assumed that 
the cost differential between the subsidized vessels and the foreign 
competitive vessels is limited to those portions of premium costs and 
deductible absorptions which are related to crew liability and that the 
cost of all other liabilities is the same for both the subsidized 
vessels and the foreign competitive vessels.
    (c) Calculation. The following is the method of calculating the 
U.S.-foreign cost differential for premiums:
    (1) General. A differential shall be calculated for each subsidized 
service of the vessel. Since the premium cost for all other liabilities 
is assumed to be the same for both the U.S. and foreign competitive 
vessels, the calculation of the differential for protection and 
indemnity insurance premiums is in effect based on the difference 
between U.S. and foreign premium costs for crew liabilities. Premium 
costs are determined in costs per gross registered ton (GRT).
    (2) Reporting Requirement. The operator shall submit the total 
premium cost for the subsidized year, plus any supplemental calls and 
lay-up return premiums not previously reported, to the Director, Office 
of Ship Operating Costs, not later than 60 days after the beginning of 
such year. The data shall be supported by invoices from the insurance 
underwriter.
    (3) U.S. crew liability cost. The crew liability portion of the 
total premium cost shall be determined by applying a percentage to the 
total premium cost based on five (5) years of claims experience for the 
five years commencing six years prior to January 1 of the subsidized 
year. The percentage shall be determined by dividing the total of 
underwriter's absorptions for crew claims, paid and estimated, by the 
total of underwriter's absorptions for all claims, paid and estimated. 
The crew claims portion shall be limited to eighty-five (85) percent 
unless the operator can substantiate a higher percentage as a result of 
having crew liability and all other liabilities insured with different 
underwriters. The operator shall submit the five-year claims experience 
not later than 60 days following the close of each calendar year.
    (4) All other liabilities cost--U.S. and foreign. The all other 
liabilities portion of the U.S. premium cost shall be determined by 
subtracting the crew liability portion from the total premium cost. The 
same cost shall be used for the all other liabilities portion of the 
foreign-flag competitor's premium cost.
    (5) Foreign crew liability cost. The crew liability cost of each 
principal foreign-flag competitor shall be used, if reliable cost data 
can be obtained. If such data cannot be obtained for a principal

[[Page 121]]

competitor, and it is determined that such competitor has a non-national 
crew, the crew liability cost for similar vessels registered under the 
flag of the crew's nationality may be used, at the Maritime 
Administrator's discretion, provided reliable cost data are obtained. If 
no reliable cost data are obtained for a competitor, the crew liability 
cost for that competitor shall be estimated by multiplying the 
subsidized operator's crew liability portion of the total premium cost 
by the ratio of that competitor's wage costs (FC) to the subsidized 
operator's wage costs (WC), as determined in the calculation of the wage 
differential.
    (6) U.S.-foreign cost differential. The U.S.-foreign cost 
differential shall be the excess of the operator's total premium cost 
over the principal foreign-flag competitor's estimated total premium 
cost, expressed as a percentage, calculated in the following manner.

  was applied to $3.98 to estimate the foreign cost.

    (d) Daily Subsidy Rate. The daily subsidy rate shall be calculated 
in the following manner:
    (1) Premiums. The net premium costs per calendar day for the 
subsidized year shall be multiplied by the U.S.-foreign cost 
differential percentage determined for the most recent year. The product 
shall be the daily amount of subsidy for P&I premiums.
    (2) Deductibles. (i) The eligible illness and injury crew claims 
paid and pending for each calendar year of a three-year period 
commencing six years prior to January 1 of the subsidized year shall be 
recalculated, if necessary, to reflect the operator's current deductible 
levels. These expenses, after audit, shall be multiplied by the 
percentage wage differential, as determined in the calculation of wage 
subsidy for the appropriate fiscal period. The resulting calendar period 
P&I deductible subsidy for the three-year period shall be divided by the 
voyage days for the period to arrive at an aggregate daily P&I 
deductible subsidy. The aggregate fiscal period wage subsidy accrued in 
the service for the three-year period shall be divided by the voyage 
days for the period to arrive at an aggregate daily wage subsidy amount. 
The aggregate daily P&I deductible subsidy for the three-year calendar 
period shall be divided by the aggregate daily wage subsidy for the 
three-year fiscal period. The resulting percentage shall be applied to 
the wage per diem calculated for each ship type in the service to derive 
the daily amount of subsidy for P&I deductibles. As to pending claims 
previously recognized in the historical period, only the amount of 
changes in cost with respect to such claims shall be subsequently 
recognized. The following methodology shall be used to determine subsidy 
for P&I deductibles.

    (ii) In cases where national insurance schemes cover crew claims 
costs in their entirety, resulting in no cost to the foreign competitor 
for deductible absorptions, the composite percentage differential for 
wages shall be adjusted by substituting a zero cost for such foreign 
competitor in the calculation of the differential. The adjustment of the 
wage percentage differential shall not be used for Japan, where 
operators incur minimal costs for deductible absorptions, rather than no 
costs. For Japan, the insurance related costs which are normally 
included in the calculation of Japanese wage costs shall be excluded in 
adjusting the wage percentage differential for this purpose.
    (3) Data submission requirement. The operator is required to submit 
annually a certified statement of eligible and audited crew claims, as 
identified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, for the historical 
period identified therein. The report shall be submitted to the 
Director, Office of Ship Operating Costs no later than January 1 of the 
subsidized year.

Sec.
283.1 Purpose.

283.5 Notification and reporting requirements.

    Authority: Sec. 204(b) Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 
U.S.C. 1114(b)); Reorganization Plans No. 21 of 1950 (64 Stat. 1273) and 
No. 7 of 1961 (75 Stat. 840), as amended by Pub. L. 91-469 (84 Stat.

1973).

    Source: 45 FR 37445, June 3, 1980, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 283.1  Purpose.

    (a) The rules of this part establish requirements for the 
declaration and payment of cash dividends by operators receiving 
operating-differential subsidy (ODS) under Title VI of the Merchant 
Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) (Act). This part 
shall be applicable immediately unless otherwise provided for in the 
operators' operating-differential subsidy agreement (ODSA).
    (b) One of the purposes of the Act is to foster the development and 
encourage the maintenance of the United States Merchant Marine. 
Subsidized operators are required to maintain the financial ability to 
assure adequate and timely reinvestment in the merchant marine. The 
policy contained herein takes into consideration the operators' 
contractual obligations to construct and acquire vessels, retire debt 
obligations secured by ship mortgages and maintain adequate working 
capital. However, this policy also takes into consideration the 
operators' need to attract new capital to the industry by paying 
dividends which are appropriate in light of the operators' earnings and 
long-range financial position.


<R05>
Sec. 283.2  Definitions.

    (a) Long-Term Debt means, as of any date, the total notes, bonds, 
debentures, equipment obligations and other evidence of indebtedness 
that would be included in Long-Term Debt in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles, less the balance of escrow fund deposits 
attributable to the principal of obligations guaranteed pursuant to 
Title XI of the Act, where deposits are required in accordance with 
Sec. 298.33. Capitalized Lease Obligations shall be included, but 
deferred income taxes shall not be included.
    (b) Capitalized Lease Obligations means, as of any date, an amount 
(excluding amounts already included in Long-Term Debt) equal to the sum 
of: (1) The present value of all capital leases, as defined and computed 
in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 
No. 13, Accounting for Leases (FASB-13), and

[[Page 126]]

(2) \1/2\ of the minimum rentals (less operating components such as 
insurance, maintenance, property taxes, etc.) of all operating leases, 
as defined and includable in footnotes to the financial statements in 
accordance with FASB-13, for shipping property, i.e., vessels, 
containers, barges, terminals and other similar property.
    (c) Equity (net worth) means, as of any date, the total of paid-in-
capital stock, paid-in-capital, retained earnings and all other amounts 
that would be included in Equity in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, but adjustable as follows. The net worth shall be 
reduced to the extent that the net worth computation includes any 
receivables from an affiliate of the company or any stockholder, 
director, officer, or employee (or any member of the employee's family) 
of the company, or of an affiliate of the company, other than (1) 
reasonable advances to affiliated agents required for the normal 
operation of the company's vessels, or (2) current receivables arising 
out of the ordinary course of business, and which are not outstanding 
for more than 120 days.
    (d) Floor net worth means net worth computed as follows: The net 
worth requirement for existing operators shall be initially set at the 
greater of 90 percent of the operator's existing net worth or 50 percent 
of the operator's long-term debt contained in its audited financial 
statements for the year ended December 31, 1979. A new operator's net 
worth requirement shall initially be set at the greater of 90 percent of 
existing net worth or 50 percent of the original long-term debt issued 
with respect to the operator's vessel(s).
    (e) Adjusted floor net worth means that the floor net worth 
requirement may be reduced with consent of the Maritime Administrator in 
an amount equivalent to amounts an operator could have paid in dividends 
under the previous policy set forth in this regulation prior to 
amendment in 1980, in the three years prior to the date of effectiveness 
of this policy, but chose not to pay out in dividends. The floor net 
worth requirement for both existing operators and new operators shall be 
further adjusted from time to time as follows:
    (1) The net worth requirement shall be increased by an amount equal 
to 50 percent of the original long-term debt to be issued with respect 
to new vessel construction (with respect to existing operators, new 
vessel construction contracts executed after December 31, 1979), and
    (2) the net worth requirements shall be decreased by an amount equal 
to 50 percent of the original long-term debt issued with respect to 
vessels which are removed from service or otherwise transferred or sold.
    (f) Working capital means the difference between current assets and 
current liabilities, both determined in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles, adjusted as follows:
    (1) Current assets shall be reduced with respect to:
    (i) Amounts in any Title XI Reserve Fund, pursuant to 46 CFR 
298.35(e) or Capital Construction Fund (CCF) Security Amount prescribed 
by 46 CFR 298.35(f), that is being maintained pursuant to an agreement 
covering a vessel owned or leased by the company, or in another similar 
fund required under any other mortgage, indenture or other agreement to 
which the company is a party;
    (ii) Any securities, obligations or evidences of indebtedness of an 
affiliate of the company or of any stockholder, director, officer or 
employee (or any member of the family of an employee of the company or 
of such affiliate), except: (a) Reasonable advances to affiliated agents 
required for the normal current operation of the company's vessels, or 
(b) receivables outstanding for not more than 120 days, arising out of 
the ordinary course of business.
    (2) Current assets shall be increased with respect to CCF accruals 
(but not actual deposits), if the operator has first met its prorated 
CCF minimum deposit schedule.
    (3) Current liabilities shall be increased by one-half of the annual 
payment of all charter hire and other lease obligations having a term of 
more than twelve months, other than charter hire and other lease 
obligations already included and reported as a current liability on the 
company's balance sheet.

[[Page 127]]

    (4) Current liabilities shall be decreased by amounts on deposit in 
a CCF which are available for the payment of current liabilities.
    (g) Prior years' earnings means the aggregate net income after tax 
for the three years immediately preceding the year in which the dividend 
is declared. An operator may include in prior years' earnings estimated 
net operating income after tax for the current fiscal year if such 
amount is based upon actual net operating income after tax for the first 
nine months of the current year. If an operator includes estimated 
current income in its prior years' earnings computation, it may also 
include earnings for only the immediately preceding two years, rather 
than three years, in the computation of prior years' earnings.
    (h) Funds available shall mean the sum of:
    (1) Amounts on deposit in any fund established pursuant to the Act 
plus accrued deposits, unless already included in working capital, 
(including interest thereon), less accrued withdrawals from any such 
fund;
    (2) Gross book value, as shown on the operators' books of account, 
of subsidized vessels and related barges and containers, less 
accumulated depreciation;
    (3) Progress payments made on subsidized vessels and related barges 
and containers undergoing construction, reconstruction, or 
reconditioning;
    (4) Progress payments made on additional vessels and related barges 
and containers, if any, which the operator has agreed to construct or 
acquire pursuant to any contract entered into with the Maritime 
Administrator or the Maritime Subsidy Board (Board);
    (5) Balance of trade-in allowances pursuant to section 510 of the 
Act;
    (6) Capitalized Lease Obligations as defined in Sec. 283.2(b); and
    (7) Working capital as defined in Sec. 283.2(f).
    (i) Funds required means the sum of:
    (1) 25 percent of the total cost to the operator of: (i) Subsidized 
vessels under construction, reconstruction or reconditioning, (ii) 
additional vessels under construction, reconstruction or reconditioning 
pursuant to any contract entered into between the operator and the 
Maritime Administrator or the Board, and (iii) barges and containers 
under construction or under contract to purchase, and to be used as part 
of the complement of such vessels;
    (2) 25 percent of the total cost to the operator, estimated at the 
time a cash dividend is to be declared, of: (i) Replacement of 
subsidized vessels required to be replaced under the current ODSA (which 
cost must be indicated whether or not the operator anticipates leasing 
replacement vessels), (ii) additional vessels which the operator has 
agreed to construct or acquire pursuant to any contract entered into 
with the Maritime Administrator or the Board, and (iii) barges and 
containers required as part of the complement of such vessels. In making 
this computation, the operator shall obtain the prior written agreement 
of the Maritime Subsidy Board as to number of replacement vessels, type 
and commercial characteristics, projected award date of construction 
contract, projected delivery dates, estimated total cost (current) and 
method used to determine such cost, intended area of operation, and 
identity of vessels to be replaced.
    (3) Capitalized Lease Obligations as defined in Sec. 283.2(b), 
excluding that portion of any such amount payable within one year; and
    (4) Outstanding indebtedness on, or secured by, subsidized vessels 
and related barges and containers, or incurred in connection with the 
acquisition, construction or reconstruction of such vessels and related 
barges and containers.


<R05>
Sec. 283.3  Dividend policy criteria.

    (a) In general. A subsidized operator may pay cash dividends at any 
time it desires up to the amount set forth in paragraph (b) of this 
section. Dividends may be paid pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section, as provided therein. The written approval of the Maritime 
Administrator shall be obtained prior to any declaration of dividends by 
the operator, if the payment of dividends does not meet the criteria of 
either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. It is intended that 
dividend payments be

[[Page 128]]

permitted under the provisions of either paragraph (b) or (c), whichever 
allows payment of the greatest amount of dividends. Nothing in this part 
shall alter restrictions on the payment of dividends which may affect 
the operator under any other agreements with the Maritime Administrator.
    (b) 40 percent dividend criteria--If the operator is able to meet 
the criteria of this paragraph after declaration and payment of the 
proposed dividend, it may declare a dividend of up to 40 percent of 
prior years' earnings, less any dividends that were paid in such years, 
unless there is an operating loss in the fiscal year to the date of 
proposed payment of dividend, as well as operating losses in the 
immediately preceding two years. If in any of the years included in the 
prior years' earnings calculation dividends were paid under the 100 
percent rule, those years' earnings and dividends may be excluded from 
the prior years' earnings calculation, and then only the earnings and 
dividends associated with the remaining years of the three year period 
may be used. This provision enables an operator to pay dividends under 
the 40 percent rule when in past years it has paid dividends under the 
100 percent rule. The criteria which must be satisfied are as follows:
    (1) Working Capital--Working Capital must equal or exceed one 
dollar.
    (2) Long-term Debt to Equity ratio--Long-Term Debt must not exceed 
two times Equity. (The Maritime Administrator may modify this 
requirement during periods of vessel construction).
    (3) Net Worth Floor--Net Worth must exceed the adjusted net worth 
floor as computed in Sec. 283.2.
    (c) An operator may declare a dividend in an amount up to 100 
percent of retained earnings, unless there is an operating loss in the 
fiscal year to the date of proposed payment of dividend, as well as 
operating losses in the immediately preceding two years, if the 
following criteria are satisfied:
    (1) Working Capital--Working Capital must equal or exceed one 
dollar.
    (2) Long-Term Debt to Equity ratio--Long-Term debt must not exceed 
Equity.
    (3) Net Worth Floor--Net worth must exceed the Adjusted Net Worth 
floor as computed in Sec. 283.2.
    (4) Funding for Replacement Vessels--Funds available must exceed 
Funds Required, and the basis for Funds Required for replacement vessels 
must receive prior approval, as provided in Sec. 283.2(i) herein.


<R05>
Sec. 283.4  Alternate standards.

    (a) The Maritime Administrator may waive or modify any of the 
financial terms or requirements otherwise applicable in part 283, upon 
determining that other factors exist which make alternate terms or 
requirements appropriate. An example of such a situation would involve 
an operator that: (1) Has no replacement obligation and (2) has a 
guarantee of charter hire or other guarantees sufficient to cover 
capital costs. In such cases, the Government's interest may be 
sufficiently protected although the operator cannot meet the standard 
part 283 requirements. Another example may be to include receivables 
otherwise excluded if they are properly guaranteed by an acceptable 
guarantor.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 283.5  Notification and reporting requirements.

    (a) Notice--The operator shall give written notice of a dividend 
declaration to the Maritime Administrator immediately upon such 
declaration.
    (b) Reports--The operator shall submit a report as described below 
whenever it declares a dividend or applies for approval under Sec. 
283.3 to declare a dividend as of the approximate date of such 
declaration or request. Such statements shall include information no 
less current than 30 days. If no dividends are declared during the 
calendar year, the operator is not required to submit a statement.

If the Maritime Administration determines that the operator was, for any 
reason, not qualified to pay the dividend, then the operator shall, in 
writing, request the approval of the Maritime Administrator for any 
subsequent dividend declaration. If such approval is then granted, the 
operator may follow the requirements of this part 283 once again. The 
reports required by

[[Page 129]]

this section shall be prepared in accordance with the definitions set 
forth in Sec. 283.2. A separate statement shall be submitted showing 
the adjustments made to working capital, long-term debt and net worth, 
and shall conform to the definitions of such items as contained herein. 
As appropriate, reports shall include the following:
    (1) The ratio of debt to equity, floor net worth and prior years' 
earnings in the format set forth in Schedule A;
    (2) The excess of ``funds available'' over ``funds required'' in the 
format as set forth in Schedule B;
    (3) Working capital as set forth in Schedule C; and
    (4) Other applicable limitations prescribed in any agreements 
between the operator and the Maritime Administrator affecting the 
payment of dividends.
    (c) Officials to whom notices and reports are to be directed. 
Operators shall submit, in triplicate, all notices, reports and requests 
prescribed in this part to the Secretary, Maritime Administration,

    (a) Applicability of regulations. The regulations prescribed in this 
part--
    (1) Apply to gain realized from the sale or loss of vessels, 
earnings from the operation of vessels, and interest (or otherwise) with 
respect to amounts previously deposited in the construction reserve 
fund, for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1964, and

    (b) Nonrecognition and accumulation. Section 511 of the Act 
provides, under conditions specified, for the nonrecognition, for income 
and excess-profits tax purposes, of the gain realized from the sale or 
indemnification for loss of certain vessels including certain vessels in

accumulation of the proceeds of such sales or indemnification and of 
certain earnings without liability under part I (section 531 and

1954, and the regulations thereunder (26 CFR 1.531 through 1.537-1

are available to any citizen as defined in paragraph (a)(4) of Sec. 
287.1, who, during any taxable year owns, in whole or in part, a vessel

vessel or vessels owned by any other person or persons can derive no 
benefit from the

[[Page 132]]

provisions relating to the nonrecognition of gain from the sale or loss 
of such vessel or vessels so owned, but may establish a construction 
reserve fund in which he may deposit earnings from the operation of such 
vessel or vessels.
    (d) Applicability of section 511. Section 511 of the Act applies 
only with respect to sales or losses of vessels within the scope of 
Sec. 287.3 or in respect of earnings derived from the operation of such 
vessels. A loss to be within section 511 of the Act must be an actual or 
constructive total loss. Whether there is a total loss, actual or 
constructive, will be determined by the Administration.


<R05>
Sec. 287.3  Requirements as to vessel operations.

    Section 511 of the Act applies with respect to vessels operated in 
the foreign or domestic commerce of the United States or in the 
fisheries of the United States and vessels acquired or being constructed 
for the purpose of such operation. The foreign commerce of the United 
States includes commerce or trade between the United States (including 
the District of Columbia), the territories and possessions which are 
embraced within the coastwise laws, and a foreign country or other 
territories and possessions of the United States. The domestic commerce 
of the United States includes commerce or trade between ports of the 
United States and its territories and possessions, embraced within the 
coastwise laws and on inland rivers. The fisheries include the fisheries 
of the United States and its territories and possessions. Section 511 of 
the Act does not apply to vessels operated in the foreign commerce or 
fisheries of any country other than the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 287.4  Application to establish fund.

    (a) Any person claiming to be entitled to the benefits of section 
511 of the Act may make application, in writing, to the Administration 
for permission to establish a construction reserve fund. The original 
application shall be executed and verified by the taxpayer, or if the 
taxpayer is a corporation, by one of its principal officers, in 
triplicate, and shall be accompanied by eight conformed copies when 
filed with the Administration. MARAD will accept electronic options

Sec. 287.5  Tentative authorization to establish fund.

    Where the time between the receipt by the Administration of the 
application for permission to establish a construction reserve fund and 
the date prior to which an amount received from the sale or loss of a 
vessel must be deposited to come within the scope of section 511 of the 
Act is insufficient to permit a determination of the eligibility of the 
applicant, the Administration may tentatively authorize the 
establishment of a construction reserve fund and the deposit of such 
amount therein. Such tentative authorization shall be subject to 
rescission by the Administration if subsequently it is determined that 
the applicant is not entitled to the benefits of section 511 of the Act, 
or has not complied with the statutory requirements. For example, a 
tentative authorization will be rescinded if the Administration 
ascertains that the applicant is not a citizen. Upon such determination, 
the fund shall be closed and all amounts on deposit therein shall be 
withdrawn.


<R05>
Sec. 287.6  Establishment of fund.

    (a) Authorization by the Administration. If the application is 
approved by the Administration, the Administration will adopt Orders 
authorizing the establishment of a construction reserve fund with the 
depository or depositories designated by the taxpayer and approved by 
the Administration. The Orders will provide for joint control by the 
Administration and the taxpayer over such fund, will set forth the 
conditions governing the establishment and maintenance of the fund and 
the making of deposits therein and withdrawals therefrom, and will 
designate the representatives authorized to execute instruments of 
withdrawal on behalf of the Administration.
    (b) Resolution or agreement of the taxpayer. A certified copy of the 
Orders of the Administration will be furnished the taxpayer. If the 
taxpayer is a corporation, it shall promptly adopt, through its board of 
directors, a resolution satisfactory in form and substance to the 
Administration, authorizing the establishment and maintenance of the 
fund in conformity with the action of the Administration. If the 
taxpayer is not a corporation, it shall promptly execute an agreement 
with the depository satisfactory in form and substance to the 
Administration to conform to the action of the Administration as set 
forth in the Orders. Certified copies of the Orders of the 
Administration and of the resolution of the taxpayer (if it is a 
corporation) will be furnished to the depository by the Administration 
and the taxpayer, respectively, for its guidance in maintaining the fund 
and honoring instruments of withdrawal. The taxpayer, if a corporation, 
shall also furnish the Administration with a certified copy of its 
resolution, or if not a corporation a duplicate original of its 
agreement with the depository.

    Note: The resolutions referred to in this section shall be retained 
2 years after a final release or settlement agreement is completed 
between the Maritime Administration/Maritime Subsidy Board and the 
taxpayer.

    (c) Constructive action not recognized. Constructive deposits, 
substitutions or withdrawals will not be recognized by the 
Administration in the establishment and maintenance of the fund.
    (d) Failure to make deposits as basis for termination of fund. In 
the event no deposit is made into the fund for more than five years, any 
amounts remaining in the fund shall be removed from the fund at the 
discretion of the Administration and, if so removed, the fund shall be 
terminated. In the event of such termination, see Sec. 287.23 for 
recognition of gain.

<R05>
Sec. 287.7  Circumstances permitting reimbursement from a construction reserve fund.

    (a) Payments prior to establishment of fund. If, prior to the 
establishment of a construction reserve fund under the regulations in 
this part, a taxpayer has made necessary payments under a contract which 
satisfies the provisions of the regulations in this part and section 511 
of the Act for the construction or acquisition of a new vessel, such 
taxpayer may, if subsequently authorized to establish a construction 
reserve fund under the regulations in this part, draw against such fund 
as reimbursement for the amount, if any, of other funds which, with the 
approval or ratification of the Administration, the taxpayer used for 
making such necessary payments prior to the establishment of the fund.
    (b) Payments subsequent to establishment of fund. If, subsequent to 
the establishment of a construction reserve fund under the regulations 
in this part, the taxpayer has made necessary payments under a contract 
which satisfies the provisions of the regulations in this part and 
section 511 of the Act for the construction or acquisition of a new 
vessel, such taxpayer may draw against such fund as reimbursement for 
the amount, if any, of other funds which, with the approval or 
ratification of the Administration, the taxpayer had used for the 
purpose of making such necessary payments.


<R05>
Sec. 287.8  Investment of funds in securities.

    (a) Obligations of or guaranteed by the United States. Interest-
bearing direct obligations of the United States, or obligations fully 
guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States may be 
deposited in the construction reserve fund in lieu of cash, may be 
purchased with cash on deposit in the fund, or may be substituted for 
securities or commitment to finance in the fund, subject to the 
provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Other securities. In cases where the taxpayer desires to deposit 
any securities in the fund in lieu of cash other than those of or 
guaranteed by the United States or to purchase such other securities 
with cash on deposit in the fund, or to substitute such other securities 
for securities or commitment to finance in the fund, the taxpayer shall 
make written application to the Administration and shall not consummate 
the transaction until the written consent of the Administration shall 
have been received. The application shall describe the securities fully. 
Every approval by the Administration of such application shall be 
conditioned upon agreement by the taxpayer forthwith to dispose of such 
securities upon subsequent request by the Administration. Immediately 
upon the purchase of any securities for deposit in the fund, the 
taxpayer shall advise the Administration, giving the date of purchase, a 
description of the securities, and the price paid therefor (net, 
brokerage and other charges, and gross). Ordinarily, the Administration 
will not approve the deposit in the fund in lieu of cash, or the 
purchase with cash on deposit in the fund or the substitution for 
securities in the fund of securities not actively traded in on exchanges 
registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. Chapter 
2B), or securities which are not legal for investment of trust funds. 
Whenever the Administration approves the substitution of other 
securities for securities in the fund, such substitution shall be 
effected only upon or after the deposit of the substituted securities 
into the fund.
    (c) Cash. Cash may be substituted for amounts which are on deposit 
in the fund in any other form.
    (d) Devalued securities. In the event the Administration determines 
that the market value at any date of any securities in the fund has 
decreased to a figure which is less than 90 percent of the market value 
at the time of deposit into the fund, then within 60 days after the 
taxpayer receives notice of such determination the taxpayer shall 
(except as otherwise provided in this paragraph) deposit into the fund 
cash or securities in an amount equal to the difference between the 
current market value of the devalued securities and the market value of 
such securities at the time of their original deposit. However, if any 
securities in the fund are valued at the time of their deposit at less 
than the market value of such securities at

[[Page 137]]

the time of their deposit the taxpayer shall be required to deposit only 
an amount equal to that portion of the difference between the current 
market value of the devalued securities and the market value of such 
securities at the time of their original deposit which bears the same 
ratio to such total difference as the amount at which the securities 
were valued at the time of their deposit bears to the market value at 
the time of such deposit.


<R05>
Sec. 287.9  Valuation of securities in fund.

    (a) Equipment values. In cases where securities are deposited in the 
fund in lieu of cash, or are purchased with cash on deposit in the fund, 
or are substituted for securities in the fund, the value of such 
securities must not be less than the amount of cash in lieu of which 
they are so deposited or with which they are so purchased, or the value 
at the time of deposit of the securities for which they were so 
substituted. If the securities on deposit in the fund are replaced by 
cash from the general funds of the taxpayer, the amount of cash to be 
deposited in the fund in lieu thereof shall be not less than the amount 
at which such securities were valued at the time of their deposit in the 
fund.
    (b) Determination of value. (1) For the purpose of determining the 
amount in the fund, the value of securities shall be their ``market 
value'' (which shall be the basis for determining value, unless 
otherwise agreed to by the administration) and shall be determined in 
the following manner:
    (i) In instances where no actual purchase is involved, such as the 
initial deposit of securities in the fund in lieu of cash, the last 
sales price thereof on the principal exchange on the day the deposit was 
made shall be deemed to be the ``market value'' thereof, or, if no such 
sales were made, the ``market value'' thereof will be determined by the 
Administration on such basis as it may deem to be fair and reasonable in 
each case.
    (ii) In instances where the purchase of securities with cash on 
deposit in the fund is involved, ``market value'' shall be the gross 
price paid (adjusted for accrued interest); Provided, That if such 
securities are purchased otherwise than upon a registered exchange the 
price shall be within the range of transactions on the exchange on the 
date of such purchase, or, if there were no such transactions, then the 
``market value'' thereof will be determined by the Administration on 
such basis as it may deem to be fair and reasonable in each case.
    (2) Purchase-money obligations secured by mortgages on vessels sold 
or irrevocable commitments to finance the construction or acquisition of 
new vessels which are deposited in the construction reserve fund as 
provided in Sec. 287.13 ordinarily will be considered as equivalent to 
their face value.


<R05>
Sec. 287.10  Withdrawals from fund.

    (a) Withdrawals for obligations or liquidation. (1) Checks, drafts, 
or other instruments of withdrawal to meet obligations under a contract 
for the construction or acquisition of new vessel or vessels or for the 
liquidation of existing or subsequently incurred purchase-money 
indebtedness, after having been executed by the taxpayer, shall be 
forwarded to the Administration in Washington, DC, with appropriate 
explanation of the purpose of the proposed withdrawal, including 
properly certified invoices or other supporting papers. Such instruments 
of withdrawal, if payable to the Administration, will be deposited by 
the Administration for collection, and the proceeds thereof, upon 
collection, will be credited to the appropriate contract with the 
Administration; but if drawn to the order of payees other than the 
Administration, after countersignature on behalf of the Administration, 
will ordinarily be forwarded to the payees.
    (2) An amount obligated under a contract for the construction or 
acquisition of a new vessel or vessels or for the liquidation of 
existing or subsequently incurred purchase-money indebtedness, whether 
the obligor has the entire or a partial interest therein within the 
scope of section 511 of the Act, may not, so long as the contract or 
indebtedness continues in full force and effect, be withdrawn except to 
meet payments due or to become due under such contract or for such 
liquidation.

[[Page 138]]

    (b) Other withdrawals. Checks, drafts, or other instruments of 
withdrawal executed by the taxpayer for purposes other than to meet 
obligations under a contract for the construction or acquisition of a 
new vessel or vessels or for the liquidation of existing or subsequently 
incurred purchase-money indebtedness, whether the taxpayer has the 
entire or a partial interest therein, shall be drawn by the taxpayer to 
its own order and forwarded to the Administration in Washington, DC, 
with appropriate explanation of the purpose of the proposed withdrawal. 
Such withdrawals may occur by reason of a determination by the 
Administration that the taxpayer is not entitled to the benefits of 
section 511 of the Act (see Sec. 287.5), or that a particular deposit 
has been improperly made (see Sec. 287.13), or by reason of the 
election of the taxpayer to make such withdrawals. Upon receipt of such 
checks, drafts, or other instruments of withdrawal, the Administration 
will give notice thereof to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The 
Commissioner will advise the Administration of the receipt of the notice 
and the date it was received. The Administration shall not countersign 
such checks, drafts, or other instruments of withdrawal or transmit them 
to the taxpayer until the expiration of 30 days from the date of receipt 
of the notice by the Commissioner, unless the Commissioner or such 
official of the Internal Revenue Service as he may designate for the 
purpose consents in writing to earlier countersignature by the 
Administration and transmittal to the taxpayer. Upon the expiration of 
such 30-day period, or prior thereto if the aforesaid consent of the 
Commissioner has been obtained, the Administration will countersign the 
check, draft, or other instrument of withdrawal and forward it to the 
taxpayer.
    (c) Inapplicability to certain transactions. The provisions of this 
section shall not be applicable to transactions deemed to be withdrawals 
by reason of the sale of securities held in the fund for an amount less 
than the market value thereof at the time of their deposit (see Sec. 
287.23), nor to the cancellation of an irrevocable commitment deposited 
in the fund, upon proof satisfactory to the Administration that the 
terms of such commitment have been fully satisfied.


<R05>
Sec. 287.11  Time deposits.

    Deposits in the construction reserve fund not invested in securities 
may be placed in time deposits when, in the judgment of the taxpayer, it 
is desirable and feasible so to do. The taxpayer shall promptly advise 
the Administration of any time deposit arrangements made with the 
depository. The Administration reserves the right at any time to require 
the termination or modification of any such arrangements. With prior 
approval of the Administration a time deposit may be made in a 
depository other than the one with which the construction reserve fund 
is established.


<R05>
Sec. 287.12  Election as to nonrecognition of gain.

    (a) Election requirements. As a prerequisite to the nonrecognition 
of gain on the sale or loss of a vessel (or of a part interest therein) 
for Federal income tax purposes, the taxpayer, after establishing a 
construction reserve fund, must make an election with respect to such 
vessel or interest in the manner set forth in this paragraph.
    (1) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, the election must be made in the taxpayer's Federal income tax 
return (or, in the case of a partnership, in the partnership return of 
income) for the taxable year in which the gain with respect to the sale 
or loss of the vessel is realized. The election as to the nonrecognition 
of gain shall be shown by a statement to that effect, submitted as a 
part of, and attached to, the return. The statement, which need not be 
on any prescribed form, shall set forth a computation of the amount of 
the realized gain, the identity of the vessel, the nature and extent of 
the taxpayer's interest therein, whether such vessel was sold or lost 
and the date of sale or loss, the full sale price or full amount of 
indemnity, and the amount and date of each payment thereof, the basis of 
tax purposes and any other data affecting the determination of the 
realized gain.
    (2) Certain Government payments. In case a vessel is purchased or 
requisitioned by the United States, or is

[[Page 139]]

lost, in any taxable year and the taxpayer receives payment for the 
vessel so purchased or requisitioned, or receives from the United States 
indemnity on account of such loss, subsequent to the end of such taxable 
year, the taxpayer shall make his election by filing notice thereof with 
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC, 20224, prior to 
the expiration of 60 days after receipt of the payment or indemnity. The 
taxpayer shall file a copy of the notice with the Secretary, Maritime 
Administration, Washington, DC, 20590. The form of the notice of 
election shall be prepared by the taxpayer and shall be substantially as

<R05>
Sec. 287.13  Deposit of proceeds of sales or indemnities.

    (a) Manner of deposit. The deposit required by section 511 of the 
Act must be made in a construction reserve fund established with a 
depository or depositories approved by the Administration and subject to 
the joint control of the Administration and the taxpayer. It is not 
necessary to establish a separate fund with respect to each vessel or 
share in a vessel sold or lost.
    (b) Amount of deposit. With respect to any vessel sold or lost, or a 
share therein, the deposit must be in an amount equal to the ``net 
proceeds'' of the sale, or the ``net indemnity'' for the loss. By ``net 
proceeds'' and ``net indemnity'' is meant (1) the depositor's interest 
in the adjusted basis of the vessel plus (2) the amount of gain which 
would be recognized for tax purposes in the absence of section 511 of 
the Act. In determining ``net proceeds'', the amount necessarily paid or 
incurred for brokers' commissions is to be deducted from the gross 
amount of the sales price. In the event the taxpayer is an affiliate or 
associate of the buyer, the amount of the sales price shall not exceed 
the fair market value of the vessel or vessels sold as determined by the 
Administration. In such case the taxpayer shall furnish evidence 
sufficient, in the opinion of the Administration, to establish that the 
sales price is not in excess of the fair market value. In determining 
``net indemnity'', the amount necessarily paid or incurred purely for 
collection, or rate of exchange discounts on the payment, of the 
indemnity is to be deducted from the gross amount of collectible 
indemnity. In case of the sale or loss of several vessels or share 
therein, a deposit of the ``net proceeds'' or ``net indemnity'' with 
respect to one or more of the vessels or shares is permissible. Where 
several vessels or shares are sold for a lump sum, the ``net proceeds'' 
allocated to each vessel or share shall be determined in accordance with 
any reasonable rule satisfactory to the Commissioner of Internal 
Revenue. The taxpayer must deposit the full amount of each payment 
(including cash, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness) as a

[[Page 140]]

single deposit in the construction reserve fund. A payment divided 
between two or more depositories will be regarded as a single deposit. 
Amounts received by the taxpayer prior to the date of consummation of 
the sale of the vessel shall be considered as having been received by 
the taxpayer at the time the sale is consummated.
    (c) Purchase-money obligations. Where the proceeds from the sale of 
a vessel include purchase-money obligations, such obligations together 
with the entire collateral therefor, or, in the case of deposit of the 
proceeds of a share in the vessel, a proportionate part of the 
obligations and collateral as determined by the Administration, shall be 
deposited, with the remainder of the proceeds, in the construction 
reserve fund as a part of the ``net proceeds''. The depository shall 
receive payment of all amounts due on such purchase-money obligations 
and such amounts shall be placed in the fund in substitution for the 
portion of the obligations paid. All installments of purchase-money 
obligations shall be paid directly into the fund by the obligor. In the 
event any such installment is not so deposited, the Administration, at 
any time after the due date, may require the taxpayer to deposit an 
amount equal to such installment. If the taxpayer so desires, he may 
deposit in the construction reserve fund cash or approved securities in 
an amount equal to the face value of any purchase-money obligations in 
lieu of depositing such obligations.
    (d) Vessel subject to mortgage at time of sale or loss. Where a 
vessel is subject to a mortgage or other encumbrance at the time of its 
sale or loss and the taxpayer actually receives only an amount 
representing the equity therein or a share in such equity corresponding 
to his share in the vessel, he shall deposit in the construction reserve 
fund such amount and concurrently therewith other funds in an amount 
equal to the difference between the amount received and the ``net 
proceeds'' or ``net indemnity''. Such other funds may be in the form of 
cash, or, subject to the approval of the Administration, (1) interest-
bearing securities, or (2) an irrevocable and unconditional commitment 
to finance the construction or acquisition of a new vessel in whole or 
in part by an obligor approved by the Administration in an amount equal 
to the amount by which the ``net proceeds'' exceed the cash or 
securities deposited in the fund.
    (e) Unauthorized deposits. A deposit which is not provided for by 
section 511 of the Act shall, without unreasonable delay, be withdrawn 
from the fund and tax liability will be determined as though such 
deposit had not been made. (See Sec. Sec. 287.10 and 287.24.)


<R05>
Sec. 287.14  Deposit of earnings and receipts.

    (a) Earnings. A citizen may deposit all or any part of earnings 
derived from the operation, within the scope of Sec. 287.3, of a vessel 
or vessels owned either by himself or any other person, if such earnings 
are intended for construction or acquisition of new vessels. Such 
earnings may include payments received by an owner, as compensation for 
use of his vessel, from other persons by whom it is so operated. 
Earnings from other sources may not be deposited. The earnings from 
operation of vessels which are eligible for deposit are the net earnings 
determined without regard to any deduction for depreciation, 
obsolescence, or amortization with respect to such vessels.
    (b) Receipts. Receipts from deposited funds, in the form of interest 
or otherwise, may be deposited.


<R05>
Sec. 287.15  Time for making deposits.

    (a) Proceeds of sale or indemnification. Deposits of amounts 
representing proceeds of the sale or indemnification for loss of a 
vessel or share therein must be made within 60 days after receipt by the 
taxpayer.
    (b) Earnings and receipts. Earnings and receipts for the taxable 
year may be deposited at any time. (See Sec. 287.14.)


<R05>
Sec. 287.16  Tax liability as to earnings deposited.

    Deposit in the construction reserve fund of earnings from the 
operation of a vessel or vessels, or receipts, in the form of interest 
or otherwise, with respect to amounts previously deposited does not 
exempt the taxpayer from tax liability with respect thereto nor postpone 
the time such earnings or receipts

[[Page 141]]

are includible in gross income. Earnings and receipts deposited in a 
construction reserve fund established in accordance with the provisions 
of section 511 of the Act and the regulations in this part will be 
deemed to have been accumulated for the reasonable needs of the business 
within the meaning of part 1 (section 531 and following), subchapter G, 
chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, so long as the 
requirements of section 511 of the Act and the regulations in this part 
are satisfied relative to the use of the fund in the construction, 
reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of new vessels, or for 
the liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness on such vessels. For 
incurrence of tax liability due to noncompliance with the requirements 
of section 511 of the Act and the regulations in this part with respect 
to deposits in the construction reserve fund, see the provisions of 
Sec. 287.23.


<R05>
Sec. 287.17  Basis of new vessel.

    The basis for determining gain or loss and for depreciation for the 
purpose of the Federal income tax with respect to a new vessel 
constructed, reconstructed, reconditioned, or acquired by the taxpayer, 
or with respect to which purchase-money indebtedness is liquidated as 
provided in section 511(g) of the Act, with funds deposited in the 
construction reserve fund, is reduced by the amount of the unrecognized 
gain represented in the funds allocated under the provisions of the 
regulations in this part to the cost of such vessel. (See Sec. 287.18.)


<R05>
Sec. 287.18  Allocation of gain for tax purposes.

    (a) General rules of allocation. As provided in Sec. 287.17, if 
amounts on deposit in a construction reserve fund are expended, 
obligated, or withdrawn for construction, reconstruction, 
reconditioning, or acquisition of new vessels, or for the liquidation of 
purchase-money indebtedness of such vessels, the portion thereof which 
represents gain shall be applied in reduction of the basis of such new 
vessels. The rules set forth below in this paragraph shall apply in 
allocating the unrecognized gain to the amounts so expended, obligated, 
or withdrawn:
    (1) If the ``net proceeds'' of a sale or ``net indemnity'' in 
respect of a loss are deposited in more than one deposit, the portion 
thereof representing unrecognized gain shall be considered as having 
been deposited first.
    (2) Amounts expended, obligated, or withdrawn from the construction 
reserve fund shall be applied against amounts deposited in the order of 
deposit.
    (3) If any deposit consists in part of gain not recognized under 
section 511(c) of the Act, then any expenditure, obligation, or 
withdrawal applied against such deposit shall be considered to consist 
of gain in the same proportion that the part of the deposit which 
constitutes gain bears to the total amount of the deposit.
    (b) Date of obligation. The date funds are obligated under a 
contract for the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or 
acquisition of new vessels, or for the liquidation of purchase-money 
indebtedness on such vessels, rather than the date of payment from the 
fund, will determine the order of application against the deposits in 
the fund. When a contract for the construction, reconstruction, 
reconditioning, or acquisition of new vessels, or for the liquidation of 
purchase-money indebtedness on such vessels is entered into, amounts on 
deposit in the construction reserve fund will be deemed to be obligated 
to the extent of the amount of the taxpayer's liability under the 
contract. Deposits will be deemed to be so obligated in the order of 
deposit, each new contract obligating the earliest deposit not 
previously expended, obligated, or withdrawn. If the liability under the 
contract exceeds the amount in the construction reserve fund, the 
contract will be deemed to obligate, to the extent of that part of such 
excess not otherwise satisfied, the earliest deposit or deposits 
thereafter made.
    (c) Illustration. The foregoing rules are illustrated in the 
following example:

    Example. (1) A taxpayer who makes his returns on the calendar year 
basis sells a vessel in 1963 for $1,000,000, realizing a gain of 
$400,000. Payment of $100,000 is received in March 1963 when the 
contract is signed, and the balance of $900,000 is received in June 1963 
on delivery of the vessel. The $1,000,000 is deposited in a construction 
reserve fund in

[[Page 142]]

July 1963. In December 1963, the taxpayer also deposits $150,000, 
representing earnings of that year. In 1964, he sells another vessel for 
$1,000,000, realizing a gain of $250,000. The sale price of $1,000,000 
is received on delivery of the vessel in February 1964, and deposited in 
the construction reserve fund in March 1964. In September 1964, the 
taxpayer purchases for cash out of the construction reserve fund a new 
vessel for $1,750,000. To the cost of this vessel must be allocated the 
1963 deposits of $1,150,000 and $600,000 of the March 1964 deposit. This 
leaves in the fund $400,000 of the March 1964 deposit. The amount of the 
unrecognized gain to be applied against the basis of the new vessel is 
$550,000, computed as follows: Gain of $400,000 represented in the 1963 
deposits, plus the same proportion of the $250,000 gain represented in 
the March 1964 deposit ($1,000,000) which the amount ($600,000) 
allocated to the vessel is of the amount of the deposit, i.e., $400,000 
plus 600,000/1,000,000 of $250,000 or $150,000, a total of $550,000. 
This reduces the basis of the new vessel to $1,200,000 ($1,750,000 less 
$550,000).
    (2) In 1965, the taxpayer sells a third vessel for $3,000,000, 
realizing a gain of $900,000. The $3,000,000 is received and deposited 
in the construction reserve fund in June 1965, making a total in the 
fund of $3,400,000. In December 1965, the taxpayer contracts for the 
construction of a second new vessel to cost a maximum of $3,200,000, 
thereby obligating that amount of the fund, and in June 1966, receives 
permission to withdraw the unobligated balance amounting to $200,000. To 
the cost of the second new vessel must be allocated the $400,000 balance 
of the March 1964 deposit and $2,800,000 of the June 1965 deposit. The 
unrecognized gain to be applied against the basis of such new vessel is 
that proportion of the gain represented in each deposit which the 
portion of the deposit allocated to the vessel bears to the amount of 
such deposit, i.e., 400,000/1,000,000 of $250,000, or $100,000 plus 
2,800,000/3,000,000 of $900,000, or $840,000 making a total of $940,000. 
The $200,000 withdrawal is applied against the June 1965 deposit and the 
portion thereof which represents gain will be recognized as income for 
1965, the year in which realized. The computation of the recognized gain 
is as follows: 200,000/3,000,000 of $900,000, or $60,000.


<R05>
Sec. 287.19  Requirements as to new vessels.

    (a) Requirements. For the purposes of section 511 of the Act and the 
regulations in this part, the new vessel must be--
    (1) Documented under the laws of the United States when it is 
acquired by the taxpayer, or the taxpayer must agree that when acquired 
it will be documented under the laws of the United States;
    (2)(i) Constructed in the United States after December 31, 1939, or 
(ii) its construction has been financed under Title V or Title VII of 
the Act, or (iii) its construction has been aided by a mortgage insured 
under Title XI of the Act; and
    (3) Either (i) of such type, size, and speed as the Administration 
determines to be suitable for use on the high seas or Great Lakes in 
carrying out the purposes of the Act, but of not less than 2,000 gross 
tons or of less speed than 12 knots, except that a particular vessel may 
be of lesser tonnage or speed if the Administration determines and 
certifies that the particular vessel is desirable for use by the United 
States in case of war or national emergency, or (ii) constructed to 
replace a vessel or vessels requisitioned or purchased by the United 
States, in which event it must be of such type, size, and speed as to 
constitute a suitable replacement for the vessel requisitioned or 
purchased, but if a vessel already built is acquired to replace a vessel 
or vessels requisitioned or purchased by the United States, such vessel 
must meet the requirements set forth in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this 
section. Ordinarily, under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, a vessel 
constructed more than five years before the date on which deposits in a 
construction reserve fund are to be expended or obligated for 
acquisition of such vessel will not be considered suitable for use in 
carrying out the purpose of the Act, except that the five-year age 
limitation provided above in this sentence shall not apply to a vessel 
to be reconstructed before being placed in operation by the taxpayer.
    (b) Time of construction. A vessel will be deemed to be constructed 
after December 31, 1939, only if construction was commenced after that 
date. Subject to the provisions of this section, a new vessel may be 
newly built for the taxpayer, or may be acquired after it is built.
    (c) Replacement of vessels. It is not necessary that vessels shall 
be replaced vessels for vessel. The new vessels may be more or less in 
number than the replaced vessels, provided the other requirements of 
this section are met.

[[Page 143]]


<R05>
Sec. 287.20  Obligation of deposits.

    (a) Time for obligation. Within three years from the date of any 
deposit in a construction reserve fund, unless extension is granted as 
provided in Sec. 287.22, such deposit must be obligated under a 
contract for the construction or acquisition of a new vessel or vessels 
(or in the discretion of the Administration for a share therein), with 
not less than 12\1/2\ percent of the construction or contract price of 
the entire vessel or vessels actually paid or irrevocably committed on 
account thereof or must be expended or obligated for the liquidation of 
existing or subsequently incurred purchase-money indebtedness to persons 
other than a parent company of, or a company affiliated or associated 
with, the mortgagor on a new vessel or vessels. Amounts on deposit in a 
construction reserve fund will be deemed to be obligated for expenditure 
when a binding contract of construction or acquisition has been entered 
into or when purchase-money indebtedness has been incurred and, if 
obligated under a contract of construction or acquisition, will be 
deemed to be irrevocably committed when due and payable in accordance 
with the terms of the contract of construction or acquisition.
    (b) Requirements for obligation. Unless otherwise authorized by the 
Administration, contracts for the construction of new vessels must be 
for a fixed price, or provide for a base price that may be adjusted for 
changes in labor and material costs not exceeding 15 percent of the base 
price. The fixed or base price, as the case may be, shall be fair and 
reasonable as determined by the Maritime Administration. Any financial 
or other interests between the taxpayer and the contractor shall be 
disclosed to the Administration by the taxpayer. Plans and 
specifications for the new vessel or vessels must be approved by the 
Administration to the extent it deems necessary. A deposit in a 
construction reserve fund may be expended or obligated for expenditure 
for procurement under an acquisition or construction contract of a part 
interest in a new vessel or vessels only after obtaining the written 
consent of the Administration. The granting of such consent shall be 
entirely in the discretion of the Administration and it may impose such 
conditions with respect thereto as it may deem necessary or advisable 
for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of section 511 of the 
Act. Applications for such consent shall be executed in triplicate, and, 
together with eight conformed copies thereof, filed with the 
Administration.


<R05>
Sec. 287.21  Period for construction of certain vessels.

    A new vessel constructed otherwise than under the provisions of 
Title V of the Act, and not purchased from the Administration must, 
within six months from the date of the construction contract, or within 
the period of any extension, be completed to the extent of not less than 
5 percent as estimated by the Administration and certified by it to the 
Secretary of the Treasury. In case of a contract covering more than one 
vessel it will be sufficient if one of the vessels is 5 percent 
completed within the six months' period from the date of the contract or 
within the period of any extension, and so certified. All construction 
must be completed with reasonable dispatch as determined by the 
Administration. If, for causes within the control of the taxpayer, the 
entire construction is not completed with reasonable dispatch, the 
Administration will so certify to the Secretary of the Treasury. For the 
effect of such certification, see Sec. 287.23.


<R05>
Sec. 287.22  Time extensions for expenditure or obligation.

    (a) Extensions. The Administration, upon application and a showing 
of proper circumstances, (1) may allow an extension of time within which 
deposits shall be expended or obligated, not to exceed one year, and 
upon a second application received before the expiration of the first 
extension, may allow an additional extension not to exceed one year, and 
(2) may allow an extension or extensions of time within which five 
percent of the construction shall have been completed as provided in 
Sec. 287.21 not to exceed one year in the aggregate, and (3) may allow 
any other extensions that may be provided by amendment to the Act.

[[Page 144]]

    (b) Application required. A taxpayer seeking an extension of time 
shall make application therefor, and transmit it with an appropriate 
statement of the circumstances, including the reasons justifying the 
requested extension or extensions, and appropriate documents in 
substantiation of the statement, to the Administration. The 
Administration will notify the Commissioner of Internal Revenue of any 
extension granted. In case an application for extension is denied, the 
taxpayer will be liable for delay as though no application had been 
made.


<R05>
Sec. 287.23  Noncompliance with requirements.

    (a) Noncompliance. The amount of the gain which is that portion of 
the construction reserve fund otherwise constituting taxable income 
under the law applicable to the taxable year in which such gain was 
realized shall be included in the taxpayer's gross income for such 
taxable year for income or excess-profits tax purposes, if:
    (1) A portion of such fund is withdrawn for purposes other than--
    (i) The construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition 
of a new vessel; or
    (ii) The liquidation of existing or subsequently incurred purchase-
money indebtedness to persons other than a parent company of, or a 
company affiliated or associated with, the mortgagor on a new vessel or 
vessels; or
    (2) The taxpayer fails to comply with the requirements of section 
511 of the Act or the regulations in this part relating to the 
utilization of construction reserve funds in the construction, 
reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of a new vessel, or the 
liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness on such a vessel.

If securities on deposit in a construction reserve fund are sold and the 
amount placed in the fund in lieu thereof is less than the value of the 
securities at the time of their deposit, the difference between such 
market value and the amount placed in the fund in lieu of the securities 
will be deemed to have been withdrawn. With respect to the substitution 
of new financing in the case of an irrevocable commitment, see paragraph 
(d) of Sec. 287.13.
    (b) Amount recognized. In the event of noncompliance with the 
prescribed conditions relative to any contract for construction, 
reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of new vessels, or for 
the liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness on such vessels, 
recognition will extend to the entire amount of the gain represented in 
that portion of the construction reserve fund obligated under such 
contract. Thus, if the Administration determines and certifies to the 
Secretary of the Treasury that for causes within the control of the 
taxpayer construction under a contract is not completed with reasonable 
dispatch, the entire amount of the gain represented in the portion of 
the construction reserve fund obligated under the contract will be 
recognized even though all other conditions have been satisfied. In case 
of noncompliance with the requirements of section 511 of the Act or the 
regulations in this part, see the provisions of Sec. 287.18 as to the 
allocation of gain.
    (c) Unreasonable accumulation. Noncompliance with the provisions of 
section 511 of the Act or the regulations in this part relative to the 
utilization of the deposited amounts may also, inasmuch as the provision 
of section 511(f) of the Act is then inapplicable, warrant an 
examination to ascertain whether such amounts constitute an unreasonable 
accumulation of earnings and profits within the meaning of part I 
(section 531 and following), subchapter G, chapter 1 of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1954, or corresponding provisions of prior law. If 
amounts are deposited and the fund maintained in good faith for the 
purpose of construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, and acquisition 
of new vessels, or for the liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness on 
such vessels, such amounts will be deemed to have been accumulated for 
the reasonable needs of the business.


<R05>
Sec. 287.24  Extent of tax liability.

    (a) Declared value excess-profits tax. Gain which is includible in 
gross income under Sec. 287.23 shall be included in gross income for 
all income and excess-profits tax purposes, but not for the

[[Page 145]]

purposes of the declared value excess-profits tax and the capital stock 
tax as provided in section 511(i) of the Act. In lieu of any adjustment 
with respect to such declared value excess-profits tax, there is imposed 
for any taxable year ending on or before June 30, 1945, in which the 
gain is realized an additional tax of 1.1 percent of the amount of the 
gain. No additional capital stock tax liability is incurred.
    (b) Improper deposits. In the case of deposits in the construction 
reserve fund of amounts derived from sources other than those specified 
in section 511 of the Act, or in the case of failure to deposit an 
amount equal to the ``net proceeds'' or ``net indemnity'' within the 
period prescribed in section 511(c) of the Act and Sec. 287.15, the 
taxpayer obtains no suspension or postponement of any tax liability and 
the tax is collectible without regard to the provisions of section 
511(c) of the Act.
    (c) Time for filing claim subsequent to election under section 
511(c)(2). If an election is made under section 511(c)(2) of the Act, 
and paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 287.12, and if computation or 
recomputation in accordance therewith is otherwise allowable but is 
prevented, on the date of filing of notice of such election, or within 
six months thereafter, by any statute of limitation, such computation or 
recomputation nevertheless shall be made notwithstanding such statute if 
a claim therefor is filed within six months after the date of making 
such election. If as the result of such computation or recomputation an 
overpayment is disclosed, a claim for refund on Form 843 should also be 
filed within such six months' period.


<R05>
Sec. 287.25  Assessment and collection of deficiencies.

    Any additional tax, including the 1.1 percent amount imposed by 
section 511(i) of the Act, due on account of withdrawal from a 
construction reserve fund, or failure to comply with section 511 of the 
Act or the regulations in this part, is collectible as a deficiency. 
Interest upon such deficiency will run from the date the withdrawal or 
noncompliance occurs. The amount of any deficiency, including interest 
and additions to the tax, determined as a result of such withdrawal or 
noncompliance, may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the 
collection thereof may be begun without assessment, at any time and 
without regard to any period of limitations or any other provisions of 
law or rule of law, including the doctrine of res judicata.


<R05>
Sec. 287.26  Reports by taxpayers.

    (a) Information required. With each income tax return filed for a 
taxable year during any part of which a construction reserve fund is in 
existence the taxpayer shall submit a statement setting forth a detailed 
analysis of such fund. The statement, which need not be on any 
prescribed form, shall include the following information with respect to 
the construction reserve fund:
    (1) The actual balance in the fund at the beginning and end of the 
taxable year;
    (2) The date, amount, and source of each deposit during the taxable 
year;
    (3) If any deposit referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section 
consists of proceeds from the sale, or indemnification of loss, of a 
vessel or share thereof, the amounts of the unrecognized gain;
    (4) The date, amount, and purpose of each expenditure or withdrawal 
from the fund; and
    (5) The date and amount of each contract, under which deposited 
funds are deemed to be obligated during the taxable year, for the 
construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of new 
vessels, or for the liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness on such 
vessels, and the identification of such vessels.
    (b) Records required. Taxpayers shall keep such records and make 
such additional reports as the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or the 
Administration may require.

    Note: The records referred to in this section shall be retained for 
a period of six months beyond the termination or closing out of the 
reserve fund.


<R05>
Sec. 287.27  Controlled corporation.

    For the purpose of section 511 of the Act and the regulations in

        Subpart C_Maritime Security Program Operating Agreements


<R05>
Sec. 295.20  General conditions.

    (a) Approval. MARAD may approve applications to enter into a MSP 
Operating Agreement and make MSP Payments with respect to vessels that 
are determined to be necessary to maintain a United States presence in 
international commercial shipping or those that are deemed, after 
consultation with the Secretary of Defense, to be militarily useful for 
meeting the sealift needs of the United States in national emergencies.
    (b) Effective date--(1) General Rule. Unless otherwise provided in 
the contract, the effective date of a MSP Operating Agreement is the 
date when executed by the Contractor and MARAD.
    (2) Exceptions. In the case of an Eligible Vessel to be included in 
a MSP Operating Agreement that is subject to an ODS contract under 
subtitle A, title VI, of the act or on charter to the U.S. Government, 
other than a charter under the provisions of an Emergency Preparedness 
Program Agreement provided by section 653 of the act, unless an earlier 
date is requested by the applicant, the effective date for a MSP 
Operating Agreement shall be:
    (i) The expiration or termination date of the ODS contract or 
Government charter covering the vessel, respectively, or
    (ii) Any earlier date on which the vessel is withdrawn from that 
contract or charter.

Eligible Vessel in a MSP Operating Agreement provided the replacement 
vessel is eligible under Sec. 295.10.
    (d) Notice to shipbuilders. The Contractor agrees that no later than 
30 days after soliciting any offer or bid for the construction of any 
vessel in a foreign shipyard, and before entering into any contract for 
construction of a vessel in a foreign shipyard, the Contractor shall 
provide notice of its intent to enter into such a contract (for vessels 
being considered for U.S.-flag registry) to MARAD. Within 10 business 
days after the receipt of such notification, MARAD shall issue a notice 
in the Federal Register of the Contractor's intent. The Contractor is 
prohibited from entering into any such contract until 10 business days 
after the date of publication of such notice.
    (e) Early termination. A MSP Operating Agreement shall terminate on 
a date specified by the Contractor if the Contractor notifies MARAD not 
later than 60 days before the effective date of the proposed 
termination, that the Contractor intends to terminate the Agreement. The 
Contractor shall be bound by the provisions relating to vessel 
documentation and national security commitments to the extent and for 
the period contained in section 652(m) of the Act.
    (f) Non-renewal for lack of funds. If, by the first day of a fiscal 
year, insufficient funds have been appropriated under section 655 of the 
act for that fiscal year, MARAD shall notify the Congress that MSP 
Operating Agreements for which insufficient funds are available will be 
terminated on the 60th day of that fiscal year if sufficient funds are 
not appropriated or otherwise made available by that date. If only 
partial funding is appropriated by the 60th day of such fiscal year, 
then MSP Operating Agreements for which funds are not available shall be 
terminated using the pro rata distribution method used to award MSP 
Operating Agreements set forth in Sec. 295.12(d). With respect to each 
terminated agreement the Contractor shall be released from any further 
obligation under the agreement, and the Contractor may transfer and 
register the applicable vessel under a foreign registry deemed 
acceptable by MARAD. In the event that no funds are appropriated, then 
all MSP Operating Agreements shall be terminated and each Contractor 
shall be released from its obligations under the agreement. Final 
payments under the terminated agreements shall be made in accordance 
with Sec. 295.30. To the extent that funds are appropriated in a 
subsequent

[[Page 152]]

fiscal year, existing operating agreements may be renewed if mutually 
acceptable to the Administrator and the Contractor and the MSP vessel 
remains eligible.
    (g) Operation under a Continuing Resolution. In the event a 
Continuing Resolution (CR) is in place that does not provide sufficient 
appropriations to fully meet obligations under MSP Operating Agreements, 
a Contractor may request termination of the agreement in accordance with 
paragraph (f), herein, and Sec. 295.30.
    (h) Requisition authority. To the extent section 902 of the act is 
applicable to any vessel transferred foreign under this section, the 
vessel shall remain available to be requisitioned by the Maritime 
Administration under that provision of law.
    (i) Transfer of Operating Agreements. A Contractor subject to an 
Agreement may transfer that Agreement (including all rights and 
obligations thereunder) to any person eligible to enter into an 
Agreement under the same priority established in section 652(i)(1)(A) of 
the act as the Contractor, provided that:
    (1) The Contractor gives notice of any such transfer to the Maritime 
Administrator by filing a completed application;
    (2) The transfer is not disapproved in writing by the Maritime 
Administrator within 90 days of the notification; and
    (3) the vessel to be covered by the Agreement after transfer is the

    (5) Has its ultimate foreign parent proffer, at the time of 
application for an MSP Operating Agreement, an agreement in a format 
substantially similar to the format of Sec. 296.3(b)(14) not to 
influence the vessel's operation in a way that is detrimental to the 
United States.
    (d) The vessel is owned by a documentation citizen and demise 
chartered to a Section 2 Citizen.
    (e) Where applicable, the Secretary and the SecDef shall notify the 
Senate Committees on Armed Services, and Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation and the House of Representatives Committee on Armed 
Services that they concur with the certifications by the documentation 
citizens under Sec. 296.3(b)(13) and that they have reviewed the 
agreements proffered by the ultimate foreign parent under Sec. 
296.3(b)(14), and agree that there are no other legal, operational, or 
other impediments that would prohibit the contractors for the vessels 
from performing their obligations under MSP Operating Agreements.

vessel documented under 46 U.S.C. chapter 121 at the time the vessel is 
to be included in the MSP fleet; and
    (A) The vessel is eligible for a certificate of inspection if the

Sec. 296.12  Applicants.

    Applicant. Owners or operators of an eligible vessel may apply to 
MARAD for inclusion of that vessel in the MSP Fleet pursuant to the 
provisions of the MSA 2003. Applications shall be addressed to the 
Secretary, Maritime Administration, Room 7218, Maritime Administration, 
U.S. Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, 
DC 20590.


<R04>
              Subpart C_Priority for Granting Applications


<R05>
Sec. 296.20  Tank vessels.

    (a) First priority for the award of MSP Operating Agreements under 
MSA 2003 shall be granted to a tank vessel that is constructed in the 
United States after October 1, 2004.
    (b) First priority for the award of MSP Operating Agreements under 
the MSA 2003 may be granted to a tank vessel that is less than ten years 
of age on the date it enters an MSP Operating Agreement:
    (1) Provided: (i) That the Contractor agrees to execute a binding 
agreement approved by the Secretary for a replacement vessel to be 
operated under the MSP Operating Agreement and to be built in the United 
States not later than nine months after the first date appropriated 
funds are available for construction and operating assistance for a 
minimum of three tank vessels;
    (ii) A tank vessel under this section is eligible to be included in 
the MSP under Sec. 296.11(a); and
    (iii) A tank vessel under this section is owned and operated during 
the period of the MSP Operating Agreement by one or more persons that 
are Section 2 Citizens;
    (2) No payment can be made for an existing tank vessel granted 
priority one status after the earlier of:
    (i) Four years following the date this MSP Operating Agreement is 
effective, except if amounts are available for construction of a minimum 
of three tank vessels under the National Defense Tank Vessel 
Construction Assistance Program (NDTVCP) by October 1, 2007, then no 
payments shall be made for the existing ``tank vessel'' after four years 
following the date such amounts are available; or
    (ii) The date of delivery of the replacement tank vessel constructed 
in the United States after October 1, 2004.
    (3) The Secretary will not enter into more than five MSP Operating 
Agreements for tank vessels under this priority. If the five tank vessel 
MSP Operating Agreement slots are not fully subscribed, the Secretary, 
in consultation with the SecDef, may award the non-subscribed slots to 
lower priority vessels, if deemed appropriate. If the Secretary 
determines that no funds are, or are likely to be, allocated for any 
tank vessel construction in the United States, the five slots may 
nevertheless be awarded to existing tank vessels or the slots may be 
awarded permanently to any eligible vessels.

[[Page 162]]

The Secretary may temporarily award a slot reserved for a tank vessel 
under construction to a lower priority vessel during the construction 
period of that vessel if an existing tank vessel offered by the tank 
vessel Contractor is not eligible for priority for that slot. If no 
existing tank vessel is offered by the tank vessel Contractor, the 
Secretary may temporarily award an MSP Operating Agreement to any 
eligible vessel of another Contractor until a new tank vessel's 
construction is completed in the United States. Such temporary MSP 
Operating Agreements may be terminated under terms set forth in the 
temporary MSP Operating Agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 296.21  Participating Fleet Vessels.

    (a) Priority. To the extent that appropriated funds are available 
after applying the first priority, tank vessels, in Sec. 296.20, the 
second priority is applicable to Participating Fleet Vessels.
    (b) Number of MSP Operating Agreements. MARAD will not enter into 
more than 47 MSP Operating Agreements for Participating Fleet Vessels.
    (c) Reduction of Participating Fleet Vessel MSP Operating 
Agreements. The number of MSP Operating Agreements available to 
Participating Fleet Vessels shall be reduced by one for:
    (1) Each Participating Fleet Vessel for which an application for 
enrollment in the MSP is not received by the Secretary, Maritime 
Administration on October 15, 2004; or
    (2) Each Participating Fleet Vessel for which an application for 
enrollment in the MSP is received by the Secretary, Maritime 
Administration on October 15, 2004, but the application is not approved 
by the Secretary of Transportation and the SecDef by January 12, 2005.
    (d) Authority to Enter into an MSP Operating Agreement. (1) 
Applications for inclusion of a Participating Fleet Vessel under the 
priority in paragraph (a) of this section will be accepted only from a 
person that has authority to enter into an MSP Operating Agreement for 
the vessel with respect to the full term of the MSP Operating Agreement. 
Applicants must certify that they have the requisite authority as of 
October 1, 2005 and for the full period of the MSP Operating Agreement 
thereafter and provide the basis on which they rely for such 
certification, such as a copy of a vessel title of ownership or a demise 
charter that remains in effect until September 30, 2015.
    (2) The full term of the MSP Operating Agreement is the period from 
October 1, 2005 through September 30, 2015. If a vessel proposed to be 
included in the MSP will become ineligible for the program prior to 
September 30, 2015, due to vessel age restrictions, then the full term 
of the MSP Operating Agreement for that vessel for purposes of paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section is the period the vessel meets the applicable age 
restrictions. MARAD may still award an MSP Operating Agreement through 
September 30, 2015, to an applicant having authority to enter into an 
MSP Operating Agreement for a vessel whose age eligibility expires 
before that date. For companies requesting an age waiver, the Applicant 
must submit an appropriate replacement vessel at least 120 days prior to 
the date of expiration of age eligibility.
    (3) For the purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, in the 
case of a vessel that is subject to a demise charter that terminates by 
its terms on September 30, 2005 (without giving effect to any extension 
provided therein for completion of a voyage or to effect the actual 
redelivery of the vessel), or that is terminable at will by the owner of 
the vessel after such date, only the owner of the vessel (provided the 
owner of the vessel is a ``person'' as defined in Sec. 296.2) shall be 
treated as having the authority referred to in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section.
    (4) If two or more applicants claim authority for the same vessel, 
the Secretary may request additional information bearing on the issue of 
which party has authority to enter into an MSP Operating Agreement, and 
the Secretary shall, in his/her sole discretion, decide the matter as 
he/she deems appropriate.
    (e) During the 30-month period commencing October 1, 2005, the age 
restrictions set forth under Sec. 296.11(a) and Sec. 296.41(c) do not 
apply to a Participating Fleet Vessel operating under an MSP Operating 
Agreement, provided:

[[Page 163]]

    (1) The Contractor has entered into an arrangement to obtain and 
operate under that MSP Operating Agreement a replacement vessel for that 
Participating Fleet Vessel; and
    (2) The Secretary determines that the replacement vessel will be 
eligible to be included in the MSP Fleet under Sec. 296.11(a).
    (f) In the event that a Participating Fleet Vessel will be 
unavailable to participate in the MSP on October 1, 2005, due to an 
unforeseen casualty to the vessel, a Contractor may offer an eligible 
replacement vessel. The replacement vessel must subsequently be approved 
by MARAD and DOD. The replacement vessel must operate under an MSP 
Operating Agreement in sufficient time to meet the 180 minimum operation 
days required during the fiscal year to avoid being in default of the 
MSP Operating Agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 296.22  Other vessels.

    (a) Third Priority. To the extent that appropriated funds are 
available after applying the first priority, tank vessels, in Sec. 
296.20, and the second priority, Participating Fleet Vessels, in Sec. 
296.21, the third priority is for any other vessel that is eligible to 
be included in an MSP Operating Agreement under Sec. 296.11(a), and 
that, during the period of that MSP Operating Agreement, will be:
    (1) Owned and operated by one or more persons that are Section 2 
Citizens; or
    (2) Owned by a person that is eligible to document the vessel under 
46 U.S.C. chapter 121 and operated by a person that is a Section 2 
Citizen.
    (b) Fourth Priority. To the extent that appropriations are available 
after applying the first priority in Sec. 296.20, the second priority 
in Sec. 296.21, and the third priority in paragraph (a) of this 
section, the fourth priority is for any other vessel that is eligible to 
be included in an MSP Operating Agreement under Sec. 296.11(a).


<R05>
Sec. 296.23  Discretion within priority.

    The Secretary--
    (a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, may award MSP 
Operating Agreements within each priority as the Secretary considers 
appropriate; and
    (b) Shall award MSP Operating Agreements within a priority--
    (1) In accordance with operational requirements specified by the 
SecDef;
    (2) In the cases of the Priorities III and IV, according to the 
applicants' records of owning and operating vessels; and
    (3) Subject to the approval of the SecDef.
    (c) The Secretary does not have discretion to override the priority 
requirements with respect to the initial award of MSP Operating 
Agreements.


<R05>
Sec. 296.24  Subsequent awards of MSP Operating Agreements.

    (a) Until October 1, 2005, if, for any reason, after the award of an 
MSP Operating Agreement, the Applicant is unwilling or unable to 
commence operations pursuant to the terms of the MSP Operating 
Agreement, MARAD may, pursuant to the priority criteria, award that MSP 
Operating Agreement to an Applicant having an eligible vessel that 
applied but was not awarded an MSP Operating Agreement.
    (b) After October 1, 2005, MARAD intends to ensure that all 
available MSP Operating Agreements are fully utilized at all times, in 
order to maximize the benefit of the MSP. Accordingly, when an MSP 
Operating Agreement becomes available through termination by the 
Secretary, expiration of a temporary MSP Operating Agreement or early 
termination by the MSP contractor, and no transfer under 46 U.S.C. 
53105(e) is involved, MARAD will reissue the MSP Operating Agreement 
pursuant to the following criteria.
    (1) The proposed vessel must meet the requirements for vessel 
eligibility in 46 U.S.C. 53102(b);
    (2) The applicant must meet the vessel ownership and operating 
requirements for priority in 46 U.S.C. 53103(c); and
    (3) Priority will be assigned in accordance with operational 
requirements specified by the SecDef.
    (c) MARAD will use the following procedures in reissuing an MSP 
Operating Agreement. MARAD and USTRANSCOM will determine if the 
applications received on October 15, 2004 form an adequate pool for 
award of a reissued MSP Operating Agreement.

[[Page 164]]

If so, MARAD will award a reissued MSP Operating Agreement from that 
pool of qualified applicants in its discretion, subject to approval of 
the SecDef. MARAD and USTRANSCOM may decide to open a new round of 
applications. Applicants for reissued MSP Operating Agreements must meet 
the citizenship requirements of Priority III. Inasmuch as MSP furthers a 
public purpose and MARAD does not acquire goods or services through MSP, 
the selection process for award of MSP Operating Agreements does not 
constitute an acquisition process subject to any procurement law or the 
Federal Acquisition Regulations.


<R04>
        Subpart D_Maritime Security Program Operating Agreements


<R05>
Sec. 296.30  General conditions.

    (a) Approval. (1) The Secretary, in conjunction with the SecDef, may 
approve applications to enter into an MSP Operating Agreement and make 
MSP Payments with respect to vessels that are determined by the 
Secretary to be commercially viable and those that are deemed by the 
SecDef to be militarily useful for meeting the sealift needs of the 
United States in time of war or national emergencies. The Secretary 
announced an initial award of 60 MSP Operating Agreements on January 12, 
2005. In addition, the Secretary advised those applicants found to be 
eligible but not included in the initial award that those applicants 
will be wait-listed for an award of an MSP Operating Agreement if 
additional slots become available.
    (2) The Commander established general evaluation criteria for 
operational requirements for considering replacement vessels described 
in Sec. 296.21(e), and for vessels eligible under the third and fourth 
priorities described in Sec. 296.22. These general evaluation criteria 
were made available by the Commander in sufficient time for preparing 
applications.
    (b) Effective date--(1) General Rule. Unless otherwise provided, the 
effective date of an MSP Operating Agreement is October 1, 2005.
    (2) Exceptions. In the case of an Eligible Vessel to be included in 
an MSP Operating Agreement that is on charter to the U.S. Government, 
other than a charter under the provisions of an Emergency Preparedness 
Agreement (EPA) provided by Sec. 53107 of the MSA 2003, unless an 
earlier date is requested by the applicant, the effective date for an 
MSP Operating Agreement shall be:
    (i) The expiration or termination date of the Government charter 
covering the vessel; or
    (ii) Any earlier date on which the vessel is withdrawn from that 
charter, but not before October 1, 2005.
    (c) Replacement Vessels. A Contractor may replace an MSP vessel 
under an MSP Operating Agreement with another vessel that is eligible to 
be included in the MSP under Sec. 296.11(a), if the Secretary, in 
conjunction with the SecDef, approves the replacement vessel. The 
replacement vessel must qualify with the same or with more militarily 
useful capability as the MSP vessel to be replaced for operational 
requirements as determined by the Commander.
    (d) Termination by the Secretary. If the Contractor materially fails 
to comply with the terms of the MSP Operating Agreement:
    (1) The Secretary shall notify the Contractor and provide a 
reasonable opportunity for the Contractor to comply with the MSP 
Operating Agreement;
    (2) The Secretary shall terminate the MSP Operating Agreement if the 
Contractor fails to achieve such compliance; and
    (3) Upon such termination, any funds obligated by the relevant MSP 
Operating Agreement shall be available to the Secretary to carry out the 
MSP.
    (e) Early termination by Contractor, generally. An MSP Operating 
Agreement shall terminate on a date specified by the Contractor if the 
Contractor notifies the Secretary not later than 60 days before the 
effective date of the proposed termination that the Contractor intends 
to terminate the MSP Operating Agreement. The Contractor shall be bound 
by the provisions relating to vessel documentation and national security 
commitments, and by its EPA for the full term, from October 1, 2005 
through September 30, 2015, of the MSP Operating Agreement.

[[Page 165]]

    (f) Early termination by Contractor, with available replacement. An 
MSP Operating Agreement shall terminate without further obligation on 
the part of the Contractor upon the expiration date of the three-year 
period beginning on the date a vessel begins operating under the MSP, 
if:
    (1) The Contractor notifies the Secretary, by not later than two 
years after the date the vessel begins operation under an MSP Operating 
Agreement, that the Contractor intends to terminate the MSP Operating 
Agreement; and
    (2) The Secretary, in conjunction with the SecDef, determines that:
    (i) An application for an MSP Operating Agreement has been received 
for a replacement vessel that is acceptable to the Secretaries; and
    (ii) During the period of an MSP Operating Agreement that applies to 
the replacement vessel, the replacement vessel will be:
    (A) Owned and operated by one or more persons that are Section 2 
Citizens; or
    (B) Owned by a person that is a Documentation Citizen and operated 
by a person that is a Section 2 Citizen.
    (g) Non-renewal for lack of funds. If, by the first day of a fiscal 
year, sufficient funds have not been appropriated under the authority of 
MSA 2003 for that fiscal year, the Secretary will notify the Senate's 
Committees on Armed Services and Commerce, Science, and Transportation, 
and the House of Representatives' Committee on Armed Services, that MSP 
Operating Agreements for which sufficient funds are not available, will 
not be renewed for that fiscal year if sufficient funds are not 
appropriated by the 60th day of that fiscal year. If only partial 
funding is appropriated by the 60th day of such fiscal year, then the 
Secretary, in consultation with the SecDef, shall select the vessels to 
retain under MSP Operating Agreements, based on the Secretaries' 
determinations of the most militarily useful and commercially viable 
vessels. In the event that no funds are appropriated, then all MSP 
Operating Agreements shall be terminated and, each Contractor shall be 
released from its obligations under the MSP Operating Agreement. Final 
payments under the terminated MSP Operating Agreements shall be made in 
accordance with Sec. 296.41. To the extent that funds are appropriated 
in a subsequent fiscal year, former MSP Operating Agreements may be 
reinstated if mutually acceptable to the Administrator and the 
Contractor provided the MSP vessel remains eligible.
    (h) Release of Vessels from Obligations: If an MSP Operating 
Agreement is terminated by the Contractor, with available replacement 
under paragraph (f) of this section, or if sufficient funds are not 
appropriated for payments under an MSP Operating Agreement for any 
fiscal year by the 60th day of that fiscal year, then--
    (1) Each vessel covered by the terminated MSP Operating Agreement is 
released from any further obligation under the MSP Operating Agreement;
    (2) The owner and operator of a non-tank vessel or a tank vessel not 
built under the NDTVCP may transfer and register the applicable vessel 
under a foreign registry deemed acceptable by the Secretary and the 
SecDef, notwithstanding section 9 of the Shipping Act, 1916 (46 App. 
U.S.C. 808) and 46 CFR part 221;
    (3) The owner and operator of a tank vessel built under the NDTVCP 
must formally apply to MARAD pursuant to section 9 of the Shipping Act, 
1916 to transfer and register the vessel under a foreign registry; and
    (4) If section 902 of the Act is applicable to a vessel that has 
been transferred to a foreign registry due to a terminated MSP Operating 
Agreement, then that vessel is available to be requisitioned by the 
Secretary pursuant to section 902 of the Act.
    (5) Paragraph (h) of this section is not applicable to vessels under 
MSP Operating Agreements that have been terminated for any other reason.
    (i) Foreign Transfer of Vessel. A Contractor may transfer a non-tank 
vessel to a foreign registry, without approval of the Secretary, if the 
Secretary, in conjunction with the SecDef, determines that the 
contractor will provide a replacement vessel:

[[Page 166]]

    (1) Of equal or greater military capability or of a capacity that is 
equivalent or greater as measured in deadweight tons, gross tons, or 
container equivalent units, as appropriate;
    (2) That is a documented vessel under 46 U.S.C. chapter 121 by the 
owner of the vessel to be placed under a foreign registry; and
    (3) That is not more than 10 years of age on the date of that 
documentation.
    (j) Transfer of MSP Operating Agreements. A Contractor subject to an 
MSP Operating Agreement may transfer that MSP Operating Agreement 
(including all rights and obligations under that MSP Operating 
Agreement) to any person eligible to enter into an MSP Operating 
Agreement under Sec. 296.10 and of the same or more restrictive U.S. 
citizen priority, provided that prior approval to transfer the MSP 
Operating Agreement is granted by the Secretary and the SecDef. The 
Contractor should allow at least 90 days for processing of a transfer 
request.


<R05>
Sec. 296.31  MSP assistance conditions.

    (a) Term of MSP Operating Agreement. MSP Operating Agreements are 
authorized for 10 years, starting on October 1, 2005, and ending on 
September 30, 2015, but payments to Contractors are subject to annual 
appropriations each fiscal year. MARAD may enter into MSP Operating 
Agreements for a period less than the full term authorized under the MSA 
2003.
    (b) Terms under a Continuing Resolution (CR). In the event funds are 
available under a CR, the terms and conditions of the MSP Operating 
Agreements shall be in force provided sufficient funds are available to 
fully meet obligations under MSP Operating Agreements, and only for the 
period stipulated in the applicable CR. If funds are not appropriated 
under a CR at sufficient levels for any portion of a fiscal year, the 
Secretary will select the vessels to retain within the funding level of 
the previous fiscal year, in consultation with the SecDef, based on the 
Secretaries' determination of the most militarily useful and 
commercially viable vessels. With regard to an MSP Operating Agreement 
that does not receive funds, the terms and conditions of any applicable 
MSP Operating Agreement may be voided and the Contractor may request 
termination of the MSP Operating Agreement.
    (c) National security requirements. Each MSP Operating Agreement 
shall require the owner or operator of an Eligible Vessel included in 
that MSP Operating Agreement to enter into an EPA pursuant to section 
53107 of the MSA 2003. The EPA shall be a document incorporating the 
terms of the Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement (VISA), as approved 
by the Secretary and the SecDef, or other agreement approved by the 
Secretaries.
    (d) Vessel operating agreements. The MSP Operating Agreement shall 
require that during the period an Eligible Vessel is included in that 
MSP Operating Agreement, the Eligible Vessel shall:
    (1) Documentation: Be documented as a U.S.-flag vessel under 46 
U.S.C. chapter 121;
    (2) Operation: Be operated exclusively in the foreign commerce, 
except for tankers, which may be operated in foreign-to-foreign 
commerce, and shall not otherwise be operated in the coastwise trade of 
the United States; and
    (3) Noncontiguous Domestic Trade: Not receive MSP payments during a 
period in which the Contractor participates, i.e., directly or 
indirectly owns, charters, or operates, a vessel engaged in 
noncontiguous domestic trade unless the Contractor is a Section 2 
Citizen.
    (e) Obligation of the U.S. Government. The amounts payable as MSP 
payments under an MSP Operating Agreement shall constitute a contractual 
obligation of the United States Government to the extent of available 
appropriations.
    (f) U.S. Merchant Marine Academy cadets. The MSP Operator shall 
agree to carry on the MSP vessel two U.S. Merchant Marine Academy 
cadets, if available, on each voyage.

Sec. 296.41  Payment procedures.

    (a) Amount payable. An MSP Operating Agreement shall provide, 
subject to the availability of appropriations and to the extent the MSP 
Operating Agreement is in effect, for each Agreement Vessel, an annual 
payment equal to $2,600,000 for FY 2006, FY 2007, FY 2008; $2,900,000 
for FY 2009, FY 2010, FY 2011; and $3,100,000 for FY 2012, FY 2013, FY 
2014, FY 2015. This amount shall be paid in equal monthly installments 
at the end of each month. The annual amount payable shall not be reduced 
except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) Reductions in amount payable. (1) The annual amount otherwise 
payable under an MSP Operating Agreement shall be reduced on a pro rata 
basis for each day less than 320 in a fiscal year that an Agreement 
Vessel:
    (i) Is not operated exclusively in the foreign commerce, except for 
tank vessels, which may be operated in foreign-to-foreign commerce;
    (ii) Is operated in the coastwise trade; or
    (iii) Is not documented under 46 U.S.C. chapter 121.
    (2) To the extent that a Contractor operates MSP vessels less than 
320 days under the provisions of Sec. 296.31(d), payments will be 
reduced for each day less than 320 days.
    (c) No payment. (1) Regardless of whether the Contractor has or will 
operate for 320 days in a fiscal year, a Contractor shall not be paid:
    (i) For any day that an Agreement Vessel is engaged in transporting 
more than 7,500 tons (using the U.S. English standard of short tons, 
which converts to 6,696.75 long tons, or 6,803.85 metric tons) of 
civilian bulk preference cargoes pursuant to section 901(a), 901(b), or 
901b of the Act, provided that it is bulk cargo;
    (ii) During a period in which the Contractor participates in 
noncontiguous domestic trade, unless that Contractor is a Section 2 
Citizen;
    (iii) While under charter to the United States Government other than 
a charter pursuant to an EPA under Sec. 53107 of the MSA 2003. A voyage 
charter that is essentially a contract of affreightment will not be 
considered to be a charter;
    (iv) For a vessel in excess of 25 years of age, except for a LASH 
vessel in excess of 30 years of age or a tank vessel which is limited to 
20 years of age, unless the vessel is a Participating Fleet Vessel 
meeting the requirements of Sec. 296.21(e);
    (v) For days in excess of 30 days in a fiscal year in which a vessel 
is drydocked or undergoing survey, inspection, or repair unless prior to 
the expiration of the vessel's 30-day period, approval is obtained from 
MARAD for an extension beyond 30 days.

[[Page 168]]

Drydocking, survey, inspection, or repair periods of 30 days or less are 
considered operating days; and
    (vi) If the contracted vessel is not operated or maintained in 
accordance with the terms of the MSP Operating Agreement.
    (2) To the extent that non-payment days under paragraph (c) of this 
section are known, Contractor payments shall be reduced at the time of 
the current billing. The daily reduction amounts shall be based on the 
annual amounts in paragraph (a) of this section divided by 365 days (366 
days in leap years) and rounded to the nearest cent. Daily reduction 
amounts shall be applied.
    (3) MARAD may require, for good cause, that a portion of the funds 
payable under this section be withheld if the provisions of Sec. 
296.31(d) have not been met.
    (4) Amounts owed to MARAD for reductions applicable to a prior 
billing period shall be electronically transferred using MARAD's 
prescribed format, or a check may be forwarded to the Maritime 
Administration, P.O. Box 845133, Dallas, Texas 75284-5133, or the amount 
owed can be credited to MARAD by offsetting amounts payable in future 
billing periods.

shall be final.


<R04>
      Subpart G_Maintenance and Repair Reimbursement Pilot Program


<R05>
Sec. 296.60  Applications.

    (a) Introduction. This section sets forth MARAD's regulations 
governing its Maintenance and Repair (M&R) Reimbursement Pilot Program. 
The M&R program is presently a 5-year program, authorized at $19.5 
million per year for FY 2006-2011.
    (b) M&R participants. Every existing Contractor in MSP may enter 
into an agreement under 46 U.S.C. 3517, to perform qualified M&R of one 
or more

[[Page 169]]

MSP vessels in United States shipyards, subject to the terms of this 
section. Every MSP Contractor entering into an MSP operating agreement, 
including those agreements transferred from an existing MSP Contractor, 
or newly issued or reissued from MARAD, after March 8, 2007, must agree 
to enter into an agreement under 46 U.S.C. 3517, to perform qualified 
M&R of one or more MSP vessels in United States shipyards, subject to 
the terms of this section. Each vessel that is subject to an M&R 
agreement will receive a priority in the allocation of MSP payments if 
the amount available for a fiscal year for making payments under MSP 
operating agreements is not sufficient to pay the full amount authorized 
under each agreement for such fiscal year.
    (c) Terms of Agreement. An agreement under this section:
    (1) Will require that except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, all qualified M&R on the vessel will be performed in the United 
States;
    (2) Will require the Administrator to reimburse the Contractor in 
accordance with paragraph (j) of this section for the costs of qualified 
M&R performed in the United States; and
    (3) Will apply to qualified M&R performed during the 5-year period 
beginning on the date the vessel begins operating under the operating 
agreement under chapter 531 of title 46, United States Code.
    (d) Exception to Requirement to Perform Work in the United States. A 
Contractor will not be required to have qualified M&R work performed in 
the United States under this section if:
    (1) The Administrator determines that there is no facility capable 
of meeting all technical requirements of the qualified M&R in the United 
States located in the geographic area in which the vessel normally 
operates available to perform the work in the time required by the 
Contractor to maintain its regularly scheduled service;
    (2) The Administrator determines that there are insufficient funds 
to pay reimbursement under paragraph (j) of this section with respect to 
the work; or
    (3) The Administrator fails to make the certification described in 
paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
    (e) Qualified M&R. In this section the term ``qualified M&R'' means:
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section:
    (i) Any inspection of a vessel that is--
    (A) Required under chapter 33 of title 46, United States Code; and
    (B) Performed in the period in which the vessel is subject to an 
agreement under this section;
    (ii) Any M&R of a vessel that is determined, in the course of an 
inspection referred to in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, to be 
necessary; and
    (iii) Any additional M&R the Contractor intends to undertake at the 
same time as the work described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section; 
but (2) does not include:
    (i) M&R not agreed to by the Contractor to be undertaken at the same 
time as the work described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section;
    (ii) Work carried out as part of continuous machinery surveys and 
other similar requirements not associated with a drydocking of the 
vessel; or
    (iii) Any emergency work that is necessary to enable a vessel to 
return to a port in the United States.
    (f) Qualification of Shipyard. MARAD will assess the following 
factors in determining whether a proposed shipyard is capable of 
undertaking the proposed M&R:
    (1) The dimension of the facility relative to the size of the 
vessel;
    (2) The capacity and the reach of the lifting cranes necessary for 
performing the specified work; and
    (3) The skills and experience of sufficient numbers of workers to 
complete the job in time to maintain the vessel's schedule.
    (g) Required information. Under each M&R agreement, the participant 
must provide within 30 days of enrollment a schedule for regular and 
special surveys for each vessel in the agreement. At the same time, and 
on an annual basis by January 1 of each calendar year, each M&R 
participant must submit a schedule of anticipated M&R for each vessel 
under an M&R agreement for the coming year. In addition, the

[[Page 170]]

M&R participant must provide for each such vessel the anticipated 
itinerary for the coming year.
    (h) Notification Requirements. (1) NOTIFICATION BY CONTRACTOR.--The 
Administrator is not required to pay reimbursement to a Contractor under 
this section for qualified M&R, unless the Contractor--
    (i) Notifies the Administrator of the intent of the Contractor to 
obtain the qualified M&R, by not later than 90 days before the date of 
the performance of the qualified M&R; and
    (ii) Includes in such notification:
    (A) A description of all qualified M&R that the Contractor should 
reasonably expect may be performed;
    (B) A description of the vessel's normal route and port calls in the 
United States;
    (C) An estimate of the cost, with supporting documentation, of 
obtaining the qualified M&R described under paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(A) of 
this section in the United States; and
    (D) An estimate of the cost, with supporting documentation, of 
obtaining the qualified M&R described under paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(A) of 
this section outside the United States, in the country in which the 
Contractor otherwise would undertake the qualified M&R.
    (2) CERTIFICATION BY ADMINISTRATOR.--
    (i) Not later than 30 days after the date of receipt of notification 
under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the Administrator will certify 
to the Contractor--
    (A) Whether the cost estimates provided by the Contractor are fair 
and reasonable;
    (B) If the Administrator determines that such cost estimates are not 
fair and reasonable, the Administrator's estimate of fair and reasonable 
costs for such work;
    (C) Whether there are available to the Administrator sufficient 
funds to pay reimbursement under paragraph (j) of this section with 
respect to such work; and
    (D) That the Administrator commits such funds to the Contractor for 
such reimbursement, if such funds are available for that purpose.
    (ii) If the Contractor notification described in paragraph (h)(1) of 
this section does not include an estimate of the cost of obtaining 
qualified M&R in the United States, then not later than 30 days after 
the date of receipt of such notification, the Administrator will:
    (A) Certify to the Contractor whether there is a facility capable of 
meeting all technical requirements of the qualified M&R in the United 
States located in the geographic area in which the vessel normally 
operates available to perform the qualified M&R described in the 
notification by the Contractor under paragraph (h)(1) of this section in 
the time period required by the Contractor to maintain its regularly 
scheduled service; and
    (B) If there is such a facility, require the Contractor to resubmit 
such notification with the required cost estimate for such facility.
    (i) Allocation of available funds. If the funds available to MARAD 
are insufficient to accommodate every M&R project required to be 
performed in U.S. shipyards, MARAD will select those work projects 
suitable for accomplishment in United States shipyards, for which MARAD 
will reimburse the differential costs of the M&R. MARAD will base such 
determinations on the amount of funds available, the projected cost of 
each repair, the number of vessels operated by the vessel operator and 
the proximity of the vessels' itineraries to suitable U.S. shipyard 
locations.
    (j) Reimbursement. (1) IN GENERAL.--The Administrator will, subject 
to the availability of appropriations, reimburse a Contractor for costs 
incurred by the Contractor for qualified M&R performed in the United 
States under this section.
    (2) AMOUNT.--The amount of reimbursement will be equal to the 
difference between--
    (i) The fair and reasonable cost of obtaining the qualified M&R in 
the United States; and
    (ii) The fair and reasonable cost of obtaining the qualified M&R 
outside the United States, in the country in which the Contractor would 
otherwise undertake the qualified M&R.
    (3) DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COSTS.--
    (i) The Administrator will determine fair and reasonable costs for 
purposes

[[Page 171]]

of paragraph (j)(2) of this section after considering the supporting 
documentation submitted by the Contractor. If it is too difficult to 
accurately ascertain the foreign costs of anticipated M&R, the Maritime 
Administrator may decide to compute the foreign cost of M&R by reference 
to a percentage of the domestic cost of the M&R, based on available 
general information.
    (ii) MARAD will also pay for other costs borne by the M&R 
participant reasonably associated with the qualified M&R performed in a 
U.S. shipyard that would not be incurred if the vessel was repaired in a 
foreign shipyard. Such costs include:
    (A) Any additional vessel maintenance and repair preparation costs, 
including costs for additional engineering, design and contract bid 
proposal costs;
    (B) Costs (including capital and operating costs) for ``lost time'' 
for transit to a U.S. shipyard in excess of the transit period to a 
foreign shipyard on the same trade route to which the vessel is assigned 
and for the time spent in a U.S. shipyard which exceeds the estimated 
time required by a foreign shipyard for the same work.
    (C) Costs for additional labor, supervision, overhead and other work 
involving shore-side personnel.
    (iii) Upon approval of each specific M&R project, the Administrator 
will establish with the Contractor a set level of funding to be provided 
by MARAD. If, during the course of performing M&R in a U.S. shipyard, it 
is discovered that the repairs will entail additional unanticipated 
costs, the Administrator shall provide MARAD's share of funding 
corresponding to the percentage of the domestic M&R costs originally 
agreed to by MARAD, but not in excess of 20 percent of the original 
funding level agreed to by MARAD. Cost overruns will be the obligation 
of the M&R participant unless MARAD determines that it is fair to 
reimburse the M&R participant and sufficient funds are available to do 
so.
    (iv) Payment of MARAD's share of the shipyard contract price may be 
made as work progresses or upon completion of the M&R and finalization 
of costs, as MARAD may determine. Vouchers for payment may be submitted 
to the Associate Administer for Marine Asset Development. Payments shall 
be paid and processed under the terms and conditions of the Prompt 
Payment Act, 31 U.S.C. 3901. However, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3902(f), 
interest on late payments will be paid only if appropriated funds for 
paying reimbursement under the M&R Pilot Program are available.

    (j) Confidential Information. (1) If we receive a request for 
release of your information, we will notify you. If you believe that 
your application, including attachments, contains information you 
consider to be trade secrets or commercial or financial information and 
privileged or confidential, or otherwise exempt from disclosure under 
the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552), you may assert a 
claim of confidentiality. When submitting your application, you should 
mark ``Confidential'' on the pages that you

[[Page 177]]

consider confidential. The same requirement applies to any amendment to 
the application.
    (2) FOIA requests. We will apply the procedures contained in the

requests for information that the submitter has designated as 
confidential. We will consider your claim of confidentiality at the time 
someone requests the information under FOIA.
    (3) Statement of objections. If we receive a request for release of 
your information, we will notify you. We will give you a reasonable

objections to our release of the information. We will not give you 
notice if:
    (i) We determine that we should not disclose the information;
    (ii) The information has been lawfully published or made available 
to the public; or
    (iii) Law (other than 5 U.S.C. 552) requires us to disclose the

    (1) Vessels capable of serving as a United States naval and military 
auxiliary in time of war or national emergency,

than one year old as opposed to the refinancing of existing equipment or 
vessels that are one year old or older,
    (3) Any applications involving the purchase of vessels currently 
financed under Title XI if the purpose is to process the assumption of 
the obligations,
    (4) Applications from those willing to take guarantees for less than 
the normal term for that class of vessel.
    (5) Eligible Export Vessels. We may issue a commitment to guarantee 
Obligations for an Eligible Export Vessel if we determine, in our sole 
discretion, that the issuance of a commitment to guarantee Obligations 
for an Eligible Export Vessel will not cause us to deny an economically 
sound application to issue a commitment to guarantee Obligations for 
vessels documented under the laws of the United States operating in the 
domestic or foreign commerce of the United States, after considering:
    (i) The status of pending applications for commitments to guarantee 
obligations for vessels documented under the laws of the United States 
and operating or to be operated in the domestic or foreign commerce of 
the United States;
    (ii) The economic soundness of the applications referred to in

Sec. 298.11  Vessel requirements.

    When you apply for a Guarantee, the Vessel for which you intend to 
receive financing for construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning 
must meet the following criteria:
    (a) United States Construction. A Vessel, including an Eligible 
Export Vessel, financed by an Obligation Guarantee must be constructed 
in the United States. United States construction means that the Vessel 
is assembled in a shipyard geographically located within the United 
States.
    (1) A U.S.-flag Vessel must meet the applicable United States Coast 
Guard requirements.
    (2) An Eligible Export Vessel must be constructed in accordance with 
the requirements of the International Maritime Organization and must 
meet the applicable:
    (i) Laws, rules, and regulations of its country of documentation,
    (ii) Treaties, conventions on international agreements to which that 
country is a signatory, and
    (iii) Laws of the ports it serves.
    (b) Actual Cost. We must approve your estimated Actual Cost for the 
construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of a Vessel as a 
condition for issuance of the Letter Commitment. The estimated cost of 
the Vessel may include escalation for the anticipated construction 
period of the Vessel. We may contact the shipyard directly and may 
require you to have the shipyard that has contracted to build the Vessel 
to submit additional technical data, backup cost details, and other 
evidence if we have insufficient data.
    (c) Class, condition, and operation. The Vessel must be constructed, 
maintained, and operated so as to meet the highest classification, 
certification, rating, and inspection standards for vessels of the same 
age and type imposed by:
    (1) The American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), or
    (2) Another classification society that also meets the inspection 
standards of the United States Coast Guard with respect to the 
documentation of U.S.-flag vessels, or
    (3) In the case of an Eligible Export Vessel, such standards as may 
be imposed by a member of the International Association of 
Classification Societies (IACS), classification societies to be ISO 9000 
series registered or Quality Systems Certificate Scheme qualified IACS 
members who have been recognized by the United States Coast Guard as 
meeting acceptable standards with such recognition including, at a 
minimum, that the society meets the requirements of IMO Resolution 
A.739(18) with appropriate certificates required at delivery, so long as 
the home country of the IACS member accords equal reciprocity, as 
determined by us, to United States classification societies.
    (4) Except in the case of an Eligible Export Vessel, the Vessel must 
be in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations as to 
condition and operation, including, but not limited to, those 
administered by the:
    (i) United States Coast Guard,
    (ii) Environmental Protection Agency,
    (iii) Federal Communications Commission,
    (iv) Public Health Service, or
    (v) Their respective successor agencies, and
    (vi) All applicable treaties and conventions to which the United 
States is a signatory, including, but not limited to, the International 
Convention for Safety of Life at Sea.

[[Page 179]]

    (d) Documentation. (1) An Eligible Export Vessel must be documented 
in a country that is party to the International Convention for Safety of 
Life at Sea, or other treaty, convention, or international agreement 
governing vessel inspection to which the United States is a signatory, 
and must comply with the applicable laws, rules, and regulations of its 
country of documentation, all applicable treaties, conventions on 
international agreements to which that country is a signatory, and the 
laws of the ports it serves.
    (2) All other Eligible Vessels must be documented under U.S. 
registry.
    (e) Reconstruction or reconditioning. Repairs necessary for the 
Vessel to meet the classification standards approved by us, or any 
regulatory body, or for previous inadequate maintenance and repair, will 
not constitute reconstruction or reconditioning within the meaning of 
this paragraph.
    (f) Condition survey. If your application involves a reconstructed 
or reconditioned Vessel, you must make the Vessel available at a time 
and place acceptable to us so that we may conduct a condition survey. 
You must:
    (1) Pay the cost of the condition survey.
    (2) Ensure that the scope and extent of the condition survey will 
not be less effective than that required by the last ABS special survey 
completed (if the Vessel is classified), next due or overdue, whichever 
date is nearest in accordance with the Vessel's age.
    (3) Ensure that the Vessel meets the standard of the survey 
necessary for retention of class (if the Vessel is classified), and
    (4) Ensure that the operating records of the Vessel reflect normal 
operation of the Vessel's main propulsion and other machinery and 
equipment, consistent with accepted commercial experience and practice.
    (g) Metric Usage. Our preferred system of measurement and weights 
for Vessels and Shipyard Projects is the metric system.

the extent allowed by paragraph (h) of this section.
    (vi) Disclose all of the Vessel(s), Shipyard Project financing in 
the format given in the Title XI application procedures.
    (2) Financial Information. You must provide us with financial 
statements, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP), and include notes that explain the basis 
for arriving at the figures except that for Eligible Export Vessels, 
your financial statements must be in accordance with GAAP if formed in 
the U.S., or reconciled to GAAP if formed in a foreign country unless a 
satisfactory justification is provided explaining the inability to

Sec. Sec. 298.35 and 298.42 of this part:
    (1) ``Company'' means any Person subject to financial requirements 
imposed under paragraph (f) of this section and in Sec. 298.35, as well 
as the reporting requirements imposed by Sec. 298.42.
    (2) ``Working Capital'' means the excess, if any, of current assets 
over current liabilities, both determined in accordance with GAAP and 
adjusted as follows:
    (i) In determining current assets you must exclude:
    (A) Any securities, obligations or evidence of indebtedness of a 
Related Party or of any stockholder, director, officer or employee (or 
any member of his family) of the Company or of such Related Party, 
except advances to agents required for the normal current operation of 
the Company's vessels and current receivables arising out of the 
ordinary course of business and not outstanding for more than 60 days; 
and
    (B) An amount equal to any excess of unterminated voyage revenue 
over unterminated voyage expenses.
    (ii) In determining current liabilities, you must deduct any excess 
of unterminated voyage expenses over unterminated voyage revenue and add

[[Page 183]]

one half of all annual charter hire and other lease obligations (having 
a term of more than six months) due and payable within the succeeding 
fiscal year, other than charter hire and such other lease obligations 
already included and reported as a current liability on the Company's 
balance sheet.
    (3) ``Equity'' or ``net worth'' means, as of any date, (the total of 
paid-in-capital stock, paid-in surplus, earned surplus and appropriated 
surplus,) and all other amounts that would be included in net worth in 
accordance with GAAP, but does not include:
    (i) Any receivables from any stockholder, director, Officer or 
employee (or their family) of the Company or from any Related Party 
(other than current receivables arising out of the ordinary course of 
business and not outstanding for more than 60 days), and
    (ii) Any increment resulting from the reappraisal of assets.
    (4) ``Long-Term Debt'' means, as of any date, the total notes, 
bonds, debentures, equipment obligations and other evidence of 
indebtedness that would be included in long term debt in accordance with 
GAAP. You must include any guarantee or other liability for the debt of 
any other Person not otherwise included on the balance sheet.
    (5) ``Capitalizable Cost'' means the aggregate of the Actual Cost of 
the Vessel or Shipyard Project and those other items which customarily 
would be capitalized as Vessel costs or Shipyard Project costs under 
GAAP.
    (6) ``Depreciated Capitalizable Cost'' means the Capitalizable Cost 
of a Vessel or Shipyard Project, depreciated on a straightline basis 
over the same useful life as determined by us for Actual Cost, and 
depreciated as required by Sec. 298.21(g).
    (e) Applicability. The financial resources must be adequate to meet 
the Equity requirements in the project and Working Capital requirements, 
as set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (1) The various financial requirements shall be met by the owner of 
the Vessel or Vessels or Shipyard Project to be security to us for the 
Guarantees, except that if the owner is not the operator, the overall 
financial requirements will be allocated among the owner, the operator 
and other parties as determined by us.
    (2) The Company must satisfy the applicable financial requirements, 
in addition to any other financial requirements already imposed or which 
may be imposed upon it in connection with other Vessels financed under 
the Title XI program or in connection with other Shipyard Project 
financed under the Title XI program.
    (3) A determination as to whether the Company has satisfied all 
financial requirements shall be based on the assumption that the 
projected financing has been completed. Accordingly, you must submit:
    (i) A pro forma balance sheet at the time of the application, 
reflecting any adjustment made pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this 
section, and
    (ii) A revised pro forma balance sheet, reflecting the completion of 
the projected financing, at least five business days before the first 
Closing at which the Obligations are issued.
    (f) Financial requirements at Closing. Financial requirements can 
apply to one or more Companies, and are determined as follows:
    (1) Owner as operator. Where the owner is to be the Vessel operator, 
minimum requirements at Closing usually are as follows:
    (i) Working Capital. The Company's Working Capital shall not be less 
than one dollar. This Working Capital requirement is based on the 
premise that the Company engages in a service-type activity with only 
normal vessel inventory. If Working Capital includes other inventory, in 
addition to such normal Vessel inventory, we may adjust the requirement 
as appropriate. Also, if we determine that the Company's Working Capital 
includes amounts receivable that it reasonably could not expect to 
collect within one year, we may make adjustments to the Working Capital 
requirements.
    (ii) Long-Term Debt. The Company's Long-Term Debt must not be 
greater than twice its Equity.
    (iii) Equity (net worth). The Company's Equity must be:
    (A) The greater of:
    (1) 50 percent of its Long-Term Debt; or

[[Page 184]]

    (2) 90 percent of its Equity as shown on the last audited balance 
sheet, dated not earlier than six months before the date of issuance of 
the Letter Commitment; or
    (B) Such other amount as may be specified by us.
    (2) Lessee or charterer as operator. Where a lessee or charterer is 
to be the Vessel operator, minimum requirements at Closing usually are 
as follows:
    (i) Working Capital. The operator's Working Capital requirement will 
be the same as that which would have otherwise been imposed on the owner 
as operator under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section and based on the 
same premise stated in that paragraph.
    (ii) Long-Term Debt. The operator's Long-Term Debt will be the same 
as that which would have otherwise been imposed on the owner as operator 
under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (iii) Equity (net worth). The operator's equity requirement will be 
the same as that which would have otherwise been imposed on the owner as 
operator under paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (iv) The owner's Equity shall at least be equal to the difference 
between the Capitalizable Cost or Depreciated Capitalizable Cost of the 
Vessel (whichever is applicable) and the total amount of the Guarantees.
    (3) Owner as General Shipyard Facility. Where the owner of Shipyard 
Project is a General Shipyard Facility, minimum requirements at Closing 
will be the same as those set forth in paragraph (f)(1) of this section 
for an owner as operator.
    (g) Adjustments to financial requirements at Closing. If the owner, 
although not operating a Vessel, assumes any of the operating 
responsibilities, we may adjust the respective Working Capital and 
Equity requirements of the owner and operator, otherwise applicable 
under paragraph (f) of this section, by increasing the requirements of 
the owner and decreasing those of the operator by the same amount.
    (h) Subordinated debt considered to be Equity. With our consent, 
part of the Equity requirements applicable under paragraphs (c) and (f) 
of this section may be satisfied by debt, fully subordinated as to the 
payment of principal and interest on the Secretary's Note and any claims 
secured as provided for in the Security Agreement or the Mortgage. 
Repayment of subordinated debt may be made only from funds available for 
payment of dividends or for other distributions, in accordance with 
requirements of the Title XI Reserve Fund and Financial Agreement 
(described in Sec. 298.35). Such subordinated debt shall not be secured 
by any interest in property that is security for Guarantees under Title 
XI, unless the Obligor and the lender enter into a written agreement, 
satisfactory to us, providing, among other things, that if any Title XI 
financing or advance by us to the Obligor shall occur in the future, 
such security interest of the lender shall become subordinated to any 
indebtedness to us incurred by the Obligor and to any security interest 
obtained by us in that property or other property, with respect to the 
subsequent indebtedness.
    (i) Modified requirements. We may waive or modify the financial 
terms or requirements otherwise applicable under this section and 
Sec. Sec. 298.35 and 298.42, upon determining that there is adequate 
security for the Guarantees. We may impose similar financial 
requirements on any Person providing other security for the Guarantees.

Sec. 298.14  Economic soundness.

    (a) Economic Evaluation. We shall not issue a Letter Commitment for 
guarantees unless we find that the proposed project, regarding the 
Vessel(s) or Shipyard Project for which you seek Title XI financing or 
refinancing, will be economically sound. The economic soundness and your 
ability to repay the Obligations will be the primary basis for our 
approval of a Letter Commitment. We will consider the value of the 
collateral for which we will issue the Obligations as only a secondary 
consideration in determining your ability to repay the Obligations.
    (b) Basic feasibility factors. In making the economic soundness 
findings, we

[[Page 185]]

shall consider all relevant factors, including, but not limited to:
    (1) The need in the particular segment of the maritime industry for 
new or additional capacity, including any impact on existing equipment 
for which a guarantee under this title is in effect;
    (2) The market potential for the employment of the Vessel or 
utilization of the Shipyard Project of a General Shipyard Facility over 
the life of the guarantee;
    (3) Projected revenues and expenses associated with employment of 
the Vessel or utilization of the Shipyard Project of a General Shipyard 
Facility;
    (4) Any charters, contracts of affreightment, transportation 
agreements, or similar agreements or undertakings relevant to the 
employment of the Vessel or utilization of the Shipyard Project of a 
General Shipyard Facility;
    (5) For inland waterways, the need for technical improvements 
including but not limited to increased fuel efficiency, or improved 
safety; and
    (6) Other relevant criteria.
    (c) Project Feasibility. To demonstrate the economic feasibility of 
the project over the Guarantee period, you must submit the following 
information:
    (1) Purpose. A detailed purpose for the obligations to be

    (i) Nature and amount of cargo/passengers available for carriage and 
your projected share (provide also the number of units; that is 
containers, trailers, etc.);
    (ii) Services or routes in which the Vessel(s) will be employed, 
including an itinerary of ports served, with the arrival and departure 
times, sea time, port time, hours working or idle in port, off hire days 
and reserve or contingency time, proposed number of annual sailings and 
number of annual working days for the Vessel(s) or, with respect to 
Shipyard Project, how the equipment will be employed;
    (iii) Suitability of the Vessel(s) or Shipyard Project for their 
anticipated use;
    (iv) Significant factors influencing your expectations for the 
future market for the Vessel(s) or Shipyard Project, for example, 
competition, government regulations, alternative uses, and charter 
rates; and
    (v) Particulars of any charters, contracts of affreightment, 
transportation agreements, etc. You should supplement the narrative by 
providing copies of any marketing studies and/or supporting information 
(for instance, existing or proposed charters, contracts of 
affreightment, transportation agreements, and letters of intent from 
prospective customers).
    (vi) The potential for purchasing existing equipment of a reasonable 
condition and age from another source, including information regarding:
    (A) Market assessment concerning the availability and cost of 
existing equipment that may be an alternative to new construction or the 
new Shipyard Project;
    (B) The cost of modification, reconditioning, or reconstruction of 
existing equipment to make it suitable for intended use; and
    (C) Descriptions of any bids or offers which you had made to 
purchase existing equipment, especially Vessels which currently are 
financed with Title XI Obligations including date of offer, Vessels, and 
amount of offer.
    (4) Revenues. A detailed statement of the revenues expected to be 
earned from the project based upon the information in paragraph (c) of 
this section. Vessel revenue projections shall include shipping/hire 
rates for current market conditions or market conditions expected to 
exist at the time of Vessel delivery taking into account seasonal or 
temporary fluctuations. The revenues shall be based on a realistic 
estimate of the Vessel(s) or the new Shipyard Project utilization rate 
and at a breakeven rate for the project. A justification for the 
utilization rate shall be supplied and should indicate the number of 
days per year allowed for maintenance, drydocking, inspection, etc.

[[Page 186]]

    (5) Expenses for Vessel financing. For applications for Vessel 
financing, a detailed statement of estimated Vessel expenses including 
the following (where applicable):
    (i) Estimated Vessel daily operating expenses, including wages, 
insurance, maintenance and repair, fuel, etc. and a detailed projection 
of anticipated costs associated with long term maintenance of the 
Vessel(s) such as drydocking and major mid-life overhauls, with a time 
frame for these events over the period of the Guarantee;
    (ii) If applicable, a detailed breakdown of those expenses 
associated with the Vessel(s) voyage, such as port fees, agency fees and 
canal fees that are assessed as a result of the voyage; and
    (iii) A detailed breakdown of annual capital costs and 
administrative expenses, segregated as to:
    (A) Interest on debt;

allocation).
    (7) Forecast of Operations. Utilizing the revenues and expenses 
provided in paragraphs (c)(4),(5) and (6) of this section, you shall 
provide a forecast of operating cash flow, as defined in paragraph 
(d)(4) of this section, for the Title XI project for the first full year 
of operations and the next four years. The cash flow statements should 
be footnoted to explain the assumptions used.
    (d) Objective Criteria. We must make a finding of economic soundness 
as to each project based on an assessment of the entire project. In 
order for the project to receive approval, we must determine that a 
project meets the following criteria:
    (1) The projected long-term demand (equal to length of time that you 
request financing) for the particular Vessel(s) or new Shipyard Project 
to be financed must exceed the supply of similar vessels or new shipyard 
project in the applicable markets. We will determine the supply of 
similar vessels and similar shipyard projects based on:
    (i) Existing equipment,
    (ii) Similar vessels or new shipyard project under construction, and
    (iii) The projected need for new equipment in that particular 
segment of the maritime industry.
    (2) We will base our determination of the project's economic 
soundness on the following:
    (i) Conformity of your projections with our supply and demand 
analyses;
    (ii) Availability of charters, letters of intent, outstanding 
contractual commitments, contracts of affreightment, transportation 
agreements or similar agreements or undertakings; and
    (iii) Your existing market share compared with the market share 
necessary to meet projected revenues.
    (3) In cases where market conditions are temporarily inadequate for 
you to service the Obligation indebtedness at the time of Vessel 
delivery, or completion of the Shipyard Project, we may approve your 
application only if you have sufficient outside sources of cash flow to 
service your indebtedness during this temporary period.
    (4) With respect to the asset for which Obligations are to be 
issued, the operating cash flow to Obligation debt service ratio over 
the term of the Guarantee must be in excess of 1:1. Operating cash flow 
means revenues less operating and capital expenses including taxes paid 
but exclusive of interest, accrued taxes, depreciation and amortization 
for the Title XI asset. Debt service means interest plus principal.

Sec. 298.15  Investigation fee.

    (a) In general. Before we issue a Letter Commitment, you shall pay 
us an

[[Page 187]]

investigation fee. The Letter Commitment will state the fee which is 
based on the formula in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (1) The investigation fee covers the cost of the investigation of 
the project described in the application and the participants in the 
project, the appraisal of properties offered as security, Vessel 
inspection during construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning (where 
applicable) and other administrative expenses.
    (2) If, for any reason, we disapprove the application, you shall pay 
one-half of the investigation fees.
    (b) Base Fee. (1) The investigation fee shall be one-half (\1/2\) of 
one percent on Obligations to be issued up to and including $10,000,000, 
plus
    (2) One-eighth (\1/8\) of one percent on all Obligations to be 
issued in excess of $10,000,000.
    (c) Credit for filing fee. You will receive credit for the $5,000 
filing fee that you paid upon filing the original application (described 
in Sec. 298.3) towards the investigation fee.


<R05>
Sec. 298.16  Substitution of participants.

    (a) You may request our permission to substitute participants to a 
Mortgage and/or Security Agreement in a financing that is receiving 
assistance authorized by Title XI of the Act.
    (b) A non-refundable fee of $3,000 is due, payable at the time of 
the request. The fee defrays all costs of processing and reviewing a 
joint application by a mortgagor and/or Obligor and a proposed 
transferee of a Vessel or Shipyard Project, which is security for Title 
XI debt, if the proposed transferee is to assume the Mortgage and/or the 
Security Agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 298.17  Evaluation of applications.

    (a) In evaluating project applications, we shall also consider 
whether the application provides for:
    (1) The capability of the Vessel(s) serving as a naval and military 
auxiliary in time of war or national emergency.
    (2) The financing of the Vessel(s) within one year after delivery.
    (3) The acquisition of Vessel(s) currently financed under Title XI 
by assumption of the total obligation(s).
    (4) The Guarantees extend for less than the normal term for that 
class of vessel.
    (5) In the case of an Eligible Shipyard, the capability of the 
shipyard to engage in naval vessel construction in time of war or 
national emergency.
    (6) In the case of Shipyard Project, the Guarantees extend for less 
than the technological life of the asset.
    (b) In determining the amount of equity which you must provide, we 
will consider, among other things, the following:
    (1) Your financial strength;
    (2) Adequacy of collateral; and
    (3) The term of the Guarantees.


<R05>
Sec. 298.18  Financing Shipyard Projects.

    (a) Initial criteria. We may issue Guarantees to finance a Shipyard 
Project at a General Shipyard Facility. We may approve such Guarantees 
after we consider whether the Guarantees will result in shipyard 
modernization and support increased productivity.
    (b) Detailed statement. You must provide a detailed statement, with 
the Guarantee application, which will provide the basis for our 
consideration.
    (c) Required conditions. We shall approve your application for loan 
guarantees under this section if we determine the following:
    (1) The term for such Guarantees will not exceed the reasonable 
economic useful life of the collective assets which comprise this 
Shipyard Project;
    (2) There is sufficient collateral to secure the Guarantee; and
    (3) Your application will not prevent us from guaranteeing debt for 
a Shipyard Project that, in our sole opinion, will serve a more 
desirable use of appropriated funds. In making this determination, we 
will consider:
    (i) The types of vessels which will be built by the shipyard,
    (ii) The productivity increases which will be achieved,
    (iii) The geographic location of the shipyard,
    (iv) The long-term viability of the shipyard,
    (v) The soundness of the financial transaction,
    (vi) Any financial impact on other Title XI transactions, and

[[Page 188]]

    (vii) The furtherance of the goals of the Shipbuilding Act.


<R05>
Sec. 298.19  Financing Eligible Export Vessels.

    (a) Notification to Secretary of Defense. (1) We will provide prompt 
notice of our receipt of an application for a loan Guarantee for an 
Eligible Export Vessel to the Secretary of Defense.
    (2) During the 30-day period, beginning on the date on which the 
Secretary of Defense receives such notice, the Secretary of Defense may 
disapprove the loan guarantee if the Secretary of Defense makes an 
assessment that the Vessel's potential use may cause harm to United 
States national security interests.
    (3) The Secretary of Defense may not disapprove a loan Guarantee 
under this section solely on the basis of the type of vessel to be 
constructed with the loan Guarantee. The authority of the Secretary of 
Defense to disapprove a loan Guarantee under this section may not be 
delegated to any official other than a civilian officer of the 
Department of Defense appointed by the President, by and with the advice 
and consent of the Senate. We will not approve a loan guarantee 
disapproved by the Secretary of Defense.
    (b) Vessel eligibility. We may not approve a Guarantee for an 
Eligible Export Vessel unless:
    (1) We find that the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning 
of the Vessel will aid in the transition of United States shipyards to 
commercial activities or will preserve shipbuilding assets that would be 
essential in time of war or national emergency;
    (2) The owner of the Vessel agrees with us that the Vessel shall not 
be transferred to any country designated by the Secretary of Defense as 
a country whose interests are hostile to the interests of the United 
States; and
    (3) We determine that the countries in which the shipowner, its 
charterers, guarantors, or other financial interests supporting the 
transaction, if any, have their chief executive offices or have located 
a substantial portion of their assets, present an acceptable financial 
or legal risk to our collateral interests. Our determination will be 
based on confidential risk assessments provided by the Inter-Agency 
Country Risk Assessment System and will take into account any other 
factors related to the loan guarantee transaction that we deem 
pertinent.

                          Subpart C_Guarantees


<R05>
Sec. 298.20  Term, redemptions, and interest rate.

    (a) In general. The maturity date of the Obligations must be 
satisfactory to us and must not exceed the anticipated physical and 
economic life of the Vessel or Vessels or Shipyard Project, and may be 
less than but no more than:
    (1) Twenty-five years from the date of delivery from the shipbuilder 
of a single new Vessel which is to be security for Guarantees;
    (2) Twenty-five years from the date of delivery from the shipyard of 
the last of multiple Vessels which are to be security for the Guarantees 
but that the amount of the Guarantees will relate to the amount of the 
depreciated actual cost of the multiple Vessels as of the Closing;
    (3) The later of twenty-five years from the date of original 
delivery of a reconstructed, or reconditioned Vessel which is to be 
security for the Guarantees, or at the expiration of the remaining 
useful life of the Vessel, as we determine; or
    (4) The technological life of the Shipyard Project.
    (b) Required redemptions. Where multiple Vessels or multiple 
Shipyard Project assets are to be used as security for the Guarantees, 
as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, we may require payments 
of principal prior to maturity (redemptions) regarding all related 
Obligations, as we may deem necessary to maintain adequate security for 
the Guarantees.
    (c) Interest rate. We will make a determination as to the 
reasonableness of the interest rate of each Obligation, taking into 
account the range of interest rates prevailing in the private market for 
similar loans and the risks that we assume.


<R05>
Sec. 298.21  Limits.

    (a) Actual Cost basis. We will issue a guarantee on an amount of the 
Obligation satisfactory to us based on the

[[Page 189]]

economic soundness of the transaction. The Obligation amount may be less 
than but not more than 75 percent or 87\1/2\ percent, whichever is 
applicable, under the provisions of section 1104A(b)(2) or section 
1104B(b)(2) of the Act of the Actual Cost of the Vessel or Vessels or 
Shipyard Project asset(s).
    (1) If minimum horsepower of the main engine is a requirement for 
Guarantees up to 87\1/2\ percent of the Actual Cost, the standard for 
the horsepower will be continuous rated horsepower.
    (2) Where we refinance existing debt, the amount of new Obligations 
we issue for the existing debt may not exceed the lesser of:
    (i) The amount of outstanding debt being refinanced (whether or not 
receiving assistance under Title XI); or
    (ii) Seventy-five or 87\1/2\ percent, whichever is applicable, of 
the Depreciated Actual Cost of the Vessel or Shipyard Project with 
respect to which the new Obligations are being issued.
    (b) Actual Cost items. Actual Cost is comprised essentially of those 
items which would customarily be capitalized as Vessel or Shipyard 
Project construction costs such as designing, engineering, constructing 
(including performance bond premiums that we approve), inspecting, 
outfitting and equipping.
    (1) Cost items include those items usually specified in Vessel or 
Shipyard Project construction contracts, e.g., changes and extras, cost 
of owner furnished equipment, shoreside spare parts and commitment fees 
and interest on the Obligations or other borrowings incurred during the 
construction period (excluding interest paid on subordinated debt 
considered to be Equity), and less income realized from investment of 
Escrow Fund deposits during the construction period.
    (2) Commissions (which represent a portion of the total shipyard 
contract price) may be included in the foreign equipment and services 
amount of the Actual Cost of an export project, provided:
    (i) A majority of the work done by the parties receiving the 
commissions is in the form of design and engineering work, and
    (ii) The commissions represent a small amount of the total contract 
price.
    (3) You may include Guarantee Fees determined in accordance with the 
provisions of section 1104(e) of the Act as an item of Actual Cost.
    (4) In approving an item of Actual Cost, we will consider all 
pertinent factors.
    (c) Items excludible from Actual Cost. Actual Cost shall not include 
any other costs such as the following:
    (1) Legal fees or expenses;
    (2) Accounting fees or expenses;
    (3) Commitment fees or interest other than those specifically 
allowed;
    (4) Fees, commissions or charges for granting or arranging for 
financing;
    (5) Fees or charges for preparing, printing and filing an 
application for Title XI Guarantees and supporting documents, for 
services rendered to obtain approval of the application and for

    (d) Substantiation of Actual Cost. (1) Before we make distribution 
from the Escrow Fund or Construction Fund (described in Sec. Sec. 
298.33 and 298.34), and prior to our final Actual Cost determination for 
each Vessel or Shipyard Project, you must submit to us documents 
substantiating all claimed costs eligible under paragraph (b) of this 
section or, alternatively, appropriate certification of such costs by an 
agent who has received our approval.
    (2) These documents may include, but need not be limited to, copies 
of invoices, change orders, subcontracts, and where we require, 
statements from independent certified or independent licensed public 
accountants that the costs for which you seek payment or reimbursement 
were actually paid or are payable for the construction of a Vessel or

    (3) You must summarize, index and arrange these documents according 
to cost categories by following the directions contained in our forms.
    (e) Escalation as part of Actual Cost. Escalation clauses in 
construction contracts shall be subject to our approval. After a review 
of the base contract price and the escalation clauses, we shall, in

    (f) Monies received in respect of construction. (1) If you or any 
Person acting on your behalf, from time to time receives moneys due for 
construction of a Vessel or Shipyard Project (described in the Security 
Agreement) from the shipbuilder, guarantors, sureties or other Persons, 
you shall give us written notice of such fact.
    (2) As long as we have not paid the Guarantees, you or other 
recipient shall promptly deposit these moneys with us to be held by the 
Depository in accordance with the Depository Agreement.
    (3) We will determine the extent to which Actual Cost is to be 
reduced by these moneys.
    (4) In no event shall Actual Cost be reduced with respect to 
payments by the shipyard to a Vessel or Shipyard Project owner of 
liquidated damages for late delivery of the Vessel or Shipyard Project .
    (5) If we have paid the Guarantees, you or other recipient must 
promptly pay these moneys, including any liquidated damages, to us for 
deposit into the Maritime Guaranteed Loans account.
    (g) Depreciated Actual Cost. After a Vessel or Shipyard Project has 
been delivered or redelivered (in the case of reconstruction or 
reconditioning), the limitation on the amount of Guarantees will be 75 
or 87\1/2\ percent, whichever is applicable, of the Depreciated Actual 
Cost of the Vessel or Shipyard Project.

Sec. 298.22  Amortization of Obligations.

    (a) Generally, after delivery or completion of Shipyard Project, and 
until maturity of the Obligations, provisions of the Trust Indenture or 
other part of the Documentation require you to make periodic payment of 
principal and interest on the Obligations.
    (b) Usually, the payment of principal (amortization) shall be made 
semi-annually, but in no event, less frequently than on an annual basis, 
and in either case the amortization shall be in equal payments of 
principal (level principal), unless we consent to the periodic payment 
of a constant aggregate amount, comprised of both interest and principal 
components which are variable in amount (level payment). No other 
proposed method of amortization will be allowed which would reduce the 
amount of periodic amortization below that determined under the level 
principal or level payment basis at any time prior to maturity of the 
Obligations, except where:
    (1) You can demonstrate to our satisfaction that there will be 
adequate funds to discharge the Obligations at maturity;
    (2) You establish a fund with the Depository in which you deposit an 
equal

[[Page 191]]

annual amount necessary to redeem the outstanding Obligations at 
maturity; or
    (3) With regard to Eligible Export Vessels, in accordance with such 
other terms as we determine to be more favorable and to be compatible 
with export credit terms offered by foreign governments for the sale of 
vessels built in foreign shipyards.

<R05>
Sec. 298.23  Refinancing.

    (a) We may approve guarantees of Obligations to be secured by one or 
more Vessels or a Shipyard Project issued to refinance existing Title XI 
debt for either Vessels or for Shipyard Project and existing non-Title 
XI debt, so long as the existing debt has been previously issued for one 
of the purposes set forth in sections 1104(a)(1) through (4) of the Act. 
Section 1104 (a) (1) of the Act requires that, if the existing 
indebtedness was incurred more than one year after the delivery or 
redelivery of the related Vessel or Shipyard Project, the proceeds of 
such Obligations will be applied to the construction, reconstruction or 
reconditioning of other Vessels or Shipyard Project or as provided in 
Sec. 298.24.
    (b) We shall require any security lien on the Vessel(s) or Shipyard 
Project to be discharged immediately before we place a Mortgage or other 
security interest on any of the above assets. You must satisfy all 
necessary eligibility requirements as set forth in subpart B of this 
part, including economic soundness.


<R05>
Sec. 298.24  Financing a Vessel more than a year after delivery.

    (a) We may approve Guarantees for a Vessel which has been delivered 
(or redelivered in the case of reconstruction or reconditioning of a 
Vessel) more than one year prior to the issuance of the Guarantees only 
if:
    (1) The issuance of the Guarantees would otherwise satisfy the 
requirements of the Act and the regulations in this part, and
    (2) The proceeds of the Obligation financing such existing Vessel 
are used to finance:
    (i) The construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of a 
different Vessel within one year of that Vessel's delivery or 
redelivery, as the case may be, or
    (ii) Facilities or equipment pertaining to marine operations. Such 
facilities or equipment must be of a specialized nature, used 
principally for servicing vessels and in handling waterborne cargo in 
the close proximity of the berthing area, excluding over-the-road 
equipment (other than chassis and containers), permanent or 
semipermanent structures and real estate, as well as new or less than 
one year old.
    (b) At the Closing of Guarantees covered by this section, you must 
deposit the proceeds of the Obligation into an Escrow Fund established 
to pay for the cost unless you demonstrate to our satisfaction that all 
such costs have been paid.


<R05>
Sec. 298.25  Excess interest or other consideration.

    We shall not execute Guarantees if any agreement in the 
Documentation directly or indirectly provides for:
    (a) The payment to an Obligee of interest, or other compensation for 
services which have not been performed, in a manner that such 
compensation or payment is being provided as interest in excess of the 
rate approved by us; or
    (b) Grants of security to an Obligee in addition to the Guarantees.


<R05>
Sec. 298.26  Lease payments.

    You must obtain our approval of the amount and conditions of lease 
or charter hire payments if the payment of principal and interest on 
Obligations would be dependent, in any way, upon the lease or charter 
hire payments for a Vessel or Shipyard Project.


<R05>
Sec. 298.27  Advances.

    (a) In general. (1) In accordance with section 207 and Title XI of 
the Act, we have the discretion to make or commit to make an advance or 
payment of funds to, or on behalf of the owner, or operator or directly 
to any other person or entity for items, including, but not limited to:
    (i) Principal,
    (ii) Interest,

[[Page 192]]

    (iii) Insurance, and
    (iv) Other vessel-related expenses or fees.
    (2) We will make advances or payments only to protect, preserve or 
improve the collateral held as our security for Title XI debt.
    (3) When requesting an advance, you must demonstrate that:
    (i) Your problems are short term (less than two years) by using 
market and cash flow analysis and other projections.

insurance payments at least 30 days before a renewal or termination 
date.
    (4) Extenuating circumstances. We may consider requests for 
assistance with less notice, upon written documentation of extenuating 
circumstances.
    (5) Supporting data. Any requests for assistance must be accompanied 
by supporting data regarding:
    (i) Need for the advance,
    (ii) Financial assistance you sought from other sources,
    (iii) The measures that you are taking and have taken to alleviate 
the situation,
    (iv) Financial projections,
    (v) Proposed term of the repayment,
    (vi) Current and projected market conditions,

<R04>
                         Subpart D_Documentation


<R05>
Sec. 298.30  Nature and content of Obligations.

    (a) Single page. An Obligation, in the form of a note, bond of any 
type, or other debt instrument, when engraved, printed or lithographed 
on a single sheet of paper must include on its face the:
    (1) Name of the Obligor,
    (2) Principal sum,
    (3) Rate of interest,
    (4) Date of maturity, and
    (5) Guarantee of the United States, authenticated by the Indenture 
Trustee, if any.
    (b) Several pages. If the Obligation is typewritten, printed or 
reproduced by other means on several pages of paper, the Guarantee of 
the United States and the authentication certificate of the Indenture 
Trustee, if any, may appear at the end of the typewritten Obligation.
    (c) Rights and responsibilities. The instrument which is evidence of 
indebtedness shall also contain all information necessary to apprise the 
Obligees of their rights and responsibilities including, but not limited 
to:
    (1) Time and manner for payment of principal and interest,
    (2) Redemptions,
    (3) Default procedure, and
    (4) Notification (in case of registered Obligations) of sale or 
other transfer of the instruments.


<R05>
Sec. 298.31  Mortgage.

    (a) In general. Under normal circumstances, a Guarantee shall not be 
endorsed on any Obligation until we receive satisfactory evidence that 
we hold a Mortgage in one or more Vessels or a Mortgage or other 
security interest in the Shipyard Project. During construction of a new 
Vessel or any Shipyard Project, a security interest may be perfected by 
a filing under the Uniform Commercial Code.
    (b) Ensuring validity of security interest. In order to ensure that 
our Mortgages or other security interests are valid and enforceable, we 
shall require that the Obligor obtain legal opinions, in form and 
substance satisfactory to us, from independent, outside legal counsel 
satisfactory to us, including foreign independent outside legal Counsel 
for Eligible Export Vessels, which opinions shall state, among other 
things, that the Mortgage or other security interest(s) are valid and 
enforceable:

[[Page 193]]

    (1) In the country in which the Vessel is documented (or, in the 
case of a security interest, in jurisdictions acceptable to us);
    (2) In the United States; and
    (3) For vessels operating on specified trade routes, in the country 
or countries involved in this service, unless we determine that those 
destinations are too numerous, in which case, we will instead require an 
opinion of foreign validity and enforceability in the Vessel's primary 
port of operation.
    (c) Alternative forms of security. In the case where a Mortgage or 
security interest on the financed assets may not be available or 
enforceable, we will require alternative forms of security.
    (d) Mortgage in our favor. The Security Agreement shall provide that 
upon delivery of a new Vessel or upon final completion of the Shipyard 
Project, or at the time Guarantees are issued with respect to an 
existing Vessel or the Shipyard Project, a Mortgage on the Vessel and a 
Mortgage or other security interest on the Shipyard Project will be 
executed in our favor, unless we determine that a Mortgage or a security 
interest is not available or enforceable in accordance with paragraph 
(c) of this section.
    (e) Filing. You must file the Mortgage with the United States Coast 
Guard's National Vessel Documentation Center. You must file the Mortgage 
for an Eligible Export Vessel with the proper foreign authorities. For 
assets of a General Shipyard Facility, you must file a Mortgage and 
security interest with the proper authorities within the appropriate 
state for recording. After you have recorded the Mortgage, you must 
deliver to us the Mortgage and evidence of the filing of the security 
interest.
    (f) Mortgage secured by multiple Vessels. (1) When two or more 
Vessels are to be security for Guarantees, the Security Agreement may 
provide that one Mortgage relating to all the Vessels (Fleet Mortgage) 
shall be executed, perfected and delivered to us by the Obligor.
    (2) If the Fleet Mortgage relates to undelivered Vessels, the Fleet 
Mortgage will be executed upon delivery of the first vessel. At the time 
of each subsequent Vessel delivery, the Obligor shall execute a 
supplement to the Fleet Mortgage which makes that Vessel subject to our 
Mortgage lien.
    (3) The Fleet Mortgage shall provide that payment by the Obligor of 
the entire amount of Obligations covered or to be covered by Guarantees 
shall be required to discharge the Fleet Mortgage, regardless of the 
amount of the Secretary's Note or Notes issued and outstanding at the 
time of execution and delivery of the Fleet Mortgage or the number of 
Vessels covered by the Fleet Mortgage.
    (4) The discharge date of the Fleet Mortgage shall be the maturity 
date of the Secretary's Note. We may require, as authorized by section 
1104(c)(2) of the Act, such payments of principal prior to maturity 
(redemptions), regarding all related Obligations, as deemed necessary to 
maintain adequate security for the Guarantees.
    (5) Each Fleet Mortgage shall provide that in the event of 
constructive total loss, requisition of title or sale of any Vessel 
covered by the Fleet Mortgage, indebtedness represented by the 
Obligations shall be paid, unless we otherwise determine that there 
remains adequate security for the Guarantees, and the Vessel shall be 
discharged from the Mortgage lien.
    (g) Adequacy of collateral. (1) Under normal circumstances, a First 
Preferred Mortgage on the Vessel(s) or Shipyard Project will be adequate 
security for the Guarantees.
    (2) If, however, we determine that the Mortgage on the Vessel(s) or 
Shipyard Project is not sufficient to provide adequate security, as a 
condition to approving the Letter Commitment or processing the 
application, we may require additional collateral, such as a mortgage(s) 
on other vessel(s) or Shipyard Project or on other assets, special 
escrow funds, pledges of stock, charters, contracts, notes, letters of 
credit, accounts receivable assignments, and guarantees.


<R05>

capacity to complete the project, posting of a bond will not be 
required;
    (2) Allowing access to the Vessel or Shipyard Project, as well as 
all related work projects being performed by the contractor and 
subcontractors, to our representative, at all reasonable times, to

our representative as to each payment;
    (5) Prohibiting the use of proceeds from the sale of Obligations for 
the payment of work performed outside the shipyard, unless we consent in

appropriate parties to any such assignments;
    (4) Covenants relating to the filing of satisfactory evidence of 
continuing United States citizenship, in accordance with 46 CFR part 
355, with the exception of Eligible Export Vessels and shipyards with

American and/or British (and/or other foreign, if permitted by us by 
prior written notice) insurance companies, underwriters' associations or 
underwriting funds approved by us through marine insurance brokers and/

<R05>
Sec. 298.33  Escrow fund.

    (a) Escrow Fund Deposits. At the time of the sale of the 
Obligations, the Obligor shall deposit with the Depository in an escrow 
fund (the ``Escrow Fund'') all of the proceeds of that sale unless the 
Obligor is entitled to withdraw funds under paragraph (b) of this 
section. The Obligor must also deposit into the Escrow Fund on the 
Closing date an amount equal to six months interest at the rate borne by 
the Obligations, unless we find the existence of adequate consideration 
or accept other consideration in lieu of the interest deposit.
    (b) Escrow Fund Withdrawals. You, as Obligor, may make a written 
request for us to disburse funds from the Escrow Fund. Within a 
reasonable time thereafter, we shall disburse directly to the Indenture 
Trustee, any Paying Agent for such Obligations, or any other Person 
entitled to payment any amount which you are obligated to pay or have 
paid, on account of the items and amounts or any other item approved by 
us, provided that we are satisfied with the accuracy and completeness of 
the information contained in the following submissions:
    (1) A responsible officer of the Obligor shall deliver an officer's 
certificate, in form and substance satisfactory to us, stating that:
    (i) There is no default under the construction contract or the 
Security Agreement;
    (ii) There have been no occurrences which have or would adversely 
and materially affect the condition of the Vessel, its hull or any of 
its component parts, or the Shipyard Project;
    (iii) The amounts of the request are in accordance with the 
construction contract including the approved disbursement schedule and 
each item in these amounts is properly included in our approved estimate 
of Actual Cost;
    (iv) With respect to the request, once the contractor is paid there 
will be no liens or encumbrances on the applicable Vessel, its hull or 
component parts, or the Shipyard Project for which the withdrawal is 
being requested except for those already approved by us; and

[[Page 196]]

    (v) If the Vessel or Shipyard Project has already been delivered or 
completed, it is in class, if required, and is being maintained in the 
highest and best condition. The Obligor must also attach an officer's 
certificate of the shipyard and other general contractors, in form and 
substance satisfactory to us, stating that there are no liens or 
encumbrances as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section and 
attaching the invoices and receipts supporting each proposed withdrawal 
to our satisfaction.
    (2) No payment or reimbursement under this section shall be made:
    (i) To any Person until the total amount paid by or for the account 
of the Obligor from sources other than the proceeds of such Obligations 
equals at least 12\1/2\ percent or 25 percent as applicable, of the 
Actual Cost of the Vessel or Shipyard Project is made;
    (ii) To the Obligor which would have the effect of reducing the 
total amounts paid by the Obligor pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of 
this section; or
    (iii) To any Person on account of items, amounts or increases 
representing changes and extras or owner furnished equipment, if any, 
unless such items, amounts and increases shall have been previously 
approved by us; provided, however, that when the amount guaranteed by us 
equals 75 percent or less of the Actual Cost and the Obligor 
demonstrates to our satisfaction the ability to pay in the remaining 25 
percent, or more, then after the initial 12\1/2\ percent of Actual Cost 
has been paid by or on behalf of the Obligor for such Vessel or 
completed Shipyard Project and up to 37\1/2\ percent of Actual Cost has 
been withdrawn from the Escrow Fund for such Vessel or Shipyard Project, 
the Obligor must pay the remaining Obligor's equity of at least 12\1/2\ 
percent (as determined by us) before additional monies can be withdrawn 
from the Escrow Fund relating to such Vessel or Shipyard Project.
    (3) We will not be required to make any disbursement except out of 
the cash available in the Escrow Fund. If any sale or payment on 
maturity results in a loss in the principal amount of the Escrow Fund 
invested in securities so sold or matured, the requested disbursement 
from the Escrow Fund shall be reduced by an amount equal to such loss, 
and the Obligor must pay to any Person entitled thereto, the balance of 
the requested disbursement from the Obligor's funds other than the 
proceeds of such Obligations.
    (4) If we assume the Obligor's rights and duties under the 
Obligations or we pay the Guarantees, all amounts in the Escrow Fund 
(including realized income which has not yet been paid to the Obligor), 
shall be paid to us and be credited against any amounts due or to become 
due to us under the Security Agreement and the Secretary's Note.
    (5) Other rights and duties with respect to withdrawals from the 
Escrow Fund shall be set out in the closing documentation in form and 
substance satisfactory to us.
    (c) Investment and liquidation of the Escrow Fund. We may invest the 
Escrow Fund in obligations of the United States. We will deposit amounts 
in the Escrow Fund into an account with the U.S. Treasury Department and 
upon agreement with the Obligor, shall deliver to the U.S. Treasury 
Department instructions for the investment, reinvestment and liquidation 
of the Escrow Fund. We will have no liability to the Obligor for acting 
in accordance with such instructions.
    (d) Income on the Escrow Fund. Unless there is an existing default, 
any income realized on the Escrow Fund shall be paid to the Obligor upon 
our receipt of such income.
    (e) Termination date of the Escrow Fund. The Escrow Fund shall 
terminate 90 days after the delivery date of the last Vessel or Shipyard 
Project covered by the Security Agreement (the ``Termination Date''). In 
the event that on such date the payment of the full amount of the 
aggregate Actual Cost of all of the Vessels or Shipyard Project has not 
been made or the amounts with respect to such Actual Cost are not then 
due and payable, then we and the Obligor by written agreement shall 
extend the Termination Date for such period as we and the Obligor shall 
determine is sufficient to allow for such contingencies. Any amounts 
remaining in the Escrow Fund on the Termination Date which

[[Page 197]]

are in excess of 87\1/2\ percent or 75 percent of Actual Cost, as the 
case may be, shall be applied to retire a pro rata portion of the 
Obligations.

ensure payment of the interest and principal due on the Obligations, we 
will require the Company to enter into a Title XI Reserve Fund and 
Financial Agreement (Agreement) at the first Closing at which the 
Company issues Obligations. We may waive or modify provisions of the 
Agreement based on our evaluation of the aggregate security for the 
Guarantees.
    (b) Financial covenants. There will be two sets of covenants. One 
set of covenants will be imposed regardless of the Company's financial 
condition (primary covenants). The other set of covenants will be 
imposed only if the Company does not meet specific financial conditions 
(supplemental covenants). The primary and supplemental covenants are to 
be set forth in the Agreement. Covenants shall be imposed on the Company 
as follows:
    (1) Primary covenants. So long as Guarantees are in effect the 
Company shall not, without our prior written consent:
    (i) Make any distribution of earnings, except as may be permitted as 
follows:
    (A) From retained earnings in an amount specified in paragraph 
(b)(1)(i)(C) of this section, provided that, in the fiscal year in which 
the distribution of earnings is made there is no operating loss to the 
date of such payment of such distribution of earnings, and there was no 
operating loss in the immediately preceding three fiscal years, or there 
was a one-year operating loss during the immediately preceding three 
fiscal years, but such loss was not in the immediately preceding fiscal 
year, and there was positive net income for the three year period;
    (B) If distributions of earnings may not be made under paragraph 
(b)(1)(i)(A) of this section, a distribution can be made in an amount 
equal to the total operating net income for the immediately preceding 
three fiscal year period, provided that:
    (1) There were no two successive years of operating losses;
    (2) There is no operating loss to the date of such distribution in 
the fiscal year in which such distribution is made; and
    (3) The distribution of earnings made would not exceed an amount 
specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(C) of this section;
    (C) Distributions of earnings may be made from earnings of prior 
years in an aggregate amount equal to 40 percent of the Company's total 
net income after tax for each of the prior years, less any distributions 
that were made in such years; or the aggregate of the Company's total 
net income after tax for such prior years, provided that, after making 
such distribution, the Company's Long-Term Debt does not exceed its Net 
Worth. In computing net income for purposes of this paragraph 
(b)(1)(i)(C), extraordinary gains, such as gains from the sale of 
assets, will be excluded;
    (ii) Enter into any service, management or operating agreement for 
the operation of the Vessel or the Shipyard Project (excluding 
husbanding type agreements), or appoint or designate a managing or 
operating agent for the operation of the Vessel or the Shipyard Project 
(excluding husbanding agents) unless approved by us;
    (iii) Sell, mortgage, transfer, or demise charter the Vessel or the 
Shipyard Project or any assets to any non-Related Party except as 
permitted in paragraph (b)(1)(vii) of this section or sell, mortgage, 
transfer, or demise charter the Vessel or any assets to a Related Party, 
unless such transaction is at a fair market value as determined by an 
independent appraiser acceptable to us, and is a total cash transaction;
    (iv) Enter into any agreement for both sale and leaseback of the 
same assets so sold unless the proceeds from such sale are at least 
equal to the fair market value of the property sold;
    (v) Guarantee, or otherwise become liable for the obligations of any 
other Person, except with respect to any undertakings as to the fees and 
expenses

[[Page 198]]

of the Indenture Trustee, except endorsement for deposit of checks and 
other negotiable instruments acquired in the ordinary course of business 
and except as otherwise permitted in this section;
    (vi) Directly or indirectly embark on any new enterprise or business 
activity not directly connected with the business of shipping or other 
activity in which the Company is actively engaged;
    (vii) Enter into any merger or consolidation or convey, sell, demise 
charter, or otherwise transfer, or dispose of any portion of its 
properties or assets (any and all of which acts are encompassed within 
the words ``sale'' or ``sold'' as used in this section), provided that, 
the Company will not be deemed to have sold such properties or assets if 
the net book value of the aggregate of all the assets sold by the 
Company during any period of 12 consecutive calendar months does not 
exceed ten percent of the total net book value of all of the Company's 
assets; the Company retains the proceeds of the sale of assets for use 
in accordance with the Company's regular business activities; and the 
sale is not otherwise prohibited by paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this 
section. The Company may not consummate such sale without our prior 
written consent if the Company has not, prior to the time of such sale, 
submitted to us, as required, its most recently audited financial 
statements referred to in Sec. 298.42(a) and any attempt to consummate 
a sale absent such approval will be null and void ab initio.
    (2) Supplemental Covenants which may become applicable. Unless, 
after giving effect to such transaction or transactions, during any 
fiscal year of the Company, the Company's Working Capital is equal to at 
least one dollar, the Company's Long-Term Debt does not exceed two times 
the Company's Net Worth and the Company's Net Worth is at least the 
amount specified by us, the Company shall not, without our prior written 
consent:
    (i) Withdraw any capital;
    (ii) Redeem any share capital or convert any of the same into debt;
    (iii) Pay any dividend (except dividends payable in capital stock of 
the Company);
    (iv) Make any loan or advance (except advances to cover current 
expenses of the Company), either directly or indirectly, to any 
stockholder, director, officer, or employee of the Company, or to any 
other Related Party;
    (v) Make any investments in the securities of any Related Party;
    (vi) Prepay in whole or in part any indebtedness to any stockholder, 
director, officer, or employee of the Company, or to any Related Party, 
which has a stated maturity of more than one year from such date;
    (vii) Increase any direct employee compensation (as defined in this 
paragraph) paid to any employee in excess of $100,000 per annum; nor 
increase any direct employee compensation which is already in excess of 
$100,000 per annum; nor initially employ or re-employ any person at a 
direct employee compensation rate in excess of $100,000 per annum; 
provided, however, that beginning with January 1, 2000 the $100,000 
limit may be increased annually based on the previous years' closing 
Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term ``direct 
employee compensation'' is the total amount of any wage, salary, bonus 
commission, or other form of direct payment to any employee from all 
companies with guarantees under the Act as reported to the Internal 
Revenue Service for any fiscal year.
    (viii) Acquire any fixed assets other than those required for the 
maintenance of the Company's existing assets, including normal 
maintenance and operation of any vessel or vessels owned or chartered by 
the Company;
    (ix) Either enter into or become liable (directly or indirectly) 
under charters and leases (having a term of six months or more) for the 
payment of charter hire and rent on all such charters and leases which 
have annual payments aggregating in excess of an amount specified by us;
    (x) Pay any indebtedness subordinated to the Obligations or to any 
other Title XI obligations;

[[Page 199]]

    (xi) Create, assume, incur, or in any manner become liable for any 
indebtedness, except current liabilities, or short term loans, incurred 
or assumed in the ordinary course of business as such business presently 
exists;
    (xii) Make any investment whether by acquisition of stock or 
indebtedness, or by loan, advance, transfer of property, capital 
contribution, guarantee of indebtedness or otherwise, in any Person, 
other than obligations of the United States, bank deposits or 
investments in securities of the character permitted for monies in the 
Title XI Reserve Fund; and,
    (xiii) Create, assume, permit or suffer to exist or continue any 
mortgage, lien, charge or encumbrance upon, or pledge of, or subject to 
the prior payment of any indebtedness, any of its property or assets, 
real or personal, tangible or intangible, whether now owned or 
thereafter acquired, or own or acquire, or agree to acquire, title to 
any property of any kind subject to or upon a chattel mortgage or 
conditional sales agreement or other title retention agreement, except 
loans, mortgages and indebtedness guaranteed by us under Title XI of the 
Act or related to the construction of a vessel approved for Title XI by 
us, and liens incurred in the ordinary course of business as such 
business presently exists.
    (c) Title XI Reserve Fund Net Income. The Agreement shall provide 
that within 105 days after the end of its accounting year, the Company 
will compute its net income attributable to the operation of the 
Vessel(s) that were constructed, reconstructed, reconditioned or 
refinanced with Title XI financing assistance (Title XI Reserve Fund Net 
Income). The computation utilizes a ratio expressed as a percentage, and 
applies this percentage to the Company's total net income after taxes. 
The numerator of the ratio is be the total original capitalized cost of 
all Company Vessels (whether leased or owned) which were constructed, 
reconstructed, reconditioned or refinanced with the assistance of 
Guarantees. The denominator shall be the total original capitalized cost 
of all the Company's fixed assets. In the case of Shipyard Project, the 
Agreement shall provide that within 105 days after the end of its 
accounting year, the Company shall submit its audited financial 
statements showing its net cash flow in a manner acceptable to us, in 
lieu of any other computation of Reserve Fund Net Income specified in 
this section for Vessels. The net income after taxes, computed in 
accordance with GAAP, will be adjusted as follows:
    (1) The depreciation expense applicable to the accounting year shall 
be added back.
    (2) There shall be subtracted:
    (i) An amount equal to the principal amount of debt required to be 
paid or redeemed, and actually paid or redeemed by the Company (other 
than from the Title XI Reserve Fund) during the year; and
    (ii) The principal amount of Obligations retired or paid (as defined 
in the Security Agreement), prepaid or redeemed, in excess of the 
required redemptions or payments which may be used by the Company as a 
credit against future required redemptions or other required payments 
with respect to the Obligations.
    (d) Deposits. Unless the Company, as of the close of its accounting 
year, was subject to and in compliance with the financial requirements 
set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Company shall make 
one or more deposits to us to be held by the Depository (the Title XI 
Reserve Fund), as further provided for in the Depository Agreement. The 
amount of deposit as to any year, or period less than a full year, where 
applicable, will be determined as follows:
    (1) Fifty percent of the Title XI Reserve Fund Net Income, less an 
amount equal to 10% of the Company's total original equity investment in 
the Vessel or Vessels, (if the Company is the owner of the assets), will 
be deposited into the Title XI Reserve Fund.
    (2) In the case of Shipyard Project, the shipyard shall make a 
deposit at two percent of its net cash flow, as defined by GAAP, and as 
shown on its audited financial statements.
    (3) Any additional amounts that may be required pursuant to the 
Security Agreement or any other agreement in the documentation to which 
the Company is a party.

[[Page 200]]

    (4) Any additional amounts that may be required, pursuant to 
provisions of the Security Agreement or any other agreement in the 
documentation to which the Company is a party.
    (5) Irrespective of the Company's deposit requirement, as stated in 
paragraphs (d) (1) through (4) of this section, the Company will not be 
required to make any deposits into the Title XI Reserve Fund if any of 
the following events will have occurred:
    (i) The Company will have discharged the Obligations and related 
Secretary's Note and will have paid other sums secured under the 
Security Agreement and Preferred Mortgage;
    (ii) All Guarantees with respect to outstanding Obligations will 
have terminated pursuant to the provisions of the Security Agreements, 
other than by reason of payment of the Guarantees; or
    (iii) The amount in the Title XI Reserve Fund, (including any 
securities at market value), is equal to, or in excess of 50 percent of 
the principal amount of outstanding Obligations.
    (e) Fund in lieu of Title XI Reserve Fund. If the Company has 
established a Capital Construction Fund (CCF), pursuant to section 607 
of the Act, whether interim or permanent, at any time when a deposit 
would otherwise be required to be made into the Title XI Reserve Fund, 
and the Company elects to make such deposits to the CCF, the Company 
must enter into an agreement, satisfactory to us, providing that all 
such deposits of assets therein will be security (CCF Security Amount) 
to the United States in lieu of the Title XI Reserve Fund. The deposit 
requirements of the Title XI Reserve Fund and Financial Agreement will 
be deemed satisfied by deposits of equal amounts in the CCF, and 
withdrawal of the CCF Security Amount will be subject to our prior 
written consent. If, for any reason, the CCF terminates prior to the 
payment of the Obligations, the Secretary's Note and all other amounts 
due under or secured by the Security Agreement or Mortgage, the CCF 
Security Amount will be deposited or redeposited in the Title XI Reserve 
Fund.

Sec. 298.36  Guarantee Fee.

    (a) Rates in general. (1) For annual periods, beginning with the 
date of the Security Agreement and prior to the delivery date of a 
Vessel or Shipyard Project, we shall charge a Guarantee Fee set at a 
rate of not less than \1/4\ of 1 percent and not more than \1/2\ of 1 
percent of the excess of the average principal amount of the Obligations 
estimated to be outstanding during the annual periods covered by said 
Guarantee Fee over the average principal amount, if any, on deposit in 
the Escrow Fund during said annual period (Average Principal Amount of 
Obligations Outstanding).
    (2) For annual periods beginning with the delivery date of a Vessel 
or Shipyard Project, the Guarantee Fee shall be set at an annual rate of 
not less than \1/2\ of 1 percent and not more than 1 percent of the 
Average Principal Amount of Obligations Outstanding during the annual 
periods covered by the Guarantee Fee. You will be responsible for 
payment of the Guarantee Fee.
    (b) Rate calculation. (1) The Guarantee Fee rate generally shall 
vary inversely with the ratio of Equity to Long-Term Debt (Variable 
Rate) of the Person who we consider to be the primary source of credit 
in the transaction (Credit Source), for example,
    (i) The long term time charterer (where the charter hire represents 
the source of payment of interest and principal with respect to the 
Obligations),
    (ii) The guarantor of the Obligations,
    (iii) The Obligor, or
    (iv) The bareboat charterer.
    (2) Where the Variable Rate is used, we may make such adjustments to 
the computation of Equity and Long-Term Debt considered necessary to 
reflect more accurately the financial condition of the Credit Source.
    (3) We shall base our determination of Equity and Long-Term Debt on 
information contained in forms or statements on file with us prior to 
the date on which the Guarantee Fee is to be paid.
    (4) With our consent, you may include in Equity and exclude from 
Long-Term Debt, any subordinated indebtedness representing loans from 
any credit source.

[[Page 201]]

    (5) We may establish a fixed rate or other method of calculation of 
the Guarantee Fee, upon an evaluation of the aggregate security for the 
Guarantees.
    (c) Variable Rate prior to Vessel or Shipyard Project. For annual 
periods beginning prior to the delivery date of a Vessel or Shipyard 
Project being constructed, reconstructed, or reconditioned, the 
Guarantee Fee shall be determined as follows:
    (1) If the Equity is less than 15 percent of the Long-Term Debt, the 
Guarantee Fee rate shall be \1/2\ of 1 percent of the Average Principal 
Amount of Obligations Outstanding during the annual period covered by 
the Guarantee Fee.
    (2) If the Equity is at least 15 percent of the Long-Term Debt, but 
less than the Long-Term Debt, the Guarantee Fee rate shall be \3/8\ of 1 
percent of the Average Principal Amount of Obligations Outstanding 
during the annual period covered by the Guarantee Fee.
    (3) If the Equity is equal to or exceeds the Long-Term Debt, the 
Guarantee Fee rate shall be \1/4\ of 1 percent of the Average Principal 
Amount of Obligations Outstanding during the annual period covered by 
the Guarantee Fee.
    (d) Variable Rate after Vessel or Shipyard Project delivery or 
completion. For annual periods beginning on or after the Vessel or 
Shipyard Project delivery date, the Guarantee Fee shall be determined as 
follows:
    (1) If the Equity is less than 15 percent of the Long-Term Debt, the 
Guarantee Fee rate shall be 1 percent of the Average Principal Amount of 
Obligations Outstanding during the annual period covered by the 
Guarantee Fee.
    (2) If the Equity is at least 15 percent of the Long-Term Debt but 
less than 60 percent of the Long-Term Debt, the Guarantee Fee rate shall 
be \3/4\ of 1 percent of the Average Principal Amount of Obligations 
Outstanding during the annual period covered by the Guarantee Fee.
    (3) If the Equity is at least 60 percent of the Long-Term Debt, but 
less than the Long-Term Debt, the Guarantee Fee rate shall be \5/8\ of 1 
percent of the Average Principal Amount of Obligations outstanding 
during the annual period covered by the Guarantee Fee.
    (4) If the Equity is equal to or exceeds the Long-Term Debt, the 
Guarantee Fee rate shall be \1/2\ of 1 percent of the Average Principal 
Amount of Obligations outstanding during the annual period covered by 
the Guarantee Fee.
    (e) Payment of Guarantee Fee. (1) The Guarantee Fee covering the 
full period of the stated maturity of the Obligations commencing with 
the date of the Security Agreement shall be paid to us concurrently with 
the execution and delivery of said Agreement. The project's entire 
Guarantee Fee payment shall be made by you to us in an amount equal to 
the sum of the present value of the separate products obtained by 
applying the pertinent pre or post delivery Guarantee Fee rate or rates 
to the projected amount of the Average Principal Amount of Obligations 
Outstanding for each year of the stated maturity of the Obligations. In 
calculating the present value used in determining the amount of the 
Guarantee Fee to be paid, we shall use a discount rate based on 
information contained in the President's most recently submitted budget.
    (2) The Guarantee Fee may be included in Actual Cost, is eligible to 
be financed, and is non-refundable.
    (f) Proration of Guarantee Fee. The Guarantee Fee shall be prorated 
where a Vessel delivery is scheduled to occur during the annual period 
with respect to which payment of said Guarantee Fee is being made, as 
follows:
    (1) Undelivered Vessel. If the Guarantee Fee relates to an 
undelivered Vessel, the predelivery rate is applicable to the Average 
Principal Amount of Obligations Outstanding for the period from the date 
of the Security Agreement to the delivery date, and the delivered Vessel 
rate is applicable for the balance of the annual period in which the 
delivery occurs.
    (2) Multiple Vessels. If the Guarantee Fee relates to more than one 
Vessel, the amount of outstanding Obligations will be allocated to each 
Vessel in the manner prescribed in Sec. 298.33(d), and an amount shall 
be determined for each Vessel by using the rate that is applicable under 
paragraph (c) or (d) of this

[[Page 202]]

section. The Guarantee Fee shall be the aggregate of the amounts 
calculated for each Vessel.


<R05>
Sec. 298.37  Examination and audit.

    (a)(1) We shall have the right to examine and audit the books, 
records (including original logs, cargo manifests and similar records) 
and books of account, which pertain directly to the project, of the 
Obligor, bareboat charterer, time charterer or any other Person who has 
an agreement with respect to control of, or a financial interest in, a 
Vessel or Shipyard Project, as well as records of a Related Party and 
domestic agents connected with such Persons, and shall have full, free 
and complete access to these items at all reasonable times.
    (2) We shall have the right to full, free and complete access, at 
all reasonable times, to each Vessel or Shipyard Project for which 
Guarantees are in force.
    (3) When a Vessel is in port or undergoing repairs, we may make 
photostatic or other copies of any books, records and other relevant 
documents or papers being examined or audited.
    (b) The Person in control of the premises where we conduct the 
examination or audit must furnish, without charge, adequate office space 
and other facilities that we reasonably require in performing the 
examination, audit or inspection.


<R05>
Sec. 298.38  Partnership agreements and limited liability company agreements.

    Partnership and limited liability company agreements must be in form 
and substance satisfactory to us prior to any Guarantee Closing, 
especially relating, but not limited to:
    (a) Duration of the entity;
    (b) Adequate partnership or limited liability company funding 
requirements and mechanisms;
    (c) Dissolution of the entity and withdrawal of a general partner or 
member;
    (d) The termination, amendment, or other modification of the entity 
without our prior written consent; and
    (e) Distribution of funds or ownership interest.


<R05>
Sec. 298.39  Exemptions.

    We may exempt an applicant from any requirement of this part, unless 
required by statute or other regulations, in exceptional cases, on 
written findings that:
    (a) The case materially involves factors not considered in the 
promulgation of this part;
    (b)(1) A national emergency makes it necessary to approve the 
exemption, or
    (2) The exemption will substantially relieve the financial liability 
of the United States;
    (c) The exemption will not substantially impact effective regulation 
of the Title XI program, consistent with the objectives of this part;
    (d) The exemption will not be unjustly discriminatory; and
    (e) For Eligible Export Vessels, such exemption would assist in 
creating financing terms that would be compatible with export credit 
terms for the sale of vessels built in shipyards other than those in the 
United States.

Security Agreement and in other parts of the Documentation.
    (b) Principal and interest Payment Default. Unless we have assumed 
the Obligor's rights and duties under the Obligation and agreements and 
have made any payments in default under terms in the Obligation or 
related agreements, the following procedures regarding principal and 
interest payment default shall apply:
    (1) No demand shall be made for payment under the Guarantees unless 
the default shall have continued for 30 days (Payment Default).

determine that a Payment Default has not occurred or that such Payment 
Default has been remedied prior to demand being made.
    (c) Security Default. If a default occurs under the Security 
Agreement which is other than a Payment Default (Security Default), 
section 1105(b) of the Act allows us, in our sole discretion, to declare 
such default a Security Default, and we may notify the Obligee or agent 
of the Obligee of such Security Default, stating that demand for payment 
under the Guarantees must be made no later than 60 days after the date 
of such notification.
    (d) Payment of Guarantees. If we receive notice of demand for 
payment of the Guarantees, we shall, no later than 30 days after the 
date of such demand (provided that we shall not have, upon such terms as 
may be provided in the Obligations or related agreements, prior to that 
demand, assumed the Obligor's rights and duties under the Obligation and

accountants of the financial statements contained in the company's 
semiannual report. We also may require certification of the semiannual 
report by the accountants. Where independent certification is not 
required, a responsible corporate officer will attach a certification 
that such report is based on the accounting records and, to the best of 
that officer's knowledge and belief, is accurate and complete.
    (h) Leveraged lease financing. If the method of financing involved 
is a leveraged lease financing, or a trust is the owner of the Vessels, 
we may modify the requirements for annual and semiannual accounting 
reports of the Obligor accordingly.
    (i) Letter of confirmation. The Company must furnish, along with its 
financial report, a letter of confirmation issued by its insurance 
underwriter(s) or broker(s) that the Company has paid premiums on 
insurance applicable to the preservation, protection and operation of 
the asset, which information must state the term for which the insurance 
is in force.

<R04>
                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 308.1  Eligibility for vessel insurance.

    Any vessel within one of the following categories shall be eligible 
for insurance, but shall remain eligible only while meeting the 
qualifications criteria in one of said categories. An eligible vessel is 
not insured unless and until an application is submitted as required in 
subpart B, C, or D of this part 308 and the Maritime Administrator, 
Department of Transportation, (Maritime Administrator) Maritime 
Administration (MARAD), approves said application.
    (a) A vessel registered, enrolled, or licensed under the laws of the 
United States of America (United States); any undocumented vessel owned 
or chartered by or made available to the United States or any department 
or agency thereof; any tug or barge or other watercraft (documented 
under the laws of the United States, or undocumented) owned by a citizen 
of the United States and used in essential water transportation; and 
United States citizen-owned watercraft used in the fishing trade or 
industry, except when used exclusively in or for sport fishing.
    (b) Any vessel, other than a vessel described in paragraph (a) of 
this section determined by the Maritime Administrator to be engaged in 
the national defense or the national economy of the United States and 
subject to an unqualified Contract of Commitment with the United States 
in a form required by the Maritime Administrator, and which is:
    (1) Owned by a United States corporation, or a foreign corporation 
in which a majority of the stock is owned and controlled by a citizen or 
citizens of the United States, whether direct or through intervening 
corporations, foreign or domestic. Where such intervening corporations 
are foreign, the ultimate majority ownership and control of the stock of 
such corporations must be vested in a citizen or citizens of the United 
States as defined in section 1201(d), Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as 
amended (46 App. U.S.C. 1281(d));
    (2) Owned by a foreign corporation which is not directly or 
beneficially owned by a citizen or citizens of the

[[Page 211]]

United States, but which vessel is under a long-term charter or other 
long-term contract covering the use of the vessel on terms deemed by the 
Maritime Administrator to subject the vessel to United States control in 
the event of an emergency. The charterer of such vessel must be either a 
citizen or citizens of the United States or a foreign corporation in 
which a majority of the stock is owned and controlled by a citizen or 
citizens of the United States, whether direct or indirect through 
intervening corporations, foreign or domestic. Where such intervening 
corporations are foreign, ultimate majority ownership and control of the 
stock of such corporations must be vested in a citizen or citizens of 
the United States, as defined in 46 App. U.S.C. 1281(d).
    (c) Any other vessel, at the sole discretion of the Maritime 
Administrator, but only while engaged in a service which has been 
determined by the Maritime Administrator to be in the interest of the 
national defense or the national economy of the United States. Vessels 
in this category are not eligible for war risk insurance interim 
binders.


<R05>
Sec. 308.2  Requirements for eligible vessels.

    (a) Restrictions--foreign-flag vessels. Interim insurance is 
available on any vessel described in Sec. 308.1 (a) and (b) of this 
part, provided application for interim insurance is submitted as 
required in subparts B, C, or D of this part 308, and the Maritime 
Administrator approves said application: Provided, That only vessels of 
Panamanian, Honduran, Bahamian, Republic of the Marshall Islands or 
Liberian registry not more than 20 years old will be considered eligible 
under Sec. 308.1 (b) of this part for interim insurance, subject at all 
times to the determination specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Special rules--foreign-flag vessels. For the purpose of 
providing interim insurance on vessels described in Sec. 308.1(b), the 
Maritime Administrator shall consider the characteristics, employment, 
and general management of the vessel. The Maritime Administrator 
formally determines that the following vessels are engaged in a service 
in the interest of the national defense or the national economy of the 
United States and qualify for an interim binder:
    (1) Vessels substantially engaged in the foreign commerce of the 
United States or which would be required in the event of war or national 
emergency;
    (2) Tankers of not less than 2,000 deadweight tons;
    (3) Dry cargo vessels, including containerships, breakbulk, and dry 
bulk vessels;
    (4) Heavy lift vessels;
    (5) Refrigerated vessels and other classes of ships in short supply 
in the United States-flag fleet;
    (6) Passenger vessels; and
    (7) Other vessels with special capabilities, as determined by the 
Maritime Administrator.
    (c) Vessel Position Reports. All vessels for which war risk 
insurance interim binders have been issued shall file a Vessel Position 
Report. The purpose of this report is to inform cognizant U.S. agencies 
of vessel arrivals, departures and at-sea locations. Failure to make 
required regular reports will cause MARAD to issue a one-time notice of 
default. If failure to report continues, MARAD shall cancel the interim 
binder for the subject vessel and any insurance attaching thereunder. 
MARAD will issue reporting instructions and formats with the binders.
    (d) Notice of change in status of vessel after binder issued. Any 
breach of the warranty prescribed hereunder as to vessels in all 
categories with respect to Department of Commerce Transportation Orders 
T-1 and T-2 (44 CFR Parts 401, 402 and 403), as well as the additional 
warranties as to vessels in categories (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this 
section, with respect to maintenance of eligibility for insurance and 
availability of the insured vessels to the U.S. Government in time of 
emergency, shall terminate the binders and any insurance attaching 
thereunder. In the event of the sale, demise charter, requisition, 
confiscation, change of flag, total loss, or any other change in status 
which, by the terms of the binder causes the binder to terminate, prompt 
notice shall be given in writing to the American War Risk Agency, 14 
Wall Street, New York, NY 10005.

[[Page 212]]

    (e) Nature of change in status of other vessels. It is the intention 
of the parties that any breach of the warranty as to operation in the 
approved service of vessels described in Sec. 308.1(c) shall terminate 
the insurance. In the event of the sale, demise charter, requisition, 
confiscation, change of flag, total loss, any other change in status or 
change in operation of the vessel in the approved service prompt notice 
shall be given to the American War Risk Agency, 14 Wall Street, New 
York, NY 10005.


<R05>
Sec. 308.3  Applications for insurance; warranties; supporting documents; payment of binder fees.

    (a) Application, binder forms. A single application for War Risk 
Insurance shall be filed on Form MA-528, specifying the types of 
insurance coverages for which the applicant is applying. A single 
application may be submitted for several vessels, if the application 
identifies each vessel to be insured and the coverage(s) required, by 
completing appendices A and B to that form. An interim binder for war 
risk insurance coverage, of the types described in subparts B, C and D 
of this part, shall be on Form MA-942, which may be obtained from the 
American War Risk Agency or from the Office of Subsidy and Insurance.
    (b) Warranties--(1) In general. Applications for war risk hull and 
protection and indemnity insurance in any eligible category of this Part 
308 shall include a warranty that, at all times during the effective 
period of the binder and any insurance attaching thereunder, the insured 
vessel, regardless of its nation of registry, will comply with 
Department of Commerce Transportation Orders T-1 and T-2 (44 CFR parts 
401, 402, and 403), or any modifications thereof so long as they remain 
in force and that the vessel will not be chartered, unless in accordance 
with the provisions of Sec. 221.11 and 221.13 of this chapter, which 
requirement is applicable to any charter in existence at the time the 
applicant applies for insurance.
    (2) Vessels described in Sec. 308.1(a). Applications for war risk 
insurance on a vessel described in Sec. 308.1(a) shall contain the 
warranty that at, and from the date of issuance of the interim binder, 
and for and during the term of any insurance attaching thereunder, such 
vessel will remain eligible within its category.
    (3) Vessels described in Sec. 308.1(b). Applications for war risk 
insurance on a vessel described in Sec. 308.1(b) shall contain the 
warranties that at all times the vessel will remain eligible within its 
applicable category; that the vessel will be made available for use by 
the United States pursuant to the signed Contract of Commitment 
submitted with the insurance applications, as required by the Maritime 
Administration; that the vessel will remain in the approved service; and

<R05>
Sec. 308.103  Insured amounts under interim binder.

    (a) Valuation. The valuation in the policy for damage to, or actual 
or constructive total loss of the vessel insured shall be a stated 
valuation (exclusive of National Defense features paid for by the 
Government) determined by the Secretary of Transportation which shall 
not exceed the amount that would be payable if the vessel had been 
requisitioned for title under section 902(a) of the Merchant Marine Act, 
1936, as amended (46 App. U.S.C. 1242(a)) at the time of the attachment 
of the insurance under said policy: Provided, however, That in the case 
of a construction subsidized vessel, for the period of insurance prior 
to requisition for title or use, the valuation so determined shall be 
reduced by such proportion as the amount of construction subsidy paid 
with respect to the vessel bears to the entire construction cost and 
capital improvements thereof (excluding the cost of national defense 
features), and for the period of insurance after requisition for use the 
valuation so determined shall not exceed the amount which would be 
payable under 46 App. U.S.C. 1242(a) in the case of requisition for 
title or use: Provided, further, that the insured shall have the right 
within sixty days after the attachment of the insurance under said 
policy, or within sixty days after determination of such valuation by 
the Secretary of Transportation, whichever is later, to reject such 
valuation, and shall pay, at the rate provided for in said policy, 
premiums upon such asserted valuation as the insured shall specify at 
the time of rejection, but such asserted valuation shall not operate to 
the prejudice of the Government in any subsequent action on the policy. 
In the event of the actual or constructive total loss of the vessel, if 
the insured has not rejected such valuation the amount of any claim 
therefor

[[Page 216]]

which is adjusted, compromised, settled, adjudged, or paid shall not 
exceed such stated amount, but if the insured has so rejected such 
valuation, the insured shall be paid as a tentative advance only, 75 per 
centum of such valuation so determined by the Secretary of 
Transportation and shall be entitled to sue the United States in a court 
having jurisdiction of such claims to recover such valuation as would be 
equal to the just compensation which such court determines would have 
been payable if the vessel had been requisitioned for title under 46 
App. U.S.C. 1242(a) at the time of the attachment of the insurance under 
said policy: Provided, however, That in the case of a construction-
subsidized vessel, the valuation determined by the court as such just 
compensation for any period of insurance prior to actual requisition for 
title or use of the vessel shall be reduced by such proportion as the 
amount of construction subsidy paid with respect to the vessel bears to 
the entire construction cost and capital improvements thereof (excluding 
the cost of national defense features), and for any period of insurance 
after actual requisition for use, the valuation determined by the court 
shall be the amount which would have been payable under 46 App. U.S.C. 
1212 in the case of requisition for title: And provided further, that in 
the event of an election by the insured to reject the stated valuation 
fixed by the Secretary of Transportation and to sue in the courts, the 
amount of the judgment will be payable without regard to any limitations 
provided by statute, although the excess of any amounts advanced on 
account of just compensation that is over the amount of the court 
judgment shall be required to be refunded by the insured. In the event 
of such court determination, premiums under the policy shall be adjusted 
on the basis of the valuation as finally determined and of the rate 
provided for in said policy. The ``stated valuation'' of the vessel 
insured refers to the vessel as described in Sec. 309.5 of this 
chapter.
    (b) Insurance risks. Insurance risks covered by the terms of the 
standard form of war risk hull insurance policy (Sec. 308.107), except 
damage to or actual or constructive total loss of the vessel insured as 
set forth in paragraph (a) of this section and loss of disbursements 
(limited to consumable and subsistence stores, slop chests, bar stock 
and bunker fuel lost as a consequence of the actual or constructive 
total loss of the vessel insured) as set forth in paragraph (c) of this 
section and identified as disbursements, shall be insured for an amount 
not in excess of the ``sum insured'' as referred to in said policy.
    (c) Disbursements. Disbursements shall be insured as authorized 
under section 1203(c), Title XII, Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended, 
(46 App. U.S.C. 1283(c)) and shall be limited to consumable and 
subsistence stores, slop chests, bar stock and bunker fuel. 
Disbursements insurance shall be optional and is insurance additional to

                             I--Introduction


<R05>
Sec. 308.500  Authority.

    The Secretary of Transportation has delegated authority to the 
Maritime Administrator to perform the functions vested in the Secretary 
by Title XII of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended, which 
authority includes the insurance set forth in this Subpart, as provided 
under section 1203(b) of the Act (46 App. U.S.C. 1283(b)). For the 
purposes of this Subpart F--War Risk Cargo Insurance, the terms 
``cargo'' and ``cargoes'' as used herein shall include loaded or empty 
containers located aboard U.S.-flag and foreign-flag vessels insured 
under Title XII, Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended. Cargo war risk 
insurance will be written under either an open policy or a facultative 
policy in accordance with the provisions of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 308.501  Cargoes on which coverage is available.

    The Maritime Administrator will be prepared to provide marine 
insurance against loss or damage by the risks of war under approved 
clauses on shipments of cargoes coming within one or more of the 
following categories:
    (a) Shipped or to be shipped on any American vessel, as defined in 
section 1201(a) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 App. 
U.S.C. 1281(a));
    (b) Shipped or to be shipped on any foreign flag vessels owned by

    (c) Owned by citizens or residents of the United States, its 
Territories or possessions;
    (d) Imported to, or exported from, the United States, its 
Territories or possessions, under contracts of sale or purchase by the 
terms of which the risk of loss by war risks or the obligation to 
provide insurance against such risks is assumed by or falls upon a 
citizen or resident of the United States, its Territories or 
possessions;
    (e) Sold or purchased by citizens or residents of the United States, 
its Territories or possessions, under contracts of sale or purchase by 
the terms of which the risk of loss by war risks or the obligation to 
provide insurance against such risks is assumed by or falls upon a 
citizen or resident of the United States, its Territories or 
possessions;
    (f) Shipped between ports in the United States, or between ports in 
the United States and its Territories and possessions, or between ports 
in such Territories or possessions; and
    (g) Shipped or to be shipped on any foreign flag vessels, whether or 
not owned by citizens of the United States, if such vessels are engaged 
in transportation in the water-borne commerce of the United States or in 
such other transportation by water or such other services as may be 
deemed by the Maritime Administrator to be in the interest of the 
national defense or the national economy of the United States, when so 
engaged.


<R05>
Sec. 308.502  Additional insurance.

    The assured may place increased value or additional insurance in 
other markets beyond the amount of insurance provided by the Maritime 
Administrator, but such insurance must be non-participating with the 
Maritime Administrator's coverage, and without benefit of salvage or 
right of contribution.


<R05>
Sec. 308.503  Rate schedules.

    Rate schedules published by the Maritime Administrator may be 
obtained from an underwriting agent. All rate schedules are subject to 
change by the Maritime Administrator at any time without notice. If no 
rate is published for a voyage on which war risk coverage is available, 
the Maritime Administrator will name a rate through an underwriting 
agent upon application.


<R05>
Sec. 308.504  Definition of territories and possessions.

    Whenever reference is made to the territories and possessions of the 
United States in this subpart or in any supplement thereto or any policy 
of insurance issued pursuant to the provisions thereof, said territories 
and possessions shall be deemed to include only the Virgin Islands of 
the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto

[[Page 221]]

Rico, American Samoa, Guam, Wake Island, Midway Islands, and the Panama 
Canal Zone.

                II--Open Policy War Risk Cargo Insurance


<R05>
Sec. 308.505  General.

    The Maritime Administrator is prepared to provide an open cargo war 
risk insurance policy covering any cargoes described in Sec. 308.501. 
The policy will be in the standard form of War Risk Open Cargo Policy, 
Form MA-300, prescribed in Sec. 308.517. All policies will be issued by 
underwriting agents appointed by the Maritime Administrator. All 
underwriting agents will be domestic insurance companies authorized to 
do a marine insurance business in a State of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 308.506  Application for an Open Cargo Policy.

    Application for an Open Cargo Policy shall be made by filing Form 
MA-301, prescribed in Sec. 308.521, with an underwriting agent of the 
Maritime Administration. The application shall state the applicant's 
name and address; the person or persons to whom loss shall be payable; 
the nature and geographic scope of the shipments to be covered under the 
policy which shall not be broader than the coverage authorized in Sec. 
308.501; the requested effective date, which shall not be earlier than 
the date of the completion of the requirements for the issuance of the 
policy; and the basis of valuation to be incorporated in the policy. An 
applicant may specify one basis of valuation for imports and another for 
exports, and he may specify different bases of valuation for different 
commodities or voyages, provided that each basis of valuation specified 
by the applicant shall define the value by the use of facts which 
existed prior to the date of the shipment and which are readily 
ascertainable by either party after the safe arrival or loss of the 
shipment.


<R05>
Sec. 308.507  Security for payment of premiums.

    Clause 21 of the policy requires the assured to maintain with the 
Maritime Administrator a collateral deposit fund or a surety bond, to 
secure the payment of the premiums, in an amount which shall at all 
times exceed the unpaid premiums on all risks which have attached under 
the policy. The minimum amount of the fund or of the surety bond shall 
be $1,000. Clause 21 also provides that, within seven (7) days from the 
time knowledge comes to the assured that the amount of the deposit or 
the surety bond is insufficient to meet the requirements of Clause 21, 
the assured shall deposit additional collateral or increase the surety 
bond in an amount not less than double the amount of such insufficiency, 
and for a sum which shall be a multiple of $500. If the assured fails to 
increase the deposit or the surety bond within the seven (7) day period, 
the policy automatically becomes void at the end of the seven (7) day 
period except as to risks which have attached prior to that date. The 
procedure for establishing a collateral deposit fund is prescribed in 
Sec. 308.509, and the procedure for posting and maintaining a surety 
bond is prescribed in Sec. 308.510. An application for the issuance of 
an open cargo policy shall be ineffective unless a collateral deposit 
fund is established and maintained, or a surety bond is posted and 
maintained, in accordance with the provisions of this section and 
Sec. Sec. 308.509 and 308.510.


<R05>
Sec. 308.508  Issuance of an Open Cargo Policy.

    (a) Time. The underwriting agent will issue an Open Cargo Policy 
within (15) days after the completion by the applicant of the 
requirements set forth in Sec. Sec. 308.506 and 308.507 unless the time 
for issuance is extended by the Maritime Administrator in writing. The 
underwriting agent may not make any Open Cargo Policy effective with 
respect to shipments attaching on a date earlier than the date when the 
application was completed, but he may make it effective on the date of 
the completion of the application or any date thereafter requested by 
the applicant.
    (b) Numbering. Each Open Cargo Policy supplied to the underwriting 
agent by the Maritime Administrator shall be numbered by the Maritime 
Administration before it is supplied to the underwriting agent. No two 
numbers shall be the same. The underwriting

[[Page 222]]

agent when issuing the policy shall add at the end of the policy number 
the agency number assigned to that underwriting agent, and where 
policies are issued by more than one office of an underwriting agent, 
the issuing office shall also be identified in the policy number. For 
example, policies issued by an office in New York will be designated by 
``NY'' and policies issued in San Francisco will be designated by ``SF'' 
prefixed to the underwriting agent's agency number.


<R05>
Sec. 308.509  Collateral deposit fund.

    (a) Requirements. An assured electing to use a cash collateral 
deposit fund pursuant to Sec. 308.507 shall comply with the provisions 
of this section and Clause 21 of the Open Cargo Policy, Form MA-300, 
prescribed in Sec. 308.517.
    (b) Cash or Government bonds. To establish a collateral deposit fund 
the applicant shall deposit with the underwriting agent a check payable 
to the order of the ``Maritime Administration, Department of 
Transportation'' for the amount of the fund, or United States Government 
bonds having a par value at the time of deposit of the amount of the 
fund, which shall be a multiple of $500 but not less than $1,000, 
together with a letter of transmittal executed by the applicant on Form 
MA-302, prescribed in Sec. 308.522. Upon receipt of the deposit, the 
underwriting agent shall assign it a serial number and transmit it to 
the Maritime Administration, Attention: Director, Office of Financial 
Management, Washington, DC 20590. It is the responsibility of the 
assured to make sure that this deposit fund is sufficient at all times 
to cover the premiums payable on all risks which have attached under the 
policy, so as to prevent the termination of the insurance under the 
provisions of Clause 21.
    (c) Overdue premiums. Pursuant to Clause 20, if the assured fails to 
pay any premium when it becomes due and payable, he thereby breaches the 
policy and it automatically ceases to insure any shipments which would 
otherwise have attached after the expiration of fifteen (15) days 
following the due date of the premium, unless within the fifteen (15) 
day period the premium has been paid and the assured has otherwise 
complied with the requirements of the policy, including the filing of 
the closing report required by Clause 19 and the payment of the 
reinstatement fee of $25 required by Clause 20. If the assured fails to 
pay the premium within the fifteen (15) day period, the Maritime 
Administrator may deduct from the assured's collateral deposit fund all 
amounts due.
    (d) Increase in amount of collateral as required by Clause 21. If 
the assured fails to deposit additional collateral in the fund within 
seven (7) days from the time knowledge comes to the assured that the 
amount of collateral is insufficient to meet the requirements of Clause 
21, the policy shall be void except as to risks which have attached 
prior to the expiration of the seven (7) day period.
    (e) Changes in amount of collateral. The assured may increase or 
decrease the amount of the collateral deposit fund by amounts of not 
less than $500 or multiples thereof, provided that the amount of the 
fund shall not be less than the amount required by Clause 21, or the 
required minimum of $1,000, whichever is greater. The effect of any 
change in the amount of the collateral deposit shall be the sole 
responsibility of the assured, and the permission granted by this 
paragraph to change the amount of collateral in the fund shall in no 
manner relieve the assured of the responsibility imposed by Clause 21.
    (f) Increase of collateral. To increase the amount of the collateral 
on deposit in the fund, the assured shall transmit to the underwriting 
agent on Form MA-302, prescribed in Sec. 308.522, a check payable to 
the order of the ``Maritime Administration, Department of 
Transportation'' or United States Government bonds having a par value at 
the time of deposit of not less than the amount of the requested 
increase. The increase shall become effective upon the date of the 
receipt of the application and check or bonds by the underwriting agent, 
as shown on Form MA-302.
    (g) Decrease of collateral. To decrease the collateral deposit fund, 
the assured shall file with the underwriting agent an application on 
Form MA-305, prescribed in Sec. 308.525. The decrease shall

[[Page 223]]

become effective upon the date of the receipt of the application by the 
underwriting agent as shown on Form MA-305.
    (h) Refund of collateral. Whenever the assured becomes entitled to a 
refund of the collateral deposit, in whole or in part, by reason of a 
request for a partial return of such collateral, or the cancellation of 
the policy and the payment in full of all premiums then or thereafter 
due, or the waiver by the Maritime Administrator of the requirements of 
maintaining the collateral deposit fund because the assured is a 
department or agency of the United States or is acting on behalf of such 
a department or agency, or the substitution of a surety bond in the 
place and stead of the collateral deposit fund, as provided in Sec. 
308.510(j), the Maritime Administrator will refund to the assured the 
amount of the collateral deposit to which the assured is entitled; 
provided, however, that the repayment of such collateral shall not be 
made by the Maritime Administrator until the assured has filed a closing 
report and paid in full all premiums with respect to all shipments which 
had attached at the time of the receipt by the underwriting agent of the 
application for the refund, Form MA-305, and a certificate executed in 
duplicate on Form MA-306, prescribed in Sec. 308.526, and, in the event 
of the substitution of a surety bond for the collateral deposit fund, 
the receipt by the underwriting agent of the surety bond properly 
executed, in accordance with Sec. 308.510.


<R05>
Sec. 308.510  Surety bond.

    (a) Requirements. An assured electing to post a surety bond pursuant 
to Sec. 308.507 shall comply with the provisions of this section and 
Clause 21 of the Open Cargo Policy, Form MA-300, prescribed in Sec. 
308.517.
    (b) Amount of bond. An applicant who wishes to post a surety bond 
shall deliver to the underwriting agent a surety bond on Form MA-308, 
prescribed in Sec. 308.528, executed by the assured as principal, and 
by the surety, in such amount as the assured determines to be necessary 
to comply with Clause 21. Such amount shall be a multiple of $500 but 
shall not be less than $1,000. Upon receipt of the surety bond, the 
underwriting agent shall assign a serial number to it and transmit it to 
the Maritime Administration, Attention: Director, Office of Financial 
Approvals, Washington, DC 20590. It shall be the responsibility of the 
assured to provide that the amount of the bond is sufficient at all 
times to cover the premium payable on all risks which have attached 
under the policy, so as to prevent the termination of the insurance 
under the provisions of Clause 21.
    (c) Surety. The sufficiency of the surety executing the bond shall 
be subject to approval by the Maritime Administrator. The underwriting 
agent may accept on behalf of the Maritime Administrator a surety bond 
executed by a surety named on the United States Treasury Department's 
approved list of sureties whose bonds are acceptable to the United 
States Treasury Department to secure obligations due the United States, 
provided the bond is within the maximum amount for which the surety is 
so authorized to write bonds as shown by the approved list.
    (d) Overdue premiums. Pursuant to Clause 20, if the assured fails to 
pay any premium when it becomes due and payable, he thereby breaches the 
policy and it automatically ceases to insure any shipments which would 
otherwise have attached after the expiration of fifteen (15) days 
following the due date of the premium, unless within the fifteen (15) 
day period the premium has been paid and the assured has otherwise 
complied with the requirements of the policy, including the filing of 
the closing report required by Clause 19 and the payment of the 
reinstatement fee of $25 required by Clause 20. If the assured fails to 
pay the premium within the fifteen (15) day period, all amounts due 
shall become a liability collectible under the surety bond and from the 
assured.
    (e) Increase in amount of bond as required by Clause 21. If the 
assured fails to increase the amount of the surety bond within seven (7) 
days from the time knowledge comes to the assured that the amount of the 
bond is insufficient to meet the requirements of Clause 21, the policy 
shall be void except as to risks which have attached prior to the 
expiration of the seven (7) day period.

[[Page 224]]

    (f) Changes in amount of bond. The assured may increase or decrease 
the amount of the surety bond by amounts of not less than $500 or 
multiples thereof, provided that the amount of the bond shall not be 
less than the amount required by Clause 21, or the required minimum of 
$1,000, whichever is greater. The effect of any change in the amount of 
the bond shall be the sole responsibility of the assured, and the 
permission granted by this paragraph to change the amount of the bond 
shall in no manner relieve the assured of the responsibility imposed by 
Clause 21.
    (g) Increase in amount of bond. To increase the surety bond the 
assured shall transmit to the underwriting agent, on Form MA-310, 
prescribed in Sec. 308.530, an endorsement duly executed by the assured 
and the surety company on Form MA-311, prescribed in Sec. 308.531. The 
increase shall become effective upon the date of the receipt of the 
endorsement by the underwriting agent as shown on Form MA-311.
    (h) Decrease in amount of bond. To decrease the amount of the bond, 
the assured shall transmit to the underwriting agent, on Form MA-310, 
prescribed in Sec. 308.530, an endorsement duly executed by the assured 
and the surety on Form MA-311, prescribed in Sec. 308.531. The decrease 
shall become effective upon the date of the receipt of the endorsement 
by the underwriting agent as shown on Form MA-311, except as to 
shipments which on that date are known or reported to the assured to be 
in transit and which have attached under the policy and upon which 
premium has not been paid in full.
    (i) Termination of bond. Whenever the assured becomes entitled to a 
termination of a surety bond by reason of the cancellation of the policy 
and the payment in full of all premiums then or thereafter due, or the 
waiver by the Maritime Administrator of the requirements of maintaining 
the surety bond by an assured which is a department or agency of the 
United States or is acting on behalf of such a department or agency, or 
the substitution of a collateral deposit fund in the place or stead of 
the surety bond, the underwriting agent shall execute a release on Form 
MA-312, prescribed in Sec. 308.532. The release shall be made effective 
as of:
    (1) The effective date of the cancellation of the policy when the 
bond is terminated for that reason, or
    (2) The date of the Maritime Administrator's directive waiving the 
requirement of a surety bond when the bond is terminated for that 
reason, or
    (3) The effective date of the establishment of a collateral deposit 
fund when the bond is terminated for that reason.
    (j) Substitution of bond for collateral deposit. An assured may 
substitute a surety bond for a collateral deposit fund by delivering to 
the underwriting agent a surety bond on Form MA-309, prescribed in Sec. 
308.529, executed by the assured as principal, and by the surety, in 
such amount as the assured determines to be necessary to comply with 
Clause 21. Such amount shall be a multiple of $500, but shall not be 
less than $1,000. The collateral deposit fund will be refunded to the 
assured after the bond has been posted, in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 308.509(h).


<R05>
Sec. 308.511  Cancellation of Open Cargo Policy.

    An assured may cancel an Open Cargo Policy by delivering to the 
underwriting agent, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the requested 
date of cancellation, an application for cancellation executed by the 
assured on Form MA-304, prescribed in Sec. 308.524, together with the 
original policy. The policy shall be cancelled as of the effective date 
requested in the application, which, unless otherwise agreed by the 
Maritime Administrator in writing, shall not be a date earlier than 
fifteen (15) days following the date of the receipt of the application 
as acknowledged by the underwriting agent on Form MA-304, with respect 
to all risks that have not attached prior to said effective date. Such 
cancellation shall not relieve the assured of the obligation to file 
closing reports with respect to all risks which attached prior to the 
effective date of the cancellation and to pay all unpaid premiums. 
Within four (4) months of the effective date of cancellation, unless 
otherwise agreed

[[Page 225]]

by the Maritime Administrator in writing, the assured must file a 
closing report in duplicate on Form MA-313, prescribed in Sec. 308.533, 
of all shipments covered by the policy for which closing reports have 
not been previously filed. The assured shall mark this closing report 
``Final Closing Report on Cancellation of Policy'', and file a 
certificate on Form MA-313-B, prescribed in Sec. 308.535, executed by 
the assured in duplicate. Thereafter, when all unpaid premiums have been 
paid, the assured will become entitled to a refund of the collateral 
deposit, or cancellation of the surety bond in accordance with 
Sec. Sec. 308.509 and 308.510. If the assured has lost or mislaid the 
original policy and is unable to produce it for cancellation, the 
assured shall execute a letter of indemnity and such other documents as 
may be required by the Maritime Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 308.512  Declaration of shipments under Open Cargo Policy.

    (a) Closing report. (1) The assured shall file with the underwriting 
agent, not later than the twenty-fifth day of each month, a closing 
report for all inward shipments and a closing report for all outward 
shipments, and pay the premium and fees, for all shipments covered 
during the preceding calendar month, as required by Clause 19. Each 
closing report shall be filed in duplicate on Form MA-313, prescribed in 
Sec. 308.533, supported by a certificate executed by the assured on 
Form MA-313-A, prescribed in Sec. 308.534. If the assured has no 
shipments to report during any calendar month, the closing report, Form 
MA-313, shall, nevertheless, be filed with one or both of the following 
statements, depending upon their applicability, noted thereon certifying 
that:
    (i) No inward shipment coming within the scope of this policy 
arrived at destination during the preceding calendar month, and that 
during the preceding calendar month no knowledge has come to the assured 
of an inward shipment covered under the terms of the policy which will 
not arrive by reason of loss, frustration or other similar cause,
    (ii) No outward shipment coming within the scope of this policy was 
made during the preceding calendar month, and
    (iii) Whenever a sea passage is made with respect to cargo covered 
under the policy by a barge or sailing vessel the assured shall note 
that fact upon the closing report, unless the Maritime Administrator 
otherwise agrees.
    (2) An assured reporting for one calendar month shall not include 
therein a report of a shipment due to be reported in the report for the 
next succeeding calendar month. Thus, the report of January closing 
shipments filed in February does not include February closings.
    (b) Inward shipments. The closing report covering inward shipments 
shall include:
    (1) All such shipments which have arrived at the port of destination 
during the preceding calendar month, and
    (2) All such shipments with respect to which inability to so arrive 
by reason of loss, frustration, or other similar causes has come to the 
knowledge of the assured during the preceding calendar month.
    (c) Outward shipments. The closing report covering outward shipments 
shall include all such shipments which attached under the policy during 
the preceding calendar month.
    (d) Definition of inward and outward shipments. A shipment will be 
classified as an inward shipment or as an outward shipment by reference 
to the geographical location of the assured with respect to the movement 
of the shipment. The address of the assured as stated in the application 
filed by him for the policy shall be deemed to be the assured's 
geographical location for the purpose of determining whether the 
shipment is inward or outward. To illustrate, if an assured has stated 
in his application that his address is in Hawaii, the assured's 
shipments of goods from the United States to Hawaii would be classified 
as inward, and his shipments from Hawaii to the United States would be 
classified as outward. Any shipments that cannot be classified as inward 
or outward under this definition shall be treated as inward shipments 
for the purposes of the declaration.

[[Page 226]]

    (e) Supplemental closing report. If an assured files a closing 
report and thereafter discovers that one or more additional shipments 
should have been included in the report, then, even though the assured 
has executed the certificate on Form MA-313-A, prescribed in Sec. 
308.534, or Form MA-313-B, prescribed in Sec. 308.535, in connection 
with the closing report, the assured must nevertheless amend the closing 
report by filing a supplemental closing report supported by an 
appropriate certificate. The supplemental closing report must be 
accompanied by a statement in writing signed by the assured giving the 
reasons for the omission of such shipments from the original closing 
report. If the Maritime Administrator finds that the failure to file the 
complete closing report was either inadvertent or unintentional or arose 
by reason of causes beyond the control of the assured, the otherwise 
automatic termination of the policy by reason of a breach of the 
warranty embodied in Clause 20 shall be avoided pursuant to the 
provisions of Clause 23.


<R05>
Sec. 308.513  Payment of premiums and fees.

    The assured shall pay the premium, when his closing report is filed, 
for all shipments shown on his closing report for the preceding month, 
at the rates prescribed by the Maritime Administrator and in effect on 
the date of the ocean bill of lading, or if an ocean bill of lading was 
not issued, on the date of the equivalent shipping document, or if no 
ocean bill of lading or equivalent shipping document was issued, or if 
such documents were undated, on the date the goods were laden on the 
overseas vessel, as required by Clause 19. All payments of premium or 
fees must be made by check or money order payable to the order of the 
``Maritime Administration, Department of Transportation.''


<R05>
Sec. 308.514  Return premium.

    No premium will be returned to the assured with respect to a 
shipment of goods that attached under the policy except where there was 
a declaration of value at variance with Clause 8, or an error in the 
application of a rate or in the computation of a premium, or the insured 
goods were short-shipped. An application for the return of a premium 
shall be made on Form MA-307, prescribed in Sec. 308.527, filed in 
duplicate with the Underwriting Agent who will transmit it to the 
Maritime Administrator for payment.


<R05>
Sec. 308.515  Payment in event of loss.

    All claims for losses shall be filed by the assured with the 
Underwriting Agent who issued the policy. Such claims must be supported 
by the customary documents required in connection with war risk 
insurance claims, together with appropriate declarations as required by 
Clause 9, and such further data as may now or hereafter be required by 
the Maritime Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 308.516  Failure to comply with Clause 21.

    (a) If the assured willfully fails to maintain a collateral deposit 
fund or a surety bond in an amount sufficient to meet the requirements 
of Clause 21, the policy becomes void from the date the fund or bond was 
first insufficient, but, if the assured's failure was inadvertent, the 
policy may be reinstated when the assured complies with Clause 21, and 
shows to the satisfaction of the Maritime Administrator that his failure 
was inadvertent and not willful. If the failure was in fact inadvertent, 
the assured shall file a declaration on Form MA-314, prescribed in Sec. 
308.536, executed in duplicate, with the Underwriting Agent within seven 
(7) days from the time knowledge comes to the assured of the 
insufficiency of the collateral deposit fund or surety bond unless the 
time for filing such declaration is extended by permission of the 
Maritime Administrator. If the space provided in the declaration, Form 
MA-314, for an explanation of the circumstances whereby the assured 
first had knowledge that the collateral was not sufficient, the assured 
shall attach to the declaration a detailed statement and include the 
same by reference in the declaration.
    (b) If any policy becomes void by reason of the failure of the 
assured to deposit additional collateral or increase the amount of its 
surety bond under

[[Page 227]]

the provisions of Clause 21, the Maritime Administrator reserves the 
right to refuse to issue another policy to such assured for a period of 
90 days.


<R05>
Sec. 308.517  Open Cargo Policy, Form MA-300.

    The standard form of War Risk Open Cargo, Form MA-300, may be 
obtained from the American War Risk Agency or MARAD.


<R05>
Sec. 308.518  Standard optional endorsement No. 1, Form MA-300-A.

    Standard Optional Endorsement No. 1, which may be obtained from the 
American War Risk Agency or MARAD, limits the amount payable for the 
loss of goods to the actual bona fide pecuniary loss to the Assured, 
exclusive of any allowance for anticipated or accrued profit arising out 
of the insured venture. An Assured may elect to have his Open Cargo

                III--Facultative War Risk Cargo Insurance


<R05>
Sec. 308.538  General.

    The Maritime Administrator is prepared to provide facultative war 
risk insurance policies covering any cargoes described in Sec. 308.501 
which are designated by an applicant prior to the attachment of risks, 
if the applicant does not have an Open Cargo Policy issued by the 
Maritime Administrator, or if he has a shipment which is not covered by 
his Open Cargo Policy. However, a person with regular shipments is urged 
to avail himself of the advantages of the automatic coverage of an Open 
Cargo Policy. The Maritime Administrator reserves the right to decline 
to quote rates or bind insurance on shipments of cargo that could be 
covered by an Open Cargo Policy unless the applicant can show to the 
satisfaction of the Maritime Administrator that the risk is not one of a 
series of similar risks forming part of a continual flow of business for 
the applicant. The policy will be in the standard form of War Risk 
Facultative Cargo Policy, Form MA-316, prescribed in Sec. 308.545. All 
policies shall be issued by Underwriting Agents appointed by the 
Maritime Administrator. All Underwriting Agents shall be domestic 
insurance companies authorized to do a marine insurance business in a 
State of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 308.539  Application.

    (a) Preliminary request. Application for a Facultative Cargo Policy 
shall be made by filing a preliminary request in writing (including 
telegram) with an Underwriting Agent of the Maritime Administration, 
setting forth the following information:
    (1) The name and address of the applicant;
    (2) The amount of insurance requested;
    (3) The commodity and quantity to be insured;
    (4) The voyage to be covered;
    (5) The name of the vessel upon which the cargo will be shipped, if 
known, the name of the steamship line, if known, and the date of 
shipment, if the applicant is submitting the request to bind war risk in 
writing; for security reasons, if the applicant is submitting the order 
to bind war risk insurance by telefax, neither the name of the vessel 
nor the name of the steamship line nor the anticipated date of sailing, 
should be mentioned. Mentioning such information in a telefax may result 
in a denial of insurance to the applicant. Any envelope transmitting a 
letter containing such information shall be marked ``confidential.''
    (b) Binder. Before the insurance can be bound, the applicant shall 
provide the Underwriting Agent with a properly prepared binder on Form 
MA-315 prescribed in Sec. 308.544. The binder must be submitted in 
duplicate, accompanied by check or Money Order payable to the order of 
the Maritime Administration, Department of Transportation'' for the full 
amount of the premium computed on the amount to be insured at the rate 
set by the Maritime Administrator. Any application for facultative cargo 
war risk insurance received by an Underwriting Agent later than 4 p.m. 
(Local War Time) shall be considered the next day's business.
    (c) Optional loss limits clause. Clause 9 of the standard form of 
facultative cargo policy, Form MA-316, prescribed in Sec. 308.545, 
limits the amount payable for loss to the fair market value at the place 
and approximate time of the attachment of risk, plus the cost of marine 
insurance, transportation and expenses incident thereto, and war risk 
insurance with respect to the lost or damaged goods, or if it is 
impossible to determine the fair market value at place and time of 
attachment of risk, the fair market value at the designated port of 
arrival on the date of the attachment of the risk, plus the cost of 
marine insurance, transportation and expenses incidental thereto, and 
war risk insurance with respect to the lost or damaged goods, or if the 
goods had been purchased prior to loading, the actual amount paid or 
payable to the seller for the goods less all discounts, plus the cost of 
marine insurance, transportation and expenses incidental thereto, and 
war risk insurance with respect to the lost or damaged goods. In lieu of 
these loss limits, the Assured by so specifying in his application, and 
the binder may have attached to the policy when issued Standard Optional

[[Page 230]]

Endorsement No. 1-A, Form MA-316, prescribed in Sec. 308.546, which 
limits the amount payable for loss to the actual bona fide pecuniary 
loss to the Assured, exclusive of any allowance for anticipated or 
accrued profits arising out of the insured venture.


<R05>
Sec. 308.540  Premiums.

    (a) Rates. Rate Schedules for war risk facultative cargo insurance 
will be published by the Maritime Administrator from time to time, and 
may be obtained from an Underwriting Agent. All Rate Schedules are 
subject to change by the Maritime Administrator without notice. If no 
rate is published for a voyage on which war risk facultative cargo 
insurance is available, the Maritime Administrator will name a rate 
through an Underwriting Agent upon application. Whenever an applicant 
for war risk facultative cargo insurance receives a definite rate 
quotation and desires to bind insurance at the quoted rate, an order to 
bind the insurance in accordance with the procedure set forth in this 
subpart should be submitted within two business days following the day 
of quotation accompanied by check or Money Order payable to the order of 
``Maritime Administration, Department of Transportation'' for the full 
amount of the premium thereon computed on the amount to be insured at 
the rate set by the Maritime Administrator, or the quotation will 
expire.
    (b) Return premium. Where goods are short-shipped, the amount of 
insurance may be reduced by an amount computed by applying to the 
original amount of insurance the proportion which the quantity of 
merchandise short-shipped (i.e., bales, barrels, tons, and other 
designations of quantity) bears to the total quantity of merchandise 
originally declared for insurance. Where more than one class of 
merchandise is insured under one policy (e.g., fuel, oil and gasoline) 
the reduced amount of insurance must be computed separately on each 
item. Where the amount of insurance is reduced, the Maritime 
Administrator will give consideration to requests for proportionate 
returns of premium. An application for the return of a premium must be 
submitted to the Underwriting Agent in quadruplicate on Form MA-317, 
prescribed in Sec. 308.547.


<R05>
Sec. 308.541  Issuance.

    (a) Binder. The Underwriting Agent is authorized to issue a 
facultative policy in Form MA-316, prescribed in Sec. 308.545, when 
there has been presented to him a properly prepared binder on Form MA-
315, prescribed in Sec. 308.544, together with the payment of the 
premium as required, and such policy shall be issued as soon as possible 
after the binder form has been presented to the Underwriting Agent. 
Prior to the issuance of the policy, the Underwriting Agent is 
authorized to accept the risk on behalf of the Maritime Administrator by 
signing the binder. The Maritime Administrator will provide each 
Underwriting Agent with a supply of facultative policies which shall not 
be valid until countersigned by the Underwriting Agent. The Underwriting 
Agent shall keep a permanent record of all such policies and the Assured 
to whom the policy is issued.
    (b) Numbering. Each Facultative Cargo Policy supplied to the 
Underwriting Agent by the Maritime Administrator shall be numbered by 
the Maritime Administration before it is supplied to the Underwriting 
Agent. No two numbers shall be the same. The Underwriting Agent when 
issuing the policy shall add at the end of the Policy number the agency 
number assigned to that Underwriting Agent, and where policies are 
issued by more than one office of an Underwriting Agent the issuing 
office shall also be identified in the policy number. For example, the 
policies issued by an office in New York will be designated ``NY'' and 
policies issued in San Francisco will be designated by ``SF'' prefixed 
to the Underwriting Agent's agency number.


<R05>
Sec. 308.542  Warranty re thirty-day shipments.

    If, after an effective binding of war risk insurance on a shipment 
of cargo, the assured believes that it will be impossible to comply with 
the warranty requiring the goods to be shipped and in transit within 
thirty days from the effective date of binding, such an assured may 
apply to the Maritime Administrator, through the Underwriting

[[Page 231]]

Agent, to modify the warranty. If the Maritime Administrator is 
satisfied that an extension of time within which the goods are warranted 
to be shipped and in transit should be granted, he will do so, but 
additional premium may be charged in the discretion of the Maritime 
Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 308.543  Cancellation.

    Facultative war risk insurance is not subject to cancellation by the 
Assured unless the goods are not shipped within thirty days following

on January 1 and ending on June 30, or a six-month period commencing on 
July 1 and ending on December 31 of each calendar year; Provided, 
however, That if there is a substantial change in market values during 
the effective period of a state valuation, the Maritime Administration 
reserves the right to revise such valuations at any time during such 
period.


<R05>
Sec. 309.2  Definitions.

    (a) Ship Valuation Committee means the Ship Valuation Committee 
referred to in Maritime Administrative Order 440-3.
    (b) The date a vessel is built is the date the vessel is delivered 
by the shipbuilder.
    (c) The deadweight tonnage of a vessel means her deadweight capacity 
established in accordance with normal Summer Freeboard as assigned 
pursuant to the International Load Line Convention, 1966, and shall be 
her capacity (in tons of 2,240 pounds) for cargo, fuel, fresh water, 
spare parts, and stores, but exclusive of permanent ballast.
    (d) The speed of a vessel means the speed determined in accordance 
with the formulae provided in part 246 of this chapter.
    (e) A passenger vessel is a vessel which carries more than twelve 
passengers.


<R05>
Sec. 309.3  Stated valuation.

    A stated valuation represents just compensation for the vessel to 
which it applies computed by the Ship Valuation Committee in accordance 
with

[[Page 233]]

sections 902(a) and 1209(a)(2) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as 
amended (46 U.S.C. 1242(a), 1289(a)(2)). The stated valuation of a 
vessel does not include vessel stores and supplies, which consist of (a) 
consumable stores, (b) subsistence stores, (c) slop chest, (d) bar 
stock, and (e) fuel, as defined in Maritime Administration Inventory 
Book Forms MA-4736, A through K, which will be valued separately.


<R05>
Sec. 309.4  Maximum amount insured.

    A stated valuation is the maximum amount for which the Maritime 
Administration will provide war risk hull insurance for damage to or 
actual or constructive total loss of the vessel to which such valuation 
applies and for which claims for damage to or actual or constructive 
total loss of such insured vessel may be adjusted, compromised, settled, 
adjudged, or paid by the Maritime Administration with respect to 
insurance attaching during the effective period of such valuation under 
the standard forms of war risk hull insurance interim binder or policy 
prescribed by Sec. Sec. 308.106 and 308.107 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 309.5  Condition of vessel.

    If the true condition of a vessel is not known, the Ship Valuation 
Committee, in determining the stated valuation of the vessel, may assume 
that it is in a condition that would entitle it to the highest 
classification of the American Bureau of Shipping, or the equivalent if 
the vessel is a foreign-flag vessel, with all required certificates, 
including but not limited to, marine inspection certificates of the 
United States Coast Guard, the United States Public Health Service, and 
the Federal Communications Commission, with all outstanding requirements 
and recommendations necessary for retention of class accomplished, 
without regard to any grace period; and, so far as due diligence can 
make her so, the vessel is tight, staunch, strong, and well and 
sufficiently tacked, appareled, furnished, and equipped, and in every 
respect seaworthy and in good running condition and repair, with clean 
swept holds and in all respects fit for service. The stated valuation of 
a vessel in substandard condition is subject to downward adjustment as 
provided in Sec. 309.6(a).


<R05>

there shall be subtracted from the stated valuation of such vessel an 
amount estimated by the Maritime Administration as the cost of putting 
the vessel in the condition assumed by the Committee when determining 
its stated valuation.
    (b) Special equipment. If the depreciated reproduction cost less 
construction subsidy, if any, of any special equipment of material 
utility in the handling of cargo or utilization of a vessel, not 
otherwise taken into account in determining the stated valuation of such 
vessel, is in excess of $50,000, an amount estimated by the Maritime 
Administration as the fair and reasonable value of such equipment shall 
be added to the stated valuation of such vessel.
    (c) Government installations. A stated valuation determined pursuant 
to this part shall not include any allowance for any special 
installations or equipment to the extent that their cost was borne by 
the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 309.7  Modifications.

    The Maritime Administration reserves the right to exempt any vessel 
from the scope of this part, or to amend, modify, or terminate the 
provisions hereof.


<R05>

Sec. 309.201  Purpose.

    It is the purpose of Sec. Sec. 309.201 through 309.204 to prescribe 
the method for determining the values of stores and supplies on board a 
vessel when lost, for which claims for loss will be paid, and to 
prescribe the procedure for payment of claims for such loss, when stores 
and supplies are covered under a disbursements clause of a War Risk Hull 
Insurance Binder or a War Risk Hull Insurance Policy issued by the 
United States on forms prescribed by Sec. Sec. 308.106 and 308.107 of 
this chapter, or when stores and supplies are covered by a War Risk 
Disbursements Policy issued by the United States pursuant to section 
1203(c) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 U.S.C. 
1283(c)). The vessel values established by Sec. Sec. 309.1 through 
309.8 (General Order 82) do not include any allowance for the loss of 
stores and supplies, as distinguished from equipment and spare parts 
which are included in such vessel values.


<R05>
Sec. 309.202  Definitions.

    Stores and supplies are those articles and commodities used and 
consumed in the day-to-day operation of a vessel by the operation and 
maintenance of machinery and equipment; the maintenance of clean and 
sanitary conditions; the feeding of passengers, officers, and crew; and 
stocked for the use and convenience of passengers, officers, and crew. 
Vessel stores and supplies include (a) consumable stores, (b) 
subsistence stores, (c) slop chest, (d) bar stock, and (e) fuel, as 
defined in Maritime Administration Inventory Books, Forms MA-4736, A 
through K.


<R05>
Sec. 309.203  Value at time of loss.

    The value of unused stores and supplies on board a vessel at the 
time of loss, and for which claims for loss will be paid equals:
    (a) The value of such stores and supplies on board at the completion 
of the previous voyage, plus
    (b) The value of stores and supplies purchased and placed on board 
the vessel before the commencement of the voyage during which the loss 
occurred, plus
    (c) The value of stores and supplies purchased and placed on board 
the vessel after the commencement of such voyage, less

[[Page 235]]

    (d) That portion of the sum of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this 
section which was sold, transferred, used or consumed to, but not 
including, the date of the loss.


<R05>
Sec. 309.204  Proof of loss.

    Claims for reimbursement for total loss of stores and supplies may 
be submitted by the owner to the Chief, Division of Insurance, Maritime 
Administration, Washington, DC 20590, based on one of two alternative 
methods of proof, as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. 
Owners may use either method for each category of stores and supplies.
    (a) Formula. In cases where the owner and the Chief, Division of 
Insurance, Maritime Administration, have agreed, in advance of the loss, 
upon amounts representing, or the method for determining, the average 
daily consumption costs of stores and supplies for the owner's vessel, 
claims for total loss of such stores and supplies may be submitted by 
the owner on Affidavit in Proof of Claim for the loss of stores and 
supplies, Exhibit A. In such cases, the value of the consumable stores 
at time of loss is determined as follows:
    (1) The value of consumable stores on board at the time the vessel 
was ready to sail, determined by multiplying the number of days for 
which the vessel is stored by the average daily consumption cost in 
dollars, plus
    (2) The cost of consumable stores, if any, purchased in foreign 
ports for the homeward voyage, less
    (3) The average daily consumption cost times the number of days from 
the date the vessel was ready to sail to, but not including, the date of 
loss, plus the actual amount of consumable stores transferred or sold. 
The values of slop chest stores, bar stock and fuel, at the time of loss 
are determined in the same manner by using the applicable daily 
consumption costs for such stores. The value of subsistence stores at 
the time of loss is determined as follows:
    (i) The value of subsistence stores on board at the time the vessel 
was ready to sail, determined by multiplying the agreed cost for one man 
per day by the number of crew signed on and the number of passengers, if 
any, and multiplying that product by the number of days for which the 
vessel is stored, plus
    (ii) The cost of subsistence stores, if any, purchased in foreign 
ports for the homeward voyage, less
    (iii) The number of crew signed on and the average number of 
passengers, if any, times the agreed cost of one man per day times the 
number of days from the date the vessel was ready to sail to, but not 
including, the date of loss, plus the actual amount of subsistence 
stores transferred or sold.
    (b) Verified costs. In cases where the owner and the Chief, Division 
of Insurance, Maritime Administration, have not agreed in advance of the 
loss upon amounts representing, or the method for determining, the 
average daily consumption costs of Stores and Supplies for the owner's 
vessel, claims for total loss of such Stores and Supplies must be 
submitted by the owner on Affidavit in Proof of Claims for the Loss of 
Stores and Supplies, Exhibit B. In such cases, the value of the 
consumable stores will be determined as follows:
    (1) The value of consumable stores on board the vessel at the time 
the vessel was ready to sail, determined by certified inventories of the 
owner of amounts on board the vessel at the termination of the preceding 
voyage or date of last inventory, less actual consumption to date of 
sailing, plus a certified statement by the owner of actual additional 
purchases made from date of termination of the preceding voyage or date 
or last inventory to date vessel was lost, subject to audit by the 
Maritime Administration, less
    (2) The average daily consumption cost determined by dividing the 
amount determined as in paragraph (b)(1) of this section by the number 
of days for which the vessel was stored, times the number of days from 
the date the vessel was ready to sail to, but not including, the date of 
loss, plus actual amount of consumable stores transferred or sold.
    The values of subsistence stores, slop chest, bar stock, and fuel, 
at the time of loss are determined in the same manner, supported by 
certified inventories of the owner and invoices.

Sec. 310.7  Federal student subsistence allowances and student incentive payments.

    (a) Subsistence allowances--(1) Selection and allocation. In 
accordance with the Administration's established freshmen subsidy 
allocation for each School, the school shall select the individuals in 
its new entering class who will be enrolled in the United States 
Maritime Service as cadets and start to receive Federal student 
subsistence payments for uniforms, textbooks and subsistence as provided 
in the 1958 Act. The freshman subsidy allocations for each school are as 
follows: California Maritime Academy 99; Maine Maritime Academy 135; 
Massachusetts Maritime Academy 69; State University of New York Maritime 
College 200; Great Lakes Maritime Academy 45; and the

[[Page 247]]

Texas Maritime College 32. Each student who meets the entrance 
requirements in Sec. 310.6(a) and applies for enrollment in the United 
States Maritime Service shall be entitled to consideration for a student 
subsistence payment at a rate and under the conditions in the 1958 Act. 
The list identifying the selected students shall be forwarded to the 
Administration on or before October 31, 1981. The Federal student 
subsistence payments will be paid to the School while a cadet is in 
attendance but not in excess of four (4) academic years for any one 
student.
    (2) Resignation or disenrollment. There will be no substitution for 
students removed or dropped from the list of those originally receiving 
Federal student subsistence payments. Subsidized students who resign or 
are disenrolled from a school shall not, on subsequent reenrollment, be 
in a position to reclaim their subsidy status.
    (3) Selection criteria; rate of payment. The selection of the 
students to receive such payments shall be made by the School in 
accordance with criteria established by the School, with the prior 
approval of the Administration. The rate of Federal student subsistence 
payments will be determined by the Administration according to the 1958 
Act or the Act.
    (4) ROTC enrollment. Subsidized cadets who make a commitment to an 
Armed Force Reserve Officer Training Corps will be removed from the 
Administration subsidy rolls effective on the date they receive funds 
from a U.S. military service. Should they leave the program for any 
reason they may not reclaim the Administration subsidy as a cadet.
    (5) Payment procedure. The Administration shall make the Federal 
student subsistence payments no more frequently than monthly, directly 
to the School upon the presentation of a statement containing the names 
of each Cadet selected by the Academy (within the quotas furnished 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section) to be enrolled in the 
Maritime Service and to receive the Federal student subsistence 
payments. For newly selected Cadets in a new entering class, the 
statement supporting the first voucher for payment shall certify that 
the cadets have met the entrance requirements in Sec. 310.6.
    (6) Certification procedure. All vouchers submitted for payment 
shall contain a certification by the Superintendent that the payment 
will be used to assist in defraying the cost of the uniforms, textbooks, 
and subsistence of each Cadet on the basis of the amount to which the 
cadet is entitled, as reflected by the attached Daily Attendance Report. 
No cadet shall receive a federal student subsistence payment for any 
time during which he or she is absent without leave or for absence due 
to a condition not in line of duty, or when determined by the School to 
be not in good standing.
    (7) Insufficient appropriations. If it appears that the amount 
appropriated by Congress under the Act shall not be sufficient to make 
payments at the maximum rate, not in excess of $1,200 per academic year 
per cadet, the Maritime Administrator, after consultation with the 
Schools, may determine the exact rate to be paid at each School for the 
remainder of the fiscal year.
    (b) Federal student incentive payments--(1) General provisions. In 
accordance with the Administration's established subsidy quotas for 
classes entering after April 1982, each school shall identify to the 
Administration, no later than February 1 annually, those students who 
have been selected to receive the student incentive payment authorized 
by the Act. The students so identified must meet the requirements of 
Sec. 310.6(b). The Administration shall provide the school with the 
necessary service obligation contracts. The contracts will be signed by 
the designated students and returned by the School to the Supervisor and 
shall become effective when signed by the Supervisor or his or her 
designee. A copy shall be returned to the School for transmittal to the 
student. Payments will be issued to midshipmen in amounts equaling $4000 
for each academic year of attendance whom execute the service obligation 
contracts providing for such payment amount. Payments shall commence to 
accrue on the day each such midshipman begins his or her first term of 
work at the School. Such payments shall be made quarterly to the 
midshipman until the completion of his or

[[Page 248]]

her course of instruction but in no event for more than four (4) 
academic years. The School shall submit a quarterly certified Daily 
Attendance Report listing the names of all designated midshipmen who are 
entitled to student incentive payments. Midshipmen who do not take all 
necessary steps to maintain their midshipman status, who lose their 
midshipman status due to action by the U.S. Navy, or who make the 
commitment identified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section will have 
their student incentive payment terminated.
    (2) Temporary reallocation of Federal student incentive payments. If 
a School does not have a sufficient number of eligible freshmen to 
utilize all of its alloted payments, then the unused subsidies may be 
reallocated on a need basis to academies with eligible students. In the 
next academic year, each School's subsidy quota for entering students 
will revert to its original level.
    (3) Form of the service obligation contract. The service obligation 
contract shall obligate the midshipman to--
    (i) Use the student incentive payment to defray the cost of 
uniforms, books and subsistence;
    (ii) Complete the course of instruction at the School;
    (iii) Take the examination for a license as an officer in the 
merchant marine of the United States on or before the date of graduation 
from a School and fulfill the requirements for such license not later 
than three (3) months after such graduation;
    (iv) Maintain a valid license as an officer in the merchant marine 
of the United States for at least six (6) years following the date of 
graduation from a School, accompanied by the appropriate national and 
international endorsements and certification required by the United 
States Coast Guard for service aboard vessels on domestic and 
international voyages (``appropriate'' means the same endorsements and 
certifications held at the date of graduation, or the equivalent);
    (v) Apply for an appointment as, and accept if tendered, and serve 
as a commissioned officer in the United States Naval Reserve (including 
the Merchant Marine Reserve, United States Naval Reserve), the United 
States Coast Guard Reserve, or any other Reserve unit of an armed force 
of the United States for at least six (6) years following the date of 
graduation from a school; and
    (vi) Serve in the foreign or domestic commerce or both, and the 
national defense of the United States for at least three (3) years 
following graduation from a School--
    (A) As a merchant marine officer serving on vessels documented under 
the laws of the United States or on vessels owned and operated by the 
United States or by any State or Territory of the United States;
    (B) As an employee in a United States maritime-related industry, 
profession, or marine science (as determined by the Maritime 
Administrator), if the Maritime Administrator determines that service 
under paragraph (b)(3)(vi)(A) of this section is not available to such 
individual;
    (C) As a commissioned officer on active duty in an armed force of 
the United States or in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration or in other maritime-related employment with the Federal 
Government which serves the national security interests of the United 
States, as determined to be satisfactory by the Maritime Administrator; 
or
    (D) By combining the services specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(vi)(A), 
(b)(3)(vi)(B) and (b)(3)(vi)(C) of this section; and
    (E) Such employment in the Federal Government must be both 
significantly maritime-related and serve the national security interests 
of the United States. ``Significantly'' is equated to a material or 
essential portion of an individual's responsibilities. It does not mean 
a ``majority'' of such individual's responsibilities, but means more 
than just an incidental part.
    (4) Marine-related employment. (i) graduates who intend to claim 
employment in a United States maritime-related industry, profession of 
marine science as meeting all or part of the service obligation under 
paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section, shall submit evidence to the 
Supervisor that they have conscientiously sought employment as a 
merchant marine officer, and

[[Page 249]]

that such employment is not available. Such evidence and other 
information available, shall be considered in any finding. In view of 
current and projected employment opportunities, afloat, the Maritime 
Administrator will grant the shoreside employment option infrequently 
and only on the basis of comprehensive evidence.
    (ii) The Maritime Administrator may consider the positions of 
operational, management and administrative responsibility in the 
following marine-related categories under the provisions of paragraph 
(b)(3)(vi) of this section: Civilian employment in Federal and State 
agencies related to maritime affairs, steamship companies, stevedoring 
companies, vessel chartering and operations, cargo terminal operations, 
naval architecture, shipbuilding and repair, municipal and state port 
authorities, port development, marine engineering, and tug and barge 
companies. The above list is not all inclusive and is only intended to 
serve as a general guide.
    (5) Afloat employment year. For purposes of the service obligation, 
a satisfactory year of afloat employment shall be the lesser of--
    (i) 150 days; or
    (ii) The number of days employed afloat that is at least equal to 
the median number of days of seafaring employment under articles 
achieved by deck or engine officers in the most recent calendar year for 
which statistics are available.
    (6) Reporting requirement. (i) The schools must promptly submit 
copies of all resignation forms (containing the name, reason, address 
and telephone number) of juniors and seniors to the Supervisor, to be 
used for monitoring and enforcement purposes. Each graduate must submit 
an annual Service Obligation Compliance Report form (MA-930) to the 
Maritime Administration (Supervisor) between January 1 and March 1 
following his or her graduation. After the initial report is submitted, 
each graduate must continue to submit annual reports during the same 
time frame between January 1 and March 1 for six (6) consecutive years 
thereafter, or until all components of the service obligation are 
fulfilled, whichever is latest. Each graduate will file a minimum of 
seven (7) reports in order to give information on all six (6) years of 
the armed forces reserve and merchant marine officer license service 
obligations. Graduates are encouraged to submit their Service Obligation 
Compliance Report forms (MA-930) to MARAD using the web-based Internet 
system at https://mscs.marad.dot.gov. Reports may also be mailed to: 
Compliance Specialist, Office of Policy and Plans, Maritime 
Administration, Department of Transportation, 400 7th St., SW., Room 
7123, Washington, DC 20590. In case a deferment has been granted to 
engage in a maritime-related graduate course of study, annual reports 
must be submitted during the extension period resulting from such 
deferments. Examples of the reporting requirements are as follows.

    Example 1: Midshipman graduates on June 30, 2004. His or her first 
reporting date is between January 1, 2005 and March 1, 2005 and each 
following period between January 1 and March 1 for six (6) consecutive 
years thereafter (or until all components of the service obligation are 
fulfilled, whichever is latest) for a minimum of seven (7) reports.
    Example 2: Midshipman has a deferred graduation on November 30, 
2004. His or her first reporting date is between January 1, 2005 and 
March 1, 2005 and each following period between January 1 and March 1 
for six (6) consecutive years thereafter (or until all components of the 
service obligation are fulfilled, whichever is latest) for a minimum of 
seven (7) reports.
    Example 3: Midshipman has a deferment following graduation on June 
30, 2004, to attend graduate school for two (2) years. His or her first 
reporting date is between January 1, 2005 and March 1, 2005 and during 
the same time frame between January 1 and March 1 for two (2) years 
during graduate school, and then during the same January 1 to March 1 
time frame for six (6) consecutive years thereafter (or until all 
components of the service obligation are fulfilled, whichever is latest) 
for a total of nine (9) reports.

    (ii) The Maritime Administration will provide reporting forms. 
However, non-receipt of such forms will not exempt a graduate from 
submitting information as required by this paragraph. The reporting form 
has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (2133-0509).

[[Page 250]]

    (7) Breach of contract--(i) Breach before graduation. (A) If the 
Maritime Administrator determines that any individual who has accepted 
Federal student incentive payments for a minimum of two (2) academic 
years has failed to fulfill any part of the contract set forth in Sec. 
310.7(b)(3), such individual may be ordered by the Secretary of Defense 
to active duty in one of the Armed Forces of the United States to serve 
a period of time not to exceed two (2) years. In cases of hardship as 
determined by the Maritime Administrator, the Maritime Administrator may 
waive this provision in whole or in part.
    (B) If the Secretary of Defense is unable or unwilling to order an 
individual to active duty under paragraph (b)(7)(i)(A) of this section, 
or if the Maritime Administrator determines that reimbursement of the 
cost of education provided would better serve the interests of the 
United States, the Maritime Administrator may recover from the 
individual the amount of student incentive payments, plus interest and 
attorney's fees.
    (C) The Maritime Administrator is authorized to reduce the amount to 
be recovered under paragraph (b)(7)(i)(B) of this section from such 
individual to reflect partial performance of service obligations and 
such other factors as the Maritime Administrator determines merit such 
reduction.
    (D) For purposes of paragraph (b)(7)(i)(A) of this section, an 
``academic year'' is defined as the completion by a student of the 
required number of semesters, trimesters, or quarters, as applicable, 
whether at school or at sea, which comprise a complete course of study 
for an academic year. Thus, liability under paragraph (b)(7)(i)(A) of 
this section begins for students at the beginning of their third (3rd) 
academic year, whether at school or at sea.
    (ii) Breach after graduation. (A) If the Maritime Administrator 
determines that an individual has failed to fulfill any part of the 
service obligations (described in Sec. 310.7(b)(3)), such individual 
may be ordered to active duty to serve a period of time not less than 
two (2) years and not more than the unexpired portion of the service 
obligation contract relating to service in the foreign or domestic 
commerce or the national defense, as determined by the Maritime 
Administrator. The Maritime Administrator, in consultation with the 
Secretary of Defense, shall determine in which service the individual 
shall be ordered to active duty to serve such period of time. In cases 
of hardship, as determined by the Maritime Administrator, the Maritime 
Administrator may waive this provision in whole or in part.
    (B) If the Secretary of Defense is unable or unwilling to order an 
individual to active duty under paragraph (b)(7)(ii)(A) of this section 
or if the Maritime Administrator determines that reimbursement of the 
Cost of Education Provided would better serve the interests of the 
United States, the Maritime Administrator may recover from the 
individual the Cost of Education Provided, plus interest and attorney's 
fees.
    (C) The Maritime Administrator may reduce the amount to be recovered 
under paragraph (b)(7)(ii)(B) of this section from such individual to 
reflect partial performance of service obligations and such other 
factors as the Maritime Administrator determines merit such reduction.
    (8) Waivers. Waivers may be granted in cases where there would be 
undue hardship or impossibility of performance of the provisions of the 
contract due to accident, illness or other justifiable reason. 
Applications for waiver will be submitted to the Supervisor.
    (9) Deferments. In exceptional cases the Administration may grant a 
deferment of all or part of the service commitment under paragraphs 
(b)(3)(ii) through (vi) of this section for a period not to exceed two 
years, only for graduates considered to have superior academic and 
conduct records while at the school, for the purpose of their entry 
after graduation into a marine-or maritime-related graduate course of 
study at an accredited graduate school. However, the Secretary of the 
department in which the United States Coast Guard is operating and the 
Secretary of Commerce, with respect to the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, which has jurisdiction over such service 
shall approve any

[[Page 251]]

deferment of service as a commissioned officer. Applications for such 
deferment shall be made through the Superintendent of Midshipman's 
school, who shall forward each application together with the 
Superintendent's recommendation for approval or disapproval and an 
evaluation of the applicant's academic and conduct records, to the 
Supervisor for appropriate action.
    (10) Determination of compliance with service obligation contract; 
deferment; waiver; and appeal procedures. (i) An official of the 
Administration designated by the Supervisor shall:
    (A) Render determinations of whether a student or graduate has 
breached his or her service agreement;
    (B) Grant or deny a deferment of the service obligation under 
paragraph (b)(9) of this section, except obligations otherwise a part of 
the graduate Reserve officer status;
    (C) Grant or deny a waiver of the requirements of the service 
agreement in hardship cases.
    (ii)(A) If a student or graduate disagrees with the decision of the 
designated official, the student or graduate may appeal that decision to 
the Maritime Administrator. The appeal must set forth all the legal and 
factual grounds on which the student or graduate bases the appeal. Any 
grounds not set forth in the appeal are waived.
    (B) Appeals must be filed with the Maritime Administrator within 30 
calendar days of the date of receipt by such student or graduate of the 
written decision of the designated official. Appeals must be filed at 
the Office of the Secretary, Maritime Administration, Room 7210, 400 7th 
St., SW., Washington, DC 20590. Each decision will include a notice of 
appeal rights.
    (C) A decision is deemed to be received by a student or graduate 
five (5) working days after the date it is mailed by first class mail, 
postage prepaid, to the address for such student or graduate listed with 
the Office of Policy and Plans. It is the responsibility of such student 
or graduate to ensure that their current mailing address is on file with 
the Office of Policy and Plans, 400 7th St., SW., Washington, DC 20590.
    (D) If the appeal is sent by conventional mail (through the United 
States Postal Service), the date of filing is determined by the postmark 
date. If no legible postmark date appears on the mailing, the appeal is 
deemed to be filed five (5) working days before the date of its receipt 
in the Office of the Secretary. If delivered by other than the United 
States Postal Service, an appeal is filed with the Maritime 
Administrator on the date it is physically delivered to the Office of 
the Secretary at the address referenced in paragraph (b)(10)(ii)(B) of 
this section. The date of filing by commercial delivery (not United 
States Postal Service) is the date it is received at the address for the 
Office of the Secretary set forth in paragraph (b)(10)(ii)(B) of this 
section. Appeals may not be submitted by facsimile or by electronic 
mail. Requests for extension of the time to file an appeal may be 
submitted by facsimile or electronic mail to the Office of the 
Secretary. Requests for extension of time do not stop or toll the 
running of the time for filing an appeal. Appeals may only be filed 
after the deadline if the Maritime Administrator or his designee, in 
their sole discretion, grants an extension.
    (E) In computing the number of days, the first day counted is the 
day after the event from which the time period begins to run. If the 
date that ordinarily would be the last day for filing falls on a 
Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the filing period will include the 
first workday after that date.

    Example to paragraph (b)(10)(ii)(E): If a graduate receives a 
decision on July 1, the 30-day period for filing an appeal starts to run 
on July 2. The appeal would ordinarily be timely only if postmarked on 
or physically delivered by July 31. If July 31 is a Saturday, however, 
the last day for obtaining a postmark by mailing or physical delivery 
would be Monday, August 2.

    (iii) The Maritime Administrator will issue a written decision for 
each timely appeal. This decision constitutes final agency action.
    (iv) If a student or graduate fails to appeal within the time set 
forth in paragraph (b)(10)(ii) of this section, the decision of the 
designated official will be final and constitute final agency action.

[[Page 252]]

    (11) Remedies. To aid in the recovery of the cost of education under 
this section, the Maritime Administrator may request the Attorney 
General to begin court proceedings, and the Maritime Administrator may 
make use of the Federal debt collection procedure in chapter 176 of 
title 28, United States Code, or other applicable administrative 
remedies.

if they continue to meet all requirements for graduation in this part, 
including age requirements.

States except: (1) Nominees from foreign nations; (2) nominees from the 
Northern Mariana Islands; (3) designees from the Trust Territory of the 
Pacific Islands; and (4) nominees from American Samoa, who may be

    (b) Age. On July 1 of the year of admission to the Academy, a 
candidate shall be not less than seventeen (17) years of age and shall 
not have passed his or her twenty-fifth (25) birthday.
    (c) Character. A candidate shall be of good moral character. The 
Administrator may reject the nomination of any candidate whose character 
is incompatible with the Academy's standards. No person who has been 
dismissed or compelled to resign from the U.S. Military Academy, the 
U.S. Naval Academy, the U.S. Air Force Academy, the U.S. Coast Guard 
Academy, the Academy or a State maritime academy for improper conduct

secondary school, or equivalent, and shall present at least 15 units of 
credit for subjects acceptable to the Academy, comprised of:
    (i) 7 required units, as follows:
    (A) 3 units of Mathematics (from algebra, geometry and 
trigonometry);
    (B) 3 units of English; and
    (C) 1 unit of Physics or Chemistry.
    (ii) 8 other units, preferably chosen from the following fields:

[[Page 257]]

    (A) Additional mathematics and science;
    (B) Foreign language;
    (C) Economics; and,
    (D) Social science.
    (2) Evidence of academic work. Before approval of an application, 
each applicant shall submit evidence showing completion of high school 
education, or showing that such education will be completed no later 
than June 30 of the year in which admission is sought.
    (b) Scholastic examinations--(1) Required entrance examinations. 
Applicants shall qualify in either the College Board's Scholastic 
Aptitude Tests (SAT) or the American College Testing Program (ACT) 
examinations, administered nationally on scheduled dates at convenient 
testing centers. A candidate electing to use the College Board shall 
take both the mathematics and the verbal section of the SAT. A candidate 
electing to use the ACT, shall take all the tests, namely, English, 
Mathematics, Social Sciences and Natural Sciences. Minimum qualifying 
scores on the entrance examinations will be determined by the 
Superintendent of the Academy for each entering class prior to any 
offers of appointment for the particular class. Any score below the 
minimum on any one section of an examination shall make the nominee 
ineligible for admission. All examination costs shall be borne by the 
applicant. Nominees shall take all the required examinations by the 
February testing date in the year for which they seek appointment, 
unless the Academy's Admissions Office grants special authorization to 
take later examinations.
    (2) Forwarding test results. Candidates shall be responsible for 
requesting the testing services to submit their scores directly to the 
Academy.
    (3) Test information. Information on the entrance examinations may 
be obtained from--

The candidate's high school guidance office; or,
College Board, P.O. Box 592, Princeton, N.J. 08540; or,
College Board, P.O. Box 1025, Berkeley, CA. 94701; or,
American College Testing Program, P.O. Box 168, Iowa City, IA 52240.

    (c) Prior Scholastic Record. Applicants shall demonstrate scholastic 
achievement by having attained a relatively high standing in relation to 
their fellow students and by having shown proficiency in mathematics and 
science courses. With respect to applicants who completed high school at 
least one year before applying for admission to the Academy, 
consideration will be given to satisfactory college level study or any 
special study undertaken to strengthen their academic backgrounds, 
particularly in respect to determining whether such supplementary 
academic activity offsets any deficiency in high school scholastic 
records.
    (d) Waivers. No waivers of scholastic requirements will be granted.


<R05>
Sec. 310.56  Physical requirements.

    (a) Physical standards. (1) A candidate shall meet the physical 
requirements prescribed by the Department of the Navy for appointment as 
Midshipman, USNR (including the Merchant Marine Reserve, USNR) and the 
requirements prescribed by the U.S. Coast Guard for original licensing 
as a third mate and third assistant engineer. All candidates shall have 
color perception and refractive error within the limits prescribed by 
the Department of the Navy or by the U.S. Coast Guard, whichever are 
higher.
    (2) The requirement to meet these standards is a continuing one and 
shall apply through graduation from the Academy. Failure to meet the 
standards while attending the Academy is grounds for, and may lead to 
disenrollment. Individuals who have completed at least two years of 
study and, as a result of an accident, illness or other cause (during 
official duty), fail to meet this requirement may be permitted to remain 
at the Academy at the discretion of, and under conditions set by, the 
Administrator. Those individuals permitted to remain through graduation 
will agree to fulfill aspects of the service obligation which they are 
capable of, as deemed appropriate by the Administrator.
    (b) Qualifying physical examinations. All candidates for the Academy 
shall have a physical and dental examination conducted by a service 
academy

[[Page 258]]

examining facility designated by the Service Academies Central Medical 
Review Board. The required physical examination shall occur within 1 
year preceding the date of admission to the Academy. Although there is 
no charge for such examination, all expenses (including travel, meals 
and hotel accommodations) incurred in obtaining such examination shall 
be borne by the applicant. Candidates may be subject to reexamination 
upon reporting to the Academy and at any time while attending the 
Academy.
    (c) Physical reexamination. A candidate who is rejected for failure 
to meet the physical requirements may request either a reevaluation of 
the examination results or a reexamination. A midshipman failing to meet 
the physical requirements while attending the Academy is entitled to 
make the same request.
    (d) Waivers. Some medical requirements may be waived for enrolled 
students and applicants to the USMMA who require such a medical waiver 
to qualify for admission and/or retention. Since commissioning in the 
United States Navy, or any other branch of the Armed Forces, is a 
requirement for graduation, no waivers will be granted for medical 
conditions which would prevent commissioning in at least a restricted 
status in the U.S. Navy Reserve. Individuals interested in waiver 
consideration may request a waiver by writing to the Superintendent, 
USMMA. The granting of medical waivers will be based on U.S. Navy 
guidelines and regulations for waiver consideration for admission to the 
U.S. Naval Academy and the physical requirements consistent with 
commissioning as a reserve officer in the U.S. Navy in a restricted line 
program. Individuals requesting medical waivers must be able to meet all 
other admission requirements, including the physical examination 
requirement for an original U.S. Coast Guard merchant marine license as 
a third mate and/or third assistant engineer. The decision of the 
Superintendent on any requested waiver is administratively final.

Sec. 310.57  Application and selection of midshipmen.

    (a) Application. All candidates shall submit an application for 
admission to the Academy's Admissions Office. Prospective candidates 
also should submit an application, but are not considered official 
candidates until their nominations are received. Candidates shall submit 
with their applications an official transcript and personality record 
from the candidate's high school and, if applicable, such records from 
any school attended after high school graduation. Application forms are 
available upon request by writing to the Admissions Office at the 
Academy. MARAD will accept electronic options (such as facsimile and 
Internet) for transmission of only Part I of required information to

    (b) Selection of Midshipmen. Selection of midshipmen for appointment 
to fill vacancies allotted to the various States and other locations, as 
specified in Sec. 310.53(b) (1) and (2) of this subpart, shall be in 
order of merit. The order of merit shall be determined on the scores of 
the required entrance examinations, on assessment of the academic 
background of the individual and on such other factors as are considered 
by the Academy to be effective indicators of motivation and the 
probability of successful completion of training at the Academy. No 
preference shall be granted in selecting individuals for appointment 
because one or more members of their immediate families are alumni of 
the Academy.
    (c) Notification of selection. Results of the selection process will 
be made known about May 1 each year. The Academy shall advise each 
candidate and his or her nominating official of his or her status as a 
principal candidate, as an alternate candidate or as an unqualified 
candidate. Alternates will replace principal candidates who decline 
appointment or fail to meet the physical requirements or the security 
and suitability investigation.
    (d) Service obligation agreement. Each candidate selected for 
appointment to the Academy after April 1, 1982, who is a citizen of the 
United States, shall sign a service obligation contract as a condition 
of admission. The contract is prescribed in Sec. 310.58 of this 
subpart.

[[Page 259]]

    (e) Reporting to the Academy. Candidates who accept offers of 
appointment shall, pursuant to instructions issued by the Academy, 
report to the Academy on a specified date in mid-July for orientation

Marine Academy, accept appointment and do solemnly swear (or affirm) 
that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States 
against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith 
and allegiance to the same; that I will comply with all the regulations 
of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy; that I take this obligation freely, 
without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will 
well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am 
about to enter, so help me God.''

    (g) Birth Certificate. Each candidate shall present a certificate of 
birth authenticated by an authorized official.

submit evidence to the Administration that they have conscientiously 
sought employment as a merchant marine officer, and that such employment

available to the Administration, shall be considered in any finding. In 
view of current and projected employment opportunities afloat, the 
Administrator will grant the shoreside employment option infrequently 
and only on the basis of comprehensive evidence.
    (2) The Administrator may consider positions of operational, 
management or administrative responsibility, including, but not limited 
to, the following marine-related categories, to be under the provisions

companies.
    (d) Reporting requirements. (1) Each graduate must submit an annual 
Service Obligation Compliance Report form (MA-930) to the Maritime 
Administration between January 1 and March 1 following his or her 
graduation. After the initial report is submitted, each graduate must 
continue to submit annual reports during the same time frame between 
January 1 and March 1 for six (6) consecutive years thereafter, or until 
all components of the service obligation are fulfilled, whichever is 
latest. Each graduate will file a minimum of seven (7) reports in order 
to give information on all six (6) years of the service obligation. 
Graduates are encouraged to submit their Service Obligation Compliance 
Report forms (MA-930) to MARAD using the web-based Internet system at 
https://mscs.marad.dot.gov. Reports may also be mailed to: Compliance 
Specialist, Office of Policy and Plans, Maritime Administration, 
Department of Transportation, 400 7th St., SW., Room 7123, Washington, 
DC 20590.
    (i) Example 1: Midshipman graduates on June 30, 2004. His or her 
first reporting date is between January 1, 2005 and March 1, 2005 and 
thereafter between January 1 and March 1 for six (6) consecutive years 
(or until all components of the service obligation are fulfilled, 
whichever is latest) for a minimum of seven (7) reports.
    (ii) Example 2: Midshipman has a deferred graduation on November 30, 
2004. His or her first reporting period is between January 1, 2005 and 
March 1, 2005 and thereafter between January 1 and March 1 for six (6) 
consecutive years (or until all components of the service obligation are 
fulfilled, whichever is latest) for a minimum of seven (7) reports.
    (iii) Example 3: Midshipman graduated in June 2003 and has already 
begun his or her service obligation reporting. His or her reports are 
now due between January 1 and March 1 of each reporting year.
    (2) The Maritime Administration will provide reporting forms upon 
request. However, non-receipt of such forms will not exempt a graduate 
from submitting service obligation information as required by this 
paragraph. Graduates are encouraged to submit their Service Obligation 
Compliance Report forms (MA-930) electronically at https://
mscs.marad.dot.gov. The reporting form has been approved by the Office 
of Management and Budget (2133-0509).
    (e) Breach of contract. (1) Breach before graduation: (i) If the 
Maritime Administrator determines that an individual who has attended 
the Academy for not less than two (2) academic

[[Page 261]]

years has failed to complete the course of instruction at the Academy, 
such individual may be ordered by the Secretary of Defense to active 
duty in one of the Armed Forces of the United States to serve for a 
period of time not to exceed two (2) years. In cases of hardship, as 
determined by the Maritime Administrator, the Maritime Administrator may 
waive this provision in whole or in part.
    (ii) If the Secretary of Defense is unable or unwilling to order an 
individual to active duty under the previous paragraph, or if the

domestic commerce or the national defense, as determined by the Maritime 
Administrator. The Maritime Administrator, in consultation with the

<R05>
Section 1  What this order does.

    This order requires that General Agents, appointed under Service 
Agreement ``G.A.A., 3/19/51'' shall not advance or entrust any monies or 
slop chest property of the United States to a master, purser or any 
other member of the ship's personnel unless such person is under a bond 
indemnifying the United States against loss of such monies or property 
caused solely or in part by the dishonesty or lack of care of any such 
person in the performance of the duties of any petition covered by the 
bond.


<R05>
Sec. 2  Amount of bond.

    The amount of the bond must be governed by the amount of monies 
advanced or value of slop chest property entrusted, and shall, at all 
times, not be less than the value of slop chest property entrusted plus 
advances of monies for which a satisfactory accounting has not been 
made.


<R05>
Sec. 3  Premiums.

    The bonds provided for shall be furnished without cost to the 
National Shipping Authority, but the cost of the premiums of such bonds 
shall be included in the overhead expense of the General Agent.


<R05>
Sec. 4  Posting of bond.

    The General Agent shall retain an executed copy of each such bond in 
its principal office for examination by the National Shipping Authority 
at any time.

[Amdt. 1, 16 FR 9527, Sept. 19, 1951. Redesignated at 45 FR 44587, July

<R05>
Sec. 5  Measures to protect ship's payrolls.

    (a) General Agents are not required to consider the amount of the 
payroll delivered to the Master at the conclusion of a voyage in 
determining the amount of bond required for any one person filling a 
bonded position hereunder. However, the person paying off the crew 
should be either the Master, or purser, or some other member of the 
ship's personnel acting for the Master who has been bonded pursuant to 
this order. If, however, the person paying off is a shoreside employee 
of the General Agent, such employee shall be bonded under the General 
Agents' general fidelity bond.
    (b) The principal risk involved where payrolls are delivered to a 
vessel at the conclusion of a voyage is loss through hold-up. Therefore, 
reasonable protection shall be taken by all General Agents where 
payrolls are delivered to a vessel or elsewhere. Because the 
circumstances of each case will vary, the General Agents shall use their 
best judgment in determining whether armored car service, armed guards 
or similar types of protection should be employed (in other words, the 
General Agents should follow their usual practices). The cost of these 
services may be included in vessel operating expenses.
    (c) General Agents are not required to purchase hold-up insurance, 
since subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of Service 
Agreement ``G.A.A., 3/19/51'' losses resulting from this exposure are 
assumed by the National Shipping Authority.


<R05>
Sec. 6  Surety and form of bond.

    Each bond provided for by this order shall be duly executed by an 
authorized surety appearing on the current approved list of companies 
acceptable as sureties on Federal bonds published by the U.S. Treasury 
Department. The form of bond required by the National Shipping Authority 
to be used by the General Agents shall be as follows:

[[Page 270]]

                      Department of Transportation

          maritime administration, national shipping authority

                     Position Fidelity Schedule Bond

    In consideration of the annual premium ------ (hereafter called the 
``Surety'') hereby agrees to pay to ------ or its successors (hereafter 
called the ``Agent'') or the United States of America, (hereafter called 
the ``United States''), represented by the Director, National Shipping 
Authority of the Maritime Administration, Department of Transportation 
(hereafter called the ``Director''), as their interests may appear, the 
amount of any pecuniary loss of money or slop chest property caused, 
solely or in part, by reason of the dishonesty or lack of care of any 
person in the performance of the duties of any position, now or 
hereafter listed in the Schedule of Positions and Amounts forming part 
hereof (hereafter called the ``Schedule''), on any and all vessels from 
time to time allocated to the Agent by the Director.
    This bond is executed and accepted subject to the following 
agreements, limitations and conditions:
    First. Liability under this bond begins with the ---------- day of 
----------------, 19---- in respect of each person then filling any 
position named in the Schedule on any and all vessels then allocated to 
the Agent by the Director. As to any position or positions bearing the 
same designation as that of any position or positions named in the 
Schedule on any vessel or vessels thereafter allocated to the Agent by 
the Director, liability under this bond shall automatically begin as 
soon as such position or positions are filled, provided the Director or 
the Agent shall within ninety (90) days of the date such position or 
positions are filled notify the Surety in writing of the date such 
position or positions are filled. As between the Agent and the Director, 
it shall be the responsibility of the Agent to give the notice to the 
Surety as provided herein. Without affecting its liability hereunder, 
the Surety agrees that neither the Agent nor the Director need furnish 
the names of vessels on which positions are bonded hereunder at any time 
during the effective period of this bond.
    Second. If the Agent or the Director shall request the Surety to 
increase or decrease the amount of coverage applicable to any position 
named in the Schedule, the Surety shall make such change by written 
acceptance showing the increase or decrease in the amount of coverage 
and the effective date thereof, which effective date shall not be prior 
to the date of such request; provided, however, that if the Director 
shall within ninety (90) days after receipt of notice of a decrease 
resulting from a request by the Agent, advise the Surety that it does 
not consent to such decrease, such decrease shall become inoperative and 
coverage shall continue in the amount applicable prior to such decrease 
as if such decrease had never been made.
    Third. If the Surety knows or has reason to believe that any person 
filling any position named in the Schedule has caused any loss of money 
or property entrusted to him by reason of his dishonesty or lack of care 
in the performance of the duties of such position, the Surety may 
terminate the coverage of this bond as to such person by giving notice 
in writing to the Agent and the Director at least thirty (30) days prior 
to the completion, in a continental United States port, of the then 
current voyage of the vessel on which such person is filling a position, 
in which case the coverage of this bond as to such person shall 
terminate when the crew is paid off upon such completion of the voyage. 
The Agent may cancel the coverage of this bond (a) as an entirety or (b) 
as to any position named in the Schedule by giving the Surety fifteen 
(15) days' written notice accompanied by written approval of the 
Director to such cancellation. The Director may cancel the coverage of 
this bond (a) as an entirety or (b) as to any position named in the 
Schedule upon fifteen (15) days' written notice to the Surety. In the 
event of any such cancellation the Surety shall refund to the Agent any 
unearned premiums computed pro rata.
    Fourth. After discovery and report to the Agent or the Director of 
any loss hereunder, the Agent or the Director shall give the Surety 
written notice thereof, and within ninety (90) days after such written 
notice to the Surety shall file with the Surety affirmative proof of 
loss itemized and sworn to on forms furnished by the Surety. Prior 
discovery and report to the Agent of such loss shall not affect the 
right of the Director to notify the Surety of such loss and to file 
proof of loss. As between the Agent and the Director, it shall be the 
responsibility of the Agent to give the notice and to file the proof of 
loss with the Surety as provided herein. ``Discovery and report'' as 
used herein is defined in paragraph Tenth hereof.
    Fifth. Any suit to recover on account of any loss hereunder shall be 
brought before the expiration of five years from the report to the Agent 
or the Director of the act causing such loss.
    Sixth. The Agent will declare at the original effective date of this 
bond, and at each subsequent premium anniversary date, the total number 
of persons then filling each position named in the Schedule, and the 
annual premium will be computed for the ensuing year on the basis of the 
aggregate coverage represented by such declaration. Upon such premium 
anniversary date there will be a computation of additional premium or 
refund of premium in proportion to the change in the coverage each year.

[[Page 271]]

    Seventh. Settlement of any claim hereunder shall be made by check 
payable to the Agent unless otherwise instructed by the Director, but no 
settlement of any claim hereunder may be made for an amount less than 
the full amount of the loss for which the claim is made without the 
written consent of the Director thereto.
    Eighth. The Surety shall not be entitled to any reimbursement, 
salvage or recovery,--except from insurance, reinsurance, collateral or 
indemnity taken by the Surety for its own benefit,--on account of any 
loss hereunder until the Agent or the Director, as their interests may 
appear, is reimbursed in full.
    Ninth. No modification or change of any nature of the provisions of 
this bond shall take effect unless the Director shall have given his 
written consent thereto, except that the Agent may increase the coverage 
hereunder in accordance with the provisions of paragraph First hereof 
without such consent of the Director.
    Tenth. (a) Any action, approval or consent which by the provisions 
of this bond is required to be taken or signed by the Director shall be 
effective if taken or signed by the Director or by his authorized 
representative, and wherever and whenever herein any right, power, or 
authority is granted or given to the Director, such right, power, or 
authority may be exercised in all cases by his authorized 
representative, and the act or acts of such authorized representative, 
when taken shall constitute the act of the Director hereunder.
    (b) ``Discovery and report'' by the Agent as used herein shall be 
deemed to mean discovery by any person and the report of such discovery 
to an executive officer or head of a department or division concerned 
with such discovery and report of the Agent at the Agent's principal 
place of business within the continental United States. ``Discovery and 
report'' by the Director shall be deemed to mean discovery by any person 
and the report of such discovery to an executive officer or head of a 
division or section concerned with such discovery and report at the 
Director's headquarters.
    (c) Notices, approvals and requests required by the provisions 
hereof shall be sent to the Surety addressed to it at its home office 
at.
    (d) Notices, acceptances and requests required to be sent to the 
Agent shall be sent to The Agent, ---------------- (Name and head office 
address).
    (e) Notices and requests to be sent to the Director shall be 
addressed to the Director, National Shipping Authority of the Maritime 
Administration, Department of Transportation, at the Director's 
headquarters.
    Signed, sealed and dated this ------------ day of --------------, 
19----.

                                Accounts


<R05>
Section 1  Books of account.

    A separate set of books of account shall be opened for the purpose 
of recording the various transactions in connection with the said agency 
agreement. The books of original entry and ledgers may be similar in 
design to those heretofore employed by the agent unless it develops that 
they are inadequate, in which event the deficiency shall be remedied 
promptly. The accounts required in operations under this agency 
agreement, however, shall conform to the chart in the uniform system 
prescribed by the Maritime Administration in General Order No. 22, 
Revised (46 CFR part 282) and recordings in the accounts shall be in 
accordance with the descriptions thereof contained in the said uniform 
system.


<R05>
Sec. 2  Bank account.

    A separate joint bank account will be maintained in a depository or 
depositories designated by the agent and approved by the National 
Shipping Authority (referred to in this order as the owner), into which 
all collections under the agency agreement will be deposited and from 
which disbursements in connection with the activities, maintenance and 
business of the vessels thereunder will be made. Upon designation by the 
agent and approval by the owner of the depository or depositories, the 
owner will issue an order for the establishment of the joint bank 
account. The order will set forth the conditions governing the 
establishment and maintenance of the account and the making of deposits 
therein and withdrawals therefrom. A signed copy of the order of the 
owner will be furnished the agent and the agent promptly shall adopt, 
through its Board of Directors, a resolution satisfactory in form and 
substance to the owner, authorizing the establishment and maintenance of 
the account in conformity with the action of the owner. A signed copy of 
the order of the owner and a certified copy of the resolution of the 
agent will be furnished by the owner to the depository for its guidance 
in maintaining the fund and honoring instruments of withdrawal. The 
order will provide, among other things, that:
    (a) Withdrawals from this bank account may be made by the agent 
without the countersignature of the owner for disbursements in 
connection with the activities, maintenance and business of the vessels 
assigned under agency agreements, except disbursements involving 
payments to the agent directly, or to any other persons specifically 
designated by the Director, National Shipping Authority, in which 
instances the countersignature of a designated representative of the 
owner will be required, (b) withdrawals may be made from the account by 
the owner without the countersignature of the agent whenever and to the 
extent the owner shall determine that the balance in the account in 
excess of current operating requirements warrants such action, (c) the 
bank shall have no rights against the joint account on account of 
indebtedness of the agent either by way of set-off or otherwise, (d) the 
bank may receive for deposit in the joint account any funds tendered to 
it by any person with instructions that the same be deposited in the 
said account, and the bank shall have no responsibility to inquire as to 
the source of such funds, and (e) the bank shall disburse funds from the 
joint account in accordance with checks, drafts, or other orders for the 
payment of money, drawn as provided in the order, without making any 
inquiry as to the purpose

[[Page 273]]

or use to which such withdrawals are to be put.

                         Accounting for Revenues


<R05>
Sec. 3  Accounting for revenues.

    (a) General. (1) The Agent shall be responsible for the prompt 
collection of all vessel operating revenue, shall issue such 
instructions as may be necessary to its branch houses or sub-agents, and 
shall take such other steps as may be necessary to insure prompt 
remittance to it of vessel operating revenue collected outside its 
principal office.
    (2) Freight revenue collected, less refunds made therefrom, shall be 
remitted to the owner promptly subsequent to the close of each month. 
Disbursements except for refunds shall not be made from freight revenue 
collections unless specifically authorized by the owner.
    (3) Passenger revenue collections shall be accounted for in 
accordance with procedures to be described.
    (4) The agent shall in all cases perform his audit and review 
functions promptly and shall be in a position to supply complete 
documentation for a current audit by representatives of the owner.
    (b) Revenue documents--(1) Freight revenue. The agent shall require 
its domestic and foreign branch houses, sub-agents, or other 
representatives, to prepare and submit revenue documents (manifests, 
bills of lading, out turn weight certificates, correction notices, etc.) 
to it. The manifest, in addition to showing the name of shipper, 
consignee, weight or measurement, freight rate and basis (whether the 
freight rate applies on measurement or weight basis), and amount of 
freight, shall show also advance charges, prepaid beyond charges, etc. A 
recapitulation sheet shall be made of the totals shown on the individual 
manifest sheets for each port. The aggregate totals of weight and 
measurement freight shall be converted to freight payable tons of bulk, 
general, heavy lifts, and commodities subject to special stevedoring 
rates if freight carried is subject to an over-all stevedoring 
agreement.
    (2) Passenger revenue. Agents to whom combination passenger and 
freight vessels have been assigned under agency agreements and who 
heretofore have established a passenger accounting procedure, may 
continue to follow such procedure under the agency operations, unless 
such procedure is found to be inadequate by the owner.
    (3) Certifications of revenue documents. The following 
certifications will be signed by branch houses or sub-agents:

    (i) Freight manifests. Certified to be a true and correct reflection 
of cargo loaded and rates charged.

    (4) Definition of manifest. The term manifest as used in this order, 
shall be interpreted to include appropriate equivalent documents as 
customarily used.

<R05>
Sec. 4  Funding of operations.

    Cash advances will be made by the owner in such amounts and at such 
times as are required to adequately fund the activities, maintenance and 
business of the vessels assigned under agency agreements.

                              Disbursements


<R05>
Sec. 5  Disbursements at principal office of agent.

    All expenses directly applicable to the activities, maintenance and 
business of the vessels assigned under agency agreements shall be paid 
from funds advanced by the owner unless otherwise specifically provided.

which the invoices were paid; when paid other than by check of the agent 
at his principal office, invoices must bear evidence of payment.


<R05>
Sec. 6  Disbursements at other domestic ports.

    Disbursements at domestic ports other than the principal office of 
the

[[Page 274]]

agent for expenses as referred to in section 5 shall be made by one of 
the three following methods:
    (a) After proper certification by the branch house or subagent, 
invoices shall be forwarded to the agent for payment, or
    (b) The branch house or subagent shall pay invoices and thereafter 
apply to the agent for reimbursement, supporting its voucher with 
invoices bearing evidence of payment covering individual disbursement, 
or
    (c) The agent may advance from time to time from the joint bank 
account the funds necessary to meet the requirements of such branch 
houses or subagents in connection with the activities, maintenance and 
business of the vessels assigned under the agency agreement. In such 
cases the branch house or subagent shall pay invoices from such advances 
and make proper accounting to the agent for each advance supported by 
invoices bearing evidence of payment and accompanied by remittance 
covering any unexpended balance of the advance, promptly after the 
departure of each vessel for which such advance was made.


<R05>
Sec. 7  Disbursements at foreign ports.

    Disbursement procedures at foreign ports may differ in the case of 
individual agents and in view of existing conditions. Disbursements at 
foreign ports shall be made by one of the following methods or by any 
other method outlined to and approved by the owner in advance of its 
use:
    (a) The agent may advance from time to time from the joint bank 
account the funds necessary to meet the requirements of the business of 
the vessels assigned under the agency agreement. In such cases the 
foreign branch house or sub-agent shall pay invoices from such advances 
and shall make proper accounting to the agent for all advances supported 
by invoices bearing satisfactory evidence of payment. Any gains or 
losses in exchange on such advances or disbursements shall be for the 
account of the owner.
    (b) The foreign branch house or sub-agent may pay all invoices from 
his own funds and thereafter draw on the agent for reimbursement, at the 
same time forwarding the disbursements account by air mail.
    (c) The agent may establish Letters of Credit making funds available 
to the foreign branch house or sub-agent against which funds may be 
drawn by the sub-agent for branch house for payment of properly approved 
documents.

rendered the services or furnished the supplies or facilities.
    (5) If the laws of any country require the foreign sub-agent or 
branch house to retain the original invoice with stamps affixed, or if 
such laws require the original receipt as prima facie evidence of 
payment, the corresponding duplicate copy of the invoice, in proper 
form, must be forwarded to the agent with notation to that effect made 
thereon by the foreign sub-agent or branch house.
    (b) Certification of master, ship's officers, branch houses, sub-
agents, or duly authorized representatives. (1) Evidence of delivery of 
supplies, performance of services, or use of facilities, as normally 
provided by delivery receipts, or an equivalent form, comprises an 
essential part of proper documentation for disbursing purposes.
    (i) Where supplies are delivered or services or facilities are 
furnished directly to a vessel, evidence of delivery or performance 
normally should be signed by a ship's officer.
    (ii) Where such evidence is not signed by a ship's officer, any duly 
authorized representative of the agent may sign as ``Duly Authorized 
Representative,'' provided the agent shall be responsible for the 
designation of proper and qualified representatives and provided the 
agent shall furnish, when so required by the owner, adequate evidence 
that the signing representative was duly authorized by him. In instances 
in which the agent may not be able to identify in advance the 
representative who may sign, the agent shall have the responsibility for 
determining that the person signing was qualified to execute evidence of 
delivery of supplies, performance of services, or use of facilities 
involved.
    (2) For charges for watching cargo, stevedoring, wharfage, receiving 
and delivering cargo, clerking and checking, or other services or 
facilities not rendered directly to the vessel, for which normally 
delivery receipts or any equivalent form are not furnished, the 
following certification on the face of the original invoice by a duly 
authorized representative of the agent is required.

    I certify that the services or facilities as specified have been 
furnished.

    (3) Ships' payrolls shall be certified by the master (or his 
authorized representative) as follows:

    (4) In instances where vessels are under foreign articles the 
payroll shall bear proper evidence of having been paid off before a 
United States Shipping Commissioner or an American Consul.
    (5) The slop chest account shall be certified by the master as 
follows:

    I hereby certify that the above is a true statement of all Slop 
Chest transactions on this vessel and voyage.

                                               Master (or his authorized
                                                         representative)

<R05>
Sec. 326.1  Purpose.

    This part states that the Maritime Administration (MARAD) shall be 
responsible for providing or obtaining marine protection and indemnity 
(P&I) insurance for any vessel that has been placed in the National 
Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF), which includes the Ready Reserve Force 
component, which vessel is assigned under a General Agency Agreement. 
These various forms of Agreements are entered into by the United States, 
acting by and through the National Shipping Authority, MARAD, and a 
private company (Agent). An agreement also contains procedures for the 
Agent to report accidents and occurrences of a P&I nature to MARAD and 
to report and settle P&I claims.


<R05>
Sec. 326.2  Insurer.

    MARAD shall be responsible for providing or obtaining P&I insurance 
for all vessels assigned to Agents under an Agreement. At its election, 
MARAD may be a self-insurer of any one or more vessels covered by the 
Agreement, or may obtain P&I insurance coverage under one or more 
policies written by underwriters of marine insurance. MARAD shall 
determine the amount of coverage to be provided or obtained.


<R05>
Sec. 326.3  Insured.

    The insureds are: The United States of America, acting by and 
through the Director, National Shipping Authority, Maritime 
Administration, Department of Transportation, and its Agents (including 
Agents' employees). Sub-agents shall be insureds only as expressly 
provided in the Agreement. Independent contractors of the Agents are not 
insureds.


<R05>
Sec. 326.4  Reports of accidents and occurrences.

    The Agent shall report every accident or occurrence of a P&I nature 
promptly to both the Director, Office of Trade Analysis and Insurance, 
Maritime Administration, 500 Seventh Street, SW., Room 8121, Washington, 
DC 20590, Tel. (202) 366-1461, and the contracting officer named in the 
Agreement. If MARAD has obtained P&I insurance through a marine 
insurance underwriter, the Agent also shall concurrently file a report 
of such accident or occurrence with the underwriter. MARAD shall 
disclose full details as the identity of such underwriter to the Agent.


<R05>
Sec. 326.5  Report of claims.

    The Agent also shall submit a quarterly report of all claims of a 
P&I insurance nature to the Director, Office of Trade Analysis and 
Insurance. The report shall contain all relevant information, e.g., the 
names of the vessels and of the claimant, the date of the injury or 
occurrence, the amount claimed, the basis for any payments already 
disbursed in behalf of the United States, estimated future costs and an 
evaluation of the claim of the merits.


<R05>
Sec. 326.6  Settlement of claims.

    (a) After ascertaining from MARAD the availability of funds, the 
Agent is authorized to settle individual claims of a P&I insurance 
nature that do not exceed $5,000. For a settlement in excess of $5,000, 
the Agent shall obtain MARAD's prior approval through the Director, 
Office of Trade Analysis and Insurance. If MARAD has placed the P&I 
insurance with an insurance underwriter, the Agent also shall obtain the 
prior approval of the underwriter to settle claims.
    (b) The amount of individual claims that do not exceed the Agent's 
limit for settlement shall be chargeable by the Agent to the vessel 
expense and shall be accounted for in accordance with current accounting 
instructions of MARAD.
    (c) When settling any such claim, the Agent shall advise the 
claimant that such settlement shall be accounted for in accordance with 
current accounting instructions, and shall also advise the claimant that 
such settlement is not to be construed as an admission of liability by 
or on behalf of the United States, the Agent or any other person.
    (d) The Agent shall apply sound judgment and follow standard 
practices of vessel operators in the settlement or other disposition of 
such P&I insurance claims, and shall settle such claims

[[Page 279]]

only when the settlement is adequately supported by all the facts and 
circumstances and is in the best interest of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 326.7  Litigation.

    (a) If a court suit of a P&I nature is filed which arises out of the 
activities of the Agent under its Agreement, wherein the Agent is named 
as the party defendant or one of the parties' defendant irrespective of 
whether the risk is covered by P&I insurance, the Agent shall 
immediately forward copies of the pleading and all other related legal 
documents, by first class mail, to the Chief Counsel, Maritime 
Administration, Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590, and 
to the Attorney General, Attn: Civil Division, Torts Branch, Department 
of Justice, Washington, DC 20530. No agent or authorized subagent shall 
incur any legal expenses in connection with any claim of a P&I nature, 
unless approved in advance by MARAD, and by the underwriter, where 
applicable. However, the Agent may incur legal expenses if the mission 
of the vessel will be frustrated or impeded and/or time will not permit 
such prior approval.
    (b) In the event of any attachment or seizure of a vessel, whether 
or not the risk is of a P&I nature, the Agent shall immediately notify 
the Chief Counsel, Maritime Administration, Washington, DC 20590, Tel. 
(202) 366-05711, by telegram, radio, or cable.

<R05>
Sec. 327.1  Purpose.

    This part prescribes rules and regulations pertaining to the filing 
of claims designated in Sec. 327.3 of this part and the administrative 
allowance, or disallowance (actual and presumed), of such claims, in 
whole or in part, filed by officers and members of crews (hereafter 
referred to as ``seamen'') employed on vessels as employees of the 
United States through the National Shipping Authority (NSA), Maritime 
Administration (MARAD), or successor.


<R05>
Sec. 327.2  Statutory provisions.

    (a) In connection with the Vessel Operations Revolving Fund created 
for the purpose of carrying out the vessel operating functions of the 
Secretary of Transportation, the Third Supplemental Appropriation Act, 
1951 (46 app. U.S.C. 1241a), provides, in part:

    That the provisions of sections 1(a), 1(c), 3(c) and 4 of Public Law 
17, Seventy-eighth Congress (57 Stat. 45), as amended, shall be 
applicable in connection with such operations and to seamen employed 
through general agents as employees of the United States, who may be 
employed in accordance with customary commercial practices in the 
maritime industry, notwithstanding the provisions of any law applicable 
in terms to the employment of persons by the United States.

    (b) Section 1(a) of Public Law 17 (50 U.S.C. app. 1291(a)), as 
amended, provides that:

    (a) Officers and members of crews (hereinafter referred to as 
``seamen'') employed on United States or foreign flag vessels as 
employees of the United States through the War Shipping Administration 
shall, with respect to (1) laws administered by the Public Health 
Service and the Social Security Act, as amended by subsection (b) (2) 
and (3) of this section; (2) death, injuries, illness, maintenance and 
cure, loss of effects, detention, or repatriation, or claims arising 
therefrom not covered by the foregoing clause (1); and (3) collection of 
wages and bonuses and making of allotments, have all of the rights, 
benefits, exemptions, privileges, and liabilities, under law applicable 
to citizens of the United States employed as seamen on privately owned 
and operated American vessels. * * *. Claims arising under clause (1) 
hereof shall be enforced in the same manner as such claims would be 
enforced if the seamen were employed on a privately owned and operated 
American vessel. Any claim referred to in

[[Page 280]]

clause (2) or (3) hereof shall, if administratively disallowed in whole 
or in part, be enforced pursuant to the provisions of the Suits in 
Admiralty Act, notwithstanding the vessel on which the seaman is 
employed is not a merchant vessel within the meaning of such Act. * * *. 
When used in this subsection the term ``administratively disallowed'' 
means a denial of a written claim in accordance with rules or 
regulations prescribed by the Administrator, War Shipping 
Administration. When used in this subsection the terms ``War Shipping 
Administration'' and ``Administrator, War Shipping Administration'' 
shall be deemed to include the United States Maritime Commission with 
respect to the period beginning October 1 1941, and ending February 11, 
1942, and the term ``seaman'' shall be deemed to include any seaman 
employed as an employee of the United States through the War Shipping 
Administration on vessels made available to or subchartered to other 
agencies or departments of the United States.

    (c) The functions of the War Shipping Administrator and War Shipping 
Administration were transferred for liquidation purposes by title II of 
Public Law 492, 79th Congress (60 Stat. 501) to the United States 
Maritime Commission and, on August 20, 1949, by Reorganization Plan No. 
6 of 1949 (63 Stat. 1069) to the Chairman of said Commission; certain of 
the functions of the United States Maritime Commission and of its 
Chairman were transferred on May 24, 1950, by part II of Reorganization 
Plan No. 21 of 1950 (64 Stat. 1273, 1276; 46 U.S.C. 1111-1114) to the 
Secretary of Commerce, and thereafter redelegated by the Secretary of 
Commerce to the Maritime Administrator (Department Order No. 117 
(Amended), Manual of Orders, Department of Commerce); vessel operating 
functions were redelegated by the Maritime Administrator to the 
Director, National Shipping Authority, Maritime Administration 
(Administrator's Order No. 11 (Amended), Manual of Orders, Federal 
Maritime Board/Maritime Administration). In 1981, Public Law 99-31 (95 
Stat. 165) transferred the Maritime Administration from the Department 
of Commerce to the Department of Transportation. By DOT Order 1100.60A, 
the Secretary of Transportation has delegated to the Maritime 
Administrator the authority to carry out the Act of June 2, 1951 (46 
app. U.S.C. 1241a), regarding the Vessel Operations Revolving Fund (49 
CFR 1.66). The Maritime Administrator has redelegated that authority to 
the Associate Administrator for Shipbuilding and Ship Operations 
(Maritime Administrative Order 70-1).

the following material partially modifying certain sections of that 
order is published.

For General Agency operations not related to the current GAA/MSTS 
Southeast Asia Program, NSA Order 35 (OPR-2) remains unchanged and 
wholly applicable. Except where specifically altered by the material 
which follows, it also remains applicable to the present situation.

For voyages made under the current GAA/MSTS program only, the following 
provisions concerning voyage commencements and terminations shall apply 
in lieu of those appearing in

[[Page 285]]

sections 3 and 4 of NSA Order 35 (OPR-2). Continental United States

shall be effective when warranted:
    (1) If the vessel completes payoff as in paragraph (b) of this 
section and takes departure within the same calendar day, the General 
Agent shall immediately inform the nearest Coast Director of Area 
Representative of the circumstances and submit recommendations regarding 
voyage termination. The resulting recommendations, decisions, and 
instructions shall be confirmed in writing to the General Agent, copy to 
Division of Operations, Washington, DC 20590.
    (d) Where a vessel is employed in intermediate voyages or in cross 
trading outside the continental United States, the original voyage shall 
continue until terminated under conditions in paragraph (b) of this 
section.

<R05>
Sec. 4  Manner of repatriation.

    (a) A seaman described in paragraph (a) of section 3 of this order 
shall be repatriated in accordance with the provisions of the shipping 
articles, or the applicable collective bargaining agreement, employment 
contract, or statute. If a seaman in this class is repatriated as a 
passenger, the General Agent of the vessel of which he was last a crew 
member shall arrange for his passage and pay the amount of expense 
involved.
    (b) A seaman described in paragraph (b) of section 3 of this order 
may be repatriated as a passenger where space is available and 
circumstances permit. If applicable collective bargaining agreements, 
employment contracts, or statutes do not conflict, he may return as a 
workaway or, at the discretion of the master of the repatriating vessel, 
he may sign on articles either as a replacement of to complete a 
vessel's complement or, when deemed advisable by the official 
authorizing the repatriation and with the approval of the master of the 
repatriating vessel, he may be signed on the articles as a repatriated 
seaman (non-working). If a seaman in this class is repatriated as a 
passenger, or repatriate seaman (non-working), the General Agent of the 
vessel of which he was last a crew member shall arrange for his passage 
and pay the amount of expense involved.
    (c) A seaman described in paragraph (c) of section 3 of this order 
shall be returned as a workaway or, at the discretion of the master of 
the repatriating vessel, he may sign on as a replacement or to complete 
a vessel's complement. Only in unusual cases, and only with the prior 
approval of the Chief, Division of Operations, shall a seaman in this 
class be repatriated as a passenger or as a repatriate seaman (non-

which he was last a crew member.
    (b) If a seaman is repatriated as a passenger, or as a repatriate 
seaman (non-working), aboard a vessel operated for the account of the 
National

[[Page 287]]

Shipping Authority under a General Agency Agreement, a flat 
transportation charge of $5.00 per day shall be made for every day spent 
aboard the repatriating vessel, including day of embarkation and day of 
debarkation, which charge shall be in addition to necessary train or 
other conveyance expense, United States and foreign government taxes, 
port dues, landing fees or other charges of every nature levied in 
connection with such repatriation. In such a case, the General Agent of 
the vessel of which the repatriate was last a crew member shall be 
billed for the amount of expense involved, and appropriate entries 
covering the receipts and disbursements resulting from the repatriation 
shall be made in the proper books of account by the General Agent 
concerned. In the event the General Agent repatriating a seaman is also 
the General Agent of the vessel on which the seaman last served, it will 
not be necessary to issue a formal billing, but it is required that 
appropriate entries be made on the agency books of account to reflect a 
revenue of $5.00 per day in the account of the vessel rendering the 
transportation service and that a charge covering the cost of 
repatriation be recorded against the vessel on which the seaman last 
served. In all cases, the General Agent charged with the repatriation 
expense shall take necessary steps to secure reimbursement of such 
expense from the P & I underwriters insuring the vessel against which 
the expense is charged. No charge is to be made in the case of a seaman 
repatriate who signs on vessel articles as a workaway or in any other 
capacity except as a repatriate seaman (non-working). When repatriation 
is required, it shall be effected by the first available means 
considered appropriate by the official authorizing such repatriation.


<R05>
Sec. 6  General provisions.

    (a) In case of repatriation of any seaman as a passenger aboard a 
vessel operated for account of the National Shipping Authority, the 
requirements of the applicable collective bargaining agreement or 
employment contract shall be met. In any event, a seaman repatriate 
shall receive at least as good accommodations as would be his due while 
sailing in his capacity.
    (b) Unless otherwise directed, a seaman when repatriated as a 
passenger aboard a vessel operated for the account of the National 
Shipping Authority, shall be issued a ticket in the form prescribed by 
the General Agent of the vessel for its own vessels. Such ticket shall 
be surrendered to the master of the repatriating vessel. When 
repatriated as a repatriate seaman (non-working), the master of the 
repatriating vessel shall be furnished with a certificate from the 
official authorizing the repatriation setting forth that the 
circumstances require that the seaman be signed on as a repatriate 
seaman (non-working). The master shall ascertain the seaman's full name 
and rating, cause of repatriation, and the names of the vessels and the 
General Agent to be charged with the cost of the repatriation.
    (c) It is recognized that the procedure set forth in this order will 
not cover all situations arising out of obligations to repatriate seamen 
nor fix ultimate responsibility for repatriation expenses which may 
sometimes depend upon determinations of fact which cannot be made prior 
to repatriation. In cases of emergency or in situations not covered in 
this order, the General Agent shall proceed in accordance with 
established commercial practice.
    (d) Nothing in this order shall be construed to interfere with the 
proper exercise of authority by United States consular officials 
relative to repatriation of seamen in accordance with applicable 
statutes.

<R05>
Sec. 3  Application for remission of duties.

    An application for relief from the payment of duties imposed is to 
be filed with the District Director of Customs as defined in 19 CFR 
1.1(d) if the following circumstances prevail:
    (a) When an item covered by the entry is not within the class of 
items liable to duty (i.e., that the item does not constitute equipment, 
repair parts or materials within the meaning of section 466 of the 
Tariff Act of 1930);
    (b) When the purchase of the equipment, repair parts or materials or 
the making of the repairs was necessitated by stress of weather and/or 
other casualty encountered during the regular course of the particular 
voyage and was necessary to secure the safety and seaworthiness of the 
vessel; or
    (c) When the equipment, repair parts or materials were manufactured 
or produced in the United States and the labor involved was performed by 
residents of the United States or by members of the regular crew of the 
vessel.

To insure consideration in the liquidation (i.e., the assessment of 
duty) of the entry, the application for relief must be filed within 90 
days from the date of the entry, except in meritorious cases, the 
District Director may grant an extension of 90 more days upon written 
request therefor.

<R05>
Sec. 4  Evidence required.

    When relief is claimed on the grounds of stress of weather or other 
casualty, there must be submitted to the Collector the following:
    (a) An affidavit of the Master which shall set out fully the nature 
of the

[[Page 291]]

casualty and/or stress of weather encountered; when and where the 
casualty and/or stress of weather occurred; nature of the damage 
sustained; the port where the repairs were made or the equipment 
purchased and a statement of the Master as to whether the repairs or 
equipment purchased were required to secure the safety or seaworthiness 
of the vessel to enable her to reach a port of destination in the United 
States;
    (b) Itemized invoices covering the cost of repairs made or equipment 
purchased;
    (c) Abstracts of the vessel's log;
    (d) Classification surveyor's report confirming vessel's 
classification when the repairs were made in order to insure 
seaworthiness.

The Master shall certify as true copies or originals, as the case may 
be, one copy of each repair bill, abstract of vessel's log, survey 
report and other documents used in support of the application for 
relief. If a document is written in a foreign language, it should be 
accompanied by a translation certified to be accurate.


<R05>
Sec. 5  General Agent's authority to effect payment of duties.

    (a) In those cases where the conditions outlined in section 3 of 
SRM-4 do not prevail, the General Agent shall effect payment of duties 
imposed by Customs and shall include the expenditure in the voyage 
accounts of the vessel. In those cases where the conditions as outlined 
in section 3 of SRM-4 do prevail, the General Agent shall exhaust every 
means toward obtaining remission of duty imposed.
    (b) Should the General Agent fail to obtain remission of duties in 
such cases, he shall refer the matter to the appropriate Coast Director 
for his (The Director) determination as to whether further appeal to the 
Bureau of Customs is warranted or that payment of duty should be made by 
the General Agent.

    Note: Records and supporting documents referred to in the above 
order, shall be retained until the completion of the audit by the 
General Accounting Office, at which time the Maritime Administration 
will take custody of the records.

<R05>
Section 1  What this order does.

    This order cancels NSA Order No. 32 (SRM-1); and outlines the 
procedure to be followed by the several Coast Directors, their field 
Ship Repair and Maintenance Staffs, the General Agents of the Authority, 
and the ship repair contractors in the award and performance of vessel 
repairs under the National Shipping Authority Master Repair Contract, 
NSA-LUMPSUMREP. The Coast Directors, field Ship Repair and Maintenance 
Staffs and the General Agents shall be referred to hereafter in this

[[Page 292]]

order as representatives of the Authority.


<R05>
Sec. 2  Use of contract for competitive bid and negotiated price awards.

    (a) The NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract is a Master form of fixed price 
contract and is applicable to ship repair work awarded as a result of 
competitive bidding or negotiation. As a general rule all work awarded 
under the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract must be awarded upon the basis of 
competitive bids. Revised Statute section 3709 (41 U.S.C. 5), which 
requires the award of contracts on the basis of competitive bids, 
however, permits award upon a negotiated basis in certain situations, 
that is, ``where immediate delivery or performance is required by the 
public exigency.''
    (b) There are set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) to (3) of this section 
three (3) examples of situations where the negotiation of fixed price 
awards for the accomplishment of work under the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract 
will be permitted in lieu of competitive bidding:
    (1) Where the desired results from competitive bidding cannot be 
obtained. For example, where there is doubt as to the reality of 
competition or the fairness or reasonableness of a low bid, all bids 
shall be rejected. If the ship's availability permits a new Invitation 
for Bids for the work in question shall be issued. If the bids received 
as a result of the second invitation are not considered satisfactory the 
bids are to be again rejected and prices of all specification items are 
to be negotiated with and the job awarded to the lowest bidder. If the 
low bidder refuses to accept the award upon the condition referred to 
the offer of award subject to price negotiation may be made to the next 
lowest bidder, etc. Negotiated awards in such cases shall be made in 
accordance with the conditions set forth on the invitation form, e.g., 
time specified, liquidated damages, etc. If a satisfactory price cannot 
be secured by negotiation with the bidders as herein proved an award may 
be made upon a negotiated basis approved in section 5 of this order.
    (2) Where the element of time is paramount. There will be instances 
where expeditious ship turnarounds will necessitate the award of work 
without the delay involved in awarding on the basis of competitive bids. 
In such cases immediate negotiation for a fixed price with one 
contractor will be permissible. However, full consideration must be 
given to the factors involved in order to determine whether, under the 
circumstances, the time requirements make necessary the negotiation of 
price rather than using the competitive bid procedure. Such relevant 
factors are the individual ship's commitments with respect to loading 
berths, sailing dates, and the charter hire, etc., that might accrue in 
the event additional ship lay-time is required because of competitive 
bidding. Definite dollar and time values cannot be established as 
specific guides for determining when to negotiate. The individual ship 
and circumstances involved are the governing elements. The practice of 
consistently favoring one contractor where this type of repair is 
required will not be permitted but instead, to the maximum extent 
possible, all qualified contractors in the particular port shall be 
given the opportunity to perform work for the National Shipping 
Authority.
    (3) Extra items of work found subsequent to the awarding of the work 
covered by the original specifications. Where extra items of work are 
required after the commencement of the awarded work, it is permissible 
to negotiate with the contractor who is performing the awarded work, for 
the accomplishment of such extra work under the provisions of Article 6 
of the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract. A discussion of this procedure is set 
out in section 8 of this order. However, where items of extra work are 
found after examinations have been made as called for by the original 
specifications, negotiation with the contractor to perform such items of 
extra work shall be permitted only if the aggregate estimated cost of 
such items of extra work would not amount to a substantial part of the 
entire job. If the items of extra work amount to a substantial part of 
the entire job, they shall be awarded in the same manner and after 
consideration of the same factors as are set forth above for awarding 
original work.

[[Page 293]]


<R05>
Sec. 3  Specifications.

    (a) It shall be incumbent upon the representatives of the Authority 
on each and every vessel requiring repairs for the account of the 
National Shipping Authority to prepare complete, detailed and fully 
descriptive specifications of the particulars of each repair item, 
identified in each particular case by the appropriate voyage number. 
Decisions of the Coast Directors' Ship Repair and Maintenance Staffs 
with respect to the need for any particular item in repair 
specifications shall be final. The specifications for voyage repairs 
shall itemize the work involved and shall be numbered consecutively and 
shall be arranged in accordance with the group classification set forth 
in section 18 of this order with the segregation by the three 
departments, namely, deck, engine and steward.
    (b) The specifications shall in their final written form be explicit 
in every respect and shall include drydocking, if required, as well as 
all other items of work known to be required or discernible through 
visual inspection and examination regardless of the fact that later 
decision may be made to eliminate or defer some of the items of work. In 
no case shall an item of work, the accomplishment of which is 
problematical, be so identified or segregated in the specifications. 
Resorting to such general phraseology as ``overhaul as necessary,'' 
``open up for examination and repair or renew as necessary,'' ``repair 
or renew,'' etc., shall not be permitted in preparing and writing the 
specifications.
    (c) Where an exact and final determination of the extent of the work 
cannot be ascertained until an examination has been made, the particular 
items involved shall so specify and the specifications with respect to 
said items shall be limited to such examinations as are necessary.
    (d) If it is desired by the representatives of the Authority to 
change any item in the specifications after the specifications have been 
issued to bid such changes shall be reduced to writing and shall be 
distributed to the invited bidders at least by such time prior to the 
time originally specified for the opening of bids as shall reasonably 
permit the bidders to revise their estimates. If determined to be 
necessary or desirable under the circumstances, the representative of 
the Authority may extend the time for opening of bids.
    (e) Any exceptions taken to the specifications by a prospective 
bidder shall be made known to the represent- ative of the Authority 
prior to the time specified for opening the bids. If it is finally 
determined by the representative of the Authority that the exceptions 
are justified, then the procedure set forth in the preceding sub-
paragraph shall be followed. Exceptions accompanying bids not processed 
as herein prescribed, but made known at the time the bids are opened 
will not be acceptable, and will be a cause for rejecting such bids.
    (f) When it is anticipated that the cost of a job will be in excess 
of a Coast Director's delegated authority, one (1) copy of 
specifications, and in case of bids a copy of Invitation for Bids, 
Instructions to Bidders and listing of contractors invited to bid shall 
be forwarded to the Chief, Division of Ship Repair and Maintenance, 
Washington, DC, simultaneously with the specifications being issued to 
the contractors.
    (g) In all cases where materials, parts or equipment are required in 
connection with the performance of any particular repair item the 
representatives of the Authority shall utilize to the fullest possible 
extent spares and replacement parts stocked in Maritime Administration 
warehouses. Prior to arranging for the purchase or furnishing of repair 
parts by repair contractors, it shall be the responsibility of the 
representatives of the Authority awarding work to determine that the 
required parts are not available in the Maritime Administration 
warehouse in the area involved, contingent upon the urgency of the 
particular situation, ship's sailing schedule, etc.


<R05>
Sec. 4  Procedure for securing competitive bids.

    (a) The geographical area within which bids will be invited involves 
the exercise of sound administrative judgment. All the relevant factors 
should be considered in deciding over what areas competitive bids should 
be invited. Such factors will include the

[[Page 294]]

scope and nature of the work, the location of the vessel, and the time 
and expense involved in shifting and returning the vessel to its loading 
berth consistent with the operating requirements.
    (b) Invitations for Bids shall be sent to all contractors, within 
the area as determined in paragraph (a) of this section, who are 
considered to be financially qualified and to be capable of performing 
all of the work set forth in the specifications either by the 
utilization of their own or subcontractors' facilities. In this regard 
attention is invited to section 15 of this order.
    (c) When inviting Bids the NSA form entitled ``Invitation for Bids, 
Instruction for Bidders, and Specifications for Repairs, Renewals, 
Alterations and Additions to the Vessel ----------'' shall be used.
    (d) Attention is called to the fact that the Invitation for Bids 
form includes a statement of the completion date for the work. In the 
event bids are invited the individual vessel's period of availability 
and the extent of the proposed work shall be considered in fixing a 
completion date that is consistent with the scope of the work involved. 
Consideration must be given to the fact that it will not be possible in 
every case to get lower bids by extending a completion date beyond the 
normal time required to do the work merely because the vessel's 
availability is exceptionally long. At the same time, care is to be 
exercised to insure that the repair period is not shortened, when there 
is no urgent need for the use of the vessel, to such an extent that it 
is impossible for the contractor to accomplish the work under normal 
working conditions. A completion date can only be fixed so as to be 
financially and otherwise to the best interests of the Government after 
due consideration has been given to all of the factors involved.
    (e) The Invitations for Bids shall provide that the contractors 
shall submit, simultaneously with their responses to Invitations for 
Bids, unit prices for each item of specification work in a separate 
sealed envelope. Only the envelope containing the separate item prices 
of the contractor determined to be the low bidder shall be retained by 
the representative of the Authority and shall not be opened until after 
the award is made. All other envelopes containing separate item prices 
shall be returned un- opened to each contractor by the representative of 
the Authority. In the event the low bid is rejected, the itemized prices 
of the low bidder shall be returned to him in the unopened envelope. 
Item prices submitted by contractors will not be subject to public 
perusal.
    (f) Vessel repair work contracted for by representatives of the 
National Shipping Authority is subject to the provisions of the Davis-
Bacon Act, except in those cases where at the time of the issuance of 
the Invitations for Bids the site of the work is not known. Where bids 
are being invited from bidders in more than one port area, the port area 
in which the award will be made will not be known, and the Invitations 
for Bids, accordingly, must state that the work in question is not 
subject to the Davis-Bacon Act.
    (g) The Invitations for Bids shall also include a statement of the 
per day liquidated damages, for the particular type vessel on which the 
work is to be performed.
    (h) The Invitation for Bids shall state where the bids are to be 
opened.
    (i) When Invitations for Bids are issued by a General Agent, the 
General Agent, at the time the invitations are issued shall make 
available to the local Ship Repair and Maintenance office, three (3) 
copies of the specifications, three (3) copies of a list of contractors 
to whom invitations have been sent, and three (3) copies of the 
Invitation for Bids.
    (j) Where the scope and probable cost of the work and the time 
required for effecting such work are secondary as compared to the ship's 
time, and where the preparation of formal specifications and the 
issuance of formal Invitations for Bids are not practicable, the 
representative of the Authority may orally contact as many qualified 
contractors as is feasible, in order to obtain written ``Spot Bids.'' 
Each contractor who indicates its intention to bid shall be fully 
advised as to the specific work involved and given an opportunity to 
inspect the vessel to enable it to prepare a bid. The contractor shall

[[Page 295]]

be verbally advised of a time and place for the submission of the ``Spot 
Bids.'' If such bids are invited by the General Agent, the General Agent 
shall also advise the Coast Director or his duly appointed 
representative of the time and place of opening the ``Spot Bids,'' and 
if practicable, the NSA representative shall attend such opening. If 
submission of such spot bids is not in writing the contractors shall 
immediately confirm their respective Spot Bids by written tenders. The 
representative of the Authority shall, if requested by responsive 
contractors, furnish invitations for bids and supporting specifications 
to the contractors.


<R05>
Sec. 5  Procedure for negotiated price awards.

    (a) In the award of vessel repair work upon the basis of negotiation 
or request for quotation, other than work covered by a supplemental job 
order, the contractor shall be furnished with the information provided 
for in Article 1(a) of the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract.
    (b) The contractor, within the time specified in a request for a 
quotation, may quote a price and shall submit itemized prices and the 
price breakdown provided for in Article 1(c) of the NSA-LUMPSUMREP 
Contract. In the event a mutually satisfactory price cannot be agreed 
to, a price shall be determined by the representative of the Authority 
making the award which shall be set out in the job order or the 
supplemental job order issued to the contractor. Within thirty (30) days 
from the receipt of such job order or supplemental job order the 
contractor may appeal such price to the Director of the Authority as a 
dispute under Article 27 of the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract.


<R05>
Sec. 6  Awarding of work.

    (a) Those portions of all bids reflecting the total aggregate cost 
of the work involved shall be opened publicly. The work shall be awarded 
to the contractor submitting the lowest qualified bid. The term lowest 
shall mean the bid most advantageous to the Government after evaluation 
of all bids by the application of differentials and any other relevant 
factors set forth in the Invitation for Bids. All pertinent costs of 
moving the vessel from the port where said vessel is located at the time 
bids are invited to the port of the responsive bidders' work sites and/
or plants are to be stated on the Invitation for Bids. If the vessel is 
scheduled to return to the same port where located at the time bids were 
invited, all costs of returning the vessel to that port shall also be 
included on the Invitation for Bids and considered in the bid 
evaluation.
    (b) Immediately after an award of a job order or a supplemental job 
order on a negotiated basis a written report shall be submitted by the 
representative of the Authority, making the award, to the appropriate 
Coast Director's office stating the pertinent reasons for awarding the

    (a) All work awarded under the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract is subject to 
the provisions of the Anti-Kickback Act, and is also subject to the 
provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act (except in those cases where the 
Invitations for Bids or job order state that the work covered thereby is 
not subject to the Davis-Bacon Act). Article 24 of the NSA-LUMPSUMREP 
Contract requires the compliance of Contractor and its subcontractors 
with the applicable provisions of said acts. In this respect the 
Contractor agrees in the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract to comply with the 
regulations of the Secretary of Labor made pursuant to the Anti-Kickback 
Act.
    (b) The Contractor shall, as provided in Article 24(a) of the NSA-
LUMPSUMREP Contract, post at the site of the work the wage determination 
decision of the Secretary of Labor as provided in said Article 24(a).
    (c) It shall be the responsibility of the representative of the 
Authority awarding the work to determine that the Contractor has made 
the postings required by Article 24(a) of the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract.
    (d) In lieu of submitting weekly certified copies of all payrolls to 
the Authority, as provided in Article 24(d) of the Master LUMPSUMREP 
Contract the Contractor shall maintain his weekly payrolls for a period 
of three years and submit weekly an affidavit that the payrolls of the 
Contractor for the preceding week are correct and complete, that the 
wage rates contained therein are not less than those determined by the 
Secretary of Labor and that the classifications set forth for each labor 
mechanic conforms with the work he performed. The Contractor shall also 
submit, and shall be responsible for the submission by its 
subcontractors of the Anti-Kickback Act affidavits as provided in 
Article 24(f) of the Master LUMPSUMREP Contract. The Contractor shall 
submit one copy of each of the weekly payroll and Anti-Kickback Act 
affidavits to the Records Administration Section, Maritime 
Administration, Washington 25, DC.
    (e) The representative of the Authority shall require Contractors, 
pursuant to the provisions of Article 24(d) of the NSA-LUMPSUMREP 
Contract, to classify or reclassify any class of laborers or mechanics 
employed on National Shipping Authority contract work and not listed in 
the Secretary of Labor's decision (schedule of wages). A report of such 
cases shall be forwarded to the District Ship Repair and Maintenance 
office for transmittal to the Office of Maritime Labor Policy.
    (f) The representatives of the Authority shall be responsible for 
establishing procedures insuring that Contractors are complying with the 
Davis-Bacon Act and in cases of non-compliance withhold payment of 
contractors' invoices.
    (g) The following certification shall be inserted by all contractors 
on all invoices rendered covering work awarded under the Master Repair 
Contract subject to the Anti-Kickback and Davis-Bacon Acts.

I hereby certify that in performing the work for which the invoice was

and Davis-Bacon Acts as provided

[[Page 300]]

in the Master Repair Contract and regulations of the Department of Labor 
have been complied with.


<R05>
Sec. 15  Subcontracts.

    Under Article 29 of the NSA-LUMPSUMREP Contract, the Contractor is 
authorized to subcontract portions of the work. However, the Contractor 
must obtain prior approval from the representative of the Authority, 
awarding the work, for each subcontract in an amount exceeding 10 
percent of the contract price for the work covered by a job order or 
supplemental job order.


<R05>
Sec. 16  Liquidated damages.

    (a) The liquidated damages payable for each calendar day of delay 
shall be placed on each job order and supplemental job order whether 
awarded on a competitive bid or negotiated basis.
    (b) The completion certificates are to contain the date on which 
work is actually completed, whereas the job order and supplemental job 
orders are to contain a completion date based on a fair and reasonable 
estimate of time to be allowed the contractor to perform the work. Thus, 
the difference between the completion date specified on the job order or 
supplemental job orders and on the completion certificates will be the 
period for which liquidated damages are assessed. If an extension of an 
original completion date is considered justifiable, the completion 
certificates are to bear in detail in the space provided for 
``exceptions'' the reasons why the completion dates were extended beyond 
that specified in the original job orders. The face of the Ship Repair 
Summaries (MA-159) shall reflect the amounts of liquidated damages. The 
penalty amount shall be deducted from the invoice prior to payment for 
the work involved.

<R05>
Sec. 17  Performance of work resulting from damage sustained while undergoing repairs.

    (a) When damage is sustained by a vessel during performance of 
repairs under the NSA Master Contract, negotiations for accomplishment 
of work necessary to correct such damage are to be made with the repair 
contractor involved, if practicable, and a job order issued to the 
contractor for the repair of damage. Such job orders are to be assigned 
a new number and are not to be supplemental to the original award. The 
following ``without prejudice'' clause is to be made a part of and place 
on each job order issued for the performance of work discussed in this 
section.

It is understood and agreed that the work covered by this job order is 
awarded and accepted without prejudice to, or waiver of, any rights of 
the United States or the Contractor.

    (b) If it is determined that the contractor is at fault and the 
contractor refuses to accept the responsibility, the procedure outlined 
in Article 27 of the master repair contract shall be followed. It is to 
be understood that the payment of this type of account is to be withheld 
pending establishment that the contractor involved is relieved of all 
responsibility for the damage.
    (c) In the event other than the original contractor effects the 
damage repairs immediate arrangements are to be made by and through the 
General Agent to collect from the contractor considered responsible for 
the damages.
    (d) A damage survey is to be conducted in all such cases and a 
report thereon submitted to the Chief, Division of Ship Repair and 
Maintenance, Washington, DC.

Sec. 340.1  Scope.

    This part establishes procedures for assigning priority for use by 
defense agencies, on commercial terms, of commercial shipping services, 
containers and chassis, and port facilities and services and for 
allocating vessels employed in commercial shipping services, containers 
and chassis, and port facilities and services for exclusive use by 
defense agencies (as defined in 340.2), at any time where appropriate 
under provision of title I of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 
U.S.C. App. 2061 et seq.) as determined by the Secretary of 
Transportation. The procedures will provide the means to require vessel 
and port operators to provide defense agencies with existing commercial 
services and facilities not obtainable through established 
transportation procurement procedures. Thus the procedures will minimize 
interference with commercial operations and ensure rapid response to 
defense needs in times of crisis or war.

    (a) The provisions of this rule apply pursuant to authority granted 
to the President by title I, Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended 
(50 U.S.C. App. 2061 et seq.) that authority having been delegated to 
the Secretary of Transportation, with respect to civil transportation 
services, by Sec. 322.3(b) of title 44, Code of Federal Regulations. In 
order to give priority to performance under contracts deemed necessary 
or appropriate to promote the national defense and to allocate materials 
and facilities in such manner, upon such conditions and to such extent 
as necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense, the 
following procedures shall be applicable:
    (1) In connection with deployment of the Armed Forces of the United 
States, or other requirements of the nation's defense, a defense agency 
(as defined in Sec. 340.2(h) of this part) may request priority use or 
allocation of vessels employed in commercial shipping services, 
containers, chassis, or port facilities and services.
    (2) The Secretary may authorize initiation of priority and 
allocation authority in accordance with administrative and statutory 
authorities.
    (3) The Administrator, on approval by the Secretary to initiate the 
use of priority and allocation authority under this regulation and in 
conformance with national program priorities, may direct owners and/or 
operators of vessels, containers, chassis, or port facilities to give 
priority usage to the defense agency or may allocate vessels, 
containers, chassis, or facilities for the defense agency's use during 
specified periods.
    (b) A defense agency may transmit requests for assignment of 
priority for use or for allocation of vessels, containers, chassis, and 
port facilities and services to the Secretary by letter, memorandum, or

include references to military operations plans. When classified, 
justifications may be provided separately by correspondence or staff 
coordination. NSPOs and NAOs will not include classified information.
    (d) The Administrator shall determine, before issuing an NSPO or 
NAO, that the action is necessary to meet the requirements of the 
national defense (as determined by the defense agency) and conforms to 
Secretarial guidance for coordinating the Department's crisis response, 
and that the proposed approach is the most effective way to do so. The 
Administrator, in conjunction with the defense agency, shall coordinate 
with vessel operators, container suppliers, chassis suppliers, port 
authorities and the Coast Guard to identify vessels, equipment and 
facilities to meet requirements covered by NSPOs and NAOs. The 
Administrator shall ensure that arrangements to provide defense support 
under NSPOs and NAOs satisfy the defense agency's requirements with 
minimum disruption to commercial activities.
    (e) When resources are required for movement of hazardous or other 
special cargo, the Administrator shall ensure that the Commandant of the

for vessels employed in commercial shipping services, containers, 
chassis, or port facilities and services shall coordinate with MARAD, 
the Coast Guard, vessel operators, container suppliers, chassis 
suppliers, and port authorities concerned before the need arises. The 
Administrator, after Secretarial review, may issue planning orders for 
information and guidance of affected agencies confirming tentative 
arrangements to meet the defense agencies' needs. No action will be 
taken to give effect to those arrangements until NSPOs and NAOs are 
issued at the time the services, equipment, or facilities are required.
    (h) Defense agencies shall pay for services covered by NSPOs and 
NAOs on the basis of commercial tariffs, or on the basis of contracts 
concluded between the operator interests and the defense agencies 
concerned, or on the basis of existing contracts where both parties so 
agree.
    (i) Defense agencies shall be responsible for payment of costs 
arising from:
    (1) Shifting ships to unoccupied berths for defense use;

vessels, containers, and chassis only when and to the extent that such 
vessels, containers, and chassis are available to the United States 
because of control by U.S. citizens (46 App. U.S.C. 802) or by provision 
of international agreements for use of shipping services and related 
resources for the common defense.
    (k) Recipients of NSPOs and NAOs shall notify the Administrator, 
without undue delay, when they cannot comply or are experiencing 
difficulty in complying with the provisions of the Orders.

<R05>
Sec. 1  Purpose.

    This part prescribes the standard form of marine terminal contract 
to be entered into by the United States of America, acting by and 
through the Director, National Shipping Authority (NSA) of the Maritime 
Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, with State or 
municipal authorities or private terminal operators for the provision of 
terminal operating services during civil defense emergencies or national 
emergencies declared by the President of the United States in accordance 
with existing statutory authority or by concurrent resolution of the 
Congress.


<R05>
Sec. 2  Stand-by agreements.

    The Director NSA, Maritime Administration, in advance of an 
emergency, may negotiate the standard form of terminal operating 
contract specified in Section 3, with terminal operators on a stand-by 
basis. Stand-by arrangements establish the framework of rapid initiation 
of government shipping operations at the outset of an emergency.

At port facilities, (as defined in section 1(e) of 32A CFR part 1901) 
under the control of the Maritime Administration and allocated for long 
term exclusive use by the Department of Defense (DOD), provisions will 
ordinarily be made for the use of contractors under DOD contracts to 
move DOD cargo through selected ports, to perform such services as pre-
stowing, receipt, intransit storage and loading of cargo under DOD 
procedures for the Defense Transportation System. When it becomes 
necessary to move DOD cargo through marine terminals under the control 
of the Maritime Administration, but not allocated for long term 
exclusive use by DOD, contractors will be required to perform such 
services as DOD requires for handling cargo and documenting shipments 
under the Defense Transportation System, with corresponding contractual 
obligations.

    (c) Upon the execution of this agreement the operator shall 
immediately furnish to the Regional Office, NSA, written schedules of 
the wages and contractual working conditions, (including overtime, pay, 
insurance benefits and other compensation and employment benefits) 
payable by the operator in performing the work, and whenever requested 
from time to time thereafter, the operator shall furnish similar written

[[Page 319]]

fault of the operator, its employees or terminals: Provided, That, to 
the extent not covered by insurance, the operator shall not be 
responsible to the NSA, for any loss, damage or injury resulting from 
the negligence or wrongful acts of the NSA; or from acts of the operator 
and its employees performed only because specifically so directed by the 
NSA; or from defects or other gear supplied by the United States.
    (b) The operator shall be under no liability to the United States in 
the event that the operator should fail to perform any work hereunder by 
reason of any labor shortage, dispute or difficulty, or any strike or 
lockout or any shortage of material or any act of God or peril of the 
sea or any other cause beyond the control of the operator, whether or 
not of the same or similar nature; or shall do or fail to do any act in 
reliance upon instructions of military or naval authorities.
    Art. 6. Insurance requirements and indemnification. (a) The operator 
shall procure, and maintain during the term of this agreement, pay for 
one or more policies of insurance insuring it as follows, as the basis 
for calculating compensation payable under paragraph 5(a) above:
    (1) Coverage of all piers, wharves, buildings, structures, 
facilities and equipment, as owner or in accordance with terms of lease.
    (2) Standard workman's compensation insurance and employer's 
liability insurance, including longshoremen and harbor worker's 
compensation insurance, or such of these as may be proper under 
applicable State or Federal statutes. Such insurance shall, unless 
otherwise required by applicable State or Federal statutes, be subject 
to $50,000/100,000 limits and shall be full coverage with occupational 
disease endorsement. The operator may, however, be a self-insurer 
against the risks in this subparagraph, if it has obtained the prior 
approval of the Director, NSA, such approval to be given upon the 
submission of satisfactory evidence that the operator has duly qualified 
as a self-insurer under applicable provisions of law.
    (3) Public liability insurance with limits of at least $1,000,000 
for the death or bodily injuries to one person and at least $5,000,000 
for the death or bodily injuries to more than one person in any one 
accident or occurrence.
    (4) Property damage liability insurance covering damage to or loss 
of property resulting from the negligence of the operator with a limit 
of $1,000,000 for each occurrence.
    (b) All liability insurance obtained by the operator as provided in 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section above shall name the United States as 
additional insured or provided for a waiver or subrogation.
    (c) The operator's work is incident to war activities of the United 
States and will involve risks and hazards far in excess of those 
normally incident to peacetime commercial operations. To induce the 
operator to undertake the performance of the work for the compensation 
herein provided, and thus obtain for the United States the resulting 
benefit of such reduced compensation, the United States undertakes to 
and does indemnify the operator and hold it harmless against any loss or 
damage to the terminals (whether owned, leased or occupied under 
license) and against expense (including expense of litigation), 
liability to and claims of third persons because of loss, damage or 
injury to persons, cargo, vessels, their stores, apparel or equipment, 
wharves, piers, docks, lighters, barges, scows, elevators, rail cars, 
carfloats, or other property or thing, arising through the negligence or 
fault of the operator, its employees, gear or equipment, or otherwise, 
all subject, however, to the following conditions and limitations:
    (1) The undertaking of the United States shall be applicable only 
and limited to:
    (a) For public liability the amount such loss, expense, or liability 
arising from any single catastrophe, accident or occurrence exceeds the 
sum of $1,000,000 each person and $5,000,000 per accident or the sum of 
insurance approved or required to be carried in excess of these limits, 
whichever sum is greater and
    (b) For property damage liability the amount such loss, expense or 
liability arising from any single catastrophe, accident or occurrence 
exceeds the sum of $1,000,000 per accident or the sum of insurance 
approved or required to be carried in excess of these limits whichever 
sum is greater.
    (2) The undertaking of the United States shall not be applicable and 
the United States shall have no obligation or liability in respect of 
such undertaking or otherwise, in situations in which such loss, expense 
or liability is due in whole or in part to willful and deliberate 
disregard of instructions of the Administrator or the personal failure 
to exercise good faith or insofar as the character of the work permits 
under wartime operations that degree of care normally exercised under 
like conditions in the performance of the operator's peacetime 
commercial operations, by the elected corporate officers of the operator 
or by the representative of the operator having supervision and 
direction of all operations at any terminal where the operator may 
perform services hereunder.
    (3) As soon as practicable after occurrence of any event from which 
the obligation of the United States to hold the operator harmless 
against loss, expense and liability might arise, written notice of such 
event shall be given by the operator to the United States, which notice 
shall contain full particulars of the event. If claim is made or suit is 
brought thereafter against the operator as a result or because of such 
event, the operator shall immediately deliver to the United States every 
demand, notice, summons or other process

[[Page 320]]

received by it or its representatives, and the United States shall 
provide appropriate attachment or appeal bonds or undertakings where 
required in the course of such litigation.
    (4) The operator shall cooperate with the United States and, upon 
the request of the United States, shall assist in effecting settlements, 
securing and giving evidence, obtaining the attendance of witnesses and 
in the conduct (including defense) of suits; and the United States shall 
reimburse the operator for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, other than 
loss of earnings, incurred in so doing. The operator shall not 
voluntarily, except at its own cost, make any payment, assume any 
obligation or incur any expense, other than for such immediate medical 
and surgical relief to others as shall be imperative at the time of said 
occurrence of such event.
    (5) This undertaking of the United States to hold the operator 
harmless against loss, expense and liability as herein provided, shall 
not create or give rise to any right, privilege or power in any person 
or organization, except the operator, nor shall any person or 
organization be or become entitled to join the United States as a co-
defendent in any action against the operator brought to determine the 
operator's liability or for any other purpose; Provided, however, That 
as to any risk borne or assumed by the United States through the 
undertaking set above, the United States shall be and hereby is 
subrogated by the operator to any claim, demand or cause of action 
against third persons or organizations which exists or may arise in 
favor of the operator, and the operator shall, if so required, forthwith 
execute a formal assignment or transfer of such claim, demand or cause 
of action.
    (6) This undertaking of the United States shall not apply against 
any loss or expense resulting from enemy attack upon the United States.
    Art. 7. Covenant against assignment or sublease of terminals. The 
operator shall not assign or sublet the terminals or any portion thereof 
nor grant any license with respect thereto, except in the ordinary 
course of terminal operations and subject to the approval of the NSA.
    Art. 8. Custom of the port. No rule or custom of the port in 
conflict with any provision or term of this agreement will be binding 
upon the United States, unless the operator is legally obligated to 
comply with the same pursuant to the laws of the United States or laws 
of any State thereof or pursuant to the terms, provisions, covenants and 
conditions of any lease covering the terminals and entered into between 
the operator and its lessor or licensor thereof.
    Art. 9. Extra work. The United States will neither compensate nor 
make any payments to the operator for any extra work in connection with 
the operation of terminals which it may render in addition to the work 
specifically required by this agreement, except as provided in paragraph 
3(e) of part II hereof.
    Art. 10. Status of employees. All employees of the operator or of 
any other person or organization employed in performance of the work 
shall at all times be the employees of the operator or of such other 
person or organization, as the case may be, and are not employees of the 
United States.
    Art. 11. Delegation of authority. Wherever and whenever any right, 
power or authority herein is granted or given to the United States, such 
right, power or authority may be exercised by the NSA or such agent or 
agents as the United States may appoint, and the act or acts of such 
agent or agents when taken shall constitute the act of the United States 
hereunder. In performing the work, the operator may rely upon the 
instructions and directions of the Director, NSA, his officers and 
responsible employees, or any person or agency authorized by him. 
Whenever practicable, instructions and directions to the operator shall 
be in writing and oral instructions or directions given shall be 
confirmed promptly in writing. No Director's orders or regulations shall 
have retroactive effect without the written consent of the General 
Counsel, Maritime Administration.
    Art. 12. Warranty against contingent fees. The operator warrants 
that it has not employed any person to solicit or secure this agreement 
upon any agreement for a commission, percentage, brokerage or contingent 
fee. Breach of this warranty shall give the United States the right to 
annul this agreement or in its discretion to deduct from any amount 
payable hereunder the amount of such commission, percentage, brokerage, 
or contingent fee.
    Art. 13. Equal opportunity. During the performance of this 
agreement, the operator agrees as follows:
    (a) The operator will not discriminate against any employee or 
applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, sex, age or 
national origin. The contractor will take affirmative action to insure 
that all action related to employment is taken without regard to race, 
color, religion, sex, age or national origin. Such action shall include, 
but not be limited to, employment, promotion, layoff or termination, 
direct or indirect compensation and selection for training, except where 
such provisions are governed by State civil service commissions or 
comparable government agencies. The contractor agrees to post in 
conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants, notices to be 
provided by the NSA setting forth the provisions of this 
nondiscrimination clause.
    (b) The operator will, in all solicitations or advertisements for 
employees placed by or

[[Page 321]]

on behalf of the operator, state that all qualified applicants will 
receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, 
religion, sex, age, or national origin.
    (c) The operator will send to each labor union or representative of 
workers with which it has a collective bargaining agreement or other 
contract or understanding, a notice, to be provided by the NSA, advising 
the labor union or worker's representative of the operator's commitments 
under section 202 of Executive Order No. 11246 of September 24, 1965, as 
amended, and shall post copies of the notice in conspicuous places 
available to employees and applicants for employment.
    (d) The operator will comply with all provisions of Executive Order 
No. 11246, as amended, and by the rules, regulations and orders of the 
Secretary of Labor.
    (e) The operator will furnish all information and reports required 
by Executive Order No. 11246, as amended, and by the rules, regulations 
and orders of the Secretary of Labor, or pursuant thereto, and will 
permit access to its books, records, and accounts by the NSA and the 
Secretary of Labor for purposes of investigation to ascertain compliance 
with such rules, regulations and orders.
    (f) In the event of the operator's noncompliance with the 
nondiscrimination clauses of this agreement or with any of such rules, 
regulations or orders, this agreement may be cancelled, terminated or 
suspended in whole or in part, and the operator may be declared 
ineligible for further Government contracts in accordance with 
procedures authorized in Executive Order No. 11246, as amended, and such 
other sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked as provided in 
Executive Order No. 11246, as amended, or by rule, regulation or order 
of the Secretary of Labor, or as otherwise provided by law.
    (g) The operator will include the provisions of this paragraph in 
every subcontract or purchase order unless exempted by rules, 
regulations or orders of the Secretary of Labor issued pursuant to 
section 204 of Executive Order No. 11246, as amended, so that such 
provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor. The 
operator will take such action with respect to any subcontract or 
purchase order as the NSA may direct as a means of enforcing such 
provisions, including sanctions for noncompliance: Provided, however, 
That in the event the operator becomes involved in or is threatened with 
litigation with a subcontractor or vendor as a result of such direction 
by the NSA, the operator may request the United States to enter into 
such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.
    Art. 14. Officials not to benefit. No persons elected or appointed 
as members of or delegates to Congress, themselves or by any other 
persons in trust for them, or for their use or account shall hold or 
enjoy this agreement in whole or in part, except as provided in Section 
433, Title 18, United States Code. The operator shall not employ any 
member of Congress, either with or without compensation, as an attorney, 
agent, officer or director.
    Art. 15. Right of Controller General to examine books and records. 
The Controller General of the United States or any of his duly 
authorized representatives shall have access to and the right to examine 
any pertinent books, documents, papers and records of the operator or 
any of its subcontractors engaged in the performance of the work under 
this agreement.
    Art. 16. Renegotiation. This agreement shall be deemed to contain 
all the provisions required by section 104 of the Renegotiation Act of 
1951. The operator shall, in compliance with said section 104, insert 
the provisions of this paragraph in each subcontract and purchase order 
made or issued in carrying out this agreement.
    Art. 17. Headnotes. The use of headnotes at the beginning of the 
articles of this agreement is for the purpose of description only and 
shall not be construed as limiting or in any other manner affecting the 
substance of the articles themselves.

Administration (MARAD), under authority delegated by the Secretary of 
Transportation to the Maritime Administrator, certifies, upon 
application, that certain merchant seamen are entitled to reemployment 
rights and other benefits after completion of their service on vessels 
used by the United States for a war, armed conflict, national emergency 
or maritime mobilization need. It also describes the form of 
administrative assistance MARAD will provide to the seamen certified.


<R05>
Sec. 349.2  Application for certification.

    Pursuant to 46 App. U.S.C. 1132, an individual may submit an

Sec. 349.3  Certification criteria.

    The Administrator shall apply the following criteria for certifying 
that an individual merchant seaman is entitled to reemployment rights 
and other benefits substantially equivalent to the rights and benefits 
provided by chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, for any member 
of a Reserve Component of the Armed Forces of the United States who is 
ordered to active duty. It shall be the responsibility of each applicant 
for certification to submit relevant documentation to MARAD, Office of 
Maritime Labor, Training, and Safety, MAR-250, 400 Seventh St., S.W., 
Room 7302, Washington, D.C. 20590, establishing that--
    (a) Employment as merchant seaman. The applicant was employed after 
October 8, 1996, in the activation or operation of a vessel--
    (1) in the National Defense Reserve Fleet maintained by MARAD under 
authority of section 11 of the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946 (50 
U.S.C. App. 1744) in a period in which that vessel was in use or being 
activated for use under 50 U.S.C. App. 1744(b);
    (2) that is requisitioned under section 902 of the Act (46 App. 
U.S.C. 1242); or
    (3) that is owned, chartered, or controlled by the United States and 
used by the United States for a war, armed conflict, national emergency, 
or maritime mobilization need (including for training purposes or 
testing for readiness and suitability for mission performance).
    (b) Seaman credentials. During the period of employment described in 
paragraph (a) of this section, the seaman possessed a valid license, 
certificate of registry, or merchant mariner's document issued under 
chapter 73 (as applicable) of title 46, United States Code, as required 
by 46 App. U.S.C. 1132(c).
    (c) Additional information. If applicable, periods of 
hospitalization, convalescence, illness, injury, shipwreck or detention 
beyond the mariner's control were incurred in, or aggravated during, the 
performance of employment described in Sec. 349.3(a).


<R05>
Sec. 349.4  Decision on application.

    MARAD will issue or deny certification (accompanied by an 
explanation in writing) to each applicant not later than 20 days after 
receipt of an application for certification.


<R05>
Sec. 349.5  Reemployment rights and benefits.

    (a) General. An individual who is absent from a position of 
employment, in the private or public (federal, state or local 
government) sector, because of temporary employment of any duration 
described in Sec. 349.3(a), shall be entitled to reemployment rights 
and benefits upon completion of the temporary employment as a merchant 
seaman.
    (b) Superior claims. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 4312(g), the right of a 
person to reemployment shall not entitle such person to retention 
preference or displacement rights over any person with a superior claim 
under the provisions of title 5, United States Code, relating to 
veterans and other preference eligibles.
    (c) Notification of employer. Any person who is absent from a 
position of employment by reason of service as described in Sec. 
349.3(a) shall be entitled to reemployment rights and benefits provided 
in Sec. 349.3(e) if--
    (1) The person has given advance written or verbal notice of such 
service to such person's employer, unless giving notice is precluded by 
military necessity, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of 
Defense, or, under

[[Page 323]]

all relevant circumstances, is impossible or unreasonable, pursuant to 
the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 4312(b); and
    (2) The person submits an application for reemployment with the 
employer not later than 14 days after completion of a period of service 
of less than 181 days, or not later than 90 days after the completion of 
a period of service greater than 180 days, or if submitting such 
application within such period is impossible or unreasonable through no 
fault of the person, the next first full calendar day when submission of 
such application becomes possible.
    (d) Waiver of notice requirements. A person who has not given 
notice, or who fails to report or apply for employment or re-employment 
within the appropriate period specified in paragraph (c) of this section 
shall not automatically forfeit such person's entitlement to the rights 
and benefits referred to in Sec. 349.5(e), but shall be subject to the 
rules of conduct, established by policy, and the general practices of 
the employer pertaining to explanations and discipline with respect to 
absence from scheduled work. MARAD will make a determination on the 
issue of whether notice of service was required in acting on the 
application for certification.
    (e) Exception to reemployment rights. An employer is not required to 
reemploy an individual if the employer satisfies the burden of proving 
that, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 4312(d)--
    (1) The employer's circumstances have so changed as to make such 
reemployment impossible or unreasonable, or such reemployment, if 
required, would impose an undue hardship on the employer, as defined in 
38 U.S.C. 4303(15); or
    (2) The employment which the individual left for employment as a 
merchant seaman was for a brief, nonrecurrent period and there was not 
at the time of leaving such employment any reasonable expectation that 
such employment would continue indefinitely or for a significant period.
    (f) Reemployment benefits. An individual certified by MARAD to be 
entitled to reemployment shall also be entitled to other ``benefits of 
employment'' (other than wages or salary for work performed), as defined 
in 38 U.S.C. 4303(2), that would have accrued to that individual by 
reason of an employment contract or agreement or an employer policy, 
plan or practice and includes rights and benefits under a pension plan, 
a health plan, an employee stock ownership plan, insurance coverage and 
awards, bonuses, severance pay, supplemental unemployment and benefits, 
vacations and the opportunity to select work hours or location of 
employment.
    (g) Reemployment position. (1) An individual certified by MARAD as 
being entitled to reemployment shall be promptly reemployed by the 
former employer, according to the order of priority specified in 38 
U.S.C. 4313(a), after submitting an application for reemployment. The 
three categories of priority, in ascending order, are for a merchant 
seaman who:
    (i) Served for 90 days or less;
    (ii) Served for more than 90 days; or
    (iii) Has a disability incurred in, or aggravated during, the 
performance of such merchant service.
    (2) For a person with such service related disability, the employer 
shall make ``reasonable efforts'', as defined in 38 U.S.C. 4303(10), 
``to accommodate the disability'' to allow that person to be employed in 
the position that would have been occupied had the employment with the

[[Page 328]]

    (1) It is organized under the laws of the United States or of a 
State, Territory, District, or possession thereof;
    (2) Its chief executive officer, by whatever title, and the chairman 
of its board of directors are citizens of the United States, and no more 
of its directors than a minority of the number necessary to constitute a 
quorum are non-citizens (except that in the case of corporations under 
title VI, Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended, all directors must be 
citizens of the United States) and
    (3) The controlling interest therein is owned by citizens of the

can be determined. MARAD will accept electronic options (such as 
facsimile and Internet) for transmission of required information to 
MARAD, if practicable.

amended, the form of affidavit to be used as a guide is hereby 
prescribed for execution in behalf of the primary corporation and filing 
with an application or, if required, subsequent filing within 30 days 
after the annual meeting of the stockholders (if the primary corporation

not hold the annual meeting of stockholders, the subsequent filing 
should be annually and related to the date of the original filing) as 
evidence of the continuing U.S. citizenship of a ``person'' as defined 
in section 1, Shipping Act, 1916, as amended, which shall read as

Sec. 355.3  Criteria to be applied in support of stock data in affidavit.

    (a) The same criteria should be observed in obtaining information to 
be furnished for stockholders named (direct ownership of required 
percentage of shares of stock of each class or series) in the Affidavit 
as those observed for the primary corporation. If, on the other hand, 
the ``fair inference rule'' is applied with respect to stock ownership 
(see Collier Advertising Service, Inc. v. Hudson River Day Line, 14 Fed. 
Supp. 335), the extent of U.S. citizen ownership of stock should be 
ascertained in the requisite percentage (65 percent for foreign 
operation and 95 percent for coastwise operation) in order that the 
veracity of the statutory statements made in the Affidavit (paragraph 5) 
may be relied upon by the Maritime Administration.
    (b) When applying the fair inference rule (where there are more than 
30 stockholders, except where one or more of such number actually owns 
the controlling or 75 percent interest) in order to prove U.S. citizen 
ownership in the required percentages (1) for foreign operation, 65 
percent of the shares of stock of each class or series must be shown to 
be held by persons with registered addresses within the United States to 
prove that 51 percent or controlling interest is vested in citizens of 
the United States and (2) for coastwise operation, 95 percent of the 
shares of stock of each class or series must be shown to be held by 
persons having registered addresses within the United States to prove 
that 75 percent of the interest in the corporation is vested in citizens 
of the United States.
    (c) If the primary corporation is consecutively owned by several 
``parent'' corporations (holders of 100 percent of the stock of each or 
all classes or series of stock issued and outstanding), the facts should 
be given in proper sequence either by chart or in narrative form, 
revealing the facts of stock ownership. The information with respect to 
the ultimate parent should include data relative to the basis upon which 
controlling or 75 percent (depending upon whether the primary 
corporation operates in the domestic or foreign commerce) is 
established, together with the names of the owners of record or 
beneficial owners of 5 percent or more of each class or series of stock, 
if more than one class or series, and statement that such owners are 
citizens of the United States. In any case where different classes or 
series of stock exist, each class or series shall be treated depending 
upon whether ``closely held'' or ``publicly held,'' individually in 
applying the fair inference rule, if applicable, or giving the relevant 
information with respect to United States citizens owning of record 51 
percent or 75 percent of the interest.

Sec. 355.4  Changes in citizenship data.

    It shall be incumbent upon the parties filing affidavits under this

evidence of U.S. citizenship, such material shall be furnished by the 
aforementioned primary corporation upon request by the Maritime 
Administration.

<R05>
Sec. 356.1  Purpose.

    (a) Part 356 implements the U.S. Citizenship requirements of the 
American Fisheries Act of 1998, as amended, Title II, Division C, Public 
Law 105-277, for owners, Mortgage Trustees, and Mortgagees of vessels of 
100 feet or greater in registered length that have a fishery endorsement 
to the vessel's documentation or where a fishery endorsement to the 
vessel's documentation is being sought. This part also addresses 
ancillary matters of charters, management agreements, exclusive sales or 
marketing contracts, conflicts with international agreements, 
determinations regarding violations of harvesting or processing limits, 
and exceptions for certain vessels, vessel owners and Mortgagees from 
the general requirements of the rule.
    (b) An agency may not conduct or sponsor and a person is not 
required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid

[[Page 332]]

OMB control number. Part 356 establishes a new requirement for the 
collection of information. The Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') 
has reviewed and approved the information collection requirements under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.) and 
assigned OMB control number 2133-0530 to the information collection 
requirements of this part 356.

United States, said -------- shares being -------- per centum ----(%) of 
the total number of shares of said stock (each class). [The exact figure 
as disclosed by the stock books of the corporation must be given and the 
per centum figure must not be less than 65 per centum for a corporation

of the Shipping Act, 1916, 46 App. U.S.C. Sec. 802(b), or not less than 
95 per centum for an entity that is demonstrating ownership in a vessel 
for which a fishery endorsement is sought. These per centum figures 
apply to corporate stockholders as well as to the primary corporation.] 
(The same statement should be made with reference to each class of 
stock, if there is more than one class.)

[Note: An entity that has less than 30 stockholders should use the 
following alternate paragraph (4) and strike the inapplicable paragraph 
(4).]

    4. Information as to stock, where Corporation has less than 30 
stockholders: That the information as to stock ownership, upon which the 
Corporation relies to establish that 75% of the stock ownership is 
vested in Citizens of the United States, is as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 Number of shares owned    Percentage of shares

by no means whatsoever, is any interest in said Corporation in excess of 
25% conferred upon or permitted to be exercised by any person who is not 
a Citizen of the United States; and

 or

[Note: An entity that is required to comply with the controlling 
interest requirements of section 2(b) of the Shipping Act, 1916, 46 App. 
U.S.C. Sec. 802(b), should use the following alternate paragraph (5) 
and strike the inapplicable paragraph (5).]

    5. That the Controlling Interest in (each) said Corporation, as 
established by the information hereinbefore set forth, is owned by 
Citizens of the United States; that the title to a majority of the stock 
of (each) said Corporation is vested in Citizens of the United States

    Penalty for False Statement: A fine or imprisonment, or both, are 
provided for violation of the proscriptions contained in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 
1001 (see also, 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 286, 287).
    (e) The format for an Affidavit of United States Citizenship, 
modified appropriately for limited liability companies, partnerships, 
etc., will be available from the Citizenship Approval Officer and on 
MARAD's internet web site at http://www.marad.dot.gov.
    (f) The same criteria should be observed in obtaining information to 
be furnished for stockholders named (direct ownership of required 
percentage of shares of stock of each class) in the Affidavit as those 
observed for the owner of the Fishing Industry Vessel. If, on the other 
hand, the ``fair inference rule'' is applied with respect to stock 
ownership as outlined in Sec. 356.7(c), the extent of U.S. Citizen 
ownership of stock should be ascertained in the requisite percentage (65 
% for state or federally chartered financial institutions and 95 % for 
Fishing Industry Vessel owners, bareboat charterers, trustees, as well 
as entities owning 5% or more of the stock of such entities). Any entity 
that must establish its U.S. citizenship has to submit proof of U.S. 
citizenship of any five percent stockholder of each class of stock in 
order that the veracity of the statutory statements made in the 
Affidavit (paragraph 5) may be relied upon by MARAD.
    (g) It shall be incumbent upon the parties filing affidavits under 
this part to notify the Citizenship Approval Officer in writing within 
30 calendar days of any changes in information last furnished with 
respect to the officers, directors, and stockholders, including 5 
percent or more stockholders of the issued and outstanding stock of each 
class, together with information concerning their citizenship status. If 
other than a corporation, comparable information must be filed by other 
entities owning Fishing Industry Vessel, including any entity whose 
ownership interest is being relied upon to establish 75% ownership by 
Citizens of the United States.
    (h) If additional material is determined to be essential to clarify 
or support the evidence of U.S. citizenship, such material shall be 
furnished by the owner of the Fishing Industry Vessel upon request by 
the Citizenship Approval Officer.

Sec. 356.7  Methods of establishing ownership by United States Citizens.

    (a) An entity may demonstrate that the interest in the entity (75% 
for Citizens of the United States or 51% for entities meeting the 
Controlling Interest requirements) is owned by Citizens of the United 
States either by direct proof or through the fair inference method 
depending on the size of the entity.
    (b) The ``direct proof'' method is used for closely held companies 
that have 30 or fewer stockholders. Under the direct proof method, the 
following information must be set forth in paragraph four of the 
Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship:

[[Page 339]]

    (1) The identity of the holders of stock or other equitable 
interests;
    (2) The amount of stock or interest that each stockholder owns;
    (3) A representation as to the citizenship of the stockholder; and
    (4) If the stockholder is a corporation or other entity, the names 
and citizenship of officers, directors, stockholders, etc. must be set 
out in the Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship.
    (c) The ``fair inference method'' is used by corporations whose 
stock is publicly traded (more than 30 stockholders). Use of the fair 
inference method requires that:
    (1)(i) At least 95% of the stock (each class) of the corporation be 
held by Persons having a registered U.S. address in order to infer at 
least 75% ownership by U.S. Citizens, or
    (ii) At least 65% of the stock (each class) of the corporation be 
held by Persons having a registered U.S. address in order to infer at 
least 51% ownership by U.S. Citizens; and
    (2) Disclosure be made in the Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship of the 
names and citizenship of any stockholders who holds five percent or more 
of the corporation's stock (including all classes of stock, voting and 
non-voting), officers, and directors.
    (d) If the owner of a Fishing Industry Vessel is consecutively owned 
by several ``parent'' corporations, the facts revealing the stock 
ownership of each entity must be set forth in the Affidavit of U.S. 
Citizenship.

<R05>
Sec. 356.9  Tiered ownership structures.

    Non-Citizens may not own or control, either directly through the 
first tier of ownership or in the aggregate through an interest in other 
entities at various tiers, more than 25% of the interest in an entity 
which owns a Fishing Industry Vessel. The prohibition against Non-
Citizens owning or controlling more than 25%, in the aggregate, of the 
interest in an entity that owns a Fishing Industry Vessel means, for 
example, that:
    (a) Non-Citizens that own or control a 25% stake in the ownership 
entity of a Fishing Industry Vessel at the first tier may not have any 
interest whatsoever in any entity that is being relied upon to establish 
the required 75% U.S. Citizen ownership; and
    (b) Non-Citizens that own or control less than a 25% stake at the 
first tier may participate in the ownership and control of other 
entities that are being relied upon to establish the required 75% U.S. 
Citizen ownership and control at the first tier. However, the total 
ownership and control by Non-Citizens of the entity owning a Fishing 
Industry Vessel may not exceed 25% in the aggregate as computed by 
MARAD.


<R05>
Sec. 356.11  Impermissible control by a Non-Citizen.

    (a) An impermissible transfer of control will be deemed to exist 
where a Non-Citizen, whether by agreement, contract, influence, or any 
other means whatsoever:
    (1) Has the right to direct the business of the entity which owns 
the Fishing Industry Vessel. The right to ``direct the business of the 
entity'' does not include the right to simply participate in the 
direction of the business activities of an entity which owns a Fishing 
Industry Vessel;
    (2) Has the right in the ordinary course of business to limit the 
actions of or replace the chief executive officer, a majority of the 
board of directors, any general partner or any person serving in a 
management capacity of the entity which owns the Fishing Industry 
Vessel. Standard rights of minority shareholders to restrict the actions 
of the entity are permitted provided they are unrelated to day-to-day 
business activities. These rights include provisions to require the 
consent of the minority shareholder to sell all or substantially all of 
the assets, to enter into a different business, to contract with the 
majority investors or their affiliates or to guarantee the obligations 
of majority investors or their affiliates;
    (3) Has the right to direct the transfer, operation, or manning of a 
Fishing Industry Vessel. The right to ``direct the transfer, operation, 
or manning'' of such vessels does not include the right to simply 
participate in the direction of the transfer, operation, and manning of 
such vessels;

[[Page 340]]

    (4) Has the right to restrict unduly the day-to-day business 
activities and management policies of the entity owning a Fishing 
Industry Vessel through loan covenants other than those approved for use 
by the Citizenship Approval Officer or other means;
    (5) Has the right to derive, through a minority shareholder and in 
favor of a Non-Citizen, a significantly disproportionate amount of the 
economic benefit from the ownership and operation of the Fishing 
Industry Vessel;
    (6) Has the right to control the management of or to be a 
controlling factor in the entity owning a Fishing Industry Vessel ;
    (7) Has the right to cause the sale of a Fishing Industry Vessel 
other than:
    (i) By an entity that is eligible to hold a Preferred Mortgage on 
the vessel pursuant to Sec. 356.19(a)(2) through (a)(5);
    (ii) By an approved Mortgage Trustee that is exercising loan and 
mortgage covenants on behalf of a beneficiary that qualifies as a 
Commercial Lender, a Lender Syndicate or an entity eligible to hold a 
Preferred Mortgage under Sec. 356.19(a)(2) through (a)(5);
    (iii) By an approved Mortgage Trustee that is exercising loan or 
mortgage covenants for a beneficiary that is not qualified to hold a 
Preferred Mortgage, provided that the loan or mortgage covenants have 
been approved by the Citizenship Approval Officer; or
    (iv) Where it is necessary in order to allow a Non-Citizen to 
dissolve its interest in the entity;
    (8) Absorbs all of the costs and normal business risks associated 
with ownership and operation of the Fishing Industry Vessel;
    (9) Has the responsibility for the procurement of insurance on the 
Fishing Industry Vessel, or assumes any liability in excess of insurance 
coverage; or,
    (10) Has the ability through any other means whatsoever to control 
the entity that owns a Fishing Industry Vessel.
    (b) In addition to the actions in paragraph (a) of this section that 
are considered absolute indicia of control, we will consider other 
factors which, in combination with other elements of Non-Citizen 
involvement, may be deemed impermissible control. The following factors 
may be considered indicia of control:
    (1) If a Non-Citizen minority stockholder takes the leading role in 
establishing an entity that will own a Fishing Industry Vessel;
    (2) If a Non-Citizen has the right to preclude the owner of a 
Fishing Industry Vessel from engaging in other business activities;
    (3) If a Non-Citizen and owner use the same law firm, accounting 
firm, etc.;
    (4) If a Non-Citizen and owner share the same office space, phones, 
administrative support, etc.;
    (5) If a Non-Citizen absorbs considerable costs and normal business 
risks associated with ownership and operation of the Fishing Industry 
Vessel;
    (6) If a Non-Citizen provides the start up capital for the owner or 
bareboat charterer on less than an arm's-length basis;
    (7) If a Non-Citizen time charterer has the general right to inspect 
the books and records of the owner, bareboat charterer, or time 
charterer of a Fish Processing Vessel or Fish Tender Vessel;
    (8) If the owner or bareboat charterer uses the same insurance 
agent, law firm, accounting firm, or broker of any Non-Citizen with whom 
the owner or a bareboat charterer has entered into a mortgage, long-term 
or exclusive sales or marketing agreement, unsecured loan agreement, or 
management agreement; or
    (9) If a Non-Citizen has the right to control, whether through sale, 
lease or other method, the fishing quota, fishing rights or processing 
rights allocated to a vessel or vessel-owning entity.
    (c) In most cases, any single factor listed in paragraph (b) of this 
section will not be sufficient to deem an entity a Non-Citizen. However, 
a combination of several factors listed in paragraph (b) of this section 
may increase our concern as to whether the entity complies with the U.S. 
Citizen ownership and control provisions of the AFA and any single 
factor listed in paragraph (b) of this section may be the basis for a 
request from us for further information.
    (d) If we have a concern regarding a Non-Citizen, we will notify the 
entity

[[Page 341]]

of the concern and work with the entity toward a satisfactory 
resolution, provided there is no verifiable evidence of fraud. 
Resolution of any control issues may result in a request by us for 
additional information to clarify the intent of the provision or to 
amend or delete the provision in question.
    (e) Information that is specifically required to be submitted for 
our consideration is set out in Sec. 356.13. However, in determining 
whether an entity has control over a Fishing Industry Vessel, we may 
review any contract or agreement that may, by any means whatsoever, 
result in a transfer of control to a Non-Citizen.

                Subpart C_Requirements for Vessel Owners


<R05>
Sec. 356.13  Information required to be submitted by vessel owners.

    (a) In order to be eligible to document a Fishing Industry Vessel 
with a fishery endorsement, the entity that owns the vessel must submit 
documentation to demonstrate that 75 percent (75%) of the interest in 
such entity is owned and controlled by Citizens of the United States. 
Unless otherwise exempted, the following documents must be submitted to 
the Citizenship Approval Officer in support of a request for a 
determination of U.S. Citizenship:
    (1) An Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship. This affidavit, set out in 
Sec. 356.15, must contain all required facts, at all tiers of 
ownership, needed for determining the citizenship of the owner of the 
Fishing Industry Vessel.
    (2) A certified copy of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of 
the owner of the Fishing Industry Vessel, and any parent corporation, 
must be submitted. The certification must be by the Secretary of State 
in which the corporation is incorporated or by the Secretary of the 
corporation. For entities other than corporations, comparable certified 
documents must be submitted. For example, for a limited liability 
company, a copy of the Certificate of Formation filed with a State must 
be submitted, along with a certified copy of the Limited Liability 
Company Operating Agreement;
    (3) An Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship for each charterer of a Fishing 
Industry Vessel, with the exception of time or voyage charterers of Fish 
Processing Vessels and Fish Tender Vessels permitted under Sec. 
356.39(b)(2);
    (4) A copy of any time charter or voyage charter to a Non-Citizen of 
a Fish Tender Vessel or Fish Processing Vessel;
    (5) Any loan agreements or other financing documents applicable to a 
Fishing Industry Vessel where the lender has not been approved by MARAD 
to hold a Preferred Mortgage on Fishing Industry Vessels, excepting 
financing documents that are exempted from review pursuant to Sec. 
356.19(d) and loan documents that have received general approval from 
the Citizenship Approval Officer pursuant to Sec. 356.21 for use with 
an approved Mortgage Trustee.
    (6) A description of any operating and/or management agreements 
entered into between the owner or bareboat charterer of a Fishing 
Industry Vessel and an entity that has not been determined by MARAD to 
be a U.S. Citizen, accompanied by a representation and warranty that the 
agreement does not contain any provisions that convey control over the 
vessel or vessel-owning entity to a Non-Citizen;
    (7) Copies of any sales or purchase agreements that relate to the 
sale or purchase of all or a significant portion of a vessel's catch 
where the agreement is with an entity that has not been determined by 
MARAD to be a U.S. Citizen and the agreement contains provisions that 
could convey control to a Non-Citizen other than those expressly 
authorized in Sec. 356.43. Agreements that only contain provisions 
expressly authorized in Sec. 356.43 do not have to be submitted; 
however, the agreements and the parties to the agreements must be 
identified;
    (8) Any stockholder's agreement, voting trust agreements, or any 
other pooling agreements, including any proxy appointment, relating to 
the ownership of all classes of stock, whether voting or non-voting of 
the owner of the Fishing Industry Vessel, including any parent 
corporation or other stockholder whose stock is being

[[Page 342]]

relied upon to establish 75 percent U.S. Citizen ownership;
    (9) Any agreements relating to an option to buy or sell stock or 
other comparable equity interest in the owner of the Fishing Industry 
Vessel, or Fish Tender Vessel, or any agreement that restricts the sale 
of such stock or equity interests in the owner of the Fishing Industry 
Vessel, including any parent corporation or other stockholder whose 
stock is being relied upon to establish 75 percent U.S. Citizen 
ownership;
    (10) Any documents relating to a merger, consolidation, liquidation 
or dissolution of the owner of the Fishing Industry Vessel, including 
any parent corporation where all of the parties have not been determined 
by the Citizenship Approval Officer to be U.S. Citizens;
    (11) Disclosure of any interlocking directors or other officials by 
and between the owner of a Fishing Industry Vessel (including any parent 
corporation) and any Non-Citizen minority stockholder of the owner and 
any parent corporation. This requirement is also applicable to any 
lender, purchaser of fish catch, or other entity that is a Non-Citizen;
    (12) Any contract or agreement that purports to sell, lease or 
otherwise transfer to a Non-Citizen the fishing rights, a fishing quota, 
a processing quota or any other right allocated to a vessel owner, 
bareboat charterer, or a particular Fishing Industry Vessel; and
    (13) A copy of the Large Vessel Certification required by Sec. 
356.47.
    (b) In the event the owner or bareboat charterer of a Fishing 
Industry Vessel enters into any agreement reflected in any of the 
documents set forth in paragraph (a) of this section after the 
submission of the Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship, the owner or bareboat 
charterer must notify the Citizenship Approval Officer within 30 
calendar days. Failure to notify the Citizenship Approval Officer of 
such agreements within the prescribed time may result in the vessel 
owner being deemed ineligible to document the vessel with a fishery 
endorsement.

[65 FR 44877, July 19, 2000, as amended at 68 FR 5579, Feb. 4, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 356.15  Filing of affidavit of U.S. Citizenship.

    (a) New owners of Fishing Industry Vessel after October 1, 2001, 
must file the Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship and other required 
documentation with the Citizenship Approval Officer in order for the 
Citizenship Approval Officer to make a determination whether the owner 
is eligible to own a vessel with a fishery endorsement to the vessel's 
documentation. A vessel may not receive a fishery endorsement to its 
documentation or operate in the fisheries of the United States before 
this determination has been made.
    (b) If the Citizenship Approval Officer believes that there is a 
defect in the Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship or the supporting 
documentation, the applicant will be notified and will be given an 
opportunity to work with the Citizenship Approval Officer to resolve the 
matter before a determination is made whether the applicant qualifies as 
a U.S. Citizen.
    (c) A vessel owner that has a valid fishery endorsement prior to 
October 1, 2001, must obtain a citizenship determination from the 
Citizenship Approval Officer no later than October 1, 2001, which states 
that the owner is a U.S. Citizen eligible to own a vessel with a fishery 
endorsement. If the owner obtains the required determination from the 
Citizenship Approval Officer, the fishery endorsement will remain valid 
and will be subject to renewal at the time of its next regularly 
scheduled annual filing to document the vessel with the Coast Guard, at 
which point the owner will be required to obtain an annual ruling from 
the MARAD's Citizenship Approval Officer that it is still a U.S. 
Citizen. If a vessel owner that owns a vessel with a valid fishery 
endorsement prior to October 1, 2001, does not obtain the required 
determination from the Citizenship Approval Officer by October 1, 2001, 
the vessel's fishery endorsement may be deemed invalid. In order to 
obtain a new fishery endorsement, the vessel owner will be required to 
obtain a citizenship determination from the Citizenship Approval Officer 
and to apply to the U.S. Coast Guard for a new fishery endorsement.

[[Page 343]]

    (d) The owner of a Fishing Industry Vessel or a prospective owner of 
such a vessel may request a letter ruling from the Citizenship Approval 
Officer in order to determine whether the owner under a proposed 
ownership structure will qualify as a U.S. Citizen that is eligible to 
document the vessel with a fishery endorsement. A complete request for a 
letter ruling must be accompanied by an Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship 
and all other documentation required by `` 356.13. The Citizenship 
Approval Officer will issue a letter ruling based on the ownership 
structure that is proposed; however, the Citizenship Approval Officer 
reserves the right to reverse the determination if any of the elements 
of the ownership structure, contractual arrangements, or other material 
relationships are altered when the vessel owner submits the executed 
Affidavits and supporting documentation.

<R05>
Sec. 356.17  Annual requirements for vessel owners.

    (a) An owner of a Fishing Industry Vessel must submit a 
certification in the form of an Affidavit of United States Citizenship 
to the Citizenship Approval Officer on an annual basis as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section. The vessel owner does not have to submit 
duplicate copies of documents that have already been submitted and that 
have not changed, provided a copy is still retained by us. This annual 
certification requirement does not excuse the owner from the 
requirements of Sec. 356.5 to notify the Citizenship Approval Officer 
throughout the year when changes in the citizenship information occur.
    (b) The annual certification required by paragraph (a) of this 
section must be filed at least 45 days prior to the renewal date for the 
vessel's documentation and fishery endorsement. Where multiple Fishing 
Industry Vessels are owned by the same entity or by entities that 
ultimately have common ownership, an Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship and 
supporting documentation may be filed for all of the vessels in 
conjunction with the first vessel documentation renewal during each 
calendar year. Any information or supporting documentation unique to a 
particular vessel that would normally be required to be submitted under 
Sec. 356.13 or any other provision of this part 356 such as charters, 
management agreements, loans or financing agreements, sales, purchase or 
marketing agreements, or exemptions claimed under this part must be 
submitted with the annual filing for that vessel if the documents are 
not already on file with the Citizenship Approval Officer.
    (c) Failure to file the annual certification in a timely manner may 
result in the expiration of the vessel's fishery endorsement, which will 
prohibit the vessel from operating in the fisheries of the United 
States.

<R05>
Sec. 356.19  Requirements to hold a Preferred Mortgage.

    (a) In order for a Mortgagee to be eligible to obtain a Preferred 
Mortgage on a Fishing Industry Vessel, it must be:
    (1) A Citizen of the United States;
    (2) A state or federally chartered financial institution that is 
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;
    (3) A farm credit lender established under title 12, chapter 23, of 
the United States Code (12 U.S.C. 2001 et seq.);
    (4) A commercial fishing and agriculture bank established pursuant 
to State law;
    (5) A Commercial Lender organized under the laws of the United 
States or of a State and eligible to own a vessel under 46 U.S.C. 
12102(a); or
    (6) A Mortgage Trustee that complies with the requirements of 46 
U.S.C. 31322(f) and 46 CFR 356.27 through 356.37.
    (b) A Mortgagee must demonstrate to the Citizenship Approval Officer 
that it satisfies one of the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of 
this section before it will be qualified to obtain a Preferred Mortgage 
on a Fishing Industry Vessel after April 1, 2003. A Mortgagee that has 
an existing Preferred Mortgage on a Fishing Industry Vessel prior to 
April 1, 2003, will be required to demonstrate that it satisfies one of

[[Page 344]]

the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section before the 
vessel's next certificate of documentation renewal date after April 1, 
2003. Failure to submit the required information may result in the loss 
of the preferred status for the mortgage. A sample format that may be 
used to submit the required information for Mortgagees, Commercial 
Lenders and Lender Syndicates is available on the MARAD website at

submitted in order to make such a demonstration for each category in 
paragraph (a) is as follows:
    (1) If a Mortgagee plans to qualify as a United States Citizen under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Mortgagee must file an Affidavit 
of United States Citizenship demonstrating that it complies with the 
citizenship requirements of 46 U.S.C. 12102(c) and section 2(c) of the 
1916 Act, which require that 75% of the ownership and control in the 
Mortgagee be vested in U.S. Citizens at each tier and in the aggregate. 
In addition to the Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship, a certified copy of 
the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, or other comparable corporate 
documents must be submitted to the Citizenship Approval Officer.
    (2) A state or federally chartered financial institution must 
provide a certification that indicates whether it is a state chartered 
or federally chartered financial institution and that certifies that it 
is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC''). The 
certification must include the FDIC Certification Number assigned to the 
institution.
    (3) A farm credit lender must provide a certification indicating 
that it qualifies as a farm credit lender established under title 12, 
chapter 23, of the United States Code (12 U.S.C. 2001 et seq.);
    (4) A commercial fishing and agriculture bank must provide a 
certification indicating that it has been lawfully established as a 
commercial fishing and agriculture bank pursuant to State law and that 
it is in good standing;
    (5) A Commercial Lender that seeks to be qualified to hold a 
Preferred Mortgage directly or through a Mortgage Trustee must provide 
evidence that it is engaged primarily in the business of lending and 
other financing transactions and a certification that it has a loan 
portfolio in excess of $100 million, of which no more than 50 percent of 
the dollar amount of the loan portfolio consists of loans to borrowers 
in the commercial fishing industry. The certification must include 
information regarding the approximate size of the loan portfolio and the 
percentage of the portfolio that consists of loans to borrowers in the 
commercial fishing industry. A Commercial Lender that seeks to be 
qualified to hold a Preferred Mortgage directly must also submit an 
Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship to the Citizenship Approval Officer to 
demonstrate that it qualifies as one of the following:
    (i) An individual who is a citizen of the United States;
    (ii) An association, trust, joint venture, or other entity--
    (A) All of whose members are citizens of the United States; and
    (B) That is capable of holding title to a vessel under the laws of

    (v) The United States Government; or
    (vi) The government of a State.
    (6) A Mortgage Trustee must submit the Mortgage Trustee Application

an entity eligible to hold a preferred mortgage under paragraphs (a)(1) 
through (5) of this section, the Mortgage Trustee must

[[Page 345]]

submit to the Citizenship Approval Officer copies of the trust 
agreement, security agreement, loan documents, preferred mortgage, and 
any issuance, assignment or transfer of interest so that a determination 
can be made as to whether any of the arrangements results in an 
impermissible transfer of control of the vessel to a person not eligible 
to own a vessel with a fishery endorsement under 46 U.S.C. 12102(c).
    (c) A Mortgagee is required to provide the certification required by 
paragraph (b) of this section to the Citizenship Approval Officer on an 
annual basis during the time in which it holds a preferred mortgage on a 
Fishing Industry Vessel. The annual certification must be submitted at 
least 30 calendar days prior to the annual anniversary date of the 
original approval. The Citizenship Approval Officer will notify a 
Mortgagee if the Mortgagee fails to submit the required annual 
certification. If the Mortgagee does not provide the certification 
within 30 calendar days of the mailing date of the delinquency notice, 
the mortgage will no longer qualify as a Preferred Mortgage.
    (d) The following entities may exercise rights under loan or 
mortgage covenants with respect to a Fishing Industry Vessel without 
obtaining MARAD approval:

submitted the appropriate certification to the Citizenship Approval 
Officer under paragraph (b) of this section; and
    (2) An approved Mortgage Trustee that is holding a Preferred 
Mortgage for a beneficiary that is qualified to hold a Preferred 
Mortgage under paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section or for a 
beneficiary that qualifies as a Commercial Lender or a Lender Syndicate 
and that has made an appropriate certification to the Citizenship 
Approval Officer that it meets the requirements of either Sec. 356.3(g) 
or Sec. 356.3(n).
    (e) An entity that holds a Preferred Mortgage on a Fishing Industry 
Vessel or that is using a Mortgage Trustee to hold a Preferred Mortgage 
for its benefit may request a letter ruling from the Citizenship 
Approval Officer in order to determine whether a mortgage or mortgage 
trust arrangement is in compliance with the regulations in this part. 
The Citizenship Approval Officer reserves the right to reverse any 
advice given under a letter ruling if any of the elements of the 
proposed loan or mortgage are materially altered or if the entity 
requesting the letter ruling has failed to fully disclose all relevant 
information.

Sec. 356.21  General approval of standard loan or mortgage agreements.

    (a) A lender that is engaged in the business of financing Fishing 
Industry Vessels and that is not a Commercial Lender or Lender Syndicate 
using a Mortgage Trustee to hold a Preferred Mortgage for its benefit or 
an entity that is otherwise qualified to hold a Preferred Mortgage on 
Fishing Industry Vessels pursuant to Sec. 356.19(a)(2) through (a)(5), 
may apply to the Citizenship Approval Officer for general approval of 
its standard loan and mortgage agreements for such vessels. In order to 
obtain general approval for its standard loan and mortgage agreements, a 
lender using an approved Mortgage Trustee must submit to the Citizenship 
Approval Officer:
    (1) A copy of its standard loan or mortgage agreement for Fishing 
Industry Vessel, including all covenants that may be included in the 
loan or mortgage agreement; and,
    (2) A certification that it will not use covenants or restrictions 
in the loan or mortgage agreement outside of those approved by the 
Citizenship Approval Officer without obtaining the prior approval of the 
Citizenship Approval Officer.
    (b) A lender that receives general approval may enter into loans and 
mortgages on Fishing Industry Vessel without prior approval from us of 
each individual loan or mortgage; provided, that the loan or mortgage 
conforms to the standard agreement approved by the Citizenship Approval 
Officer and does not include any other covenants that have not been 
approved by the Citizenship Approval Officer.
    (c) The lender must provide an annual certification to the 
Citizenship

[[Page 346]]

Approval Officer certifying that all loans and mortgages on Fishing 
Industry Vessel entered into under this general approval conform to the 
standard agreement approved by us and do not contain deviations from the 
standard agreement or covenants that were not reviewed and approved by 
the Citizenship Approval Officer. The certification must be submitted at 
least 30 calendar days prior to the annual anniversary date of the 
previous approval.
    (d) If the lender wishes to use covenants that were not approved 
pursuant to this section, it must submit the new covenants to the 
Citizenship Approval Officer for approval.
    (e) A lender that has received general approval for its lending 
program and that uses covenants in a loan or mortgage on a Fishing 
Industry Vessel that have not been approved by the Citizenship Approval 
Officer will be subject to loss of its general approval and the 
Citizenship Approval Officer may review and approve all of the lender's 
mortgage and loan covenants on a case-by-case basis. The Citizenship 
Approval Officer may also determine that the arrangement results in an 
impermissible transfer of control to a Non-Citizen and therefore does 
not meet the requirements to qualify as a Preferred Mortgage. If the 
lender knowingly files a false certification with the Citizenship 
Approval Officer or has used covenants in a loan or mortgage on a 
Fishing Industry Vessel that are materially different from the approved 
covenants, it may also be subject to civil and criminal penalties 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001.

publication in the Federal Register of the disapproval notice, the 
disapproved Mortgage Trustee must either transfer its fiduciary 
responsibilities to a successor Mortgage Trustee that has been approved 
by the Citizenship Approval Officer or cure the defect in its approval. 
The preferred status of the mortgage will be maintained during the 30

all or a significant portion of its catch where the contract or 
agreement is solely for the purpose of employment of certain vessels on 
an exclusive basis for a specified period of time. Such contracts or

approval include provisions that:
    (1) Specify that the owner or bareboat charterer agrees to sell and 
purchaser agrees to procure, on a preferential basis, a certain quantity 
of fish caught by a vessel owner or bareboat charterer on a specific

obtain the approval of the Citizenship Approval Officer prior to 
entering into any agreement or contract with a Non-Citizen for the sale 
of all or a significant portion of a vessel's catch if the agreement or 
contract contains provisions that in any way convey to the purchaser of 
the vessel's catch control over the operation, management or harvesting 
activities of the vessel, vessel owner, or bareboat charterer other than 
as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) An owner or bareboat charterer must submit, with its Affidavit

           Subpart G_Special Requirements for Certain Vessels


<R05>
Sec. 356.47  Special requirements for large vessels.

    (a) Unless exempted in paragraph (b), (c) or (d) of this section, a 
vessel is not eligible for a fishery endorsement under 46 U.S.C. 12108 
if:
    (1) It is greater than 165 feet in registered length;
    (2) It is more than 750 gross registered tons (as measured pursuant 
to 46 U.S.C. Chapter 145) or 1900 gross registered tons (as measured 
pursuant to 46 U.S.C. Chapter 143); or
    (3) It possesses a main propulsion engine or engines rated to 
produce a total of more than 3,000 shaft horsepower; such limitation 
shall not include auxiliary engines for hydraulic power, electrical 
generation, bow or stern thrusters, or similar purposes.
    (b) A vessel that meets one or more of the conditions in paragraph 
(a) of this section may still be eligible for a fishery endorsement if:
    (1) A certificate of documentation was issued for the vessel and 
endorsed with a fishery endorsement that was effective on September 25, 
1997;
    (2) The vessel is not placed under foreign registry after October 
21, 1998; and,
    (3) In the event of the invalidation of the fishery endorsement 
after October 21, 1998, application is made for a new fishery 
endorsement within 15 business days of the receipt of written 
notification from MARAD or the Coast Guard identifying the reason for 
such invalidation. The fishery endorsement of a Fishing Industry Vessel 
that meets the criteria of paragraph (a) of this section is not deemed 
to be invalid for purposes of complying with this paragraph (a)(3), if 
the vessel is purchased pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 31329 by a Mortgagee that 
is not eligible to own a vessel with a fishery endorsement, provided 
that the Mortgagee is eligible to hold a preferred mortgage on such 
vessel at the time of the purchase;
    (c) A vessel that is prohibited from receiving a fishery endorsement 
under paragraph (a) of this section will be eligible if the owner of 
such vessel demonstrates to MARAD that the regional fishery management 
council of jurisdiction established under section 302(a)(1) of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 
1852(a)(1)) has recommended after October 21, 1998, and the Secretary of 
Commerce has approved, conservation and management measures in 
accordance with the American Fisheries Act of 1998, Title II, Division 
C, Public Law 105-277, to allow such vessel to be used in fisheries 
under such council's authority.
    (d) A vessel that meets one or more of the conditions in paragraph 
(a) of

[[Page 353]]

this section may still be eligible for a fishery endorsement if the 
vessel is engaged exclusively in the menhaden fishery in the geographic 
region governed by the South Atlantic Fisheries Council or the Gulf of 
Mexico Fisheries Council.
    (e) The owner of a vessel that meets any of the criteria in 
paragraph (a) of this section is required to submit a certification each 
year in conjunction with its Affidavit of U.S. Citizenship in order to 
document that the vessel is eligible for documentation with a fishery 
endorsement. The certification should indicate that the vessel meets the 
criteria of paragraph (a) of this section; however, it is eligible to be 
documented with a fishery endorsement because it complies with the 
requirements of either paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section. A 
sample form for the certification is available on the MARAD Web site at 
http://www.marad.dot.gov/afa.html or may be obtained by contacting the 
Citizenship Approval Officer.

the vessel's fishery endorsement, the following penalties may apply:
    (a) The vessel's fishery endorsement may be revoked;
    (b) A fine of up to $100,000 may be assessed against the vessel

economic zone of the United States; and
    (c) The owner, representative or agent may be subject to additional 
fines, penalties or both for violation of the proscriptions of 18 U.S.C. 
286, 287, and 1001.

<R04>
                   Subpart H_International Agreements


<R05>
Sec. 356.53  Conflicts with international agreements.

    (a) If the owner or Mortgagee of a Fishing Industry Vessel believes 
that there is a conflict between the AFA or 46 CFR part 356 and any 
international treaty or agreement to which the United States is a party 
on July 24, 2001, and to which the United States is currently a party, 
the owner or Mortgagee may petition the Chief Counsel of the Maritime 
Administration at any time after July 19, 2000 to request a ruling that 
all or part of the requirements of this part 356 do not apply to that 
particular owner or particular Mortgagee with respect to a specific 
vessel; provided, the petitioner had an ownership interest in the 
Fishing Industry Vessel, or a mortgage on the vessel in the case of a 
Mortgagee, on July 24, 2001, and is covered by the international 
agreement.
    (b) A petition for exemption from the requirements of this part 356 
must include:
    (1) Evidence of the ownership structure, or mortgage structure in 
the case of a Mortgagee, of the Fishing Industry Vessel as of July 24, 
2001 (or on the date of the petition, for petitions filed prior to July 
24, 2001), and any subsequent changes to the ownership structure, or 
mortgage structure in the case of a Mortgagee, of the vessel;
    (2) A copy of the provisions of the international agreement or 
treaty which the owner or mortgagee believes are in conflict with the 
regulations in this part 356;
    (3) A detailed description of how the provisions of the 
international agreement or treaty and the regulations in this part 356 
are in conflict; and
    (4) A certification in all petitions filed on or after July 24, 
2001, that no interest in the vessel-owning entity has been transferred 
to a Non-Citizen after July 24, 2001.
    (c) A separate petition must be filed for each Fishing Industry 
Vessel for which the vessel owner or a Mortgagee is requesting an 
exemption unless the Chief Counsel authorizes consolidated filing. 
Petitions should include two copies of all materials and should be

[[Page 355]]

sent to the following address: Maritime Administration, Chief Counsel, 
Room 7228, 400 7th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590.
    (d) Upon receipt of a complete petition, the Chief Counsel may 
publish a notice in the Federal Register requesting public comment if 
the petition presents unique issues that have not been addressed in 
previous determinations. The Federal Register notice will include the 
petitioner's descriptions regarding how the AFA and this part 356 are in 
conflict with a particular investment treaty or agreement, but it will 
not include proprietary or confidential information about the 
petitioner. The Chief Counsel, in consultation with other departments 
and agencies within the Federal Government that have responsibility or 
expertise related to the interpretation or application of international 
investment agreements (e.g., the Department of State, United States 
Trade Representative, Department of Treasury, etc.), will review the 
petition and the public comments, if any, to determine whether the 
international agreement and the requirements of the AFA and this part 
356 are in conflict and, absent any extenuating circumstances, will 
render a decision within 120 days of the receipt of a fully completed 
petition. If MARAD's Chief Counsel determines after the receipt of a 
fully completed petition that there are extenuating circumstances that 
will preclude a decision from being rendered on the petition within 120 
days, the petitioner will be notified around the 90th day and provided 
with an estimated date on which a decision will be rendered.
    (e) To the extent that it is determined that an international 
agreement covering the petitioner is in conflict with the requirements 
of this part 356, the AFA, 46 U.S.C. 31322(a), 46 U.S.C. 12102(c), and 
this part 356 will not be applied to the petitioner with respect to the 
specific vessel. If the petitioner is a vessel owner, it will be 
required to comply with the documentation requirements as in effect 
prior to passage of the AFA on October 21, 1998. If the petitioner is a 
Mortgagee, it will be subject to requirements of 46 U.S.C. 31322(a) as 
in effect prior to passage of the AFA with regard to the mortgage on the 
particular vessel covered by the petition. Decisions of the Chief 
Counsel may be appealed to the Maritime Administrator within 15 business 
days of issuance.
    (f) The owner of a Fishing Industry Vessel that is determined 
through the petition process to be exempt from all or part of the 
requirements of this part 356 must submit evidence of its ownership 
structure to the Chief Counsel on an annual basis. The owner must 
specifically set forth:
    (1) The Vessel's current ownership structure;
    (2) The identity of all Non-Citizen owners and the percentage owned;
    (3) Any changes in the ownership structure that have occurred since 
the filing of the last Affidavit; and,
    (4) A certification that no interest in the vessel was transferred 
to a Non-Citizen after July 24, 2001.
    (g) The provisions of this part 356 shall apply:
    (1) To all owners and Mortgagees of a Fishing Industry Vessel who 
acquired an interest in the vessel after July 24, 2001; and
    (2) To the owner of a Fishing Industry Vessel on July 24, 2001, if 
any ownership interest in that owner is transferred to or otherwise 
acquired by a Non-Citizen or if the percentage of foreign ownership in 
the vessel is increased after such date.
    (3) An ownership interest is deemed to be transferred under this 
paragraph (g) if:
    (i) There is a transfer of direct ownership interest in the primary 
vessel owning entity. If the primary vessel owning entity is wholly 
owned by another entity, the parent entity will be considered the 
primary vessel owning entity; or
    (ii) There is a transfer of indirect ownership at any tier.
    (4) A transfer of interest in a vessel owner does not include:
    (i) Transfers of disparately held shares of a vessel-owning entity 
if it is a publicly traded company and the total of the shares 
transferred in a particular transaction equals less than 5% of the 
shares in that class. An interest in a vessel owning entity that exceeds 
5% of the shares in a class can not be sold to the same Non-Citizen 
through

[[Page 356]]

multiple transactions involving less than 5% of the shares of that class 
of stock in order to maintain the exemption for the vessel owner; or
    (ii) Transfers pursuant to a divorce or death.

<R04>
        Subpart I_Review of Harvesting and Processing Compliance


<R05>
Sec. 356.55  Review of compliance with harvesting and processing quotas.

    (a) Upon the request of either the North Pacific Fishery Management 
Council (``NPFMC'') or the Secretary of Commerce, the Chief Counsel will 
review any allegation that an individual or entity has exceeded the 
allowable percentage for harvesting or processing pollock as provided 
for in section 210(e)(1) or (2) of the AFA.
    (b) Following a request for MARAD review under paragraph (a) of this 
section, the NPFMC and the Secretary of Commerce (through the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Marine Fisheries 
Service) will transmit to MARAD any relevant information in their 
possession including, but not limited to:
    (1) The identity of the parties alleged to have exceeded the 
excessive share caps;
    (2) The relevant harvesting or processing data (the amount harvested 
or processed by particular parties);
    (3) Any information that would be helpful in determining if the 
parties are related;
    (4) Any information regarding the ownership structure of the 
parties, including:
    (i) Articles of incorporation;
    (ii) Bylaws;
    (iii) Identity of shareholders and the percentage owned;
    (iv) Any contracts or agreements that would demonstrate ownership or 
control of one party by another allegedly related party; and
    (v) Any other evidence that would demonstrate ownership or control 
of one party by another allegedly related party.
    (c) If MARAD determines during the course of its review that 
additional information is required from the parties alleged to have 
exceeded the excessive share cap, the Chief Counsel will advise the 
Secretary of Commerce and/or the NPFMC what information is required. The 
Secretary and/or the NPFMC will request that specific parties submit the 
required information to MARAD.
    (d) The Chief Counsel will make a finding as soon as practicable and 
will submit it to the Secretary of Commerce and the NPFMC.
    (e) For purposes of this section, if 10% or more of the interest in 
an entity is owned or controlled either directly or indirectly by 
another individual or entity, the two entities will be considered the 
same entity for purposes of applying the harvesting and processing caps.
    (1) For purposes of this section, an entity will be deemed to have 
an ownership interest in a pollock harvesting or processing entity if it 
either owns a percentage of the pollock harvesting or processing entity 
directly or if ownership can be traced through intermediate entities to 
the pollock harvesting or processing entity. To determine the percentage 
of ownership interest that an entity has in a pollock harvesting or 
processing entity where the ownership interest passes through one or 
more intermediate entities, the entity's percentage of direct interest 
in an intermediate entity is multiplied by the intermediate entity's 
percentage of direct or indirect interest in the pollock harvesting or 
processing entity.
    (2) For purposes of this section, an entity will be deemed to 
exercise 10% or greater control over a pollock harvesting or processing 
entity if:
    (i) It has the right to direct the business of the pollock 
harvesting or processing entity;
    (ii) It has the right to appoint members to the management team of 
the pollock harvesting or processing entity such as the directors of a 
corporation or is a general partner or joint venturer in a harvesting or 
processing entity;
    (iii) It has the right to direct the business of an entity that 
directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% of a harvesting or 
processing entity; or
    (iv) It owns 50% or more of an entity that owns or controls 10 
percent of a

[[Page 357]]

pollock harvesting or processing entity.
    (f) If the Secretary of Commerce determines that there is enough 
evidence to pursue an enforcement action for violation of the harvesting 
or processing caps contained in section 210(e) of the AFA, the Person 
against whom an enforcement action is taken is entitled to notice and an 
opportunity for a hearing before the Secretary of Commerce in accordance 
with 5 U.S.C. 554.

Sec. 370.1  Definitions.

    (a) Time-barred claim means a claim against the Government, for 
which the statutory period for filing suit has expired.
    (b) Contract includes every agreement or contract entered into by 
the Maritime Administrator and/or Maritime Subsidy Board, the Director 
National Shipping Authority or their delegatee.

<R05>
Sec. 370.2  General policy.

    (a) Time-barred claims shall be rejected, except as follows:
    (1) A time-barred claim which could be asserted in court by way of 
set-off against a claim in favor of the United States arising out of the 
same contract may be considered in an overall settlement where 
settlement will result in a net payment to the United States, provided 
claimant releases the United States from all claims arising from or in 
any way connected with said contract.
    (2) Time-barred claims in favor of friendly foreign governments 
shall not be rejected solely because they are time-barred. However, 
should any such government adopt the practice of asserting the statute 
of limitations as a defense against claims of the United States, the 
time-barred claims of that government shall be rejected.
    (3) Time-barred claims arising under Second Seamen's War Risk 
insurance (or similar earlier types of crew insurance) where the policy 
was issued or the risks were assumed by the Maritime Administration (or 
its predecessors), shall not be rejected where the beneficiaries were 
precluded from receiving the proceeds of the policy by reason of 
regulations or orders of the U.S. Government (i) by reason of the 
beneficiary being physically or mentally unable to present the claim, 
(ii) by the beneficiaries being unaware of their entitlement to the 
proceeds in question, or (iii) where the claim is not ``stale'' under 
general principles of equity.
    (b) For the purpose of a claim by a General Agent under General 
Agency Agreements set forth in 32A CFR AGE-1 for reimbursement by the 
Maritime Administration on account of a timely payment made to a third 
party within a period of limitations running from the date the claim of 
the third party accrued, the period of limitations applicable to the 
General Agent shall run from the date of such payment. In all other 
cases involving claims arising under General Agency Agreements, 
including third-party claims, the policy provided in paragraph (a) of 
this section shall apply.
    (c) Consideration of any claim governed by applicable regulations in 
this chapter II, including without limitation parts 272, 292, and 205 of 
this chapter, shall be controlled by the time limitations expressly 
provided for with respect to the submission of such claims.

provisions of this subpart to retain such books, records, and accounts:
    (1) For the periods specifically provided by any statutory,

    (2) Pertaining to or related to matters in litigation, to matters 
which knowingly may become involved in litigation, to unsettled claims 
of whatsoever nature, and to all unsettled matters specifically reserved 
by the parties at the time of any final accounting as may be required 
under statute, contract and/or agreement.
    (b) With respect to books, records, and accounts which, subject to 
the provision of paragraph (a) of this section, are to be disposed of 
upon the expiration of the minimum retention period prescribed herein, 
there shall be filed with the Records Officer, Maritime Administration, 
Washington, DC, 20590, a written notification, at least thirty (30) days 
prior to the contemplated, disposal requesting permission to dispose of 
records. MARAD will accept electronic options (such as facsimile and 
Internet) for transmission of required information to MARAD, if 
practicable. The request shall be in such form that the books, records, 
and accounts can be readily identified. Within thirty (30) days after 
receipt of such notification the Records Officer shall grant approval 
for disposal, or advise the necessity for continued retention of all or 
any specified portion thereof. Failure of the Record Officer to reply 
within the thirty (30) days period following receipt by the 
Administration of such request shall constitute approval.

    (c) Applications for special authority to dispose of certain books, 
records, and accounts prior to the expiration of prescribed minimum 
retention periods, and any inquiries as to the interpretation or 
applicability of this subpart to specific items shall be submitted to

practicable.
    (b) The person in charge of the retention and disposal program shall 
maintain a record of all books, records, and accounts held in storage, 
and in such form that the items and their location are readily 
identifiable. A copy of the written, or by electronic options (such as 
facsimile and Internet), if practicable, notification requesting 
permission to dispose of any books, records, and accounts, and the 
original approval from the Administration, as required in Sec. 
380.22(b), together with a statement showing date, place and method of

which are subject to the Cargo Preference Act of 1954 and which are 
generated by U.S. Government Grant, Guaranty, Loan and/or Advance of 
Funds Programs, the head of each affected department or agency shall 
require appropriate clauses to be inserted in those Grant, Guaranty, 
Loan and/or Advance of Funds Agreements and all third party contracts 
executed between the borrower/grantee and other parties, where the 
possibility exists for ocean transportation of items procurred, 
contracted for or otherwise obtained by or on behalf of the grantee, 
borrower, or any of their contractors or subcontractors. The clauses 
required by this part shall provide that at least 50 percent of the 
freight revenue and tonnage of cargo generated by the U.S. Government 
Grant, Guaranty, Loan or Advance of Funds be transported on privately 
owned United

[[Page 365]]

States-flag commercial vessels. These clauses shall also require that 
all parties provide to the Maritime Administration the necessary 
shipment information as set forth in Sec. 381.3. A copy of the 
appropriate clauses required by this part shall be submitted by each 
affected agency or department to the Secretary, Maritime Administration, 
for approval no later than 30 days after the effective date of this 
part. The following are suggested acceptable clauses with respect to the 
use of United States-flag vessels to be incorporated in the Grant, 
Guaranty, Loan and/or Advance of Funds Agreements as well as contracts 
and subcontracts resulting therefrom:
    (a) Agreement Clauses. ``Use of United States-flag vessels:
    ``(1) Pursuant to Pub. L. 664 (43 U.S.C. 1241(b)) at least 50 
percent of any equipment, materials or commodities procured, contracted 
for or otherwise obtained with funds granted, guaranteed, loaned, or 
advanced by the U.S. Government under this agreement, and which may be 
transported by ocean vessel, shall be transported on privately owned 
United States-flag commercial vessels, if available.
    ``(2) Within 20 days following the date of loading for shipments 
originating within the United States or within 30 working days following 
the date of loading for shipments originating outside the United States, 
a legible copy of a rated, `on-board' commercial ocean bill-of-lading in 
English for each shipment of cargo described in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section shall be furnished to both the Contracting Officer (through the 
prime contractor in the case of subcontractor bills-of-lading) and to 
the Division of National Cargo, Office of Market Development, Maritime 
Administration, Washington, DC 20590.''
    (b) Contractor and Subcontractor Clauses. ``Use of United States-
flag vessels: The contractor agrees--
    ``(1) To utilize privately owned United States-flag commercial 
vessels to ship at least 50 percent of the gross tonnage (computed 
separately for dry bulk carriers, dry cargo liners, and tankers) 
involved, whenever shipping any equipment, material, or commodities 
pursuant to this contract, to the extent such vessels are available at 
fair and reasonable rates for United States-flag commercial vessels.
    ``(2) To furnish within 20 days following the date of loading for 
shipments originating within the United States or within 30 working days

Sec. 381.8  Subsidized vessel participation.

    (a) For the purpose of approving subsidized U.S.-flag liner and bulk 
vessels competing for the carriage of dry bulk preference cargoes, each 
department or agency having responsibility under the Cargo Preference 
Act of 1954 (46 U.S.C. 1214(b)), shall evaluate bids received from the 
operators of such vessels in the manner described in this section.
    (b) When a subsidized vessel operator is the apparent low U.S.-flag 
responsive bidder for a dry bulk preference cargo, the responsible 
department or agency shall evaluate the subsidized operator's bid by:
    (1) Requesting from MARAD an amount for the operating-differential 
subsidy (ODS) likely to be paid for the carriage of such cargo expressed 
as a cost per ton for performing the voyage by the apparent low 
responsive subsidized bidders;
    (2) Deriving ``augmented bids'' for the subsidized operators by 
adding the ODS amount to each subsidized operator's bid;

[[Page 366]]

    (3) Comparing the augmented bids of the subsidized operators and the 
bids of unsubsidized operators to determine the apparent low responsive 
bidder;
    (4) Requesting from MARAD a fair and reasonable guideline rate for 
the apparent low responsive bidder which shall be based on MARAD's 
calculation of anticipated costs (less ODS in the case of a subsidized 
vessel) for the voyage plus a reasonable amount for profit for the 
voyage; and
    (5) Determining whether the subsidized operator's unaugmented bid or 
the unsubsidized operator's bid, whichever was determined to be the 
lowest responsive bid pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, is 
at or below the fair and reasonable guideline rate.
    (c) If the amount of dry bulk cargo to be shipped is changed at any 
time prior to award, the department or agency shall request that MARAD 
provide new ODS amounts applicable to the carriage. The department or 
agency shall redetermine the augmented bids before determining the 
lowest responsive bid and requesting from MARAD a revised fair and 
reasonable guideline rate in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (d) Whenever a bid is submitted for a U.S.-flag vessel for the 
transportation of dry bulk preference cargo, the responsible department 
or agency shall only approve bids that apply to an individual vessel, 
and may not accept combined bids submitted for more than one vessel. If 
two or more vessels are offered, separate bids shall be submitted for 
each vessel. A bidder may submit a conditional lower bid for each vessel 
to be effective only if more than one vessel is contracted to carry the 
cargo.
    (e) The requirements of this section shall apply only to those 
departments or agencies that directly pay or finance all or part of 
U.S.-flag ocean freight transportation costs for the carriage of dry 
bulk preference cargoes, in accordance with this part.
    (f) The requirements of this section shall not apply to foreign aid 
consisting of direct cash transfer payments under specific agreements 
between departments or agencies and the recipient country with respect 
to the utilization of U.S.-flag vessels for transportation of 
commodities purchased with such funds.

Sec. 381.9  Available U.S.-flag service.

    For purposes of shipping bulk agricultural commodities under 
programs administered by sponsoring Federal agencies from U.S. Great 
Lakes ports during the 1996-2000 Great Lakes shipping seasons, if direct 
all-U.S.-flag service, at fair and reasonable rates, is not available at 
U.S. Great Lakes ports, a joint service involving a foreign-flag 
vessel(s) carrying cargo no farther than a Canadian port(s) or other 
point(s) on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, with transshipment via a U.S.-flag 
privately-owned commercial vessel to the ultimate foreign destination, 
will be deemed to comply with the requirement of ``available'' 
commercial U.S.-flag service under the Cargo Preference Act of 1954. 
Shipper agencies considering bids resulting in the lowest landed cost of 
transportation based on U.S.-flag rates and service shall include within 
the comparison of U.S.-flag rates and service, for shipments originating 
in U.S. Great Lakes ports, through rates (if offered) to a Canadian port 
or other point on the Gulf of St. Lawrence and a U.S.-flag leg for the 
remainder of the voyage. The ``fair and reasonable'' rate for this mixed 
service will be determined by considering the U.S.-flag component under 
the existing regulations at 46 CFR Part 382 or 383, as appropriate, and 
incorporating the cost for the foreign-flag component into the U.S.-flag 
``fair and reasonable'' rate in the same way as the cost of foreign-flag 
vessels used to lighten U.S.-flag vessels in the recipient country's 
territorial waters. Alternatively, the supplier of the commodity may 
offer the Cargo FOB Canadian transshipment point, and MARAD will 
determine fair and reasonable rates accordingly.

    Authority: 46 App. U.S.C. 1114, 1241(b); 49 CFR 1.66.

    Source: 63 FR 3828, Jan. 27, 1998, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 382.1  Scope.

    The regulations in this part prescribe the type of information that 
shall be submitted to the Maritime Administration (MARAD) by operators 
interested in carrying bulk and packaged preference cargoes, and the 
method for calculating fair and reasonable rates for the carriage of dry 
(including packaged) and liquid bulk preference cargoes on U.S.-flag 
commercial vessels, except vessels engaged in liner trades, which is 
defined as service provided on an advertised schedule, giving relatively 
frequent sailings between specific U.S. ports or ranges and designated 
foreign ports or ranges.


<R05>
Sec. 382.2  Data submission.

    (a) General. The operators shall submit information, described in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, to the Director, Office of Costs 
and Rates, Maritime Administration, Washington, DC 20590. To the extent 
a vessel is time chartered, the operator shall also submit operating 
expenses for that vessel. All submissions shall be certified by the 
operators. A further review based on the independent CPA performing an 
engagement consistent with professional standards, i.e., an attestation 
engagement, is recommended. Submissions are subject to verification, at 
MARAD's discretion, by the Office of the Inspector General, Department 
of Transportation. MARAD's calculations of the fair and reasonable rates 
for U.S.-flag vessels shall be performed on the basis of cost data 
provided by the U.S.-flag vessel operator, as specified herein. If a 
vessel operator fails to submit the required cost data, MARAD will not 
construct the guideline rate for the affected vessel, which may result 
in such vessel not being approved by the sponsoring Federal agency.
    (b) Required vessel information. The following information shall be 
submitted not later than April 30, 1998, for calendar year 1997 and 
shall be updated not later than April 30 for each subsequent calendar 
year. In instances where a vessel has not previously participated in the 
carriage of cargoes described in Sec. 382.1, the information shall be 
submitted not later than the same date as the offer for carriage of such 
cargoes is submitted to the sponsoring Federal agency, and/or its 
program participant, and/or its agent and/or program's agent, or freight 
forwarder.
    (1) Vessel name and official number.
    (2) Vessel DWT (summer) in metric tons.
    (3) Date built, rebuilt and/or purchased.
    (4) Normal operating speed.
    (5) Daily fuel consumption at normal operating speed, in metric tons 
(U.S. gallons for tugs) and by type of fuel.
    (6) Daily fuel consumption in port while pumping and standing, in 
metric tons (U.S. gallons for tugs) and by type of fuel.
    (7) Total capitalized vessel costs (list and date capitalized 
improvements separately), and applicable interest rates for indebtedness 
(where capital leases are involved, the operator shall report the 
imputed capitalized cost and imputed interest rate).
    (8) Operating cost information, to be submitted in the format 
stipulated in 46 CFR 232.1, on Form MA-172, Schedule 310. Operators are 
encouraged to provide operating cost information for similar vessels 
that the operator considers substitutable within a category, as defined 
in Sec. 382.3(a)(1), in the aggregate on a single schedule. Information 
shall be applicable to the most recently completed calendar year.
    (9) Number of vessel operating days pertaining to data reported in 
paragraph (b)(8) of this section for the year ending December 31. For 
purposes of this part, an operating day means any day on which a vessel 
or tug/barge unit

[[Page 368]]

is in a seaworthy condition, fully manned, and either in operation or 
standing ready to begin pending operations.
    (c) Required port and cargo handling information. The port and cargo 
handling costs listed in this paragraph shall be provided semiannually 
for each cargo preference voyage terminated during the period. The 
report shall identify the vessel, cargo and tonnage, and round-trip 
voyage itinerary including dates of arrival and departure at port or 
ports of loading and discharge. The semiannual periods and the 
information to be submitted are as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  Period                              Due date
------------------------------------------------------------------------
April 1-September 30......................  January 1.
October 1-March 31........................  July 1.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) Port expenses. Total expenses or fees, by port, for pilots, 
tugs, line handlers, wharfage, port charges, fresh water, lighthouse 
dues, quarantine service, customs charges, shifting expenses, and any 
other appropriate port expense.
    (2) Cargo expense. Separately list expenses or fees for stevedores, 
elevators, equipment, and any other appropriate expenses.
    (3) Extra cargo expenses. Separately list expenses or fees for 
vacuvators and/or cranes, lightering (indicate tons moved and cost per 
ton), grain-to-grain cleaning of holds or tanks, and any other 
appropriate expenses.
    (4) Canal expenses. Total expenses or fees for agents, tolls (light 
or loaded), tugs, pilots, lock tenders and boats, and any other 
appropriate expenses. Indicate waiting time and time of passage.
    (d) Other requirements. Unless otherwise provided, operators shall 
use generally accepted accounting principles and MARAD's regulations at 
46 CFR part 232, Uniform Financial Reporting Requirements, for guidance 
in submitting cost data. Notwithstanding the general provisions in 46 
CFR 232.2(c) for MARAD program participants, each operator shall submit 
cost data in the format that conforms with the accounting practices 
reflected in the operator's trial balance and, if audited statements are 
prepared, the audited financial statements. Data requirements stipulated 
in paragraph (b) of this section that are not included under those 
reporting instructions shall be submitted in a similar format. If the 
operator has already submitted to MARAD, for other purposes, any data 
required under paragraph (b) of this section, its submission need not be 
duplicated to satisfy the requirements of this part.
    (e) Presumption of confidentiality. MARAD will initially presume 
that the material submitted in accordance with the requirements of this 
part is privileged or confidential within the meaning of the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4). In the event of a subsequent 
request for any portion of that data under the FOIA, MARAD will inform 
the submitter of such request and allow the submitter the opportunity to 
comment. The submitter shall claim or reiterate its claim of 
confidentiality at that time by memorandum or letter, stating the basis 
for such assertions of exemption from disclosure. The Freedom of 
Information Act Officer, or the Chief Counsel of MARAD, will inform the 
submitter of the intention to disclose any information claimed to be 
confidential, after the initial FOIA request, or after any appeal of 
MARAD's initial decision, respectively.

<R05>
Sec. 382.3  Determination of fair and reasonable rate.

    Fair and reasonable rates for the carriage of preference cargoes on 
U.S.-flag commercial vessels shall be determined as follows:
    (a) Operating cost component--(1) General. An operating cost 
component for each category, based on average operating costs of 
participating vessels within a vessel size category, shall be 
determined, at least twice yearly, on the basis of operating cost data 
for the calendar year immediately preceding the current year that has 
been submitted in accordance with Sec. 382.2. The operating cost 
component shall include all operating cost categories, as specified in 
46 CFR 232.5, Form MA-172, Schedule 310, Operating Expenses. For 
purposes of these regulations, charter

[[Page 369]]

hire expenses are not considered operating costs. MARAD shall index such 
data yearly to the current period, utilizing the escalation factors for 
wage and non-wage costs used in escalating operating subsidy costs for 
the same period.
    (2) Fuel. Fuel costs within each category shall be determined based 
on the average actual fuel consumptions, at sea and in port, and current 
fuel prices in effect at the time of the preference cargo voyage(s).
    (3) Vessel categories. Vessels shall be placed in categories by 
deadweight capacities (DWT), as follows:

Group I--under 10,000 DWT
Group II--10,000--19,999 DWT
Group III--20,000--34,999 DWT
Group IV--35,000 DWT and over.

    (b) Capital Component--(1) General. An average capital cost 
component for each category shall be constructed, at least twice yearly, 
consisting of vessel depreciation, interest, and return on equity.
    (2) Items included. The capital cost component shall include:
    (i) Depreciation. The owners' capitalized vessel costs, including 
capitalized improvements, shall be depreciated on a straight-line basis 
over a 20-year economic life, except vessels purchased or reconstructed 
when their age was greater than 10 years old. To the extent vessels are 
chartered or leased, the operator shall submit the capitalized cost of 
the vessel owner and imputed interest rate. If these items are not 
furnished, MARAD will construct these amounts. When vessels more than 10 
years old are acquired, a depreciation period of 10 years shall be used. 
Capitalized improvements made to vessels more than 10 years old shall be 
depreciated over a 10-year period. When vessels more than 10 years old 
are reconstructed, MARAD will determine the depreciation period.
    (ii) Interest. The cost of debt shall be determined by applying each 
vessel owner's actual interest rates to the outstanding vessel 
indebtedness. MARAD shall assume that original vessel indebtedness is 75 
percent of the owners' capitalized vessel costs, including capitalized 
improvements, and that annual principal payments are made in equal 
installments over the economic life of the vessels as determined in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Where an operator 
uses a variable interest rate, the operator's actual interest rate at 
the time of calculation of the average capital cost component shall be 
used. The ten-year Treasury bill (T-bill) rate plus one percent on the 
first business day of the year or the first business day on or after 
July 1 shall be used for operators without vessel debt and when the 
actual rate is unavailable.
    (iii) Return on equity. The rate of return on equity shall be 
computed in the same manner as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section. For the purpose of determining equity, it shall be assumed that 
the vessel's constructed net book value, less outstanding constructed 
principal, is equity. The constructed net book values shall equal the 
owners' capitalized cost minus accumulated straight-line depreciation.
    (3) Return on working capital. For each voyage a return on working 
capital shall be included as a voyage related capital cost element, and 
thus not part of the averaged costs. Working capital shall equal the 
dollar amount necessary to cover 100 percent of the averaged operating 
costs and estimated voyage costs for the voyage. The rate of return 
shall be based on an average of the most recent return of stockholders' 
equity for a cross section of transportation companies, including 
maritime companies.
    (4) New vessel allowance. Newly constructed vessels and vessels 
acquired during or before their fifth year of age will receive an 
additional allowance for acquisition capital as part of the capital cost 
element. For the first year following construction or acquisition by the 
operator, a daily amount equal to ten percent of capitalized acquisition 
costs, divided by 300 operating days, shall be included. This amount 
shall be reduced by one percent of capitalized acquisition costs each 
subsequent year. No allowance shall be included after the tenth year 
following construction.
    (5) Voyage component. The annual average depreciation, interest, and 
return on equity for vessels in each category shall be divided by 300 
vessel operating

[[Page 370]]

days to yield the daily cost factors. Total voyage days shall be applied 
to the daily cost factors and totaled with the return on working capital 
and new vessel allowance for the voyage to determine the daily capital 
cost component.
    (c) Port and cargo handling cost component. MARAD shall calculate an 
estimate of all port and cargo handling costs on the basis of the 
reported cargo tender terms. The port and cargo handling cost component 
shall be based on vessels in the category and the most current 
information available verified by information submitted in accordance 
with Sec. 382.2(c), or as otherwise determined by MARAD, such as by 
analysis of independent data obtained from chartering agencies.
    (d) Brokerage and overhead component. An allowance for broker's 
commission and overhead expenses of 8.5 percent shall be added to the 
sum of the operating cost component, the capital cost component, and the 
port and cargo handling cost component.
    (e) Determination of voyage days. The following assumptions shall be 
made in determining the number of preference cargo voyage days:
    (1) The voyage shall be round-trip with the return in ballast to a 
port or port range selected by MARAD as the most appropriate, unless the 
vessel is scrapped or sold after discharge of the preference cargo and 
does not return to the United States as a U.S.-flag vessel. In this 
event, only voyage days from the load port to the discharge port, 
including time allowed to discharge, shall be included.
    (2) Cargo is loaded and discharged as per cargo tender terms 
interpreted in accordance with the ``International Rules For the 
Interpretation of Trade Terms'' (INCOTERMS) published by the 
International Chamber of Commerce.
    (3) Total loading and discharge time includes the addition of a 
factor to account for delays and days not worked.
    (4) One extra port day is included at each anticipated bunkering 
port.
    (5) An allowance shall be included for canal transits, when 
appropriate.
    (6) Transit time shall be based on the average speed of vessels in 
the category. When calculating the vessels' average speed, individual 
vessel speeds will be reduced by five percent for self-propelled vessels 
and ten percent for tugs/barges to account for weather conditions.
    (f) Determination of cargo carried. The amount of cargo tonnage used 
to calculate the rate shall be based on the tender offer or charter 
party terms. In instances when separate parcels of preference cargo are 
booked or considered for booking on the same vessel, whether under a 
single program or different programs, a guideline rate shall be provided 
based on the combined voyage.
    (g) Total rate. The guideline rate shall be the total of the 
operating cost component, the capital cost component, the port and cargo 
handling cost component, and the broker's commission and overhead 
component. The fair and reasonable rate can be expressed as total voyage 
revenue or be divided by the amount of cargo to be carried, as 
prescribed in paragraph (f) of this section, and expressed as cost per 
ton, whichever MARAD deems most appropriate.

    The MarAd assistance regulations apply to all MarAd research and 
development programs which will result in assistance awards, and to all 
recipients eligible for MarAd assistance awards such as state and local 
governments, institutions of higher education, hospitals, other 
nonprofit organizations, individuals, profitmaking organizations, and 
foreign organizations. The provisions of this part govern the award and 
administration of all such financial assistance matters, including 
resolutions and guidelines issued by MarAd except:
    (a) As otherwise required by statute; and,
    (b) As otherwise provided by specific program regulations.

                           Definition of Terms


<R05>
Sec. 385.20  Scope.

    Only those definitions needed to understand this part will be 
defined. Generally, terms defined elsewhere in statutes, OMB circulars, 
and other Federal requirements will not be restated. Special attention 
is directed to the definitions in the Standard General Provisions of 
MarAd's grant and cooperative agreements (See Sec. 385.62).


<R05>
Sec. 385.21  Definitions.

    (a) Assistance is where the principal purpose of the relationship is 
the transfer of money, property, services or anything of value to a 
recipient in order to accomplish a public purpose of support or 
stimulation authorized by Federal statute rather than of acquisition, by 
purchase, lease, or barter, of property or services for the direct 
benefit or use of the Federal Government.
    (b) Assistance instrument is a general term which identifies a class 
of instruments used to award assistance. These instruments include grant 
and cooperative agreements, as defined in Sec. 385.32 (c) and (d) of 
this part.
    (c) Act means the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 
1977 (Pub. L. 95-224).
    (d) MarAd means the Maritime Administration within the Department of 
Transportation.
    (e) Secretary means the Secretary of Transportation.
    (f) Maritime Administrator means the Maritime Administrator, 
Department of Transportation to whom the Secretary has delegated 
authority to administer within MarAd the provisions of the Act.

[[Page 373]]

    (g) Grants Officer means the primary delegate of the Maritime 
Administrator responsible for administration of grants and cooperative 
agreements for research and development within MarAd.
    (h) Awards Officer means the principal executive subordinate to the 
Grants Officer responsible for the day-to-day administration of grants 
and cooperative agreements for research and development.

                            General Policies


<R05>
Sec. 385.31  Scope.

    Sections 385.31 through 385.62 set forth the regulations applicable 
to all assistance instruments as defined herein.


<R05>
Sec. 385.32  Selection of award instrument.

    (a) General. This section provides guidance on the appropriate use 
of award instruments consistent with the Act and the supplementary 
interpretative guidelines required by section 9 of the Act, which were 
published by the OMB in the Federal Register of August 18, 1978 (41 FR 
36860), and are incorporated by reference herein. This section applies 
to all program and individual transactions where the choice of award 
instruments is within the administrative discretion of MarAd and is not 
otherwise prescribed or limited by law. A variety of award instruments 
is available as the means for defining the terms and conditions and the 
nature of the relationship between MarAd and eligible recipients. The 
award instruments are intended to be different in purpose, application, 
content, and nature. When properly employed, they create different 
relationships between the parties. Because of these differences, the 
decision to use a particular instrument must be made deliberately. The 
determination of whether a program, to be implemented through individual 
transactions, is principally one of acquisition or assistance will be 
made by the Grants Officer. MarAd generally will employ the cooperative 
agreement form of assistance instrument but will employ the grant form 
where deemed appropriate.
    (b) Procurement contract. A procurement contract shall be used as 
the legal instrument to reflect a relationship between the Federal 
Government and a state or local government or other recipient whenever 
(1) the principal purpose of the instrument is the acquisition by 
purchase, lease, or barter, of property or services for the direct 
benefit or use of the Federal Government; or (2) whenever MarAd 
determines in a specific instance that the use of a type of procurement 
contract is appropriate.
    (c) Grant agreement. A type of grant agreement shall be used as the 
legal instrument to reflect a relationship between the Federal 
Government and a state or local government or other recipient whenever 
the principal purpose of the relationship is the transfer of money, 
property, services, or anything of value to the state or local 
government or other recipient in order to accomplish a public purpose of 
support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute, rather than 
acquisition, by purchase, lease, or barter, of property or services for 
the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government; and no substantial 
involvement is anticipated between MarAd, acting for the Federal 
Government, and the state or local government or other recipient during 
performance of the contemplated activity.
    (d) Cooperative agreement. A type of cooperative agreement shall be 
used as the legal instrument to reflect a relationship between the 
Federal Government and a state or local government or other recipient 
whenever the principal purpose of the relationship is the transfer of 
money, property, services, or anything of value to the state or local 
government or other recipient in order to accomplish a public purpose of 
support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute, rather than 
acquisition by purchase, lease, or barter, of property or services for 
the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government; and substantial 
involvement is anticipated between MarAd, acting for the Federal 
Government, and the state or local government or other recipient during 
performance of the contemplated activity.

<R05>
Sec. 385.33  Unsolicited applications and proposals for financial assistance awards.

    (a) Policy. Although it is MarAd policy to solicit applications and 
proposals for assistance awards where possible, MarAd also values 
obtaining innovative ideas, methods, and approaches in maritime 
transportation areas offered by the public through unsolicited 
applications and proposals. It is the policy of the Government to foster 
and encourage the submission of unsolicited proposals. This Sec. 385.33 
is designed to encourage the submisson of unsolicited proposals relating 
to MarAd's mission and to eliminate restraints which discourage the 
generation and acceptance of innovative ideas through unsolicited 
proposals.
    (b) Scope. This section applies to unsolicited proposals being 
considered for support through an assistance instrument. This section 
does not apply when a procurement contract is the appropriate award 
instrument in accordance with Sec. 385.32(b).
    (c) Definition of unsolicited proposal. The term unsolicited 
proposal means a written offer to perform a proposed task or effort, 
initiated and submitted to MarAd by a prospective recipient (offeror) 
without solicitation by MarAd, and with the objective of obtaining an 
award. The term may include both requests for support of a new project 
and requests for additional support of a previously funded project 
(renewals).
    (d) Advance consultation. Organizations or individuals who are 
interested in submitting an unsolicited proposal are encouraged, before 
expending extensive effort in preparing a detailed unsolicited proposal 
or submitting any proprietary information to the Government, to make 
preliminary inquiries of MarAd program staff as to the general interest 
in the type of project contemplated. Prior contact with agency technical 
personnel is permissible and is encouraged, with the limited objectives 
of conveying to the prospective recipient an understanding of the agency 
mission and interest relative to the type of project contemplated. The 
project officer shall not indicate or imply in discussions with the 
potential proposer that a proposal will result in an award. Nothing is 
to be suggested to encourage or authorize the potential proposer to 
perform any work at MarAd expense in anticipation of support or an 
award. If there have been prior discussions with a particular MarAd 
program office, a statement of this fact should be stated on the face of 
the proposal.
    (e) Guides. Guides for preparing the content of unsolicited 
proposals are available from the Awards Officer (M-900), Maritime 
Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590. 
Notwithstanding these guides, state and local governments may submit 
unsolicited applications or proposals using the application forms 
authorized by OMB Circular No. A-102, Attachment M.
    (f) Submission point. All unsolicited proposals for new or renewals 
of financial assistance awards shall be submitted to Awards Officer (M-
900), Maritime Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, 
Washington, DC 20590.
    (g) Receipt and review. (1) Receipt of unsolicited proposals will be 
acknowledged promptly by the Awards Officer and then forwarded 
expeditiously to potentially interested program offices for comment. 
Each unsolicited proposal that is circulated for a comprehensive 
evaluation shall have a legend attached or imprinted on it by the Awards 
Officer, identifying it as an unsolicited proposal and stating that it 
shall be used only for purposes of evaluation.
    (2) The responsible program officials shall evaluate the proposal 
fairly and objectively using the criteria in Sec. Sec. 385.50 through 
385.52.
    (3) An unsolicited proposal may include data which the proposer does 
not want disclosed for purposes other than the evaluation of the 
proposal. In such case, the proposer should mark each page containing 
such data with the words ``Proprietory Data--Restricted Use'' at the top 
of the page. In the event that an unsolicited proposal, in whole or in 
part, indicates that the proposer wishes to impose restrictions on the 
use or disclosure of the data contained in the proposal, MarAd personnel 
handling the proposal will take care to ensure that the information in

[[Page 375]]

the proposal is not disclosed outside of MarAd. The Awards Officer has 
responsibility for ensuring that proposal reviewers are free of any 
direct affiliation with the individual(s) or institution submitting the 
proposal. MarAd policy on the use of information contained in proposals 
is to use such information only for evaluation purposes, except to the 
extent such information is generally available to the public, is already 
the property of the Government, or is available to the Government 
without restriction. Accordingly, if a proposal contains information the 
proposer wishes to protect, the proposer shall mark the cover page of 
the proposal with the following Notice:

    Notice: The data contained in pages ---- of this proposal have been 
submitted in confidence and contain trade secrets and/or privileged or 
confidential commercial or financial information, and such data shall be 
used or disclosed only for evaluation purposes: Provided, That if this 
proposer receives an award as a result of or in connection with the 
submission of this proposal the Government shall have the right to use 
or disclose the data herein to the extent provided in the award. This 
restriction does not limit the Government's right to use or disclose 
data obtained without restriction from any source, including the 
proposer.


MarAd shall ensure that all copies of the proposal carry the above 
Notice, and that it is not disclosed outside MarAd, except with the 
consent of the proposer.
    (h) Criteria for acceptance of an unsolicited proposal are those 
listed in Sec. Sec. 385.50 through 385.52. If an unsolicited proposal 
fails to meet any of the criteria, the proposer will be notified by the 
Awards Officer in accordance with paragraph (j) of this section.
    (i) Funding determination. The responsibility for deciding funding 
availability rests solely with the Grants Officer and will not be 
considered by the proposal reviewers.
    (j) Nonsupport of proposal. If the proposal does not offer 
sufficient technical merit or program value; is not relevant to the 
accomplishment of a public purpose authorized by MarAd program 
legislation; or if funds are not available; the proposal will be 
returned to the proposer, if the proposer so requests. The Awards 
Officer shall prepare a letter to the proposer which sets forth the 
basis for rejection of the unsolicited proposal or application.
    (k) Support of proposal. There is no prescribed format for the 
program documentation necessary to justify providing assistance. The 
minimum requirements are that: there be a reasonable basis for 
acceptance based on the criteria set forth in Sec. Sec. 385.50 through 
385.52; the rationale for providing support be written, and approvals be 
obtained as required by MarAd; and, that a copy of the documentation be 
included in the assistance instrument award file. The rationale for 
providing assistance may be included in documents required for project 
approval.


<R05>
Sec. 385.34  Responsibility for issuing solicitations for proposals or applications.

    (a) It is MarAd policy to favor solicitation of proposals or 
applications, where discretionary assistance awards are available, in 
preference to relying on unsolicited proposals, in order to maximize 
opportunities for open participation by the public in MarAd assistance 
awards.
    (b) The Awards Officer shall be responsible for issuing 
solicitations, announcements, or the like, which call for the submission 
of proposals and applications by a certain due date which, if favorably 
acted upon by MarAd, may result in assistance awards.


<R05>
Sec. 385.35  Program opportunity notices.

    (a) A program opportunity notice can be used to stimulate the flow 
of unsolicited proposals or applications when the program objectives 
cannot be defined sufficiently to prepare a program solicitation.
    (b) The program opportunity notice will contain the following, at a 
minimum:
    (1) A number assigned for control and reference purposes;
    (2) A brief description of the broad, general technical program or 
areas needing investigation (generally 50 words or less);
    (3) A statement of the principal program objective in possibly 
funding unsolicited proposals as either:
    (i) The acquisition of concepts, property, or services for the 
direct benefit or use of the Federal Government; or

[[Page 376]]

    (ii) The transfer of money, property, or services to a recipient for 
support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute;
    (4) A statement about how unsolicited proposals will be evaluated 
and accepted:
    (i) If the principal program objective is to accomplish a public 
purpose of support or stimulation, the criteria in Sec. Sec. 385.50 
through 385.52 shall be applied;
    (ii) If the principal program objective is the acquisition of 
concepts, property, or services for the direct benefit or use of the 
Federal Government (i.e., procurement), the policy regarding evaluation 
and acceptance of unsolicited proposals in 41 CFR 9-4.9 shall apply;
    (5) Restrictions, if any, as to who may submit proposals;
    (6) A contact where additional information may be obtained;
    (7) An expiration date which identifies when the program opportunity 
notice will no longer be current. This date shall not be used as a 
required common due date for submission of proposals;
    (8) A statement that MarAd reserves the right to support or not 
support, in whole or in part, any or all proposals received;
    (9) A statement that MarAd assumes no responsibility for any costs 
associated with specific proposal preparation if no award is made; but 
that if an award is made, MarAd will pay its allocable share of bid and 
proposal expenses as provided for in applicable Federal cost principles;
    (10) A statement that proposals submitted pursuant to the notice 
shall be mailed to the Awards Officer (M-900), Maritime Administration, 
Room 4885, U.S. Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590.
    (11) A reference that detailed information concerning assistance 
policy and procedures is contained in these assistance regulations, 46 
CFR part 385;
    (12) As much information as possible as to how proposals and 
applications will be evaluated;
    (13) Policies and procedures for patents, data, and copyrights. 
Proposers have the right to request in advance of or within thirty (30) 
days after the effective date of award a waiver of all or any part of 
the United States rights in subject inventions.
    (c) The program opportunity notice shall be in a format that best 
reflects the needs of the specific program, for example, letter, 
booklet, bulletin, or other documents.
    (d) The program opportunity notice shall be distributed widely. It 
may be distributed to industry associations, including small business 
associations; schools, colleges, and universities; appropriate 
professional and scientific journals; state, local, and regional 
governmental organizations; the Commerce Business Daily; other MarAd 
offices; and individuals and organizations who request copies on a one-
time basis.
    (e) The submission of innovative methods, approaches or ideas will 
not be restricted to those problems or technical areas published in the 
program opportunity notice. Alternatives will be eligible for 
consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 385.36  Public notice of availability of assistance awards.

    (a) In order to maximize involvement of prospective recipients in 
MarAd assistance programs, it is MarAd's policy, wherever possible, to 
provide timely notice to the public as to the availability of assistance 
awards.
    (b) Early notice regarding legislated grant or other assistance 
programs will br provided by MarAd to the Office of Management and 
Budget for publication in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance 
pursuant to Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-89. When 
legislated assistance programs or program objectives which are to be 
implemented through assistance instruments reach the point where 
applications or proposals need to be obtained, timely notice of such 
solicitations will be published in the Federal Register, Commerce 
Business Daily, trade and professional journals which are widely 
circulated to state and local governments, and news media, as 
appropriate to communicate with potentially interested applicants.
    (c) When a MarAd assistance project involves making assistance 
available through prime recipients to subrecipients, such as through 
states to local governments, prime recipients should

[[Page 377]]

provide timely advance notice to subrecipients as to the availability of 
such assistance, and provide a reasonable time period for subrecipients 
to prepare applications and secure prerequisite local approvals.


<R05>
Sec. 385.37  Requirement for unrestricted solicitations for discretionary assistance awards.

    (a) Policy. It is MarAd policy to maximize the opportunity for 
prospective recipients to be considered for assistance awards where 
eligibility is not prescribed by law. Therefore, when eligibility is not 
prescribed by law or a final program regulation, and when discretionary 
assistance awards are selected to accomplish a program objective, 
applications or proposals will be obtained, wherever practicable, by 
issuance of a written solicitation. When MarAd initiates the 
solicitation of applications or proposals, eligibility to be considered 
for discretionary awards will not be restricted by MarAd to one category 
of recipients or to a single recipient without adequate basis.
    (b) Justification of restricted eligibility. Where program 
legislation explicitly restricts eligibility, e.g., to state 
governments, no justification is required. When program regulations 
restrict eligibility beyond the restrictions required by the program 
legislation, the basis for the restriction shall be set forth in the 
program rulemaking.

41 CFR 9-3.805-51 shall be used as a guide in preparing the 
``justification for restricting eligibility.'' The reasons offered will 
be evaluated for consistency with the policy in paragraph (a) of this 
section, MarAd's overall mission, and the objective of maintaining an 
open and fair system of making assistance awards.
    (c) Approvals. Justifications of restricted eligibility will be 
signed by the Grants Officer and will be reviewed by Office of General 
Counsel for legal sufficiency prior to issuance of the restricted 
solicitation. The signed justification will be filed in official award 
file.


<R05>
Sec. 385.38  Joint funding.

    (a) Pursuant to section 10(c) of the Act, MarAd is authorized to 
participate in joint funded projects with other Federal agencies in any 
funding relationship which will serve the best interest of all of the 
participating agencies' program. Such joint funding project may include 
more than one type of assistance relationship, e.g., some components of 
project may be funded by grants and other components of the project may 
be funded by cooperative agreements.
    (b) It is MarAd's positive policy, further, to encourage cost-
sharing on the part of applicants for financial assistance. The 
willingness of applicants to cost-share is a primary factor in making, 
or not making, an assistance award.


<R05>
Sec. 385.39  Socio-economic and environmental policies.

    A number of socio-economic and environmental policies of the Federal 
Government are incorporated into the standard general provisions of the 
grant agreement and cooperative agreements, and are identified as 
explicit criteria in Sec. Sec. 385.51 and 385.52.


<R05>
Sec. 385.40  Disputes.

    Procedures for resolution of disputes between a recipient and MarAd 
appear in the standard general provisions of the grant and cooperative 
agreements referenced in Sec. 385.62, of this part.

                           Criteria for Award


<R05>
Sec. 385.50  Scope.

    Sections 385.51 and 385.52 set forth the criteria to be used by 
MarAd in evaluating all projects and all potential recipients prior to 
award of a grant or cooperative agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 385.51  Criteria: Projects.

    The criteria to be used by MarAd in evaluating all projects prior to 
award of a grant or cooperative agreement are as follows:
    (a) In terms of the accomplishment of a public purpose--
    (1) The potential contribution which the proposed work is expected 
to make to the MarAd assistance mission;
    (2) The economic, environmental, and societal significance which a 
successful demonstration or project may have for

[[Page 378]]

the nation, and in particular the national merchant marine program;
    (3) The relationship of the proposal to:
    (i) The public need for the potential results of the research, 
development, or demonstration effort, and whether it is unlikely that 
similar results would be achieved in a timely manner in the absence of 
Federal assistance;
    (ii) Whether the potential opportunities for non-Federal interests 
to recapture the investment in the undertaking through the normal 
commercial utilization of proprietary knowledge appear inadequate to 
encourage timely results;
    (iii) The extent of the problems treated and whether the objectives 
sought by the undertaking are national, widespread, or regional in their 
significance;
    (iv) The extent of opportunities to induce non-Federal support of 
the undertaking;
    (v) The degree of risk of loss of the investment inherent in the 
research, and the availability of risk capital to the non-Federal 
entities which might otherwise engage in the field of the research so as 
to further timely development of the technology; and,
    (vi) The availability of appropriations to MarAd.
    (b) In terms of the particular objectives of the project, whether 
the project has:
    (1) High technical merit which promises or represents an innovative 
idea, method, or approach;
    (2) Program value not previously recognized or pursued by MarAd; 
and,
    (3) A reasonable degree of probability of achieving the stated 
objectives.


<R05>
Sec. 385.52  Criteria: Applicant.

    The criteria to be used by MarAd in evaluating all applicants prior 
to award of a grant or cooperative agreement are as follows:
    (a) The qualifications, capabilities, resources (both financial and 
technical) and experience of the applicant;
    (b) The facilities or techniques which the proposer possesses and 
offers which are considered to be integral factors for achieving the 
objectives of the proposal;
    (c) The qualifications, capabilities, and experiences of the 
proposed investigator, team leader, or key personnel, who are considered 
to be critical in achieving the objectives of the proposal;
    (d) The precision and detail with which the applicant states its 
plan to further the formally adopted socioeconomic and environmental 
policies of the United States e.g., the encouragement of minority 
business enterprises); and,
    (e) The extent to which the applicant will share the total estimated 
cost of the project.

                           Forms of Agreements


<R05>
Sec. 385.60  Scope.

    Sections 385.61 through 385.62 describe the form and content of the 
two parts which comprise a grant agreement or a cooperative agreement 
which will be executed by MarAd and a recipient of financial assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 385.61  Grant and cooperative agreements: Special provisions.

    (a) MarAd has adopted two format matrices, one for grant agreements 
and one for cooperative agreements, to accommodate the variables 
inherent in undertaking a project with a particular recipient. These 
variables include, for example, identity of the recipient, scope of 
work, schedule of performance and obligations assumed by both parties.
    (b) The format matrices are available on request from the Awards 
Officer, and a copy of each is included in the information kit provided 
to all potential recipients of financial assistance. \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ An informational copy of both format matrices accompany this 
regulation as filed in the Office of the Federal Register.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) MarAd will adapt the appropriate format matrix to the extent 
deemed necessary when drafting the particular agreement to be executed 
by MarAd and a recipient of financial assistance for a specific project.


<R05>
Sec. 385.62  Grant and cooperative agreements: Standard general provisions.

    (a) MarAd has adopted two standard general provisions which apply to

[[Page 379]]

grant and cooperative agreements, respectively, and said provisions are 
hereby incorporated by reference into these regulations. \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ A copy of both such incorporated provisions accompany this 
regulation and are on file in the Office of the Federal Register.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) MarAd reserves the right to amend or to render inapplicable any 
portion of the particular standard general provisions required for any 
particular grant or cooperative agreement: Provided, That such 
modification shall be accomplished only by means of an explicit 
statement in the special provisions executed by MarAd and a particular 
recipient.

<R05>
Sec. 386.1  Hours of admission to property.

    Academy property shall be closed to the public during other than 
normal working hours, as well as during Regimental leave periods and 
indoctrination training for the fourth class year. The closing of 
property shall not apply where the Superintendent has approved the after 
normal working hours use of buildings or athletic facilities for 
authorized activities. During normal working hours, property shall be 
closed to the public only when situations require this action to ensure 
the orderly conduct of Academy business. The Superintendent, or a 
designated representative of the Superintendent, shall make the decision 
to close all or any areas of Academy property. This action shall be 
coordinated with the Head, Department of Public Safety and Security 
(Security), of the Academy. When property, or a portion thereof, is

[69 FR 51772, Aug. 23, 2004, as amended at 70 FR 66797, Nov. 3, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 388.4  Criteria for grant of a waiver.

    (a) General Criteria. (1) A waiver of the foreign build and/or 
foreign rebuild prohibition in the coastwise trade laws will be granted 
for an eligible vessel only if we determine that the employment of the 
vessel in the coastwise trade will not unduly adversely affect--

[[Page 386]]

    (i) United States vessel builders; or
    (ii) The coastwise trade business of any person who employs vessels 
built in the United States in that business.
    (2) The determination of ``unduly adverse affect'' on a coastwise 
operator or a U.S. vessel builder may not be limited to operators or 
builders of vessels carrying 12 or fewer passengers.
    (3) We may evaluate the expected impact of the proposed waiver on 
the basis of the information received from all sources, including public 
comment, internal investigation and analysis, and any other sources of 
information deemed appropriate.
    (b) Impact on U.S. vessel builders. We may use the following 
criteria to determine the effect on U.S. vessel builders: Whether a 
potentially affected U.S. vessel builder has a history of construction 
of similar vessels, or can demonstrate the capability and capacity and 
the fact it has taken definite steps to offer to build a similar vessel, 
for use in the same geographic region of the United States, as the 
proposed vessel of the applicant.
    (c) Impact on coastwise trade business. We may use the following 
criteria to determine the effect on existing operators of U.S.-built 
vessels in coastwise trade:
    (1) Whether the proposed vessel of the applicant and a vessel of an 
existing operator (or the vessel of an operator that can demonstrate it 
has taken definite steps to begin operation) would provide similar 
commercial service and would operate in the same geographic area.
    (2) The number of similar vessels operating or proposed to operate 
in the same market with the same or similar itinerary, relative to the 
size of the market. For example, a single vessel may have a small impact 
on a large market.
    (d) Advance notice and approval needed for changes. When we approve 
a waiver application, we will notify the applicant that no substantial 
change in the employment of the vessel in the coastwise trade may be 
made without prior notice to MARAD. In general, a substantial change in 
operating area will require a new waiver application.


<R05>
Sec. 388.5  Criteria for revocation of a waiver.

    We shall revoke a waiver previously granted under this part if we 
determine, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that fraud was 
involved in any part of the waiver application.


<R05>
Sec. 388.6  Process.

    (a) Initial process. (1) We will review each application for 
completeness as received. We will notify the applicant if additional 
information is necessary or if the application does not meet the initial 
eligibility requirements for waiver. All applications will be available 
for public inspection electronically in the Department of Transportation 
Docket at http://dot.dms.gov.
    (2) Applications being processed on the merits will be noticed in 
the Federal Register. Interested parties will be given an opportunity to 
comment on whether introduction of any proposed vessel would adversely 
affect them. In the absence of duly filed objections to an application, 
and in the absence of unduly adverse impact on vessel builders or 
businesses employing U.S.-built vessels otherwise discovered by us, we 
will conclude that there will be no adverse effect. If an objection to 
an application is received, additional information may be sought from 
the objector. The applicant will be given a sufficient amount of time to 
respond. The Director, Office of Ports and Domestic Shipping, will then 
either make a decision based on the written submissions and all 
available information or, on MARAD's motion or at the applicant's 
request, hold a hearing on the application and make a decision based on 
the hearing record. The decision will be communicated to the applicant, 
commenters and the United States Coast Guard in writing and placed in 
the docket. If MARAD grants a waiver, the applicant must thereafter 
contact the Coast Guard to obtain the necessary documentation for 
domestic operation. MARAD's waiver does not satisfy other requirements 
of the Coast Guard for documentation. The waiver, if approved, will be 
assigned to the vessel.
    (b) Revocation. We may, upon the request of a U.S. builder or a 
coastwise trade business of a person who employs

[[Page 387]]

U.S.-built vessels or upon our own initiative propose to revoke a waiver 
granted under this part, on the basis that the waiver was obtained 
through fraud. The grantee of the waiver in question will be notified 
directly by mail, and a notice will be published in the Federal 
Register. The original docket of the application will be reopened. We 
may request additional information from the applicant granted the waiver 
or from any respondent to the notice. The Director, Office of Ports and 
Domestic Shipping, will then either make a decision based on the written 
submissions and all available information or, on MARAD's motion or at 
the applicant's request, hold a hearing on the proposed revocation and 
make a decision based on the hearing record. The decision will be 
communicated in writing to: the applicant granted the waiver, the 
requestor (if any), each respondent to the proposed revocation notice, 
the Coast Guard; and placed in the docket. If MARAD revokes a waiver, 
the Coast Guard, automatically and without further proceedings, shall 
revoke the vessel's coastwise endorsement.
    (c) Review of determinations. (1) The decisions by the Director, 
Office of Ports and Domestic Shipping, to grant a waiver, deny a waiver, 
or revoke a waiver will not be final until time for discretionary review 
by the Administrator has expired. Each decision to grant, deny, or 
revoke a waiver will be made in writing and a copy of the written 
decision will be provided to each applicant and other parties to the 
decision. Applicants, persons who requested revocation of a waiver, and 
persons who submitted comments in response to a Federal Register notice 
may petition the Administrator to review a decision by the Director, 
Office of Ports and Domestic Shipping, to grant a waiver, deny a waiver, 
or revoke a waiver within five (5) business days after such decision is 
filed in the docket. Each petition for review should state the 
petitioner's standing and the reasons review is being sought, clearly 
pointing out alleged errors of fact or misapplied points of law. Within 
five (5) business days of submission of a petition for review, the 
applicant, and other persons with standing, may request that the 
Administrator not review a decision by the Director, Office of Ports and 
Domestic Shipping, to grant, deny, or revoke a waiver. Such petitions 
and responses must either be sent by facsimile to the Secretary, 
Maritime Administration, at (202) 366-9206 or filed electronically in 
the appropriate DOT docket at http://dms.dot.gov. The Administrator will 
decide whether to review within five (5) business days following the 
last day for submission of a request that the Administrator not take 
review. If the Administrator undertakes review, the decision by the 
Director, Office of Ports and Domestic Shipping, is stayed until final 
disposition. In the event the Administrator decides to undertake review, 
a decision will be made based on the written submissions and all 
available information. As a matter of discretion, the Administrator or 
designated representative may hold a hearing on the proposed action and 
make a decision based on the hearing record. The decision will be 
communicated in writing to the interested parties and the Coast Guard. 
In the review process, the decision of the Maritime Administrator is the 
final disposition. In the absence of any petition for review, the 
determination by the Director, Office of Ports and Domestic Shipping, 
becomes final on the sixth business day after the decision. The 
Secretary, MARAD, may extend any of the time limits, but only for good 
cause shown.
    (2) Such petitions and responses must either be sent by facsimile to 
the Secretary, Maritime Administration, at (202) 366-9206 or filed 
electronically in the appropriate DOT docket at http://dms.dot.gov. The 
Administrator will decide whether to review within five (5) business 
days following the last day for submission of a request that the 
Administrator not take review. If the Administrator takes review, the 
decision by the Director, Office of Ports and Domestic Shipping, is 
stayed until final disposition. In the event the Administrator decides 
to take review, a decision will be made based on the written

[[Page 388]]

submissions and all available information. As a matter of discretion, 
the Administrator or designated representative may hold a hearing on the 
proposed action and make a decision based on the hearing record. The 
decision will be communicated in writing to the interested parties and 
the Coast Guard. In the review process, the decision of the Maritime 
Administrator is the final disposition. In the absence of any petition 
for review, the determination by the Director, Office of Ports and 
Domestic Shipping, becomes final on the sixth business day after the 
decision. The Secretary, MARAD, may extend any of the time limits, but 
only for good cause shown.

Sec. 389.1  Purpose.

    This part prescribes regulations implementing the provisions of 
section 417 of Public Law 108-293, which grants the Secretary of 
Transportation, acting through the Maritime Administration, the 
authority to review and approve applications for determinations of 
availability of coastwise-qualified launch barges. Owners or operators 
of proposed platform jackets may submit information regarding a specific 
platform jacket transport, placement and/or launch project, following 
the procedures set forth in this regulation, in order for us to 
determine whether a suitable coastwise-qualified barge is available for 
the project. If we determine a suitable coastwise-qualified launch barge 
is not available, then a non-coastwise qualified foreign-built launch 
barge may be used.


<R05>
Sec. 389.2  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this Part:
    ``Administrator'' means the Maritime Administrator.
    ``Coastwise-qualified Vessel'' means a vessel that has been issued a 
certificate of documentation with a coastwise endorsement under 46 
U.S.C. 12112.

<R05>
Sec. 389.5  Review; issuance of determinations.

    (a) The Maritime Administration will review each application for 
completeness including evidence of prior notification and payment of 
application fee. Applications will not be processed until deemed 
complete. We will notify the applicant if additional information is 
necessary. We encourage the submission of applications well in advance 
of project dates in order to allow sufficient time for review under this 
part.
    (b) We will review the information required by Sec. 389.4. When the 
application is deemed complete, we will publish a notice in the Federal 
Register describing the project and platform jacket involved, advising 
that all relevant information reasonably needed to assess the

[[Page 391]]

available to interested parties upon request. The notice will request 
that information on the availability of coastwise-qualified launch 
barges be submitted within thirty (30) days after the publication date. 
We will also notify the coastwise-qualified owners/operators who have 
registered with us as per Sec. 389.3.
    (c) The Maritime Administration will review any submittals whereby 
an owner or operator of a coastwise-qualified launch barge asserts they 
are available and we will facilitate discussions between the offeror and 
the platform jacket owner/operator. If the parties are unable to reach 
agreement, we will make a determination regarding availability.
    (d) If needed, the Maritime Administration's technical personnel 
will review the data required in Sec. 389.4. The data must be complete 
and current. Any data submitted will not be returned to the applicant 
and will be retained by us on file for a period of time. The Maritime 
Administration review will not substitute for the review and approval by 
either a major classification society (ABS, BV, LR, GL, DNV, NK) or the 
U.S. Coast Guard. The Maritime Administration review will not verify the 
accuracy or correctness of the applicant's engineering proposal; rather, 
it will only pertain to the general reasonableness and soundness of the 
technical approach.
    (e) The Maritime Administration will deny the application if:
    (1) We find the applicant did not comply with the requirements in 
Sec. 389.3 or Sec. 389.4; or,
    (2) We determine a suitable coastwise-qualified launch barge is 
reasonably available.
    (f) The Maritime Administration will issue a determination of non-
availability if we determine that no suitable coastwise-qualified vessel 
is reasonably available.
    (g) Our determination will be issued within ninety (90) days from 
the date the application notice was published in the Federal Register.
    (g) Our determination of non-availability will expire one-hundred 
and twenty (120) days after the date of issuance, unless we provide an 
extension for good cause.
    Maritime Administration determinations in this regard should NOT be 
interpreted as a change setting new federal maritime precedents. The 
Maritime Administration continues to support the Jones Act, the 
Passenger Vessel Services Act, and other federal U.S.-flag requirements.

<R05>
Sec. 390.3  Policy considerations.

    (a) In general. It is the policy of the United States, as set forth 
in 46 U.S.C. 50501, that for the national defense and the development of 
its foreign and domestic commerce, the United States shall have a 
merchant marine: sufficient to carry a substantial portion of its water-
borne export and import foreign commerce and to provide shipping service 
essential for maintaining the flow of such commerce at all times; 
capable of serving as auxiliaries in time of war or national emergency; 
owned and operated by United States citizens insofar as practicable and 
composed of the best equipped, safest and most suitable types of 
vessels, constructed and documented in the United States and manned with 
United States citizens.
    (b) Unacceptable programs--(1) In general. The Maritime 
Administrator will not enter into an agreement where the proposed 
program is not, in his opinion, in consonance with the policies of the 
Act.
    (2) Specific unacceptable programs. The Maritime Administrator will 
not enter into an agreement where the proposed program is merely to 
accomplish the following:
    (i) Reconstruction of an existing vessel, unless such reconstruction 
will exceed $1,000,000 in cost, will be capitalized under the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder and 
will result in a vessel which is significantly more competitive;
    (ii) Acquisition of an existing vessel; or
    (iii) Payment of the principal on existing indebtedness.
    (3) Waiver. The Maritime Administrator may, for good cause shown, 
waive the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. For example, 
the Maritime Administrator may waive the monetary limit in paragraph 
(b)(2)(i) of

[[Page 394]]

this section where the applicant proposes to reconstruct a small vessel.

Sec. 390.6  Administration of the agreement.

    (a) In general. The Maritime Administrator will administer and 
enforce the agreement in a manner which will insure that the fund is 
properly established, that the assets in the fund are used to accomplish 
the program and that the party fully complies with all obligations and 
responsibilities. This

[[Page 397]]

section specifies the reports which must be submitted to the Maritime 
Administrator and sets forth the procedures for administering the 
agreement.
    (b) Reporting requirements--(1) In general. This paragraph describes 
the reports required to be submitted to the Maritime Administrator by 
the party.
    (2) Submission dates. Reports must be submitted annually, in 
triplicate, for the party's taxable year not later than 90 days after 
the close of each reporting period. An affidavit regarding the operation 
of qualified agreement vessels as required by paragraph (b)(7) of this 
section shall be submitted concurrently with each annual report.
    (3) Cumulation. The annual report submitted following the close of 
the party's taxable year shall be cumulative for the party's entire 
taxable year.
    (4) Certification. The annual report shall be accompanied by an 
opinion of an independent certified public accountant to the effect that 
exhibits (see paragraph (b)(5) of this section) composing the accounting 
have been prepared in accordance with all published orders, rules, 
regulations and instructions issued or adopted by the Maritime 
Administrator.
    (5) Format. The reports shall consist of the following exhibits:
    (i) ``Exhibit A''--a summary of cash, securities and stock on 
deposit (showing the adjusted basis for securities and stock), including 
a subtotal of cash, securities and stock on deposit, net amount of 
accrued deposits to and accrued withdrawals from the fund and the fund 
total at the end of the period, and if applicable, a summary of the 
portion of the fund which represents a ``CCF: Security Amount'' pursuant 
to an Agreement Covering the Dual Use of a Capital Construction Fund;
    (ii) ``Exhibit A-1''--a summary of balances in all cash accounts 
within the fund at the end of the period;
    (iii) ``Exhibit A-2''--a summary of the securities and stock within 
the fund at the end of the period (showing both the adjusted basis and 
fair market value of each item);
    (iv) ``Exhibit A-3''--a summary of the accrued deposits to and

    (vi) ``Exhibit C''--a summary showing the opening balance, additions 
thereto due to deposits to the fund, subtractions therefrom due to 
withdrawals from the fund, and the closing balance for the period for 
each of the three separate accounts: ordinary income account, capital 
gains account and capital account; and
    (vii) ``Exhibit D''--a summary, by vessel, of the qualified 
withdrawals made from the fund during the period.
    (6) Sample report. A sample report is contained in appendix III of 
this part.
    (7) Affidavit. An official of the party who is knowledgeable about 
the operation of the party's qualified agreement vessels shall submit an 
affidavit for each taxable year indicating that the party's qualified 
agreement vessels operated only in qualified trades during such taxable 
year, or if any such vessel operated in a trade other than a qualified 
trade, the details of such operation. See Sec. 390.5(c) of this part 
for a description of what constitutes a qualified trade. A sample 
affidavit is contained in appendix V of this part.
    (8) Failure to submit reports. The failure by a party to make the 
timely submission of any report or affidavit required by this section 
shall constitute a material breach of the agreement unless the Maritime 
Administrator shall determine that such failure was excusable. See Sec. 
390.13 (relating to the failure to fulfill a substantial obligation 
under the agreement).
    (c) Review in the event of changed circumstances. Each agreement 
provides that the party shall promptly inform the Maritime Administrator 
of any change in circumstances which affects its agreement. Such changes 
may be mere form, such as a change of the party's name, or substantive 
such as the sale of an eligible agreement vessel. The Maritime 
Administrator may require a full review of the agreement if in his 
opinion the changed circumstances materially affect the agreement.
    (d) Modification of agreement--(1) In general. The agreement is 
subject to

[[Page 398]]

modification and amendment by mutual consent. However, except in special 
circumstances, the Maritime Administrator will not consent to 
modification or amendment of the standard part of the agreement unless 
such modification or amendment is of uniform application to similarly 
situated parties. The Maritime Administrator will normally agree to 
modification or amendment of the schedules subject to the restriction in 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (2) Limitations on modification of schedules. The Maritime 
Administrator will not agree to modification or amendment of the 
schedules (as described in Sec. 390.4) when, in his opinion, such 
modification or amendment delays imposition of Federal Income Tax in a 
manner not contemplated or authorized by the Act, or if the proposed 
modification or amendment would not be in consonance with the policies 
of the Act, these rules and regulations or the joint regulations.
    (e) Fund adjustment upon modification. Upon application by a party 
for modification or amendment of the agreement, the Maritime 
Administrator will determine whether the requested modification or 
amendment would result in an amount held in the fund in excess of an 
amount determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out the 
program. If such an excess is created in the fund by such modification 
or amendment, the Maritime Administrator will require a nonqualified 
withdrawal (as defined in Sec. 390.10) of such excess as a condition to 
the modification or amendment.

Sec. 390.7  Deposits into the fund.

    (a) In general--(1) Source of deposits. 46 U.S.C. 53505 provides 
ceilings within which fund deposits may be made. This section provides 
rules for the qualification of depositories, timing of deposits, the 
type of property which may be deposited and the level of deposits.
    (2) Tax aspects of deposits. For the Federal Income Tax aspects of 
deposits into a fund, see 46 U.S.C. 53507 and Sec. 3.3 of the joint 
regulations (Sec. 391.3 of this chapter).
    (b) Depositories--(1) In general. 46 U.S.C. 53506 provides that 
amounts in a fund must be kept in the depository or depositories 
specified in the agreement and be subject to such trustee or other 
fiduciary requirements as the Maritime Administrator may specify.
    (2) Qualifications. The Maritime Administrator has established 
general qualifications for depositories for all maritime programs 
authorized under the Act, including the capital construction fund 
program. The general qualifications are published in Part 351 of this 
title.
    (3) Fiduciary requirements. Except in unusual circumstances, the 
Maritime Administrator will not impose special trustee or other 
fiduciary requirements upon depositories of a fund. For rules relating 
to a fund held in trust for investment purposes, see paragraph (h) of 
this section.
    (4) Type and name of accounts. Unless otherwise specified in the 
agreement, the party may select the type or types of accounts in which 
assets of the fund may be deposited. For example, the party may select a 
savings account for cash and a trust account for intangible property 
which is held in the fund. Each account shall be in the name of the 
party and identified as a capital construction fund account.
    (5) Compensating balances. The obligation of the assets in the fund 
as a compensating balance shall constitute a material breach of the 
agreement.
    (c) Timing of deposits--(1) In general. 46 U.S.C. 53507(b) provides 
that deposits shall not be taxable only when they are made in accordance 
with the agreement and not later than the time provided in the joint 
regulations.
    (2) Deposits prior to the time provided in joint regulations. The 
party may make deposits for any taxable year prior to the time provided 
in joint regulations in accordance with the following rules:
    (i) Amounts representing taxable income attributable to the 
operation of agreement vessels for a taxable year may be deposited at 
any time during such taxable year, and thereafter within the time 
provided for in the joint regulations, based upon the party's estimated 
Federal taxable income for such vessels for the entire taxable year;

[[Page 399]]

    (ii) Amounts representing net proceeds from the sale or other 
disposition (including mortgaging) with respect to agreement vessels may 
be deposited when accrued and thereafter within the time provided for in 
the joint regulations;
    (iii) Amounts representing receipts from the investment or 
reinvestment of amounts held in a fund may be deposited when accrued and 
thereafter within the time provided for in the joint regulations; and
    (iv) Amounts representing depreciation with respect to agreement 
vessels for a taxable year may be deposited at any time during such 
taxable year, and thereafter within the time provided for in the joint 
regulations.
    (3) Deposits required prior to the time provided in joint 
regulations. The Maritime Administrator may require that deposits be 
made earlier than the latest time provided for in the joint regulations. 
Generally, the Maritime Administrator will require early deposits only 
when necessary for the party to meet its agreed upon obligations.
    (d) Types of property which may be deposited into a fund--(1) Form 
of deposits. Deposits may be made into a fund only in the form of money 
or intangible property of the type in which assets of the fund may be 
invested pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 53506, the Agreement, and these 
regulations, other than the securities or common and preferred stock of 
the party or a company related to the party within the meaning of 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section, except that in the case of deposits 
representing net proceeds from the sale or other disposition of any 
agreement vessel to other than a purchaser or transferee related to the 
party (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2) of this section) or 
deposits representing receipts from the investment or reinvestment of 
amounts held in a fund, any intangible property received may be 
deposited.
    (2) Related purchaser. For purposes of this paragraph a purchaser or 
transferee is a related person to the party if--
    (i) The relationship between purchaser or transferee and the party 
would result in disallowance of losses under section 267 or 707 of the 
Code, or
    (ii) The purchaser or transferee and the party are members of the 
same controlled group of corporations (as defined in section 1563(a) of 
the Code, except that ``more than 50 percent'' shall be substituted for 
``at least 80 percent'' each place it appears therein).
    (e) Level of deposits--(1) In general. 46 U.S.C. 53504 states that 
the agreement must provide for the deposit in the fund of amounts agreed 
upon but only to the extent necessary or appropriate to provide for 
qualified withdrawals to accomplish the program set forth in the 
agreement.
    (2) Maximum level of deposits. The party shall not be permitted to 
deposit more than is necessary to complete its program. See Sec. 390.4 
(relating to description of the agreement).
    (3) Minimum level of deposits. Each agreement shall contain an 
agreed upon minimum deposit schedule applicable to each three-year 
period under the agreement. The minimum deposit shall be calculated 
taking into consideration the scheduling of the anticipated qualified 
withdrawals. The purpose of the minimum deposit is to insure that the 
party has made a sufficient commitment to accomplish its program. See 
Sec. 390.13 (relating to failure to fulfill a substantial obligation 
under the agreement).
    (4) Determination of minimum deposits. The minimum deposit shall be 
set by the Maritime Administrator. In determining the minimum deposit, 
the Maritime Administrator shall give consideration to the anticipated 
ceilings, financial history, current conditions and future business 
expectations of the party.
    (5) Waiver of minimum deposit. The Maritime Administrator shall 
waive a failure to meet the minimum deposit schedule when the party has 
deposited all allowable taxable income as specified in Article 5(c) of 
this agreement attributable to the operation of agreement vessels, net 
proceeds from all sales or other dispositions of agreement vessels, all 
receipts from the investment or reinvestment of amounts held in the fund 
and all earned depreciation on agreement vessels. The Maritime 
Administrator may also waive the minimum deposit schedule in any case 
where the party can demonstrate

[[Page 400]]

that such deposits will adversely affect its ability to operate its 
agreement vessels. In the event of a waiver, the Maritime Administrator 
may require modification of the schedules. See Sec. 390.6 (relating to 
administration of the agreement).
    (6) Selection of ceiling. Except as may be otherwise provided in the 
agreement or these rules and regulations, the party may choose the 
ceilings with respect to which deposits are made.
    (f) Allocation of depreciation deposits--(1) In general. 46 U.S.C. 
53505(b) provides that in the case of a lessee of an eligible agreement 
vessel the maximum amount which may be deposited with respect to such 
vessel, under the depreciation ceiling, shall be reduced by any amount 
which the owner is required or permitted to deposit with respect to such 
vessel under its depreciation ceiling.
    (2) Method of allocation. When an agreement vessel is leased, the 
party's agreement shall fix a percentage of the annual depreciation 
which the party may deposit. The percentage shall be that agreed upon 
between the lessors and the lessees unless the Maritime Administrator 
determines that the agreed upon percentage will result in an 
accumulation of assets in the fund or funds which is greater than or 
less than an amount necessary or appropriate to carry out the party's 
program. See paragraph (e) of this section (relating to level of 
deposits).
    (g) [Reserved]
    (h) Funds held in trust for investment purposes. A fund may be 
transferred in whole or in part to the control of an unrelated trustee 
for investment purposes with the prior written permission of the 
Maritime Administrator. The Maritime Administrator shall approve such a 
transfer when:
    (1) The trustee meets the requirements for a depository under 
paragraph (b) of this section;
    (2) The trust instrument provides that all investment restrictions 
stated in 46 U.S.C. 53506 and Sec. 390.8 of these regulations will be 
observed;
    (3) The trust instrument provides that the trustee will give 
consideration to the party's withdrawal requirements under the agreement 
when investing the fund;
    (4) The trustee agrees to be bound by all rules and regulations 
which have been or will be promulgated governing the investment or 
management of the fund.
    (i) Federal ship mortgage guarantee or insurance. A fund may serve 
in lieu of a Restricted Fund required in connection with Federal Ship 
Mortgage Guarantee or Insurance under 46 U.S.C. Chapter 537 and the 
regulations thereunder upon approval by the Maritime Administrator. 
Approval by the Maritime Administrator shall be conditioned upon the 
execution by the party of an agreement, satisfactory in form and 
substance to the Maritime Administrator, governing the dual use of the 
fund. Applications for permission to use the fund in this dual capacity 
should be made in writing to the Secretary, Maritime Administration.

their capital; and
    (ii) Preferred stock of a corporation if the common stock of that

Sec. 390.9  Qualified withdrawals.

    (a) In general--(1) Defined. In accordance with 46 U.S.C. 53509, 
qualified withdrawals are those made from a fund in accordance with the 
agreement, but only if they are for:
    (i) The acquisition, construction or reconstruction of a qualified 
agreement vessel;
    (ii) The acquisition, construction or reconstruction of barges or 
containers which are part of the complement of a qualified agreement 
vessel; or
    (iii) The payment of the principal on indebtedness incurred in 
connection with the acquisition, construction or reconstruction of a 
qualified agreement vessel or a barge or container which is part of the 
complement of a qualified agreement vessel.
    (2) Tax aspects of a qualified withdrawal. For the tax aspects of a 
qualified withdrawal, see 46 U.S.C. 50510 and Sec. 3.6 of the joint 
regulations (Sec. 391.6 of this chapter).
    (b) Purpose of qualified withdrawals--(1) Acquisition of qualified 
agreement vessels. (i) The term acquisition of a qualified agreement 
vessel shall mean any transaction, including a corporate merger, where 
the party obtains a proprietary interest in an existing vessel and such 
a proprietary interest will, in the opinion of the Maritime 
Administrator, further the purposes and policies of the Act. See Sec. 
390.3 (relating to policy considerations).
    (ii) Qualified withdrawals for the acquisition of a qualified 
agreement vessel shall only be allowed for amounts determined by 
independent appraisal to be the fair market value of the vessel, at the 
time of the acquisition, or the actual cost directly allocable to 
acquiring only the vessel, whichever is less.
    (2) Construction of qualified agreement vessels. The term 
construction of a qualified agreement vessel shall mean the construction 
of a vessel with the aid of qualified withdrawals.
    (3) Reconstruction of qualified agreement vessels. Once an agreement 
has been entered into, the term reconstruction of a qualified agreement 
vessel shall mean any improvement to an existing vessel which increases 
the vessel's competitiveness and involves an aggregate sum in excess of 
$100,000. The Maritime Administrator may waive the monetary limit in 
this subparagraph in the case of small vessels.
    (4) Payment of principal on indebtedness. 46 U.S.C. 53509(a)(2) 
provides that any indebtedness which the party proposes to pay through 
qualified withdrawals must be shown to the satisfaction of the Maritime 
Administrator to have been incurred in direct connection with the 
acquisition, construction or reconstruction of a qualified agreement 
vessel. The fact that indebtedness is secured by an interest in a 
qualified agreement vessel is insufficient by itself to demonstrate the 
direct connection. It is not necessary that the lien or mortgage 
securing the indebtedness be on the vessel. For example, if the party 
mortgages an office building in order to finance the construction of a 
vessel, payments of principal on the mortgage may be made with qualified 
withdrawals.
    (c) Limitations on qualified withdrawals--(1) Capitalized costs 
requirement. All qualified withdrawals must be for costs which are 
capitalized under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the 
regulations thereunder and so reported on the party's Federal Income Tax 
return.
    (2) Executed contract requirement and reimbursement of general 
funds. Qualified withdrawals may be made for the purpose of reimbursing 
general funds subject to the following limitations:
    (i) Qualified withdrawals may not be made until a construction, 
reconstruction or acquisition contract is executed. However, the party 
may reimburse its general funds for expenditures applicable to the 
construction, reconstruction or acquisition contract which occurred 
prior to the date of contracting if such reimbursements are made within 
120 days from the date of such contracting.

[[Page 403]]

    (ii) The party may also reimburse its general funds for expenditures 
which could have been paid initially by a qualified withdrawal, if such 
reimbursements are made within 120 days of such expenditure.
    (iii) The party may reimburse its general funds for expenditures 
made prior to the time an agreement or amendment is entered into, but 
after the party has made application therefor, if such expenditures 
would otherwise qualify for reimbursement pursuant to paragraphs (c)(3) 
(i) and (ii) of this section but for the fact that an agreement or 
amendment has not been executed, and if such reimbursement is effected 
within 120 days of the execution of an agreement or amendment.
    (3) Prepayment of indebtedness. The party shall not prepay principal 
on indebtedness with qualified withdrawals without the prior written 
consent of the Maritime Administrator.
    (4) Qualified withdrawals paid to related persons. A withdrawal, 
including payments for indebtedness, paid to a related person, within 
the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended, and the regulations thereunder, shall not constitute a 
qualified withdrawal unless the Maritime Administrator determines that 
no portion of such payment constitutes a dividend, a return of capital 
or a contribution of capital under the Internal Revenue Code. 
Transactions which include payments to a related person, will be 
approved if the cost of the item to be acquired, constructed or 
reconstructed through qualified withdrawals is or was at the time of the 
acquisition, construction or reconstruction its fair market value. The 
party must obtain the prior written permission of the Maritime 
Administrator before any qualified withdrawals may be paid to a related 
person. Any such withdrawal prior to approval shall be a nonqualified 
withdrawal.
    (d) Permission to make qualified withdrawals. Once a program has 
been approved, prior approval of the Maritime Administrator is not 
required for specific qualified withdrawals except as provided in 
paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(5) of this section. However, the Maritime 
Administrator will give prior approval to qualified withdrawals upon 
written request.

FR 56740, Sept. 30, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 390.10  Nonqualified withdrawals.

    (a) In general--(1) Defined. Any withdrawal from a fund which is not 
a qualified withdrawal is a nonqualified withdrawal.
    (2) Tax aspects of a nonqualified withdrawal. For the tax aspects of 
a nonqualified withdrawal, see 46 U.S.C. 53511 and Sec. 3.7 of the 
joint regulations (Sec. 391.7 of this chapter).
    (b) Permission required--(1) In general. The prior written 
permission of the Maritime Administrator is required before a 
nonqualified withdrawal may be made.
    (2) Failure to secure permission. A nonqualified withdrawal made 
without the prior written permission of the Maritime Administrator shall 
constitute a material breach of the agreement unless the Maritime 
Administrator shall determine that failure to obtain prior written 
consent was excusable. See Sec. 390.13 (relating to failure to fulfill 
a substantial obligation under the agreement).
    (3) Types of nonqualified withdrawals which will be permitted. 
Generally, the Maritime Administrator will give permission to make 
nonqualified withdrawals when:
    (i) The party has incurred operating losses from the operations of 
agreement vessels which have impaired his working capital and it becomes 
necessary to reimburse its general funds to the extent of such losses;
    (ii) The party desires to make an expenditure for research, 
development or design and such an expenditure is incident to new and 
advanced ship design, machinery and equipment;
    (iii) The withdrawal would be a qualified withdrawal except for the 
fact that there is no tax basis left that can be reduced; or
    (iv) The party demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Maritime 
Administrator, that it cannot fulfill its program due to circumstances 
beyond its

[[Page 404]]

control or due to a change in circumstances which makes the completion 
of its program economically unfeasible.

[41 FR 4265, Jan. 29, 1976, as amended at 73 FR 56740, Sept. 30, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 390.11  Sale or other disposition of agreement vessels.

    (a) Eligible agreement vessels. The sale or other disposition 
(including mortgages) of eligible agreement vessels shall not require 
prior approval of the Maritime Administrator, but shall require written 
notification within 10 days after the sale or other disposition. Such 
notification shall include a description of the transaction, the 
identity of the transferee, the proceeds to be realized, the date of the 
transaction and whether the proceeds will be deposited into the fund.
    (b) Qualified agreement vessels--(1) In general. If a qualified 
agreement vessel whose basis has been reduced through the application of 
qualified withdrawals is sold or disposed of (including mortgaged) 
within one year, interest on the amount of gain attributable to the 
basis reduction shall attach if the Maritime Administrator determines 
that the disposition was contrary to the policies of the Act, the joint 
regulations or these regulations. See Sec. 390.13 (relating to failure 
to fulfill a substantial obligation under the agreement).
    (2) Period of one year defined. The one-year period shall mean 365 
days from the date of final delivery from the shipyard in the case of 
construction or reconstruction and 365 days from the date of first 
loading of the vessel in the case of an acquisition.
    (3) Prior approval. The party shall obtain the written approval of 
the Maritime Administrator prior to the sale or other disposition 
(including mortgage) of a qualified agreement vessel.
    (4) Deposit requirement. The Maritime Administrator will not 
normally require the deposit of the net proceeds from the sale of a 
qualified agreement vessel but shall require the deposit of the net 
proceeds from the mortgage of a qualified agreement vessel for which 
qualified withdrawals from the fund have been made.
    (c) Sale or other disposition of agreement vessels to related 
persons--(1) In general. Section 3.2(c)(4) of the joint regulations 
(Sec. 391.2(c)(4) of this chapter) requires that the net proceeds from 
the sale or other disposition of an agreement vessel shall be the fair 
market value of the vessel when the party and the purchaser are owned or 
controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests within the 
meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, 
and the regulations thereunder. In such case, the party shall furnish 
data to establish that the amount realized or to be realized is the fair 
market value.
    (2) Data to be submitted. Sufficient data must be submitted to 
support a determination by the Maritime Administrator of the fair market 
value including the original cost of the vessel, dates of original 
delivery, acquisition and reconstruction, as applicable, cost of 
improvements, sales price, costs of sale and any other information which 
would assist in making such determination.

<R05>
Sec. 390.12  Liquidated damages.

    (a) Liquidated damages--(1) In general. Each agreement entered into 
under Chapter 535 shall contain a liquidated damages provision for the 
purpose of placing the party into its prefund position for each day a 
qualified agreement vessel is operated in violation of the geographic 
trading restrictions contained in the Act and Sec. 390.5. The 
liquidated damages provision requires that the party repay the time 
value of the deferral of Federal Income Tax which the party has 
received.
    (2) Calculation of liquidated damages. The liquidated damages 
specified in this paragraph shall be calculated as follows:
    (i) With respect to each vessel operated in violation of the 
applicable trading restrictions, add (A) the sum of qualified 
withdrawals for the vessel which have been made from the ordinary income 
and capital gain accounts to the date of breach, and (B) the amount of 
any unpaid principal on indebtedness for the vessel which may be paid 
from the fund less any portion of such amount which by operation of law

[[Page 405]]

must be withdrawn from the capital account balance on deposit in the 
fund on the date of the breach.
    (ii) Multiply the total derived in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this 
section by an assumed effective Federal Income Tax rate of 30 percent;
    (iii) Compound the product derived in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this 
section at 8 percent annually (A) for 20 years, if the duration of the 
trading restrictions applicable to the vessel is 20 years in accordance 
with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section; (B) for 10 years, if the 
duration of the trading restrictions applicable to the vessel is 10 
years in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this 
section; or (C) for 5 years, if the duration of the trading restrictions 
applicable to the vessel is 5 years in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(1)(iv) of this section.
    (iv) Subtract the amount calculated in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this 
section from the product derived in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this 
section;
    (v) Divide the result derived in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this 
section by 2; and
    (vi) Divide the result derived in paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this 
section (A) by 7300 (days) if the duration of the trading restrictions 
applicable to the vessel is 20 years; (B) by 3650 (days) if the duration 
of the trading restrictions applicable to the vessel is 10 years; or (C) 
by 1825 (days) if the duration of the trading restrictions applicable to 
the vessel is 5 years.
    (3) Formula. The calculation of the daily rate of liquidated damages 
may be reduced to the following formula:

X = [I(QT)-S]/2D

Where:

X = Daily rate in dollars.
Q = Summation of qualified withdrawals, other than withdrawals from the 
capital account, permitted from the fund.
T = Assumed effective tax rate of 30 pct.
S = Tax savings=(Q)(T).
I = Discount factor to be applied for vessels subject to 20-yr trading 
restriction = 4.660957; for vessels subject to 10-yr trading restriction 
= 2.158925; for vessels subject to 5-yr trading restriction = 1.469328 
(value of $1 compounded at 8 pct for 20, 10, and 5 yr respectively).
D = 7,300 d for vessels subject to 20-yr trading restriction; 3,650 d 
for vessels subject to 10-yr trading restriction; 1,825 d for vessel 
subject to 5-yr trading restriction.

    The formula may be further reduced to:

X = 0.5491436Q/7,300


for vessels subject to 20 year trading restriction,

X = 0.1738388Q/3,650


for vessels subject to 10 year trading restriction,

X = 0.0703992Q/1,825


for vessels subject to 5 year trading restriction.
    (4) Example. The provisions of paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this 
section may be illustrated by the following example:

    Assume that a qualified agreement vessel has been constructed with 
qualified withdrawals from a fund. The total cost was $20 million of 
which $6 million was withdrawn from the fund for a downpayment. Pursuant 
to the agreement, an additional $4 million may be withdrawn from the 
fund to pay principal on indebtedness. Thus, $10 million has been or may 
be withdrawn from the fund with respect to this vessel. The daily rate 
of liquidated damages would be:

X = 0.5491436 (10,000,000)/7300 or X = $752.25

    (5) Payment of liquidated damages. The amount derived in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section shall be the daily rate of liquidated damages and 
shall be paid to the Maritime Administrator, for deposit in the Treasury 
of the United States, within 30 days from the date the qualified 
agreement vessel first entered the prohibited geographic trade and shall 
be for all amounts owing from such date thereafter until the date 
payment is due. Payments, for continuing breaches, shall be made at 30 
day intervals.
    (6) Other remedies. Nothing in this paragraph shall diminish the 
Maritime Administrator's other remedies for breach under the Act, the 
rules and regulations or the agreement.
    (b) Duration of restrictions--(1) In general. The geographic trading 
restrictions in the Act and Sec. 390.5 and the liquidated damages 
provision shall apply for:
    (i) 20 years from the date of final delivery on qualified agreement 
vessels constructed or acquired within one year of final delivery from 
the shipyard with the aid of qualified withdrawals;

[[Page 406]]

    (ii) 10 years from the date of completion of reconstruction for 
qualified agreement vessels reconstructed with the aid of qualified 
withdrawals;
    (iii) 10 years from the date of acquisition of qualified agreement 
vessels acquired with the aid of qualified withdrawals more than one 
year after final delivery of the vessel from the shipyard;
    (iv) 10 years from the date of the first qualified withdrawal from 
the fund to pay the existing indebtedness on a qualified agreement 
vessel which was included in Schedule B for that purpose unless the 
qualified vessel was more than fifteen years old on the date of the 
first qualified withdrawal in which case the period shall be five years.
    (2) Transfer of qualified agreement vessel. In the event a qualified 
agreement vessel is sold or transferred to another person (see paragraph 
(b)(3) of Sec. 390.11 requiring prior permission), the transferor shall 
require in the bill of sale that the transferee agree with the Maritime 
Administrator to comply with the geographic trading restrictions and to 
pay liquidated damages for any breach of such agreement that occurs 
after the transfer. The transferor shall remain liable for any 
violations that occurred prior to the approved transfer. However, in the 
case of a like kind exchange which is governed by section 1031 of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if the vessel acquired by the 
party has an economic life equal to or greater than the length of the 
geographic trading restrictions that remain applicable to the 
transferred vessel, the acquired vessel shall be deemed to be a 
qualified agreement vessel and the geographic trading restrictions of 
the transferred vessel shall attach to the acquired vessel.

FR 56740, Sept. 30, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 390.13  Failure to fulfill a substantial obligation under the agreement.

    (a) In general. 46 U.S.C. 53509(c) requires the Maritime 
Administrator to determine whether there has been a failure to fulfill a 
substantial obligation under an agreement.
    (b) Contracting Officer's tentative conclusion--(1) Notice. If the 
Contracting Officer tentatively concludes that any substantial 
obligation under the agreement, the joint regulations or these 
regulations is not being fulfilled by the party he shall serve written 
notice of his tentative conclusion upon the party by certified mail with 
return receipt requested. The notice shall contain the following 
information:
    (i) A statement of the grounds upon which the tentative conclusion 
is based;
    (ii) The amount the Contracting Officer tentatively concludes should 
be withdrawn as a nonqualified withdrawal; and
    (iii) A statement that the tentative conclusion shall become a final 
decision unless the party requests, within 30 days, an opportunity 
either to cure its breach or to be heard and offer evidence in 
opposition to the tentative conclusion.
    (2) Effect of notice. The notice of the tentative conclusion shall 
become a final decision as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, unless within 30 days of receipt of such a written notice the 
party by personal delivery or by certified mail, requests the 
opportunity either to cure its breach or to be heard and offer evidence 
in opposition to the tentative conclusion, in which case no further 
withdrawals from the fund, without the written prior approval of the 
Contracting Officer, shall be made by the party until a binding final 
decision is reached by the Maritime Administration.
    (c) Basis for Contracting Officer's tentative conclusion. In 
determining whether a party has not fulfilled a substantial obligation 
under its agreement, the Contracting Officer shall consider among other 
things:
    (1) The effect of the party's action or omission upon its ability to 
either carry out the purpose of the fund, accomplish its Schedule B 
program (see Sec. 390.4(c)) or satisfy its minimum level of deposits in 
Schedule D (see Sec. 390.4(e)).
    (2) Whether the party has made material misrepresentations in 
connection with its application, agreement or any modification or 
amendment thereto or has failed to disclose material information that 
may affect its agreement or the purpose of the fund.

[[Page 407]]

    (d) Contracting Officer's decision and appeals to the Maritime 
Administrator--(1) Where there has not been a request to cure or to be 
heard. If the Contracting Officer issues a written notice under 
paragraph (b) of this section and the party does not request within 30 
days an opportunity either to cure its breach or to be heard and offer 
evidence in opposition to the tentative conclusion, the Contracting 
Officer's tentative conclusion shall become the final decision, which 
decision shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the party, and no 
appeal therefrom shall be taken to the Maritime Administrator.
    (2) Where there has been a request to cure or to be heard. If the 
Contracting Officer issues a written notice under paragraph (b) of this 
section and the party requests within 30 days an opportunity either to 
cure its breach or to be heard and offer evidence in opposition to the 
tentative conclusion, the party shall be offered such an opportunity. 
Request to cure must include a proposal to cure the breach. If the 
Contracting Officer accepts the party's proposal to cure its breach, 
then such determination shall be final. A party requesting to be heard 
and offer evidence in opposition to the Contracting Officer's tentative 
conclusion shall be permitted to submit, in writing, any information, 
evidence or argument within a period set by the Contracting Officer 
after considering the wishes of the party. The Contracting Officer shall 
reduce his final decision to writing and furnish the party a copy, by 
certified mail--return receipt requested, which decision shall be final 
and conclusive and shall bind the party unless within 30 days of receipt 
of the decision the party appeals from said decision by personal 
delivery or by certified mail to the Maritime Administrator with notice 
to the Contracting Officer.
    (e) Appeals to the Maritime Administrator. Appeals with a request 
for a hearing on the record, if desired, are to be transmitted pursuant 
to paragraph (d) of this section and are to be addressed to the Maritime 
Administrator. Upon the filing of an appeal, the Contracting Officer 
shall transmit the entire record and a copy of his final decision to the 
Maritime Administrator. If a request for a hearing on the record is 
granted, the Maritime Administrator shall proceed pursuant to the Rules 
of Practice and Procedure in Part 201 of this title. The decision of the 
Maritime Administrator on any question of fact shall be final, 
conclusive and binding upon the party unless determined by a court of 
competent jurisdiction to be fraudulent, capricious, or arbitrary, or so 
grossly erroneous as necessarily to imply bad faith or is not supported 
by substantial evidence.

Sec. 390.14  Departmental reports and certification.

    (a) In general. For each calendar year, the Secretary of 
Transportation shall provide the Secretary of the Treasury, within 120 
days after the close of such calendar year, a written report with 
respect to those capital construction funds under the Secretary of 
Transportation's jurisdiction.

calendar year that such person has failed to fulfill a substantial 
obligation under any capital construction fund agreement to which such 
person is a party.

the laws of the United States for operation in the United States 
foreign, Great Lakes, or noncontiguous domestic trade or in the 
fisheries of the United States and shall provide for the deposit in the 
fund of the amounts agreed upon as necessary or appropriate to provide 
for qualified withdrawals under subsection (f). The deposits in the 
fund, and all withdrawals from the fund, whether qualified or 
nonqualified, shall be subject to such conditions and requirements as 
the Secretary of Transportation may by regulations prescribe or are set 
forth in such agreement; except that the Secretary of Transportation may 
not require any person to deposit in the fund for any taxable year more 
than 50 percent of that portion of such person's taxable income for such 
year (computed in the manner provided in subsection (b)(1)(A)) which is 
attributable to the operation of the agreement vessels.
    (b) Ceiling on Deposits.
    (1) The amount deposited under subsection (a) in the fund for any 
taxable year shall not exceed the sum of:
    (A) That portion of the taxable income of the owner or lessee for 
such year (computed as provided in chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1954 but without regard to the carryback of any net operating 
loss or net capital loss and without regard to this section) which is 
attributable to the operation of the agreement vessels in the foreign or 
domestic commerce of the United States or in the fisheries of the United 
States.
    (B) The amount allowable as a deduction under section 167 of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for such year with respect to the 
agreement vessels.
    (C) If the transaction is not taken into account for purposes of 
subparagraph (A), the net proceeds (as defined in joint regulations) 
from (i) the sale or other disposition of any

[[Page 421]]

agreement vessel, or (ii) insurance or indemnity attributable to any 
agreement vessel, and
    (D) The receipts from the investment or reinvestment of amounts held 
in such fund.
    (2) In the case of a lessee, the maximum amount which may be 
deposited with respect to an agreement vessel by reason of paragraph 
(1)(B) for any period shall be reduced by any amount which, under an 
agreement entered into under this section, the owner is required or 
permitted to deposit for such period with respect to such vessel by 
reason of paragraph (1)(B).
    (3) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term agreement vessel 
includes barges and containers which are part of the complement of such 
vessel and which are provided for in the agreement.
    (c) Requirements as to Investments.
    Amounts in any fund established under this section shall be kept in 
the depository or depositories specified in the agreement and shall be 
subject to such trustee and other fiduciary requirements as may be 
specified by the Secretary of Transportation. They may be invested only 
in interest-bearing securities approved by the Secretary of 
Transportation; except that, if the Secretary of Transportation consents 
thereto, an agreed percentage (not in excess of 60 percent) of the 
assets of the fund may be invested in the stock of domestic 
corporations. Such stock must be currently fully listed and registered 
on an exchange registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as 
a national securities exchange, and must be stock which would be 
acquired by prudent men of discretion and intelligence in such matters 
who are seeking a reasonable income and the preservation of their 
capital. If at any time the fair market value of the stock in the fund 
is more than the agreed percentage of the assets in the fund, any 
subsequent investment of amounts deposited in the fund, and any 
subsequent withdrawal from the fund, shall be made in such a way as to 
tend to restore the fund to a situation in which the fair market value 
of the stock does not exceed such agreed percentage. For purposes of 
this subsection, if the common stock of a corporation meets the 
requirements of this subsection, and if the preferred stock of such 
corporation would meet such requirements but for the fact that it cannot 
be listed and registered as required because it is nonvoting stock, such 
preferred stock shall be treated as meeting the requirements of this 
subsection.
    (d) Nontaxability for Deposits.
    (1) For purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954--
    (A) Taxable income (determined without regard to this section) for 
the taxable year shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount 
deposited for the taxable year out of amounts referred to in subsection 
(b)(1)(A).
    (B) Gain from a transaction referred to in subsection (b)(1)(C) 
shall not be taken into account if an amount equal to the net proceeds 
(as defined in joint regulations) from such transaction is deposited in 
the fund.
    (C) The earnings (including gains and losses) from the investment 
and reinvestment of amounts held in the fund shall not be taken into 
account,
    (D) The earnings and profits of any corporation (within the meaning 
of section 316 of such Code) shall be determined without regard to this 
section, and
    (E) In applying the tax imposed by section 531 of such Code 
(relating to the accumulated earnings tax), amounts while held in the 
fund shall not be taken into account.
    (2) Paragraph (1) shall apply with respect to any amount only if 
such amount is deposited in the fund pursuant to the agreement and not 
later than the time provided in joint regulations.
    (e) Establishment of Accounts.
    For purposes of this section--
    (1) Within the fund established pursuant to this section three 
accounts shall be maintained:
    (A) The capital account,
    (B) The capital gain account, and
    (C) The ordinary income account.
    (2) The capital account shall consist of--
    (A) Amounts referred to in subsection (b)(1)(B),
    (B) Amounts referred to in subsection (b)(1)(C) other than that 
portion thereof which represents gain not taken into account by reason 
of subsection (d)(1)(B),
    (C) 85 percent of any dividend received by the fund with respect to 
which the person maintaining the fund would (but for subsection 
(d)(1)(C)) be allowed a deduction under section 243 of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1954, and
    (D) Interest income exempt from taxation under section 103 of such 
Code.
    (3) The capital gain account shall consist of--
    (A) Amounts representing capital gains on assets held for more than 
6 months and referred to in subsection (b)(1)(C) or (b)(1)(D), reduced 
by--
    (B) Amounts representing capital losses on assets held in the fund 
for more than 6 months.
    (4) The ordinary income account shall consist of--
    (A) Amounts referred to in subsection (b)(1)(A),
    (B)(i) Amounts representing capital gains on assets held for 6 
months or less and referred to in subsection (b)(1)(C) or (b)(1)(D), 
reduced by--
    (ii) Amounts representing capital losses on assets held in the fund 
for 6 months or less,
    (C) Interest (not including any tax-exempt interest referred to in 
paragraph (2)(D)) and other ordinary income (not including any

[[Page 422]]

dividend referred to in subparagraph (E)) received on assets held in the 
fund,
    (D) Ordinary income from a transaction described in subsection 
(b)(1)(C), and
    (E) 15 percent of any dividend referred to in paragraph (2)(C).
    (5) Except on termination of a fund, capital losses referred to in 
paragraph (3)(B) or in paragraph (4)(B)(ii) shall be allowed only as an 
offset to gains referred to in paragraph (3)(A) or (4)(B)(i), 
respectively.
    (f) Purposes of Qualified Withdrawals.
    (1) A qualified withdrawal from the fund is one made in accordance 
with the terms of the agreement but only if it is for:
    (A) The acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of a qualified 
vessel,
    (B) The acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of barges and 
containers which are part of the complement of a qualified vessel, or
    (C) The payment of the principal on indebtedness incurred in 
connection with the acquisition, construction or reconstruction of a 
qualified vessel or a barge or container which is part of the complement 
of a qualified vessel.

Except to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary 
of Transportation, subparagraph (B), and so much of subparagraph (C) as 
relates only to barges and containers, shall apply only with respect to 
barges and containers constructed in the United States.
    (2) Under joint regulations, if the Secretary of Transportation 
determines that any substantial obligation under any agreement is not 
being fulfilled, he may, after notice and opportunity for hearing to the 
person maintaining the fund, treat the entire fund or any portion 
thereof as an amount withdrawn from the fund in a nonqualified 
withdrawal.
    (g) Tax Treatment of Qualified Withdrawals.
    (1) Any qualified withdrawal from a fund shall be treated--
    (A) First as made out of the capital account.
    (B) Second as made out of the capital gain account, and
    (C) Third as made out of the ordinary income account.
    (2) If any portion of a qualified withdrawal for a vessel, barge, or 
container is made out of the ordinary income account, the basis of such 
vessel, barge, or container shall be reduced by an amount equal to such 
portion.
    (3) If any portion of a qualified withdrawal for a vessel, barge, or 
container is made out of the capital gain account, the basis of such 
vessel, barge, or container shall be reduced by an amount equal to--
    (A) Five-eighths of such portion, in the case of a corporation 
(other than an electing small business corporation, as defined in 
section 1371 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954), or
    (B) One-half of such portion, in the case of any other person.
    (4) If any portion of a qualified withdrawal to pay the principal on 
any indebtedness is made out of the ordinary income account or the 
capital gain account, then an amount equal to the aggregate reduction 
which would be required by paragraphs (2) and (3) if this were a 
qualified withdrawal for a purpose described in such paragraphs shall be 
applied, in the order provided in joint regulations, to reduce the basis 
of vessels, barges, and containers owned by the person maintaining the 
fund. Any amount of a withdrawal remaining after the application of the 
preceding sentence shall be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal.
    (5) If any property the basis of which was reduced under paragraph 
(2), (3), or (4) is disposed of, any gain realized on such disposition, 
to the extent it does not exceed the aggregate reduction in the basis of 
such property under such paragraphs, shall be treated as an amount 
referred to in subsection (h)(3)(A) which was withdrawn on the date of 
such disposition. Subject to such conditions and requirements as may be 
provided in joint regulations, the preceding sentence shall not apply to 
a disposition where there is a redeposit in an amount determined under 
joint regulations which will insofar as practicable, restore the fund to 
the position it was in before the withdrawal.
    (h) Tax Treatment of Nonqualified Withdrawals.
    (1) Except as provided in subsection (i), any withdrawal from a fund 
which is not a qualified withdrawal shall be treated as a nonqualified 
withdrawal.
    (2) Any nonqualified withdrawal from a fund shall be treated--
    (A) First as be made out of the ordinary income account,
    (B) Second as made out of the capital gain account, and
    (C) Third as made out of the capital account.

For purposes of this section, items withdrawn from any account shall be 
treated as withdrawn on a first-in-first-out basis; except that (i) any 
nonqualified withdrawal for research, development, and design expenses 
incident to new and advanced ship design, machinery and equipment, and 
(ii) any amount treated as a nonqualified withdrawal under the second 
sentence of subsection (g)(4), shall be treated as withdrawn on a last-
in-first-out basis.
    (3) For purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954--
    (A) Any amount referred to in paragraph (2)(A) shall be included in 
income as an item of ordinary income for the taxable year in which the 
withdrawal is made.

[[Page 423]]

    (B) Any amount referred to in paragraph (2)(B) shall be included in 
income for the taxable year in which the withdrawal is made as an item 
of gain realized during such year from the disposition of an asset held 
for more than 6 months, and
    (C) For the period on or before the last date prescribed for payment 
of tax for the taxable year in which this withdrawal is made--
    (i) No interest shall be payable under section 6601 f such Code and 
no addition to the tax shall be payable under section 6651 of such Code.
    (ii) Interest on the amount of the additional tax attributable to 
any item referred to in subparagraph (A) or (B) shall be paid at the 
applicable rate (as defined in paragraph (4)) from the last date 
prescribed for payment of the tax for the taxable year for which such 
item was deposited in the fund, and
    (iii) No interest shall be payable on amounts referred to in clauses 
(i) and (ii) of paragraph (2) or in the case of any nonqualified 
withdrawal arising from the application of the recapture provision of 
section 606(5) of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 as in effect on 
December 31, 1969.
    (4) For purposes of paragraph (3)(C)(ii), the applicable rate of 
interest for any nonqualified withdrawal--
    (A) Made in a taxable year beginning in 1970 or 1971 is 8 percent, 
or
    (B) Made in a taxable year beginning after 1971, shall be determined 
and published jointly by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary 
of Transportation and shall bear a relationship to 8 percent which the 
Secretaries determine under joint regulations to be comparable to the 
relationship which the money rates and investment yields for the 
calendar year immediately preceding the beginning of the taxable year 
bear to the money rates and investment yields for the calendar year 
1970.
    (i) Certain Corporate Reorganizations and Changes in Partnerships.
    Under joint regulations--
    (1) A transfer of a fund from one person to another person in a 
transaction to which section 381 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 
applies may be treated as if such transaction did not constitute a 
nonqualified withdrawal, and
    (2) A similar rule shall be applied in the case of a continuation of 
a partnership (within the meaning of subchapter K of such Code).
    (j) Treatment of Existing Funds.
    (1) Any person who was maintaining a fund or funds (hereinafter in 
this subsection referred to as ``old fund'') under this section (as in 
effect before the enactment of this subsection) may elect to continue 
such old fund but--
    (A) May not hold moneys in the old fund beyond the expiration date 
provided in the agreement under which such old fund is maintained 
(determined without regard to any extension or renewal entered into 
after April 14, 1970),
    (B) May not simultaneously maintain such old fund and a new fund 
established under this section, and
    (C) If he enters into an agreement under this section to establish a 
new fund, may agree to the extension of such agreement to some or all of 
the amounts in the old fund.
    (2) In the case of any extension of an agreement pursuant to 
paragraph (1)(C), each item in the old fund to be transferred shall be 
transferred in a nontaxable transaction to the appropriate account in 
the new fund established under this section. For purposes of subsection 
(h)(3)(C), the date of the deposit of any item so transferred shall be 
July 1, 1971, or the date of the deposit in the old fund, whichever is 
the later.

<R05>
Sec. 391.1  Scope of section 607 of the Act and the regulations in this part.

    (a) In general. The regulations prescribed in this part provide 
rules for determining the income tax liability of any person a party to 
an agreement with the Secretary of Transportation establishing a capital 
construction fund (for purposes of this part referred to as the 
``fund'') authorized by section 607 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as 
amended (for purposes of this part referred to as the ``Act''). With 
respect to such parties, section 607 of the Act in general provides for 
the nontaxability of certain deposits of money or other property into 
the fund out of earnings or gains realized from the operation of vessels 
covered in an agreement, gains realized from the sale or other 
disposition of agreement vessels or proceeds from insurance for 
indemnification for loss of agreement vessels, earnings from the 
investment or reinvestment of amounts held in a fund, and gains with 
respect to amounts or deposits in the fund. Transitional rules are also 
provided for the treatment of ``old funds'' existing on or before the 
effective date of the Merchant Marine Act of 1970 (see Sec. 391.10).
    (b) Cross references. For rules relating to eligibility for a fund, 
deposits, and withdrawals and other aspects, see the regulations 
prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation in title 46 (Merchant 
Marine) and by the Secretary of Commerce in title 50 (Fisheries) of the 
Code of Federal Regulations.
    (c) Code. For purposes of this part, the term Code means the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended.


<R05>
Sec. 391.2  Ceiling on deposits.

    (a) In general--(1) Total ceiling. Section 607(b) of the Act 
provides a ceiling on the amount which may be deposited by a party for a 
taxable year pursuant to an agreement. The amount which a party may 
deposit into a fund may not exceed the sum of the following subceilings:
    (i) The lower of (a) the taxable income (if any) of the party for 
such year (computed as provided in chapter 1 of the Code but without 
regard to the carryback of any net operating loss or net capital loss 
and without regard to section 607 of the Act) or (b) taxable income (if 
any) of such party for such year attributable under paragraph (b) of 
this section to the operation of agreement vessels (as defined in 
paragraph (f) of this section) in the foreign or domestic commerce of 
the United States or in the fisheries of the United States (see section 
607(b)(1)(A) of the Act),
    (ii) Amounts allowable as a deduction under section 167 of the Code 
for such year with respect to the agreement vessels (see section 
607(b)(1)(B) of the Act),
    (iii) The net proceeds (if not included in paragraph (a)(i) of this 
section) from (a) the sale or other disposition of any agreement vessels 
or (b) insurance or

[[Page 425]]

indemnity attributable to any agreement vessels (see section 
607(b)(1)(C) of the Act and paragraph (c) of this section), and
    (iv) Earnings and gains from the investment or reinvestment of 
amounts held in such fund (see section 607 (b)(1)(D) of the Act and 
paragraphs (d) and (g) of this section).
    (2) Overdeposits. (i) If for any taxable year an amount is deposited 
into the fund under a subceiling computed under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section which is in excess of the amount of such subceiling for such 
year, then at the party's option such excess (or any portion thereof) 
may--
    (a) Be treated as a deposit into the fund for that taxable year 
under another available subceiling, or
    (b) Be treated as not having been deposited for the taxable year and 
thus, at the party's option, may be disposed of either by it being--
    (1) Treated as a deposit into the fund under any subceiling 
available in the first subsequent taxable year in which a subceiling is 
available, in which case such amount shall be deemed to have been 
deposited on the first day of such subsequent taxable year, or
    (2) Repaid to the party from the fund.
    (ii)(a) When a correction is made for an overdeposit, proper 
adjustment shall be made with respect to all items for all taxable years 
affected by the overdeposit, such as, for example, amounts in each 
account described in Sec. 391.4, treatment of nonqualified withdrawals, 
the consequences of qualified withdrawals and the treatment of losses 
realized or treated as realized by the fund. Thus, for example, if the 
party chooses to have the fund repay to him the amount of an 
overdeposit, amounts in each account, basis of assets, and any affected 
item will be determined as though no deposit and repayment had been 
made. Accordingly, in such a case, if there are insufficient amounts in 
an account to cover a repayment of an overdeposit (as determined before 
correcting the overdeposit), and the party had applied the proceeds of a 
qualified withdrawal from such account towards the purchase of a 
qualified vessel (within the meaning of Sec. 391.11(a)(2)), then such 
account and the basis of the vessel shall be adjusted as of the time 
such withdrawal was made and proceeds were applied, and repayment shall 
be made from such account as adjusted. If a party chooses to treat the 
amount of an overdeposit as a deposit under a subceiling for a 
subsequent year, similar adjustments to affected items shall be made. If 
the amount of a withdrawal would have exceeded the amount in the fund 
(determined after adjusting all affected amounts by reason of correcting 
the overdeposit), the withdrawal to the extent of such excess shall be 
treated as a repayment made at the time the withdrawal was made.
    (b) If the accounts (as defined in Sec. 391.4) that were increased 
by reason of excessive deposits contain sufficient amounts at the time 
the overdeposit is discovered to repay the party, the party may, at his 
option, demand repayment of such excessive deposits from such accounts 
in lieu of making the adjustments required by paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(a) of 
this section.
    (iii) During the period beginning with the day after the date an 
overdeposit was actually made and ending with the date it was disposed 
of in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i)(b) of this section, there 
shall be included in the party's gross income for each taxable year the 
earnings attributed to any amount of overdeposit on hand during such a 
year. The earnings attributable to any amount of overdeposit on hand 
during a taxable year shall be an amount equal to the product of--
    (a) The average daily earnings for each one dollar in the fund (as 
determined in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section),
    (b) The amount of overdeposit (as determined in paragraph (a)(2)(vi) 
of this section), and
    (c) The number of days during the taxable year the overdeposit 
existed.
    (iv) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(a) of this section, the 
average daily earnings for each dollar in the fund shall be determined 
by dividing the total earnings of the fund for the taxable year by the 
sum of the products of--
    (a) Any amount on hand during the taxable year (determined under 
paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section), and

[[Page 426]]

    (b) The number of days during the taxable year such amount was on 
hand in the fund.
    (v) For purposes of this paragraph--
    (a) An amount on hand in the fund or an overdeposit shall not be 
treated as on hand on the day deposited but shall be treated as on hand 
on the day withdrawn, and
    (b) The fair market value of such amounts on hand for purposes of 
this subparagraph shall be determined as provided in Sec. 20.2031-2 of 
the Estate Tax Regulations of this chapter but without applying the 
blockage and other special rules contained in paragraph (e) thereof.
    (vi) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(b) of this section, the 
amount of overdeposit on hand at any time is an amount equal to--
    (a) The amount deposited into the fund under a subceiling computed 
under paragraph (a)(1) of this section which is in excess of the amount 
of such subceiling, less
    (b) The sum of--
    (1) Amounts described in paragraph (a)(2)(vi)(a) of this section 
treated as a deposit under another subceiling for the taxable year 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section,
    (2) Amounts described in paragraph (a)(2)(vi)(a) of this section 
disposed of (or treated as disposed of) in accordance with paragraphs 
(a)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section prior to such time.
    (vii) To the extent earnings attributed under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) 
of this section represent a deposit for any taxable year in excess of 
the subceiling described in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section for 
receipts from the investment or reinvestment of amounts held in the 
fund, such attributed earnings shall be subject to the rules of this 
paragraph for overdeposits.
    (3) Underdeposit caused by audit adjustment. [Reserved]
    (4) Requirements for deficiency deposits. [Reserved]
    (b) Taxable income attributable to the operation of an agreement 
vessel--(1) In general. For purposes of this section, taxable income 
attributable to the operation of an agreement vessel means the amount, 
if any, by which the gross income of a party for the taxable year from 
the operation of an agreement vessel (as defined in paragraph (f) of 
this section) exceeds the allowable deductions allocable to such 
operation (as determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section). The 
term taxable income attributable to the operation of the agreement 
vessels means the sum of the amounts described in the preceding sentence 
separately computed with respect to each agreement vessel (or share 
therein) or, at the party's option, computed in the aggregate.
    (2) Gross income. (i) Gross income from the operation of agreement 
vessels means the sum of the revenues which are derived during the 
taxable year from the following:
    (a) Revenues derived from the transportation of passengers, freight, 
or mail in such vessels, including amounts from contracts for the 
charter of such vessels to others, from operating differential 
subsidies, from collections in accordance with pooling agreements and 
from insurance or indemnity net proceeds relating to the loss of income 
attributable to such agreement vessels.
    (b) Revenues derived from the operation of agreement vessels 
relating to commercial fishing activities, including the transportation 
of fish, support activities for fishing vessels, charters for commercial 
fishing, and insurance or indemnity net proceeds relating to the loss of 
income attributable to such agreement vessels.
    (c) Revenues from the rental lease, or use by others of terminal 
facilities, revenues from cargo handling operations and tug and lighter 
operations, and revenues from other services or operations which are 
incidental and directly related to the operation of an agreement vessel. 
Thus, for example, agency fees, commissions, and brokerage fees derived 
by the party at his place of business for effecting transactions for 
services incidental and directly related to shipping for the accounts of 
other persons are includible in gross income from the operation of 
agreement vessels where the transaction is of a kind customarily 
consummated by the party for his own account at such place of business.

[[Page 427]]

    (d) Dividends, interest, and gains derived from assets set aside and 
reasonably retained to meet regularly occurring obligations relating to 
the shipping or fishing business directly connected with the agreement 
vessel which obligations cannot at all times be met from the current 
revenues of the business because of layups or repairs, special surveys, 
fluctuations in the business, and reasonably forseeable strikes (whether 
or not a strike actually occurs), and security amounts retained by 
reason of participation in conferences, pooling agreements, or similar 
agreements.
    (ii) The items of gross income described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (c) 
and (d) of this section shall be considered to be derived from the 
operations of a particular agreement vessel in the same proportion that 
the sum of the items of gross income described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) 
(a) and (b) of this section which are derived from the operations of 
such agreement vessel bears to the party's total gross income for the 
taxable year from operations described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (a) and 
(b) of this section.
    (iii) In the case of a party who uses his own or leased agreement 
vessels to transport his own products, the gross income attributable to 
such vessel operations is an amount determined to be an arm's length 
charge for such transportation. The arm's length charge shall be 
determined by applying the principles of section 482 of the Code and the 
regulations thereunder as if the party transporting the product and the 
owner of the product were not the same person but were controlled 
taxpayers within the meaning of Sec. 1.482-1(a)(4) of the Income Tax 
Regulations of this chapter. Gross income attributable to the operation 
of agreement vessels does not include amounts for which the party is 
allowed a deduction for percentage depletion under sections 611 and 613 
of the Code.
    (3) Deductions. From the gross income attributable to the operation 
of an agreement vessel or vessels as determined under paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section, there shall be deducted in accordance with the 
principles of Sec. 1.861-8 of the Income Tax Regulations of this 
chapter, the expenses, losses, and other deductions definitely related 
and therefore allocated and apportioned thereto and a ratable part of 
any expenses, losses, or other deductions which are not definitely 
related to any gross income of the party. Thus, for example, if a party 
has gross income attributable to the operation of an agreement vessel 
and other gross income and has a particular deduction definitely related 
to both types of gross income, such deductions must be apportioned 
between the two types of gross income on a reasonable basis in 
determining the taxable income attributable to the operation of the 
agreement vessel.
    (4) Net operating and capital loss deductions. The taxable income of 
a party attributable to the operation of agreement vessels shall be 
computed without regard to the carryback of any net operating loss 
deduction allowed by section 172 of the Code, the carryback of any net 
capital loss deduction allowed by section 165(f) of the Code, or any 
reduction in taxable income allowed by section 607 of the Act.
    (5) Method of accounting. Taxable income must be computed under the 
method of accounting which the party uses for Federal income tax 
purposes. Such method may include a method of reporting whereby items of 
revenue and expense properly allocable to voyages in progress at the end 
of any accounting period are eliminated from the computation of taxable 
income for such accounting period and taken into account in the 
accounting period in which the voyage is completed.
    (c) Net proceeds from transactions with respect to agreement 
vessels. [Reserved]
    (d) Earnings and gains from the investment or reinvestment of 
amounts held in a fund--(1) In general. (i) Earnings and gains received 
or accrued by a party from the investment or reinvestment of assets in a 
fund is the total amount of any interest or dividends received or 
accrued, and gains realized, by the party with respect to assets 
deposited in, or purchased with amounts deposited in, such fund. Such 
earnings and gains are therefore required to be included in the gross 
income of the party unless such amount, or a portion thereof, is not 
taken into account under section 607(d)(1)(C) of the Act and

[[Page 428]]

Sec. 391.3(b)(2)(ii) by reason of a deposit or deemed deposit into the 
fund. For rules relating to receipts from the sale or other disposition 
of nonmoney deposits into the fund, see paragraph (g) of this section.
    (ii) Earnings received or accrued by a party from investment or 
reinvestment of assets in a fund include the ratable monthly portion of 
original issue discount included in gross income pursuant to section 
1232(a)(3) of the Code. Such ratable monthly portion shall be deemed to 
be deposited into the ordinary income account of the fund, but an actual 
deposit representing such ratable monthly portion shall not be made. For 
basis of a bond or other evidence of indebtedness issued at a discount, 
see Sec. 391.3(b)(2)(ii)(b).
    (2) Gain realized. (i) The gain realized with respect to assets in 
the fund is the excess of the amount realized (as defined in section 
1001(b) of the Code and the regulations thereunder) by the fund on the 
sale or other disposition of a fund asset over its adjusted basis (as 
defined in section 1011 of the Code) to the fund. For the adjusted basis 
of nonmoney deposits, see paragraph (g) of this section.
    (ii) Property purchased by the fund (including property considered 
under paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section as purchased by the fund) 
which is withdrawn from the fund in a qualified withdrawal (as defined 
in Sec. 391.5) is treated as a disposition to which subdivision (i) of 
this subparagraph applies. For purposes of determining the amount by 
which the balance within a particular account will be reduced in the 
manner provided in Sec. 391.6(b) (relating to order of application of 
qualified withdrawals against accounts) and for purposes of determining 
the reduction in basis of a vessel, barge, or container (or share 
therein) pursuant to Sec. 391.6(c), the value of the property is its 
fair market value on the day of the qualified withdrawal.
    (3) Holding Period. Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this 
section, the holding period of fund assets shall be determined under 
section 1223 of the Code.
    (e) Leased vessels. In the case of a party who is a lessee of an 
agreement vessel, the maximum amount which such lessee may deposit with 
respect to any agreement vessel by reason of section 607(b)(1)(B) of the 
Act and paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section (relating to depreciation 
allowable) for any period shall be reduced by the amount (if any) which, 
under an agreement entered into under section 607 of the Act, the owner 
is required or permitted to deposit for such period with respect to such 
vessel by reason of section 607(b)(1)(B) of the Act and paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii) of this section. The amount of depreciation depositable by 
the lessee under this paragraph is the amount of depreciation deductible 
by the lessor on its income tax return, reduced by the amount described 
in the preceding sentence or the amount set forth in the agreement, 
whichever is lower.
    (f) Definition of agreement vessel. For purposes of this section, 
the term agreement vessel (as defined in Sec. 391.11 (a)(3) and 46 CFR 
390.6) includes barges and containers which are the complement of an 
agreement vessel and which are provided for in the agreements, agreement 
vessels which have been contracted for or are in the process of 
construction, and any shares in an agreement vessel. Solely for purposes 
of this section, a party is considered to have a ``share'' in an 
agreement vessel if he has a right to use the vessel to generate income 
from its use whether or not the party would be considered as having a 
proprietary interest in the vessel for purposes of State or Federal law. 
Thus, a partner may enter into an agreement with respect to his share of 
the vessel owned by the partnership and he may make deposits of his 
distributive share of the sum of the four subceilings described in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Notwithstanding the provisions of 
Subchapter K of the Code (relating to the taxation of partners and 
partnerships), the Internal Revenue Service will recognize, solely for 
the purposes of applying this part, an agreement by an owner of a share 
in an agreement vessel even though the ``share'' arrangement is a 
partnership for purposes of the Code.
    (g) Special rules for nonmoney deposits and withdrawals--(1) In 
general. (i) Deposits may be made in the form of

[[Page 429]]

money or property of the type permitted to be deposited under the 
agreement. (For rules relating to the types of property which may be 
deposited into the fund, see 46 CFR 390.7(d), and 50 CFR Part 259.) For 
purposes of this paragraph, the term property does not include money.
    (ii) Whether or not the election provided for in paragraph (g)(2) of 
this section is made--
    (a) The amount of any property deposit, and the fund's basis for 
property deposited in the fund, is the fair market value of the property 
at the time deposited, and
    (b) The fund's holding period for the property begins on the day 
after the deposit is made.
    (iii) Unless such an election is made, deposits of property into a 
fund are considered to be a sale at fair market value of the property, a 
deposit of cash equal to such fair market value, and a purchase by the 
fund of such property for cash. Thus, in the absence of the election, 
the difference between the fair market value of such property deposited 
and its adjusted basis shall be taken into account as gain or loss for 
purposes of computing the party's income tax liability for the year of 
deposit.
    (iv) For fund's basis and holding period of assets purchased by the 
fund, see paragraphs (d) (2) and (3) of this section.
    (2) Election not to treat deposits of property other than money as a 
sale or exchange at the time of deposit. A party may elect to treat a 
deposit of property as if no sale or other taxable event had occurred on 
the date of deposit. If such election is made, in the taxable year the 
fund disposes of the property, the party shall recognize as gain or loss 
the amount he would have recognized on the day the property was 
deposited into the fund had the election not been made. The party's 
holding period with respect to such property shall not include the 
period of time such property was held by the fund. The election shall be 
made by a statement to that effect, attached to the party's Federal 
income tax return for the taxable year to which the deposit relates, or, 
if such return is filed before such deposit is made, attached to the 
party's return for the taxable year during which the deposit is actually 
made.
    (3) Effect of qualified withdrawal of property deposited pursuant to 
election. If property deposited into a fund, with respect to which an 
election under paragraph (g)(2) of this section is made, is withdrawn 
from the fund in a qualified withdrawal (as defined in Sec. 391.5) such 
withdrawal is treated as a disposition of such property resulting in 
recognition by the party of gain or loss (if any) as provided in 
paragraph (g)(2) of this section with respect to nonfund property. In 
addition, such withdrawal is treated as a disposition of such property 
by the fund resulting in recognition of gain or loss by the party with 
respect to fund property to the extent the fair market value of the 
property on the date of withdrawal is greater or less (as the case may 
be) than the adjusted basis of the property to the fund on such date. 
For purposes of determining the amount by which the balance within a 
particular account will be reduced in the manner provided in Sec. 
391.6(b) (relating to order of application of qualified withdrawals 
against accounts and for purposes of determining the reduction in basis 
of a vessel, barge, or container (or share therein) pursuant to Sec. 
391.6(c), the value of the property is its fair market value on the day 
of the qualified withdrawal. For rules relating to the effect of a 
qualified withdrawal of property purchased by the fund (including 
deposited property considered under paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this 
section as purchased by the fund), see paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this 
section.
    (4) Effect of nonqualified withdrawal of property deposited pursuant 
to election. If property deposited into a fund with respect to which an 
election under paragraph (g)(2) of this section is made, is withdrawn 
from the fund in a nonqualified withdrawal (as defined in Sec. 
391.7(b)), no gain or loss is to be recognized by the party with respect 
to fund property or nonfund property but an amount equal to the adjusted 
basis of the property to the fund is to be treated as a nonqualified 
withdrawal. Thus, such amount is to be applied against the various 
accounts in the manner provided in Sec. 391.7(c), such amount is to be 
taken into account in computing

[[Page 430]]

the party's taxable income as provided in Sec. 391.7(d), and such 
amount is to be subject to interest to the extent provided for in Sec. 
391.7(e). In the case of withdrawals to which this subparagraph applies, 
the adjusted basis of the property in the hands of the party is the 
adjusted basis on the date of deposit, increased or decreased by the 
adjustments made to such property while held in the fund, and in 
determining the period for which the party has held the property there 
shall be included, in addition to the period the fund held the property, 
the period for which the party held the property before the date of 
deposit of the property into the fund. For rules relating to the basis 
and holding period of property purchased by the fund (including 
deposited property considered under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section 
as purchased by the fund) and withdrawn in a nonqualified withdrawal see 
Sec. 391.7(f).
    (5) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph are illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example (1). X Corporation, which uses the calendar year as its 
taxable year, maintains a fund described in Sec. 391.1 X's taxable 
income (determined without regard to section 607 of the Act) is 
$100,000, of which $80,000 is taxable income attributable to the 
operation of agreement vessels (as determined under paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section). Under the agreement, X is required to deposit into the 
fund all earnings and gains received from the investment or reinvestment 
of amounts held in the fund, an amount equal to the net proceeds from 
transactions referred to in Sec. 391.2(c), and an amount equal to 50 
percent of its earnings attributable to the operation of agreement 
vessels provided that such 50 percent does not exceed X's taxable income 
from all sources for the year of deposit. The agreement permits X to 
make voluntary deposits of amounts equal to 100 percent of its earnings 
attributable to the operation of agreement vessels, subject to the 
limitation with respect to taxable income from all sources. The 
agreement also provides that deposits attributable to such earnings may 
be in the form of cash or other property. On March 15, 1973, X deposits, 
with respect to its 1972 earnings attributable to the operation of 
agreement vessels, stock with a fair market value at the time of deposit 
of $80,000 and an adjusted basis to X of $10,000. Such deposit 
represents agreement vessel income of $80,000. At the time of deposit, 
such stock had been held by X for a period exceeding 6 months. X does 
not elect under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph to defer recognition 
of the gain. Accordingly, under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph, 
the deposit is treated as a deposit of $80,000 and X realizes a long-
term capital gain of $70,000 on March 15, 1973.
    Example (2). The facts are the same as in example (1), except that X 
elects in accordance with subparagraph (2) of this paragraph not to 
treat the deposit as a sale or exchange. On July 1, 1974, the fund sells 
the stock for $85,000. The basis to the fund of the stock is $80,000 
(see subparagraph (1)(ii)(a) of this paragraph). With respect to non 
fund property, X recognizes $70,000 of long-term capital gain on the 
sale includible in its gross income for 1974. With respect to fund 
property, X realizes $5,000 of long-term capital gain (the difference 
between the amount received by the fund on the sale of the stock, 
$85,000, and the basis to the fund of the stock, $80,000), an amount 
equal to which is required to be deposited into the fund with respect to 
1974, as a gain from the investment or reinvestment of amounts held in 
the fund. Since the fund held the stock for a period exceeding 6 months, 
the $5,000 is allocated to the fund's capital gain account under Sec. 
391.4(c).
    Example (3). The facts are the same as in example (2), except that 
the fund sells the stock on July 1, 1974, for $75,000. As the basis to 
the fund of the stock is $80,000 with respect to fund property, X 
realizes a long-term capital loss on the sale (the difference between 
the amount received by the fund on the sale of the stock, $75,000, and 
the basis to the fund of the stock, $80,000), of $5,000, an amount equal 
to which is required to be charged against the fund's capital gain 
account under Sec. 391.4(e). Under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, 
X recognizes $70,000 of long-term capital gain with respect to nonfund 
property on the sale which is includible in its gross income for 1974.
    Example (4). The facts are the same as in example (2), except that 
on July 1, 1974, X makes a qualified withdrawal (as defined in Sec. 
391.5(a)) of the stock and uses it to pay indebtedness pursuant to Sec. 
391.5(b). On the disposition by X considered to occur under subparagraph 
(3) of this paragraph on the qualified withdrawal, X recognizes $70,000 
of long-term capital gain with respect to nonfund property, which is 
includible in its gross income for 1974, and a long-term capital gain of 
$5,000 with respect to fund property, an amount equal to which is 
allocated to the fund's capital gain account under Sec. 391.4(c). The 
fund is treated as having a qualified withdrawal of an amount equal to 
the fair market value of the stock on the day of withdrawal, $85,000 
(see subparagraph (3) of this paragraph). In addition, $85,000 is 
applied against the various accounts in the order provided in Sec. 
391.6(b). The basis of the

[[Page 431]]

vessel with respect to which the indebtedness was incurred is to be 
reduced as provided in Sec. 391.6(c).
    Example (5). The facts are the same as in example (2), except that X 
withdraws the stock from the fund in a nonqualified withdrawal (as 
defined in Sec. 391.7(b)). Under subparagraph (4) of this paragraph, X 
recognizes no gain or loss with respect to fund or nonfund property on 
such withdrawal. An amount equal to the basis of the stock to the fund 
($80,000) is applied against the various accounts in the order provided 
in Sec. 391.7(c), and is taken into account in computing X's taxable 
income for 1974 as provided in Sec. 391.7(d). In addition, X must pay 
interest on the withdrawal as provided in Sec. 391.7(e). The basis to X 
of the stock is $10,000 notwithstanding the fact that the fair market 
value of such stock was $85,000 on the day of withdrawal (see paragraph 
(g)(4) of this section).


<R05>
Sec. 391.3  Nontaxability of deposits.

    (a) In general. Section 607(d) of the Act sets forth the rules 
concerning the income tax effects of deposits made with respect to 
ceilings described in section 607(b) and Sec. 391.2. The specific 
treatment of deposits with respect to each of the subceilings is set 
forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Treatment of deposits--(1) Earnings of agreement vessels. 
Section 607 (d)(1)(A) of the Act provides that taxable income of the 
party (determined without regard to section 607 of the Act) shall be 
reduced by an amount equal to the amount deposited for the taxable year 
out of amounts referred to in section 607(b)(1)(A) of the Act and Sec. 
391.2(a)(1)(i). For computation of the foreign tax credit, see paragraph 
(i) of this section.
    (2) Net proceeds from agreement vessels and fund earnings. (i)(a) 
Section 607(d)(1)(B) provides that gain from a transaction referred to 
in section 607(b)(1)(C) of the Act and Sec. 391.2(a)(1)(iii) (relating 
to ceilings on deposits of net proceeds from the sale or other 
disposition of agreement vessels) is not to be taken into account for 
purposes of the Code if an amount equal to the net proceeds from 
transactions referred to in such sections is deposited in the fund. Such 
gain is to be excluded from gross income of the party for the taxable 
year to which such deposit relates. Thus, the gain will not be taken 
into account in applying section 1231 of the Code for the year to which 
the deposit relates.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (ii)(a) Section 607(d)(1)(C) of the Act provides that the earnings 
(including gains and losses) from the investment and reinvestment of 
amounts held in the fund and referred to in section 607(b)(1)(D) of the 
Act and Sec. 391.2(a)(1)(iv) shall not be taken into account for 
purposes of the Code if an amount equal to such earnings is deposited 
into the fund. Such earnings are to be excluded from the gross income of 
the party for the taxable year to which such deposit relates.
    (b) However, for purposes of the basis adjustment under section 
1232(a)(3)(E) of the Code, the ratable monthly portion of original issue 
discount included in gross income shall be determined without regard to 
section 607(d)(1)(C) of the Act.
    (iii) In determining the tax liability of a party to whom paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section applies, taxable income, determined after 
application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, is in effect reduced by 
the portion of deposits which represent gain or earnings respectively 
referred to in paragraph (b)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section. The excess, 
if any, of such portion over taxable income determined after application 
of paragraph (b)(1) of this section is taken into account in computing 
the net operating loss (under section 172 of the Code) for the taxable 
year to which such deposits relate.
    (3) Time for making deposits. (i) This section applies with respect 
to an amount only if such amount is deposited in the fund pursuant to 
the agreement and not later than the time provided in paragraph (b)(2) 
(ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section for the making of such deposit or 
the date the Secretary of Transportation provides, whichever is earlier.
    (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) (iii) or (iv) of this 
section, a deposit may be made not later than the last day prescribed by 
law (including extensions thereof) for filing the party's Federal income 
tax return for the taxable year to which such deposit relates.
    (iii) If the party is a subsidized operator under an operating-
differential

[[Page 432]]

subsidy contract, and does not receive on or before the 59th day 
preceding such last day, payment of all or part of the accrued 
operating-differential subsidy payable for the taxable year, the party 
may deposit an amount equivalent to the unpaid accrued operating-
differential subsidy on or before the 60th day after receipt of payment 
of the accrued operating-differential subsidy.
    (iv) A deposit pursuant to Sec. 391.2(a)(3)(i) (relating to 
underdeposits caused by audit adjustments) must be made on or before the 
date prescribed for such a deposit in Sec. 391.2(a)(4).
    (4) Date of deposits. (i) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs 
(b)(4) (ii) and (iii) of this section (with respect to taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 1969, and prior to January 1, 1972), in 
Sec. 391.2(a)(2)(i), or in Sec. 391.10(b), deposits made in a fund 
within the time specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section are deemed 
to have been made on the date of actual deposit.
    (ii)(a) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, and 
prior to January 1, 1971, where an application for a fund is filed by a 
taxpayer prior to January 1, 1972, and an agreement is executed and 
entered into by the taxpayer prior to March 1, 1972,
    (b) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1970, and prior 
to January 1, 1972, where an application for a fund is filed by a 
taxpayer prior to January 1, 1973, and an agreement is executed and 
entered into by the taxpayer prior to March 1, 1973, and
    (c) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1971, and prior 
to January 1, 1975, where an agreement is executed and entered into by 
the taxpayer on or prior to the due date, with extensions, for the 
filing of his Federal income tax return for such taxable year, deposits 
in a fund which are made within 60 days after the date of execution of 
the agreement, or on or before the due date, with extensions thereof, 
for the filing of his Federal income tax return for such taxable year or 
years, whichever date shall be later, shall be deemed to have been made 
on the date of the actual deposit or as of the close of business of the 
last regular business day of each such taxable year or years to which 
such deposits relate, whichever day is earlier.
    (iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, for 
taxable years beginning after December 31, 1970, and ending prior to 
January 1, 1972, deposits made later than the last date permitted under 
paragraph (b)(4)(ii) but on or before January 9, 1973, in a fund 
pursuant to an agreement with the Secretary of Transportation acting by 
and through the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, shall be deemed to have been made on the date of the 
actual deposit or as of the close of business of the last regular 
business day of such taxable year, whichever is earlier.
    (c) Determination of earnings and profits. [Reserved]
    (d) Accumulated earnings tax. As provided in section 607(d)(1)(E) of 
the Act amounts, while held in the fund, are not to be taken into 
account in computing the ``accumulated taxable income'' of the party 
within the meaning of section 531 of the Code. Amounts while held in the 
fund are considered held for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, or 
reconstructing a qualified vessel or barges and containers which are 
part of the complement of a qualified vessel or the payment of the 
principal on indebtedness incurred in connection with any such 
acquisition, construction, or reconstruction. Thus, for example, if the 
reasonable needs of the business (within the meaning of section 537 of 
the Code) justify a greater amount of accumulation for providing 
replacement vessels than can be satisfied out of the fund, such greater 
amount accumulated outside of the fund shall be considered to be 
accumulated for the reasonable needs of the business. For a further 
example, although amounts in the fund are not taken into account in 
applying the tax imposed by section 531 of the Code, to the extent there 
are amounts in a fund to provide for replacing a vessel, amounts 
accumulated outside of the fund to replace the same vessel are not 
considered to be accumulated for the reasonable needs of the business.
    (e) Nonapplicability of section 1231. If an amount equivalent to 
gain from a transaction referred to in section

[[Page 433]]

607(b)(1)(C) of the Act and Sec. 391.2(c) (1) and (5) is deposited into 
the fund and, therefore, such gain is not taken into account in 
computing gross income under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, then such gain will not be taken into account for purposes of 
the computations under section 1231 of the Code.
    (f) Deposits of capital gains. In respect of capital gains which are 
not included in the gross income of the party by virtue of a deposit to 
which section 607(d) of the Act and this section apply, the following 
provisions of the Code do not apply; the minimum tax for tax preferences 
imposed by section 56 of the Code; the alternative tax imposed by 
section 1201 of the Code on the excess of the party's net long-term 
capital gain over his net short-term capital loss; and, in the case of a 
taxpayer other than a corporation, the deduction provided by section 
1202 of the Code of 50 percent of the amount of such excess. However, 
section 56 may apply upon a nonqualified withdrawal with respect to 
amounts treated under Sec. 391.7(d)(2) as being made out of the capital 
gain account.
    (g) Deposits of dividends. The deduction provided by section 243 of 
the Code (relating to the deductions for dividends from a domestic 
corporation received by a corporation) shall not apply in respect of 
dividends (earned on assets held in the fund) which are deposited into a 
fund, and which, by virtue of such deposits and the provisions of 
section 607(d) of the Act and this section, are not included in the 
gross income of the party.
    (h) Presumption of validity of deposit. All amounts deposited in the 
fund shall be presumed to have been deposited pursuant to an agreement 
unless, after an examination of the facts upon the request of the 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his delegate, the Secretary of 
Transportation determines otherwise. The Commissioner or his delegate 
will request such a determination where there is a substantial question 
as to whether a deposit is made in accordance with an agreement.
    (i) Special rules for application of the foreign tax credit--(1) In 
general. For purposes of computing the limitation under section 904 of 
the Code on the amount of the credit provided by section 901 of the Code 
(relating to the foreign tax credit), the party's taxable income from 
any source without the United States and the party's entire taxable 
income are to be determined after application of section 607(d) of the 
Act. Thus, amounts deposited for the taxable year with respect to 
amounts referred to in section 607(b)(1)(A) of the Act and Sec. 
391.2(a)(1)(i) (relating to taxable income attributable to the operation 
of agreement vessels) shall be treated as a deduction in arriving at the 
party's taxable income from sources without the United States (subject 
to the apportionment rules and paragraph (i)(2) of this section) and the 
party's entire taxable income for the taxable year. Amounts deposited 
with respect to gain described in section 607(d)(1)(B) of the Act and 
Sec. 391.2(c) (relating to net proceeds from the sale or other 
disposition of an agreement vessel and net proceeds from insurance or 
indemnity) and amounts deposited with respect to earnings described in 
section 607(d)(1)(C) of the Act and paragraph (b)(2)(ii) (relating to 
earnings from the investment and reinvestment of amounts held in a fund) 
of this section are not taken into account for purposes of the Code and 
hence are not included in the party's taxable income from sources 
without the United States or in the party's entire taxable income for 
purposes of this paragraph.
    (2) Apportionment of taxable income attributable to agreement 
vessels. For purposes of computing the overall limitation under section 
904(a)(2) of the Code the amount of the deposit made with respect to 
taxable income attributable to agreement vessels pursuant to Sec. 
391.2(a)(1)(i) which is allocable to sources without the United States 
is the total amount of such deposit multiplied by a fraction the 
numerator of which is the gross income from sources without the United 
States from the operation of agreement vessels and the denominator of 
which is the total gross income from the operation of agreement vessels 
computed as provided in Sec. 391.2(b)(2). For purposes of this 
paragraph, gross income from sources without the United States 
attributable to the operation of agreement vessels is

[[Page 434]]

to be determined under sections 61 through 863 of the Code and under the 
taxpayer's usual method of accounting provided such method is reasonable 
and in keeping with sound accounting practice. Any computation under the 
per-country limitation of section 904(a)(1) shall be made in the manner 
consistent with the provisions of the preceding sentences of this 
paragraph.


<R05>
Sec. 391.4  Establishment of accounts.

    (a) In general. Section 607(e)(1) of the Act requires that three 
bookkeeping or memorandum accounts are to be established and maintained 
within the fund: The capital account, the capital gain account, and the 
ordinary income account. Deposits of the amounts under the subceilings 
in section 607(b) of the Act and Sec. 391.2 are allocated among the 
accounts under section 607(e) of the Act and this section.
    (b) Capital account. The capital account shall consist of:
    (1) Amounts referred to in section 607(b)(1)(B) of the Act and Sec. 
391.2 (a)(1)(ii) (relating to deposits for depreciation),
    (2) Amounts referred to in section 607(b)(1)(C) of the Act and Sec. 
391.2(a)(1)(iii) (relating to deposits of net proceeds from the sale or 
other disposition of agreement vessels) other than that portion thereof 
which represents gain not taken into account for purposes of computing 
gross income by reason of section 607(d)(1)(B) of the Act and Sec. 
391.3(b)(2) (relating to nontaxability of gain from the sale or other 
disposition of an agreement vessel),
    (3) Amounts representing 85 percent of any dividend received by the 
fund with respect to which the party would, but for section 607(d)(1)(C) 
of the Act and Sec. 391.3(b)(2)(ii) (relating to nontaxability of 
deposits of earnings from investment and reinvestment of amounts held in 
a fund), be allowed a deduction under section 243 of the Code, and
    (4) Amounts received by the fund representing interest income which 
is exempt from taxation under section 103 of the Code.
    (c) Capital gain account. The capital gain account shall consist of 
amounts which represent the excess of (1) deposits of long-term capital 
gains on property referred to in section 607(b)(1) (C) and (D) of the 
Act and Sec. 391.2(a)(1) (iii) and (iv) (relating respectively to 
certain agreement vessels and fund assets), over (2) amounts 
representing losses from the sale or exchange of assets held in the fund 
for more than 6 months (for purposes of this section referred to as 
``long-term capital losses''). For purposes of this paragraph and 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an agreement vessel disposed of at a 
gain shall be treated as a capital asset to the extent that gain thereon 
is not treated as ordinary income, including gain which is ordinary 
income under section 607(g)(5) of the Act (relating to treatment of gain 
on disposition of a vessel with a reduced basis) and Sec. 391.6(e) or 
under section 1245 of the Code (relating to gain from disposition of 
certain depreciable property). For provisions relating to the treatment 
of short-term capital gains on certain transactions involving agreement 
vessels or realized by the fund, see paragraph (d) of this section. For 
rules relating to the treatment of capital losses on assets held in the 
fund, see paragraph (e) of this section.
    (d) Ordinary income account. The ordinary income account shall 
consist of:
    (1) Amounts referred to in section 607(b)(1)(A) of the Act and Sec. 
391.2(a)(1)(i) (relating to taxable income attributable to the operation 
of an agreement vessel),
    (2) Amounts representing (i) deposits of gains from the sale or 
exchange of capital assets held for 6 months or less (for purposes of 
this section referred to as ``short-term capital gains'') referred to in 
section 607(b)(1) (C) or (D) of the Act and Sec. 391.2(a)(1) (iii) and 
(iv) (relating respectively to certain agreement vessels and fund 
assets), reduced by (ii) amounts representing losses from the sale or 
exchange of capital assets held in the fund for 6 months or less (for 
purposes of this section referred to as ``short-term capital losses''). 
For rules relating to the treatment of certain agreement vessels as 
capital assets, see paragraph (c) of this section,
    (3) Amounts representing interest (not including any tax-exempt 
interest referred to in section 607(e)(2)(D) of the Act and paragraph 
(b)(4) of this section) and other ordinary income received on assets 
held in the fund (not

[[Page 435]]

including any dividend referred to in section 607(e)(2)(C) of the Act 
and paragraph (d)(5) of this section),
    (4) Amounts representing ordinary income from a transaction 
(involving certain net proceeds with respect to an agreement vessel) 
described in section 607(b)(1)(C) of the Act and Sec. 391.2(a)(1)(iii), 
including gain which is ordinary income under section 607(g)(5) of the 
Act and Sec. 391.6(e) (relating to treatment of gain on the disposition 
of a vessel with a reduced basis) or under section 1245 of the Code 
(relating to gain from disposition of certain depreciable property), and
    (5) Fifteen percent of any dividend referred to in section 
607(e)(2)(C) of the Act and paragraph (b)(3) of this section received on 
any assets held in the fund.
    (e) Limitation on deduction for capital losses on assets held in a 
fund. Except on termination of a fund, long-term (and short-term) 
capital losses on assets held in a fund shall be allowed only as an 
offset to long-term (and short-term) capital gains on assets held in the 
fund, but only if such gains are deposited into the fund, and shall not 
be allowed as an offset to any capital gains on assets not held in the 
fund. The net long-term capital loss of the fund for the taxable year 
shall reduce the earliest long-term capital gains in the capital gain 
account at the beginning of the taxable year and the next short-term 
capital loss for the taxable year shall reduce the earliest short-term 
capital gains remaining in the ordinary income account at the beginning 
of the taxable year. Any such losses that are in excess of the capital 
gains in the respective accounts shall reduce capital gains deposited 
into the respective accounts in subsequent years (without regard to 
section 1212, relating to capital loss carrybacks and carryovers). On 
termination of a fund, any net long-term capital loss in the capital 
gain account and any net short-term capital loss remaining in the 
ordinary income accounts is to be taken into account for purposes of 
computing the party's taxable income for the year of termination as a 
long-term or short-term (as the case may be) capital loss recognized in 
the year the fund is terminated. With respect to the determination of 
the basis to a fund of assets held in such fund, see Sec. 391.2(g).


<R05>
Sec. 391.5  Qualified withdrawals.

    (a) In general. (1) A qualified withdrawal is one made from the fund 
during the taxable year which is in accordance with section 670(f)(1) of 
the Act, the agreement, and with regulations prescribed by the Secretary 
of Transportation and which is for the acquisition, construction, or 
reconstruction of a qualified vessel (as defined in Sec. 391.11(a)(2)) 
or barges and containers which are part of the complement of a qualified 
vessel (or shares in such vessels, barges, and containers), or for the 
payment of the principal of indebtedness incurred in connection with the 
acquisition construction, or reconstruction of such qualified vessel (or 
a barge or container which is part of the complement of a qualified 
vessel).
    (2) For purposes of this section the term share is used to reflect 
an interest in a vessel and means a proprietary interest in a vessel 
such as, for example, that which results from joint ownership. 
Accordingly, a share within the meaning of Sec. 391.2(f) (relating to 
the definition of ``agreement vessel'' for the purpose of making 
deposits) will not necessarily be sufficient to be treated as a share 
within the meaning of this section.
    (3) For purposes of this section, the term acquisition means any of 
the following:
    (i) Any acquisition, but only to the extent the basis of the 
property acquired in the hands of the transferee is its cost. Thus, for 
example, if a party transfers a vessel and $1 million in an exchange for 
another vessel which qualifies for nonrecognition of gain or loss under 
section 1031(a) of the Code (relating to like-kind exchange), there is 
an acquisition to the extent of $1 million.
    (ii) With respect to a lessee's interest in a vessel, expenditures 
which result in increasing the amounts with respect to which a deduction 
for depreciation (or amortization in lieu thereof) is allowable.
    (b) Payments on indebtedness. Payments on indebtedness may 
constitute qualified withdrawals only if the party

[[Page 436]]

shows to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Transportation a direct 
connection between incurring the indebtedness and the acquisition, 
construction, or reconstruction of a qualified vessel or its complement 
of barges and containers whether or not the indebtedness is secured by 
the vessel or its complement of barges and containers. The fact that an 
indebtedness is secured by an interest in a qualified vessel, barge, or 
container is insufficient by itself to demonstrate the necessary 
connection.
    (c) Payments to related persons. Not- withstanding paragraph (a) of 
this section, payments from a fund to a person owned or controlled 
directly or indirectly by the same interests as the party within the 
meaning of section 482 of the Code and the regulations thereunder are 
not to be treated as qualified withdrawals unless the party demonstrates 
to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Transportation that no part of 
such payment constitutes a dividend, a return of capital, or a 
contribution to capital under the Code.
    (d) Treatment of fund upon failure to fulfill obligations. Section 
607(f)(2) of the Act provides that if the Secretary of Transportation 
determines that any substantial obligation under the agreement is not 
being fulfilled, he may, after notice and opportunity for hearing to the 
party, treat the entire fund, or any portion thereof, as having been 
withdrawn as a nonqualified withdrawal. In determining whether a party 
has breached a substantial obligation under the agreement, the Secretary 
will consider among other things, (1) the effect of the party's action 
or omission upon his ability to carry out the purposes of the fund and 
for which qualified withdrawals are permitted under section 607(f)(1) of 
the Act, and (2) whether the party has made material misrepresentations 
in connection with the agreement or has failed to disclose material 
information. For the income tax treatment of nonqualified withdrawals, 
see Sec. 391.7.


<R05>
Sec. 391.6  Tax treatment of qualified withdrawals.

    (a) In general. Section 607(g) of the Act and this section provide 
rules for the income tax treatment of qualified withdrawals including 
the income tax treatment on the disposition of assets acquired with fund 
amounts.
    (b) Order of application of qualified withdrawals against accounts. 
A qualified withdrawal from a fund shall be treated as being made: 
First, out of the capital account; second, out of the capital gain 
account; and third, out of the ordinary income account. Such withdrawals 
will reduce the balance within a particular account on a first-in-first-
out basis, the earliest qualified withdrawals reducing the items within 
an account in the order in which they were actually deposited or deemed 
deposited in accordance with this part. The date funds are actually 
withdrawn from the fund determines the time at which withdrawals are 
considered to be made.
    (c) Reduction of basis. (1) If any portion of a qualified withdrawal 
for the acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of a vessel, barge, 
or container (or share therein) is made out of the ordinary income 
account, the basis of such vessel, barge, or container (or share 
therein) shall be reduced by an amount equal to such portion.
    (2) If any portion of a qualified withdrawal for the acquisition, 
construction or reconstruction of a vessel, barge, or container (or 
share therein) is made out of the capital gain account, the basis of 
such vessel, barge, or container (or share therein) shall be reduced by 
an amount equal to--
    (i) Five-eights of such portion, in the case of a corporation (other 
than an electing small business corporation, as defined in section 1371 
of the Code), or
    (ii) One-half of such portion, in the case of any other person.
    (3) If any portion of a qualified withdrawal to pay the principal of 
an indebtedness is made out of the ordinary income account or the 
capital gain account, then the basis of the vessel, barge, or container 
(or share therein) with respect to which such indebtedness was incurred 
is reduced in the manner provided by paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this 
section. If the aggregate amount of such withdrawal from the ordinary 
income account and capital gain account would cause a basis reduction in 
excess of the party's basis in such vessel, barge, or container (or

[[Page 437]]

share therein), the excess is applied against the basis of other 
vessels, barges, or containers (or shares therein) owned by the party at 
the time of withdrawal in the following order: (i) Vessels, barges, or 
containers (or shares therein) which were the subject of qualified 
withdrawals in the order in which they were acquired, constructed, or 
reconstructed; (ii) agreement vessels (as defined in section 607(k)(3) 
of the Act and Sec. 391.11(a)(3)) and barges and containers which are 
part of the complement of an agreement vessel (or shares therein) which 
were not the subject of qualified withdrawals, in the order in which 
such vessels, barges, or containers (or shares therein) were acquired by 
the party; and (iii) other vessels, barges, and containers (or shares 
therein), in the order in which they were acquired by the party. Any 
amount of a withdrawal remaining after the application of this paragraph 
is to be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal. If the indebtedness was 
incurred to acquire two or more vessels, barges, or containers (or 
shares therein), then the basis reduction in such vessels, barges, or 
containers (or shares therein) is to be made pro rata in proportion to 
the adjusted basis of such vessels, barges, or containers (or shares 
therein) computed, however, without regard to this section and 
adjustments under section 1016(a) (2) and (3) of the Code for 
depreciation or amortization.
    (d) Basis for depreciation. For purposes of determining the 
allowance for depreciation under section 167 of the Code in respect of 
any property which has been acquired, constructed, or reconstructed from 
qualified withdrawals, the adjusted basis for determining gain on such 
property is determined after applying paragraph (c) of this section. In 
the case of reductions in the basis of any property resulting from the 
application of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the party may adopt a 
method of accounting whereby (1) payments shall reduce the basis of the 
property on the day such payments are actually made, or (2) payments 
made at any time during the first half of the party's taxable year shall 
reduce the basis of the property on the first day of the taxable year, 
and payments made at any time during the second half of the party's 
taxable year shall reduce the basis of the property on the first day of 
the succeeding taxable year. For requirements respecting the change of 
methods of accounting, see Sec. 1.446-1(e)(3) of the Income Tax 
Regulations of this chapter.
    (e) Ordinary income treatment of gain from disposition of property 
acquired with qualified withdrawals. [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 391.7  Tax treatment of nonqualified withdrawals.

    (a) In general. Section 607(h) of the Act provides rules for the tax 
treatment of nonqualified withdrawals, including rules for adjustments 
to the various accounts of the fund, the inclusion of amounts in income, 
and the payment of interest with respect to such amounts.
    (b) Nonqualified withdrawals defined. Except as provided in section 
607 of the Act and Sec. 391.8 (relating to certain corporate 
reorganizations, changes in partnerships, and transfers by reason of 
death), any withdrawal from a fund which is not a qualified withdrawal 
shall be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal which is subject to tax in 
accordance with section 607(h) of the Act and the provisions of this 
section. Examples of nonqualified withdrawals are amounts remaining in a 
fund upon termination of the fund, and withdrawals which are treated as 
nonqualified withdrawals under section 607(f)(2) of the Act and Sec. 
391.5(d) (relating to failure by a party to fulfill substantial 
obligation under agreement) or under the second sentence of section 
607(g)(4) of the Act and Sec. 391.6(c)(3) (relating to payments against 
indebtedness in excess of basis).
    (c) Order of application of nonqualified withdrawals against 
deposits. A nonqualified withdrawal from a fund shall be treated as 
being made: First, out of the ordinary income account; second, out of 
the capital gain account; and third, out of the capital account. Such 
withdrawals will reduce the balance within a particular account on a 
first-in-first-out basis, the earliest nonqualified withdrawals reducing 
the items within an account in the order in which they were actually 
deposited or deemed deposited in accordance with this part. Nonqualified 
withdrawals for

[[Page 438]]

research, development, and design expenses incident to new and advanced 
ship design, machinery, and equipment, and any amount treated as a 
nonqualified withdrawal under the second sentence of section 607(g)(4) 
of the Act and Sec. 391.6(c)(3), shall be applied against the deposits 
within a particular account on a last-in-first-out basis. The date funds 
are actually withdrawn from the fund determines the time at which 
withdrawals are considered to be made. For special rules concerning the 
withdrawal of contingent deposits of net proceeds from the installment 
sale of an agreement vessel, see Sec. 391.2(c)(6).
    (d) Inclusion in income. (1) Any portion of a nonqualified 
withdrawal which, under paragraph (c) of this section, is treated as 
being made out of the ordinary income account is to be included in gross 
income as an item of ordinary income for the taxable year in which the 
withdrawal is made.
    (2) Any portion of a nonqualified withdrawal which, under paragraph 
(c) of this section, is treated as being made out of the capital gain 
account is to be included in income as an item of long-term capital gain 
recognized during the taxable year in which the withdrawal is made.
    (3) For effect upon a party's taxable income of capital losses 
remaining in a fund upon the termination of a fund (which, under 
paragraph (b) of this section, is treated as a nonqualified withdrawal 
of amounts remaining in the fund), see Sec. 391.4(e).
    (e) Interest. (1) For the period on or before the last date 
prescribed by law, including extensions thereof, for filing the party's 
Federal income tax return for the taxable year during which a 
nonqualified withdrawal is made, no interest shall be payable under 
section 6601 of the Code in respect of the tax on any item which is 
included in gross income under paragraph (d) of this section, and no 
addition to such tax for such period shall be payable under section 6651 
of the Code. In lieu of the interest and additions to tax under such 
sections, simple interest on the amount of the tax attributable to any 
item included in gross income under paragraph (d) of this section is to 
be paid at the rate of interest determined for the year of withdrawal 
under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Such interest is to be charged 
for the period from the last date prescribed for payment of tax for the 
taxable year for which such item was deposited in the fund to the last 
date for payment of tax for the taxable year in which the withdrawal is 
made. Both dates are to be determined without regard to any extensions 
of time for payment. Interest determined under this paragraph which is 
paid within the taxable year shall be allowed as a deduction for such 
year under section 163 of the Code. However, such interest is to be 
treated as part of the party's tax for the year of withdrawal for 
purposes of collection and in determining any interest or additions to 
tax for the year of withdrawal under section 6601 or 6651, respectively, 
of the Code.
    (2) For purposes of section 607(h)(3)(C)(ii) of the Act, and for 
purposes of certain dispositions of vessels constructed, reconstructed, 
or acquired with qualified withdrawals described in Sec. 391.6(e), the 
applicable rate of interest for any nonqualified withdrawal--
    (i) Made in a taxable year beginning in 1970 and 1971 is 8 percent.
    (ii) Made in a taxable year beginning after 1971, the rate for such 
year as determined and published jointly by the Secretary of the 
Treasury or his delegate and the Secretary of Transportation. Such rate 
shall bear a relationship to 8 percent which the Secretaries determine 
to be comparable to the relationship which the money rates and 
investment yields for the calendar year immediately preceding the 
beginning of the taxable year bear to the money rates and investment 
yields for the calendar year 1970. The determination of the applicable 
rate for any such taxable year will be computed by multiplying 8 percent 
by the ratio which (a) the average yield on 5-year Treasury securities 
for the calendar year immediately preceding the beginning of such 
taxable year, bears to (b) the average yield on 5-year Treasury 
securities for the calendar year 1970. The applicable rate so determined 
shall be computed to the nearest one-hundredth of 1 percent. If such a 
determination and publication is made, the latest published percentage 
shall apply for any taxable year beginning in the calendar year

[[Page 439]]

with respect to which publication is made.
    (3) No interest shall be payable in respect of taxes on amounts 
referred to in section 607(h)(2) (i) and (ii) of the Act (relating to 
withdrawals for research and development and payments against 
indebtedness in excess of basis) or in the case of any nonqualified 
withdrawal arising from the application of the recapture provision of 
section 606(5) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as in effect on 
December 31, 1969.
    (f) Basis and holding period in the case of property purchased by 
the fund or considered purchased by the fund. In the case of a 
nonqualified withdrawal of property other than money which was purchased 
by the fund (including deposited property considered under Sec. 391.2 
(g)(1)(ii) as purchased by the fund), the adjusted basis of the property 
in the hands of the party is its adjusted basis to the fund on the day 
of the withdrawal. In determining the period for which the taxpayer has 
held the property withdrawn in a nonqualified withdrawal, there shall be 
included only the period beginning with the date on which the withdrawal 
occurred. For basis and holding period in the case of nonqualified 
withdrawals of property other than money deposited into the fund, see 
Sec. 391.2(g)(4).

<R05>
Sec. 391.9  Consolidated returns. [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 391.10  Transitional rules for existing funds.

    (a) In general. Section 607(j) of the Act provides that any person 
who was maintaining a fund or funds under section 607 of the Merchant 
Marine Act, 1936, prior to its amendment by the Merchant Marine Act of 
1970 (for purposes of this part referred to as ``old fund'') may 
continue to maintain such old fund in the same manner as under prior law 
subject to the limitations contained in section 607(j) of the Act. Thus, 
a party may not simultaneously maintain such old fund and a new fund 
established under the Act.
    (b) Extension of agreement to new fund. If a person enters into an 
agreement under the Act to establish a new fund, he may agree to the 
extension of such agreement to some or all of the amounts in the old 
fund and transfer the amounts in the old fund to which the agreement is 
to apply from the old fund to the new fund. If an agreement to establish 
a new fund is extended to amounts from an old fund, each item in the old 
fund to which such agreement applies shall be considered to be 
transferred to the appropriate account in the manner provided for in 
Sec. 391.8(d) in the new fund in a nontaxable transaction which is in 
accordance with the provisions of the agreement under which such old 
fund was maintained. For purposes of determining the amount of interest 
under section 607(h)(3)(C) of the Act and Sec. 391.7(e), the date of 
deposit of any item so transferred shall be deemed to be July 1, 1971, 
or the date of the deposit in the old fund, whichever is the later.

Sec. 391.11  Definitions.

    (a) As used in the regulations in this part and as defined in 
section 607(k) of the Act--
    (1) The term eligible vessel means any vessel--
    (i) Constructed in the United States, and if reconstructed, 
reconstructed in the United States,
    (ii) Documented under the laws of the United States, and
    (iii) Operated in the foreign or domestic commerce of the United 
States or in the fisheries of the United States. Any vessel which was 
constructed outside of the United States but documented under the laws 
of the United States on April 15, 1970, or constructed outside the 
United States for use in the U.S. foreign trade pursuant to a contract 
entered into before April 15, 1970, shall be treated as satisfying the 
requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the requirements of 
paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.
    (2) The term qualified vessel means any vessel--
    (i) Constructed in the United States and, if reconstructed, 
reconstructed in the United States,
    (ii) Documented under the laws of the United States, and

[[Page 440]]

    (iii) Which the person maintaining the fund agrees with the 
Secretary of Transportation will be operated in the U.S. foreign, Great 
Lakes, or noncontiguous domestic trade or in the fisheries of the United 
States.
    (3) The term agreement vessel means any eligible vessel or qualified 
vessel which is subject to an agreement entered into under section 607 
of the Act.
    (4) The term vessel includes cargo handling equipment which the 
Secretary of Transportation determines is intended for use primarily on 
the vessel. The term vessel also includes an ocean-going towing vessel 
or an ocean-going barge or comparable towing vessel or barge operated in 
the Great Lakes.
    (b) Insofar as the computation and collection of taxes are 
concerned, other terms used in the regulation in this part, except as 
otherwise provided in the Act or this part, have the same meaning as in

<R05>
Sec. 393.1  Purpose.

    (a) This part prescribes interim regulations establishing a short 
sea transportation program as set forth in the Energy Independence and 
Security Act of 2007 (Sections 1121, 1122, and 1123 of Pub. L. 110-140, 
approved December 19, 2007 (121 Stat. 1492)).
    (b) The purpose of America's Marine Highway Program is described in 
Section 1121. Section 1121 states that ``[t]he Secretary shall designate 
short sea transportation routes as extensions of the surface 
transportation system to focus public and private efforts to use the 
waterways to relieve landside congestion along coastal corridors.'' 
America's Marine Highway Program consists of four primary components:
    (1) Marine Highway Corridor Designations: This regulation 
establishes the goals and methods by which specific Marine Highway 
Corridors will be identified and designated by the Secretary of 
Transportation. The purpose of designating Marine Highway Corridors is 
to integrate America's Marine Highway into the surface transportation 
system. The Marine Highway Corridors will serve as extensions of the 
surface transportation system and consist of the navigable coastal, 
inland, and intracoastal waters of the United States, to support the 
movement of passengers and cargo between U.S. ports, or between U.S. 
ports and unloaded either at a port in Canada located in the Great Lakes 
Saint Lawrence Seaway System; or loaded at a port in Canada located in 
the Great Lakes Saint Lawrence Seaway System and unloaded at a port in 
the United States, relieving landside congestion. America's Marine 
Highway Program will encourage the development of multi-jurisdictional 
coalitions and focus public and private efforts and investment on 
shifting freight and passengers from congested roads and rail lines to 
effectively utilize Marine Highway Corridors.
    (2) Marine Highway Project Designations: This regulation establishes 
the goals and methods by which specific Marine Highway Projects will be 
identified and designated by the Secretary of Transportation. The 
purpose is to mitigate landside congestion by designating projects that, 
if successfully started, expanded, or otherwise enhanced, would provide 
the greatest benefit to the public in terms of congestion relief, 
improved air quality, reduced energy consumption, infrastructure 
construction and maintenance savings, improved safety, and long-

[[Page 441]]

term economic viability. Designated Marine Highway Projects may receive 
direct support from the Department of Transportation as described in 
this section.
    (3) Incentives, Impediments and Solutions: This section outlines how 
the Department of Transportation, in partnership with public and private 
entities, will identify potential incentives, seek solutions to 
impediments to encourage utilization of America's Marine Highway and 
incorporate it, including ferries, in State and regional transportation 
planning.
    (4) Research: This section describes the research that the 
Department of Transportation, working with the Environmental Protection 
Agency, will conduct to support America's Marine Highway, within the 
limitations of available resources, and to encourage multi-state 
planning. Research would include environmental and transportation 
impacts (benefits and costs), technology, vessel design, and solutions 
to impediments to the Marine Highway.
    (c) In addition, vessels engaged in Marine Highway operations are 
qualified for Capital Construction Fund (CCF) benefits. This program was 
created to assist owners and operators of U.S.-flag vessels in 
accumulating the capital necessary for the modernization and expansion 
of the U.S. merchant marine by encouraging construction, reconstruction, 
or acquisition of vessels through the deferment of Federal income taxes 
on certain deposits of money placed into a CCF.

Sec. 393.3  Marine Highway Corridors.

    (a) Summary. The purpose of this section is to designate specific 
routes as Marine Highway Corridors. Corridors will be established by the 
Maritime Administrator. The goal of this designation process is to 
accelerate the development of multi-State and multi-jurisdictional 
Marine Highway Corridors to relieve landside congestion along highway 
and railroad corridors. Designation will encourage public/private 
partnerships, and help focus investment on those Marine Highway 
Corridors that offer the maximum potential public benefit in congestion 
reduction, energy efficiency, emissions reduction and other categories. 
Navigable waterways that parallel Corridors already designated as 
``Corridors of the Future'' under DOT's National Strategy to Reduce 
Congestion will be fast-tracked for designation as Marine Highway 
Corridors.
    (b) Objectives. The primary objectives of the designation of Marine 
Highway Corridors are to:
    (1) Establish Marine Highway Corridors as ``extensions of the 
surface transportation system'' as provided by Section 1121 of the 
Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.
    (2) Develop multi-jurisdictional coalitions that focus public and 
private efforts to use the waterways to relieve landside congestion 
along freight and passenger Corridors.
    (3) Obtain public benefit by shifting freight and passengers in 
measurable terms from congested highway and railroad routes to Marine 
Highway Corridors. Benefits, while primarily aimed at reducing 
congestion, can also include air quality and emissions improvements, 
reduced energy consumption, improved freight reliability and enhanced 
safety.
    (4) Identify potential savings that could be realized by providing 
an alternative to surface transportation infrastructure construction and 
maintenance.
    (c) Designation of Marine Corridors. The Department of 
Transportation will solicit recommendations for designation of specific 
routes as Marine Highway Corridors. Recommendations will be accepted 
from Corridor sponsors. Corridor sponsors must be public entities, 
including but not limited to, Metropolitan Planning Organizations, state 
governments (including State Departments of Transportation) and port 
authorities. When responding to specific solicitations for Marine 
Highway Corridors by the Secretary of Transportation, the following 
information will be required:
    (1) Physical Description of Proposed Marine Highway Corridor: The 
recommendation should describe the proposed Marine Highway Corridor, and 
its connection to existing or planned transportation infrastructure and 
intermodal facilities. Include key navigational factors such as 
available draft, channel width, bridge or lock clearance and identify if 
they could limit service.
    (2) Surface Transportation Corridor Served: Provide a summary of the 
surface transportation Corridor that the Marine Highway would benefit. 
Include a description of the Corridor, its primary users, the nature, 
locations and occurrence of congestion, urban areas affected, and other 
geographic or jurisdictional issues that impact its overall operation 
and performance.
    (3) Involved Parties: Provide the organizational structure of 
parties recommending the Corridor designation including business 
affiliations, and private sector stakeholders. Multi-jurisdictional 
coalitions may include State Departments of Transportation, Metropolitan 
Planning Organizations, municipalities and other governmental entities 
that have been engaged and the extent to which they support the corridor 
designation.
    (4) Passengers and Freight: Identify number of likely passengers 
and/or quantity of freight that are candidates for shifting to the 
proposed Marine Highway Corridor. If known, include specific shippers, 
manufacturers, distributors or other entities that could benefit from a 
Marine Highway alternative, and the extent to which these entities have 
been engaged.
    (5) Congestion Reduction: Describe extent to which the proposed 
Corridor could relieve landside congestion in measurable terms. Include 
any known offsetting infrastructure savings (either construction or 
maintenance) that would result from the project.

[[Page 443]]

    (6) Public environmental, energy or safety benefits: The 
recommendation should provide, if known, the savings over status quo in 
fuel, emissions, or safety improvements that could be derived from 
shifting some capacity to the proposed Marine Highway Corridor. It 
should also consider the implications future growth may have on the 
proposal and include any affiliations with environmental advocacy groups 
or community groups that support the Corridor designation.
    (7) Impediments: Describe known or anticipated obstacles to shifting 
capacity to the proposed Marine Highway Corridor. Include any 
strategies, either in place or proposed, to deal with the impediments.
    (d) Action by the Department of Transportation. All Marine Highway 
Corridor designation recommendations will be evaluated based upon the 
preceding criteria. An announcement of waterways designated as Marine 
Highway Corridors will appear in the Federal Register. In certain cases 
the Secretary of Transportation may designate a Marine Highway Corridor 
without receipt of a recommendation. The Department of Transportation 
will coordinate with Corridor sponsors to identify the most appropriate 
actions to support the Corridors. Support could include any of the 
following, as appropriate and within agency resources:
    (1) Promote the Corridor with appropriate governmental, State and 
local transportation planners, private sector entities or other 
decision-makers.
    (2) Coordinate with ports, State Departments of Transportation, 
Metropolitan Planning Organizations, localities, other public agencies 
and the private sector to support the designated corridor. Efforts can 
be aimed at obtaining access to land or terminals, developing landside 
facilities and infrastructure, and working with regional, State or local 
governmental entities to remove barriers to self-supporting operations.
    (3) Pursue memorandums of agreement with other federal entities to 
transport federally owned or generated cargo using waterborne 
transportation along the Marine Highway Corridor, when practical or 
available.
    (4) Assist with collection and dissemination of data for the 
designation and delineation of Marine Highway Corridors as available 
resources permit.
    (5) Work with Federal entities and state and local governments to 
include designated Corridors in transportation planning.
    (6) Bring specific impediments to the attention of the Marine 
Highway Advisory Board.
    (7) Conduct research on issues specific to designated Corridors as 
available resources permit.
    (8) Communicate with designated Corridor coalitions to provide 
ongoing support and identify lessons learned and best practices for the 
overall Marine Highway program.
    (9) Collect data and disseminate data for the designation and 
delineation of short sea transportation routes.

Sec. 393.4  Marine Highway Projects.

    (a) Summary. The purpose of this section is to designate specific 
Marine Highway Projects to mitigate landside congestion. The goal is to 
identify Projects that, if successfully started, expanded, or otherwise 
enhanced, would provide the greatest benefit to the public. Public 
benefits to be considered include road and railroad congestion relief 
(particularly in urban areas and along corridors with national 
significance), reduced emissions or energy consumption, infrastructure 
construction and maintenance savings, improved safety, and long-term 
economic viability. Designation can help focus public and private 
investment on pre-identified projects that offer the maximum potential 
public benefit. Designated Marine Highway Projects may receive support 
from the Department of Transportation as described in this section.
    (b) Objectives. The primary objectives of the designation of Marine 
Highway Projects are:
    (1) Reduce landside congestion.
    (2) Identify proposed services that represent the greatest public 
benefit as measured in congestion relief, energy savings, reduced 
emissions and improved safety.

[[Page 444]]

    (3) Focus resources on those projects that offer the greatest 
likelihood of success.
    (4) Identify potential savings by providing an alternative to 
surface transportation infrastructure construction and maintenance.
    (5) Develop best practices for the Marine Highway Program.
    (6) Provide specific examples with performance measures and 
quantifiable outcomes for the Marine Highway.
    (c) Designation of Marine Highway Projects. The Department of 
Transportation will solicit applications for designation as specific 
Marine Highway Projects. Applications will be accepted from a Project 
sponsor. Project sponsors must be public entities, including but not 
limited to, Metropolitan Planning Organizations, state governments 
(including State Departments of Transportation) and port authorities. 
Project sponsors are encouraged to develop coalitions and public/private 
partnerships with the common objective of developing the specific Marine 
Highway Project. Potential partners can include vessel owners and 
operators, third party logistics providers, trucking companies, 
shippers, port authorities, state, regional and local transportation 
planners, or any combination of entities working in collaboration under 
a single application. Candidate Projects can be new starts or existing 
Marine Highway operations where expansion or improvements present 
maximum public benefit. Applications must meet the requirements of 
coastwise shipping laws and all applicable federal, state and local 
laws.
    (d) Action by the Department of Transportation. (1) The Department 
will evaluate and select Projects based on a cost-benefit analysis and 
technical review of the information provided by the applicant. The 
Department will publish, and update periodically, the application 
information required and the factors that will be considered in the 
evaluation. Each factor will be weighed according to its relative cost 
or benefit. Applicants may request that other factors be considered in 
the cost-benefit analyses.
    (2) Projects that support a designated Marine Highway Corridor, 
receive a favorable technical review, and meet other minimum standards 
as defined by the Department, may be nominated by the Maritime 
Administrator for selection by the Secretary.
    (3) Upon designation as a Marine Highway Project, the Department of 
Transportation will coordinate with the Project sponsor to identify the 
most appropriate Departmental actions to support the project. Support 
could include any of the following, as appropriate and within agency 
resources:
    (i) Promote the service with appropriate governmental, regional 
State or local transportation planners, private sector entities or other 
decision makers.
    (ii) Coordinate with ports, State Departments of Transportation, 
Metropolitan Planning Organizations, localities, other public agencies 
and the private sector to support the designated service. Efforts can be 
aimed at identifying resources, obtaining access to land or terminals, 
developing landside facilities and infrastructure, and working with 
regional, State or local governmental entities to remove barriers to 
success.
    (iii) Pursue memorandums of agreement with other federal entities to 
transport federally owned or generated cargo using the services of the 
designated project, when practical or available.
    (iv) In cases where transportation infrastructure is needed, Project 
sponsors may request to be designated on the Secretary of 
Transportation's list of high-priority transportation infrastructure 
projects under Executive Order 13274, ``Environmental Stewardship and 
Transportation Infrastructure Project Review.'' For these projects, 
Executive Order 13274 provides that Federal agencies shall, to the 
maximum extent practicable, expedite their reviews for relevant permits 
or other approvals and take related actions as necessary, consistent 
with available resources and applicable laws.
    (v) Assist with developing individual performance measures as 
described in this rule.

    (2) Shippers: Identify shippers that have indicated an interest in 
and level of commitment to the proposed service, or describe the 
specific commodities, market, and shippers the service will attract, and 
the extent to which these entities have been engaged. Applications 
should include the marketing strategy.
    (3) Potential relief to surface transportation congestion: Describe 
extent to which the proposed project will relieve landside congestion in 
measurable terms, such as reductions in vehicle miles traveled. Include 
the landside corridors that stand to benefit from the operation, and any 
known infrastructure savings (either construction or maintenance) that 
would result from the project.
    (4) Environmental, energy or safety benefits: The application should 
address the savings over the current practice in fuel, emissions, or 
safety improvements that would result from the proposed operation. 
Include any affiliations with environmental groups or additional 
benefits the service would offer.
    (5) Finance Plan and Private Sector Participation: Provide projected 
revenues and expenses. Include labor and operating costs, fixed and 
recurring infrastructure costs. Include commitments from terminals, 
shippers, operators and other entities. A cost benefit analysis should 
be provided, if available. Note that prior to final designation as a 
project, a cost benefit analysis will be required, if not provided in 
the original application.
    (6) Impediments: Describe any known or anticipated obstacles to 
either start-up or long-term success of the project. Include any 
strategies, either in place or proposed, to mitigate impediments.
    (7) Proposed Project Timeline: The Application should include a 
proposed project time-line with estimated start dates and key 
milestones. Include the point in the timeline at which the enterprise is 
anticipated to attain self-sufficiency (if applicable).
    (8) Cost and Benefits: Applicants will describe, to the extent 
known, the benefits to be derived from the designation of the project in 
monetary terms, including the items described in number 1 through 7 
above, such as the environmental improvements, reduction in fuel usage, 
reduction in landside congestion, increase in employment, increase in 
taxes paid or other revenues derived therefrom, safety improvements 
including potential saving of human life and property from fewer traffic 
accidents, decrease in time required for delivery of cargo or passengers 
and the costs associated with construction of new infrastructure if any, 
the costs of additional operations

[[Page 446]]

or maintenance of the project, including any public funds needed for 
support of the project. Upon receipt by the Maritime Administrator, the 
application will be evaluated using weight-based criteria during a 
technical review. The review will assess factors such as project scope, 
impact, public benefit, offsetting costs, cost to the Government (if 
any), the likelihood of long-term self-supporting operations, and its 
relationship with Marine Highway Corridors, once designated (See 46 CFR 
393.3 Marine Highway Corridors). Additional factors may be considered 
during the evaluation process. All factors will be quantified and 
weighted by their relative costs and benefits. Project sponsors will be 
notified in writing by the Maritime Administration if they receive 
designation.
    (9) Evaluation Criteria: To view the criteria which will be used in 
the initial assessment of Project applications, please see the Appendix 
to part 393.
    (10) Performance Measures: Once designated projects enter the 
operational phase (either start of a new service, or expansion of 
existing service), they will be evaluated regularly to determine if the 
project's objectives are being achieved. Overall project performance 
will be in one of three categories--exceeds, meets, or does not meet 
original projected unit cost. Unit cost at time of project designation 
will be compared to the unit cost during the performance evaluation. 
Unit cost will be calculated by dividing Public benefit by Public cost, 
then multiplying it by the Timeliness factor, each of which are 
described below:
    (i) Public benefit: Does the project meet the stated goals in 
shifting specific numbers of vehicles (number of trucks, rail cars or 
automobiles) off the designated landside routes (measured in miles, 
weighted for either urban or rural)? Other public benefits, including 
congestion reduction, energy savings, reduced emissions, and safety 
improvements will be assumed to be a direct derivative of either numbers 
of vehicles shifted, or vehicle/ton miles avoided, unless specific 
factors change (such as a change in vessel fuel or emissions).
    (ii) Public cost: Is the overall cost to the Federal government (if 
any) on track with estimates at the time of designation? The overall 
cost to the Federal government represents the amount of Federal 
investment (either direct funding, loan guarantees or similar 
mechanisms) reduced by the offsetting savings the project represents 
(road/bridge wear and tear avoided, infrastructure construction or 
expansion deferred).
    (iii) Timeliness factor: Is the project on track for the point at 
which the enterprise is projected to attain self-sufficiency? For 
example, if the project was anticipated to attain self-sufficiency after 
36 months of operation, is it on track at the point of evaluation to 
meet that objective? This can be determined by assessing revenues, 
freight trends, expenses and other factors established in the 
application review process.


<R05>
Sec. 393.5  Incentives, Impediments and Solutions.

    (a) Summary. The purpose of this section is to identify short term 
incentives and solutions to impediments in order to encourage use of the 
Marine Highway for freight and passengers.
    (b) Objectives. This section is aimed at increasing the use of the 
Marine Highways through the following primary objectives:
    (1) Encourage the integration of Marine Highways in transportation 
plans at the State, regional and local levels.
    (2) Develop short term incentives aimed at expanding existing or 
starting new Marine Highway operations.
    (3) Identify and seek solutions to impediments to the Marine 
Highway.
    (c) Federal, State, Local, and Regional Transportation Planning. The 
Department of Transportation will coordinate with Federal, state and 
local governments and metropolitan planning organizations to develop 
strategies to encourage the use of America's Marine Highway for 
transportation of passengers and cargo. Activities will include the 
following:
    (1) Work with State Departments of Transportation to assess plans 
and develop strategies, where appropriate, to incorporate Marine Highway 
transportation, including ferries, and other marine transportation 
solutions for regional and interstate transport of

[[Page 447]]

freight and passengers in their statewide and metropolitan 
transportation plans.
    (2) Facilitating groups of States and multi-State transportation 
entities to determine how Marine Highway transportation can address 
congestion, bottlenecks, and other interstate transportation challenges 
to their mutual benefit.
    (3) Identify other federal agencies that have jurisdiction over the 
Project or which currently provide funding for components of the project 
in order to determine the extent to which those agencies should be 
consulted with and invited to assist in the coordination process.
    (3) Consult with Federal Highway Administration, Federal Motor 
Carrier Safety Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, Federal 
Transit Administration and other entities within DOT, as appropriate to 
evaluate costs and benefits of proposed Marine Highway Corridors and 
Projects.
    (d) Short-Term Incentives. The Department of Transportation will 
develop proposed short-term incentives that would encourage the use, 
initiation, or expansion of Marine Highway services. This will be done 
in consultation with shippers and other participants in transportation 
logistics, and government entities, as appropriate.
    (e) Impediments and Solutions. The Department of Transportation will 
establish a Board in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act 
(FACA) whose role is to identify impediments that hinder effective use 
of the Marine Highway and recommend solutions. The Board will meet 
regularly and report its findings and recommended solutions to the 
Maritime Administrator. Board membership will evolve as impediments are 
identified and the area of focus changes. Representation could include 
Federal Departments and Agencies, State Departments of Transportation, 
Metropolitan Planning Organizations and other local public entities and 
private sector stakeholders. The Department of Transportation will take 
actions, as appropriate, to address impediments to the Marine Highway.


<R05>
Sec. 393.6  Research on Marine Highway Transportation

    (a) Summary. The Department of Transportation will work in 
consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency and other entities 
as appropriate, within the limits of available resources, to conduct 
research in support of America's Marine Highway. Research can be general 
in nature, or in direct support of designated Marine Highway Corridors 
and Projects.
    (b) Objectives. The primary objectives of selected research Projects 
are to:
    (1) Identify and quantify environmental and transportation-related 
benefits that can be derived from utilization of the Marine Highway as 
compared to other modes of surface transportation.
    (2) Identify existing or emerging technology, vessel design, and 
other improvements that would reduce emissions, increase fuel economy, 
and lower costs of Marine Highway transportation and increase the 
efficiency of intermodal transfers.

master, any United States Coast Guard officer or inspector, or a 
representative of the Director.
    (c) A Certificate of Registration evidencing registration of the

the Director by a Registered Pilot at any time such pilot no longer 
desires to perform pilotage services; however, in the event such 
Registered Pilot has been served with a notice of hearing pursuant to

for renewal of Certificates of Registration may be obtained from the 
Director. A renewal fee of 5 dollars by check or money order, drawn to 
the order of the U.S. Coast Guard, shall accompany an application for 
renewal of registration, which will be refunded if registration is not 
renewed. Failure of a Registered Pilot to comply with these requirements 
or file a complete and sufficient application may constitute cause for 
denying renewal of the Certificate of Registration.
    (b) No Certificate of Registration shall be renewed unless the 
applicant for renewal thereof meets the requirements and qualifications 
set forth in Sec. 401.210 for issuance of an original Certificate of 
Registration; excepting that compliance with Sec. 401.210(a)(4) shall 
not be required if the examination was satisfactorily passed on a 
previous application for registration within six (6) months next 
preceding the date of application for renewal.
    (c) If the Director determines that there is good cause for denying 
renewal of a Certificate of Registration, the applicant shall be 
notified in writing of such determination and the cause thereof. The 
applicant may thereupon apply within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of 
such notice for a hearing in regard to the cause for the denying of a 
renewal of the Certificate, which hearing shall be granted.
    (d) In any case in which the applicant has made timely and 
sufficient application for renewal of his registration, no such 
registration shall expire until such application shall have been finally 
determined by the Commandant unless the public health, interest, or 
safety requires otherwise.
    (e) Upon receipt of a renewal Certificate of Registration, the 
expired Certificate shall be surrendered to the Director.

whichever is later, the ship shall pay an additional charge calculated 
on a basic rate of $113 for each hour or part

of an hour including the first hour of the delay, with a maximum basic 
rate of $1,777 for each continuous 24-hour period of the delay.

cancelled, the ship shall pay:
    (1) A cancellation charge calculated on a basic rate of $671;
    (2) A charge for reasonable travel expenses if the cancellation 
occurs after the pilot has commenced travel; and
    (3) If the cancellation is more than one hour after the pilot 
reports for duty at the designated boarding point or after the time for 
which the pilot is ordered, whichever is later, a charge calculated on a 
basic rate of $113 for each hour or part of an hour including the first 
hour, with a maximum basic rate of $1,777 for each 24-hour period.

Sec. 401.425  Provision for additional pilot.

    The Director, Great Lakes Pilotage Staff, U.S. Coast Guard, or the 
General Manager, Great Lakes Pilotage Authority, Ltd., Canada, may 
require the assignment of two pilots to a ship upon request of the ship 
or when in his judgment, because of anticipated long transit, uncommon 
ship size, adverse weather or sea conditions or other abnormal 
circumstances, the assignment of two pilots is considered necessary for 
the safe navigation of the ship. The Director or General Manager shall 
direct which of the pilots is to be in charge, as circumstances require. 
The charge to the ship shall be twice the appropriate charge provided 
for in Sec. Sec. 401.405, 401.407, 401.410, and 401.420. This section 
does not apply to a ship in a direct transit of the undesignated waters

<R05>
Sec. 401.510  Operation without Registered Pilots.

    (a) A vessel may be navigated in the U.S. waters of the Great Lakes 
without a United States or Canadian Registered Pilot when the vessel or 
its cargo is in distress or jeopardy.
    (b) A vessel may be navigated in the U.S. waters of the Great Lakes 
without a United States or Canadian Registered Pilot when the Director, 
with the concurrence of the Commander, 9th Coast Guard District, 
notifies the master that a United States or Canadian Registered Pilot is 
not available.
    (1) Notification to the master that a pilot is not available will be 
made by the Director, either directly to the vessel or through the 
appropriate pilotage pool, orally or in writing as the circumstances 
admit, and shall not be deemed given until the notice is actually 
received by the vessel.
    (2) The determination that a pilot is not available will be made on 
an individual basis and only when a vessel has given proper notice of 
its pilotage service requirements to the pilotage pool having 
dispatching jurisdiction at the time. The vessel has no obligation or 
responsibility with respect to such notification other than properly 
informing the pilotage pool of its pilotage requirements. However, the 
failure or delay by the pool in processing a pilotage service request, 
or refusal or delay by the U.S. Coast Guard in notifying the vessel that 
a pilot is not available, does not constitute constructive notice that a 
pilot is not available, and the vessel is not relieved by such failure 
or delay from compliance with the Great Lakes Pilotage Act of 1960.
    (3) Upon receipt of proper notice of a vessel's pilotage 
requirements, the pilotage pool shall then determine from the tour de 
role the availability of a pilot to render the service required. If no 
pilot is reasonably expected to be available for service within 6 hours 
of the time the pilotage services are required by the vessel, the 
pilotage pool shall promptly inform the Commandant through the U.S. 
Coast Guard communications system in the manner as may be prescribed 
from time to time by the Commandant. The Commandant shall be informed 
of:
    (i) Name and flag of the vessel;
    (ii) Route of vessel for which a pilot is not available;
    (iii) Time elapsing before a pilot is reasonably expected to become 
available;
    (iv) Whether vessel has an ``other officer'' on board;
    (v) Familiarity of master with route to be transited by the vessel;
    (vi) Draft of vessel; and

[[Page 465]]

    (vii) Any circumstances of traffic or weather, or condition of the 
vessel or its cargo which would adversely affect the safety of the 
vessel in transiting without a pilot.
    (4) When a pilot is expected to become available within 6 hours of 
the time pilot services are required, the vessel shall be informed that 
a pilot is available and the approximate time the pilot will report on 
duty. However, should any unusual circumstance or condition exist which 
may justify notification that a pilot is not available in less than 6 
hours, the pilotage pool shall inform the Director as in paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section, along with the circumstances involved. 
Additionally, the vessel may contact the Director directly to request 
notification under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if a notice of pilot 
availability is not received from the appropriate pilotage pool within 
two hours of providing its pilotage requirements to the pool.
    (5) Any vessel which requires the services of a pilot and is 
navigated without a pilot or proceeds prior to receipt of a message that 
a pilot is not available pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
shall be reported as in violation of section 7 of the Great Lakes 
Pilotage Act of 1960 by the pilotage pool to the local Coast Guard unit 
having jurisdiction. If the message is received after the vessel 
proceeds, such message shall not be delivered without concurrence of the 
Coast Guard officer to whom the violation was reported.
    (6) U.S. pilotage pools informing the Director that a pilot is not 
available for a vessel shall also obtain notice that a pilot is not 
available from the appropriate Canadian Supervisor of Pilots for those 
portions of the route which are in Canadian waters in the manner 
prescribed by them. The notice for Canadian District No. 1 waters shall 
be obtained from the Supervisor of Pilots, Department of Transport, 
Cornwall, Ontario, and the notice for Canadian District No. 2 waters 
shall be obtained from the Supervisor of Pilots, Department of 
Transport, Port Weller, Ontario. Authority to issue notice for Canadian 
waters of District No. 3 has been granted to the Director by the 
Department of Transport, Ottawa, and separate notice from Canada for 
this District is not required until such time as separate Canadian 
pilotage dispatch facilities may be established.
    (7) Notice that a pilot is not available shall not be delivered to 
any vessel unless the message contains the concurrence of the Commander, 
9th Coast Guard District, and notice for Canadian waters of Districts 
No. 1 and No. 2, if required, has been obtained from the appropriate 
Canadian authority.
    (8) In the event of an emergency or any other compelling 
circumstance, the Director may issue, without the specific request for 
service as provided under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, individual 
or general notification that a pilot or pilots are not available. 
Pilotage pools shall advise the Director of any condition or 
circumstance coming to their attention which may warrant such a 
determination.

<R05>
Sec. 402.210  Requirements and qualifications for registration.

    (a) Pursuant to Sec. 401.210(a)(4), each applicant for an original 
registration at the time of application and each Registered Pilot 
annually is required to pass a physical examination given by a licensed 
medical doctor and reported on the form furnished by the Director. The 
examination report shall describe the applicant's or Registered Pilot's 
visual acuity, color sense, physical condition, and competency or 
perform the duties of a U.S. Registered Pilot.
    (b) Any disease, physical or mental defect, or impairment to hearing 
or visual acuity, such as epilepsy, insanity, senility, acute venereal 
disease, neurosyphilis, hemiplegia, paralysis or missing arm, leg, or 
eye, muteness or pronounced speech impairment, acute kidney or gastro-
enteritis disease, extreme obesity, addiction of alcohol or narcotics, 
acute varicosity of the legs, cardiovascular disease or other disorder 
which would impair the applicant's ability to be available for service 
when required and to withstand the rigors of boarding vessels, climbing 
ladders or great heights, standing for long periods of time, and 
performing his duties under prolonged periods of nervous strain are 
causes for determination of physical incompetency.
    (c) An applicant for original registration must have a visual acuity 
either with or without glasses of at least 20/20 vision in one eye and 
at least 20/40 in the other. An applicant who wears glasses or contact 
lenses must also pass a test without glasses or lens of at least 20/40 
in one eye and at least 20/70 in the other. Registered Pilots, however, 
must have either with or without glasses or lens visual acuity of at 
least 20/30 in one eye and at least 20/50 in the other. A Registered 
Pilot who wears glasses or lens must also pass a test without glasses or 
lens of at least 20/50 in one eye and at least 20/100 in the other. The 
color sense of original applicants and Registered Pilots shall be tested 
by a pseudoisochromatic plate test. Passage of the Williams lantern test 
or its equivalent is an acceptable substitute for a pseudoisochromatic 
plate test.

Sec. 404.1  General ratemaking provisions.

    (a) The purpose of this part is to provide guidelines and procedures 
for Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking. Included in this part are 
explanations of the steps followed in developing a pilotage rate 
adjustment, the analysis used, and the guidelines followed in arriving 
at the pilotage rates contained in part 401 of this chapter.
    (b) Great Lakes pilotage rates shall be reviewed annually in 
accordance with the procedures detailed in Appendix C to this part. The 
Director shall review Association audit reports annually and, at a 
minimum, the Director shall complete a thorough audit of pilot 
association expenses and establish pilotage rates in accordance with the 
procedures detailed in Sec. 404.10 of this part at least once every 
five years. An interested party or parties may also petition the 
Director for a review at any time. The petition must present a 
reasonable basis for concluding that a review may be warranted. If the 
Director determines, from the information contained in the petition, 
that the existing rates may no longer be reasonable, a full review of 
the pilotage rates will be conducted. If the full review shows that 
pilotage rates are within a reasonable range of their target, no 
adjustment to the rates will be initiated.

<R05>
Sec. 404.5  Guidelines for the recognition of expenses.

    (a) The following is a listing of the principal guidelines followed 
by the Director when determining whether expenses will be recognized in 
the ratemaking process:
    (1) Each expense item included in the rate base is evaluated to 
determine if it is necessary for the provision of pilotage service, and 
if so, what dollar amount is reasonable for that expense item. Each 
Association is responsible for providing the Director with sufficient 
information to show the reasonableness of all expense items. The 
Director will give the Association the opportunity to defend any 
expenses that are questioned. However, subject to the terms and 
conditions contained in other provisions of this part, expense items 
that the Director determines are not reasonable and necessary for the 
provision of pilotage services will not be recognized for ratemaking 
purposes.
    (2) In determining reasonableness, each expense item is measured 
against one or more of the following:
    (i) Comparable or similar expenses paid by others in the maritime 
industry,
    (ii) Comparable or similar expenses paid by other industries, or
    (iii) U.S. Internal Revenue Service guidelines.
    (3) Lease costs for both operating and capital leases are recognized 
for ratemaking purposes to the extent that they conform to market rates. 
In the absence of a comparable market, lease costs are recognized for 
ratemaking purposes to the extent that they conform to depreciation plus 
an allowance for return on investment (computed as if the asset had been 
purchased with equity capital). The portion of lease costs that exceed 
these standards is not recognized for ratemaking purposes.
    (4) For each Association, a market-equivalent return-on-investment 
is allowed for the net capital invested in the Association by its 
members. Assets subject to return on investment provisions are subject 
to reasonableness provisions. If an asset or other investment is not 
necessary for the provision of pilotage services, the return element is 
not allowed for ratemaking purposes.

[[Page 474]]

    (5) For ratemaking purposes, the revenues and expenses generated 
from Association transactions that are not directly related to the 
provision of pilotage services are included in ratemaking calculations 
as long as the revenues exceed the expenses from these transactions. For 
non-pilotage transactions that result in a net financial loss for the 
Association, the amount of the loss is not recognized for ratemaking 
purposes. The Director reviews non-pilotage activities to determine if 
any adversely impact the provision of pilotage service, and may make 
ratemaking adjustments or take other steps to ensure the provision of 
pilotage service.
    (6) Medical, pension, and other benefits paid to pilots, or for the 
benefit of pilots, by the Association are treated as pilot compensation. 
The amount recognized for each of these benefits is the cost of these 
benefits in the most recent union contract for first mates on Great 
Lakes vessels. Any expenses in excess of this amount are not recognized 
for ratemaking purposes.
    (7) Expense items that are not reported to the Director by the 
Association are not considered by the Director in ratemaking 
calculations.
    (8) Expenses are appropriate and allowable if they are reasonable, 
and directly related to pilotage. Each Association must substantiate its 
expenses, including legal expenses. In general, the following are not 
recognized as reasonable expenses for ratemaking purposes:
    (i) Undocumented expenses;
    (ii) Expenses for lobbying;
    (iii) Expenses for personal matters;
    (iv) Expenses that are not commensurate with the work performed; and
    (v) Any other expenses not directly related to pilotage.
    (9) In any Great Lakes pilotage district where revenues and expenses 
from Canadian pilots are commingled with revenues and expenses from U.S. 
pilots, Canadian revenues and expenses are not included in the U.S. 
calculations for setting pilotage rates.
    (10) Reasonable profit sharing for non-pilot employees of pilot 
associations will be allowed as an expense for ratemaking purposes. 
Profit sharing that benefits pilots will be treated as part of pilot 
compensation.

Sec. 404.10  Ratemaking procedures and guidelines.

    (a) Appendix A to this part is a description of the types of 
analyses performed and the methodology followed in the development of a 
base pilotage rate. Ratemaking calculations in appendix A of this part 
are made using the definitions and formulas contained in appendix B of 
this part. Appendix C of this part is a description of the methodology 
followed in the development of annual reviews to base pilotage rates. 
Pilotage rates actually implemented may vary from the results of the 
calculations in appendices A, B and C of this part, because of 
agreements with Canada requiring identical rates, or because of other 
circumstances to be determined by the Director. Additional analysis may 
also be performed as circumstances require. The guidelines contained in 
Sec. 404.05 are applied in the steps identified in appendix A to this 
part.
    (b) A separate ratemaking calculation is made for each of the 
following U.S. pilotage areas:

Area 1--the St. Lawrence River;
Area 2--Lake Ontario;
Area 4--Lake Erie;
Area 5--the navigable waters from South East Shoal to Port Huron, MI;
Area 6--Lakes Huron and Michigan;
Area 7--the St. Mary's River; and
Area 8--Lake Superior.

    Sec. Appendix A to Part 404--Ratemaking Analyses and Methodology

                Step 1: Projection of Operating Expenses

    (1) The Director projects the amount of vessel traffic annually. 
Based upon that projection, the Director forecasts the amount of fair 
and reasonable operating expenses that pilotage rates should recover. 
This consists of the following phases:
    (a) Submission of financial information from each Association;
    (b) determination of recognizable expenses;

[[Page 475]]

    (c) adjustment for inflation or deflation; and
    (d) final projection of operating expenses. Each of these phases is 
detailed below.

              Step 1.A--Submission of Financial Information

    (1) Each Association is responsible for providing detailed financial 
information to the Director, in accordance with part 403 of this 
chapter.

            Step 1.B--Determination of Recognizable Expenses

    (1) The Director determines which Association expenses will be 
recognized for ratemaking purposes, using the guidelines for the 
recognition of expenses contained in Sec. 404.05. Each Association is 
responsible for providing sufficient data for the Director to make this 
determination.

             Step 1.C--Adjustment for Inflation or Deflation

    (1) In making projections of future expenses, expenses that are 
subject to inflationary or deflationary pressures are adjusted. Costs 
not subject to inflation or deflation are not adjusted. Annual cost 
inflation or deflation rates will be projected to the succeeding 
navigation season, reflecting the gradual increase or decrease in costs 
throughout the year. The inflation adjustment will be based on the 
preceding year's change in the Consumer Price Index for the North 
Central Region of the United States.

               Step 1.D--Projection of Operating Expenses

    (1) Once all adjustments are made to the recognized operating 
expenses, the Director projects these expenses for each pilotage area. 
In doing so, the Director takes into account foreseeable circumstances 
that could affect the accuracy of the projection. The Director will 
determine, as accurately as reasonably practicable, the ``projection of 
operating expenses.''

             Step 2: Projection of Target Pilot Compensation

    (1) The second step in the Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking 
methodology is to project the amount of target pilot compensation that 
pilotage rates should provide in each area. This step consists of the 
following phases:
    (a) Determination of target rate of compensation;
    (b) determination of number of pilots needed in each pilotage area; 
and
    (c) multiplication of the target compensation by the number of 
pilots needed to project target pilot compensation needed in each area. 
Each of these phases is detailed below.

         Step 2.A--Determination of Target Rate of Compensation

    (1) Target pilot compensation for pilots providing services in 
undesignated waters approximates the average annual compensation for 
first mates on U.S. Great Lakes vessels. The average annual compensation 
for first mates is determined based on the most current union contracts, 
and includes wages and benefits received by first mates.
    (2) Target pilot compensation for pilots providing services in 
designated waters approximates the average annual compensation for 
masters on U.S. Great Lakes vessels. It is calculated as 150% of the 
compensation earned by first mates on U.S. Great Lakes vessels.

           Step 2.B--Determination of Number of Pilots Needed

    (1) The basis for the number of pilots needed in each area of 
designated waters is established by dividing the projected bridge hours 
for that area by 1,000. Bridge hours are the number of hours a pilot is 
aboard a vessel providing basic pilotage service.
    (2) The basis for the number of pilots needed in each area of 
undesignated waters is established by dividing the projected bridge 
hours for that area by 1,800.
    (3) In determining the number of pilots needed in each pilotage 
area, the Director is guided by the results of the calculations in steps 
2.A. and 2.B. However, the Director may also find it necessary to make 
adjustments to these numbers in order to ensure uninterrupted pilotage 
service in each area, or for other reasonable circumstances that the 
Director determines are appropriate.

            Step 2.C--Projection of Target Pilot Compensation

    (1) The ``projection of target pilot compensation'' is determined 
separately for each pilotage area by multiplying the number of pilots 
needed in that area by the target pilot compensation for pilots working 
in that area.

                      Step 3: Projection of Revenue

    (1) The third step in the Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking 
methodology is to project the revenue that would be received in each 
pilotage area if existing rates were left unchanged. This consists of a 
projection of future vessel traffic and pilotage revenue.

                     Step 3.A--Projection of Revenue

    (1) The Director generates the most accurate projections reasonably 
possible of the pilotage service that will be required by vessel traffic 
in each pilotage area. These projections are based on historical data 
and all other relevant data available. Projected demand for pilotage 
service is multiplied by

[[Page 476]]

the existing pilotage rates for that service, to arrive at the 
``projection of revenue.''

                 Step 4: Calculation of Investment Base

    (1) The fourth step in the Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking 
methodology is the calculation of the investment base of each 
Association. The investment base is the recognized capital investment in 
the assets employed by each Association required to support pilotage 
operations. In general, it is the sum of available cash and the net 
value of real assets, less the value of land. The investment base will 
be established through the use of the balance sheet accounts, as amended 
by material supplied in the Notes to the Financial Statement. The 
formula used in calculating the investment base is detailed in Appendix 
B to this part.

      Step 5: Determination of Target Rate of Return on Investment

    (1) The fifth step in the Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking 
methodology is to determine the Target Rate of Return on Investment. For 
each Association, a market-equivalent return-on-investment (ROI) is 
allowed for the recognized net capital invested in the Association by 
its members.
    (2) The allowed Return on Investment (ROI) is based on the preceding 
year's average annual rate of return for new issues of high grade 
corporate securities.
    (3) Assets subject to return on investment provisions must be 
reasonable in both purpose and amount. If an asset or other investment 
is not necessary for the provision of pilotage services, that portion of 
the return element is not allowed for ratemaking purposes.

                    Step 6: Adjustment Determination

    (1) The next step in the Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking methodology 
is to insert the results from steps 1, 2, 3, and 4 into a formula that 
is based on a basic regulatory rate structure, and comparing the results 
to step 5. This basic regulatory rate structure takes into account 
revenues, expenses and return on investment, and is of the following 
form:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    Ratemaking projections  for basic
              Line                               pilotage
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.                               + Revenue (from step 3)
2.                               - Operating Expenses (from step 1)
3.                               - Pilot Compensation (from step 2)
                                ----------------------------------------
4.                               = Operating Profit/(Loss)
5.                               - Interest Expense (from Audit reports)
                                ----------------------------------------
6.                               = Earnings Before Tax
7.                               - Federal Tax Allowance
                                ----------------------------------------
8.                               = Net Income
9.                               Return Element (Net Income + Interest)
10.                              / Investment Base (from step 4)
                                ----------------------------------------
11.                              = Return on Investment
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) The Director will compare the projected return on investment (as 
calculated using the formula above) to the target return on investment 
(from step 5), to determine whether an adjustment to the base pilotage 
rates is necessary. If the projected return on investment is 
significantly different from the target return on investment, the 
revenues that would be generated by the current pilotage rates are not 
equal to the revenues that would need to be recovered by the pilotage 
rates.
    (3) The base pilotage revenues that are needed are calculated by 
determining what change in projected revenue will make the target return 
on investment equal to the projected return on investment. This 
``projection of revenue needed'' is used in determining the basis for 
proposed adjustments to the base pilotage rates. The mechanism for 
adjusting the base pilotage rates is discussed in Step 7 below. The 
required return, tax, and interest elements may be considered additions 
to the operating expenses and pilot compensation components of the base 
pilotage rates.

                  Step 7: Adjustment of Pilotage Rates

    The final step in the Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking methodology is 
to adjust base pilotage rates if the calculations from Step 6 show that 
pilotage rates in a pilotage area should be adjusted, and if the 
Director determines that it is appropriate to go forward with a rate 
adjustment. Rate adjustments are calculated in accordance with the 
procedures found in this step. However, pilotage rates calculated in 
this step are subject to adjustment based on requirements of the 
Memorandum of Arrangements between the United States and Canada, and 
other supportable circumstances that may be appropriate.
    (2) Pilotage rate adjustments are calculated for each area by 
multiplying the existing pilotage rates in each area by the rate 
multiplier. The rate multiplier is calculated by inserting the result 
from the steps detailed above into the following formula:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
              Line                        Ratemaking projections
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.                               + Revenue Needed (from step 6)
2.                               / Revenue (from step 3)
                                ----------------------------------------
3.                               = Rate multiplier
------------------------------------------------------------------------

<R05>
    Sec. Appendix B to Part 404--Ratemaking Definitions and Formulas

    The following definitions apply to the ratemaking formula contained 
in this appendix.
    (1) Operating Revenue--means the sum of all operating revenues 
received by the Association for pilotage services, including revenues 
such as docking, moveage, delay, detention, cancellation, and lock 
transit.
    (2) Operating Expense--means the sum of all operating expenses 
incurred by the Association for pilotage services, less the sum of 
disallowed expenses.
    (3) Target Pilot Compensation--means the compensation that pilots 
are intended to receive for full time employment. For pilots providing 
services in undesignated waters, the target pilot compensation is the 
average annual compensation for first mates on U.S. Great Lakes vessels. 
For pilots providing services in designated waters, the target pilot 
compensation is 150% of the average annual compensation for first mates 
on U.S. Great Lakes vessels.
    (4) Operating Profit/(Loss)--means Operating Revenue less Operating 
Expense and Target Pilot Compensation.
    (5) Interest Expense--means the reported Association interest 
expense on operations, as adjusted to exclude any interest expense 
attributable to losses from non-pilotage operations.
    (6) Earnings Before Tax--means Operating Profit/(Loss), less the 
Interest Expense.
    (7) Federal Tax Allowance--means the Federal statutory tax on 
Earnings Before Tax, for those Associations subject to Federal tax.
    (8) Net Income--means the Earnings Before Tax, less the Federal Tax 
Allowance.
    (9) Return Element (Net Income plus Interest)--means the Net Income, 
plus Interest Expense. The return element can be considered the sum of 
the return to equity capital (the Net Income), and the return to debt 
(the Interest Expense).
    (10) Investment Base (separately determined)--means the net 
recognized capital invested in the Association, including both equity 
and debt. Should capital be invested in other than pilotage operations, 
that capital is excluded from the rate base.
    (11) Return on Investment--means the Return element, divided by the 
Investment Base, and expressed as a percent.

                         Investment Base Formula

    (1) Regulatory Investment (Investment Base) is the recognized 
capital investment in the useful assets employed by the pilot groups. In 
general, it is the sum of available cash and the net value of real 
assets, less the value of land. The investment base is established 
through the use of the balance sheet accounts, as amended by material 
supplied in the Notes to the Financial Statement.
    (2) The Investment Base is calculated using financial data from the 
Great Lakes pilot associations, as audited and approved by the Director. 
The Investment Base would be calculated as follows:

                                 = Total Sources of Funds
 

    (3) Using the figures developed above, the Investment Base is the 
Recognized Assets times the ratio of Recognized Sources of Funds to 
Total Sources of Funds.

   Sec. Appendix C to Part 404--Procedures for Annual Review of Base 
                             Pilotage Rates

    The ratemaking methodology detailed in appendix A is used by the 
Director to determine base pilotage rates at least once every five 
years, as required by Sec. 404.1. In the intervening years the Director 
will review, if warranted by cost changes, recalculate base pilotage 
rates proposed for coordination with Canada using the following 
procedures:
    Step 1: Calculate the total economic costs for the base period (i.e. 
pilot compensation expense plus all other recognized expenses plus the 
return element) and divide by the total bridge hours used in setting the 
base period rates;
    Step 2: Calculate the ``expense multiplier,'' the ratio of other 
expenses and the return element to pilot compensation for the base 
period;
    Step 3: Calculate an annual ``projection of target pilot 
compensation'' using the same procedures found in Step 2 of appendix A;
    Step 4: Increase the projected pilot compensation in Step 3 by the 
expense multiplier in Step 2;
    Step 5: Adjust the result in Step 4, as required, for inflation or 
deflation;
    Step 6: Divide the result in Step 5 by projected bridge hours to 
determine total unit costs;
    Step 7: Divide prospective unit costs in Step 6 by the base period 
unit costs in Step 1;
    Step 8: Adjust the base period rates by the percentage change in 
unit costs in Step 7. For example if the total economic costs per bridge 
hour is $30.00 for the base period and $33.00 for the prospective rate 
period, then the rates established for the base period would be 
increased by 10% to determine the proposed rates for the prospective 
rate period, which would then be subject to negotiation with Canada.
